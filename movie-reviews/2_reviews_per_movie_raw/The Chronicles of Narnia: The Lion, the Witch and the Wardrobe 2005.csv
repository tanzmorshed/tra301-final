","The audience at this afternoon's preview screening of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, at New York's AMC 25 theater in Times Square, broke out in spontaneous applause at least three or four times. It seems that director Andrew Adamson has brought a thaw to normally-jaded New Yorkers as well as to the 100-year winter of Narnia. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of war-ravaged England, where siblings Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund (wonderful performances by all) are sent from their homes to the relative safety of 'the professor's' country estate where, during a game of hide-and-go-seek, young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. From this point, the multi-layered story of betrayal, courage, sacrifice, redemption and hope unfolds into a briskly paced 2 hour and ten minute adventure that leaves the viewer emotionally charged and thoroughly entertained. <br/><br/>The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody. The computer generated creatures are sophisticated to the point where the technology disappears and you begin to accept the performance, and not the special effect! This brings us to Aslan - if the talking lion didn't work, the movie would fold in on itself and go away. Aslan works,however, and works very well. Voiced by Liam Neeson, Alsan is both believable as a 'literal' lion and as Aslan, talking lion, King of Narnia. Aslan's face is expressive and noble, and Neeson's voice acting has strength and dignity. <br/><br/>This film succeeds on so many levels, it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins: the direction, the story's surface-level themes, the theological possibilities, the drama, the fantasy, the adventure.... Yes - it's an action film, a dramatic film, a fantasy, a somewhat-dark (yet hopeful) fairy-tale. It has humorous moments and frightening moments, like most truly great 'family' films always seem to have. <br/><br/>The bottom line is, this is a film that will leave you the better for having seen it. There's much to reflect on and much to simply enjoy - there's certainly enough to keep you thinking for a while, and that's always a good thing. Aslan, indeed, is on the move!"

","To sum things up: I loved this movie.<br/><br/>I had been waiting for it ever since it was announced, so of course I couldn't pass up the chance to see a press preview this morning. And, while there were some definite weaknesses (mostly in the quality of the animations), overall I was completely convinced. Naturally it did not coincide 100% with my own vision of Narnia visually, but emotionally it rang absolutely true, choking me up several times and really touching me. I walked out of the theatre with a warm, contented feeling - just like I feel every time I read C.S. Lewis' book! <br/><br/>The stand-out performance was definitely Tilda Swinton's as the White Witch, but I liked all actors/voices, from cute little Lucy (newcomer Georgie Henley) to majestic Aslan (Liam Neeson). I thought the children did a great job, considering their relative inexperience and the amount of blue screen work involved.<br/><br/>Tip: Stay seated through the actor credits - afterwards there's another small scene."
"arabianardour","10","19","22","23 December 2005"," A Classic for all Time
","The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.<br/><br/>Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first, it is smooth, confident, and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable, and surprisingly convincing, and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out, but I needn't have worried; those large, startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. <br/><br/>I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just ""based"" on the book. It IS the book. The scope, depth, and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone, at a level for children to understand, yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen, including those in LOTR, putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting, well-done film, and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.<br/><br/>Ten stars!!"

","With an appeal to both adults and children, the British author C. S. Lewis wrote seven books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.<br/><br/>Now comes this wonderful film of the first chronicle, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" The beautiful cinematography and the terrific performances of the children make this film outstanding for family viewing. As integrated with the live actors, the colorful animal characters, especially the Lion (Jesus), reveal brilliant technical film-making as well.<br/><br/>Lewis's books are not overtly allegorical. Rather, the symbols and the messages are subtle. The four children in the story (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) were inspired by the actual children evacuated from London during World War II, who spent time in Lewis's home. Lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories. In this area, the film is enormously faithful to the original book and would have made the author extremely proud."

","The Chrinicles of Narnia, the lion the witch and the wardrobe, is now my favorite movie! this movie was FANTASTIC! the actors are amazing and the movie is just so exactly like the book. If you read the book and are going to see the movie, you will not be disappointed. The movie was better than i expected actually. It's such an amazing and imaginative movie it's just enchanting. I wouldn't normally give any movie 10 stars, but i gave this one 10 stars out of 10. When i was watching the movie, and seeing all the sets and the props, i felt like i had already seen them before. Like they had taken them right out of my imagination when i was reading the book. I know not everyone will have this feeling, but i did, and it was magical. Even if you don't want to see this movie, go because it really is a spectacular and magical movie."

","What a fabulous movie! I just saw a screening of it (with a bunch of other actors and writers) and the whole place burst into applause at the end.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is amazing as the White Witch. Her cold, evil gaze could freeze anyone.<br/><br/>I loved the kids - especially the little Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was suitably majestic and comforting and grand.<br/><br/>It was beautifully filmed, and I felt Narnia was perfectly realized.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the movies that will follow."
"nycritic","8","31","42","10 January 2006"," Jadis, Aslan, Four Humans, and Winter Hell
","After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors, so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it. Early screenings gave it great reviews, and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.<br/><br/>Four children are sent away from their London home to a professor's estate in the countryside in order to escape the bombings from the Nazi invaders. What they find there, aside from a severe place not unlike what V. C. Andrews would depict in FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC, is a wardrobe that opens the doors to another world -- a parallel one if you may -- in which winter is ever present, but Christmas never takes place. This is Narnia, and it is under control of the White Witch Jadis who is aware of a prophecy that four humans will put an end to her wintry empire, and sets out her minions against the children who have entered her world while bribing one of them -- the rebellious Edmund -- to join her as she holds him prisoner much like the witch in Hansel and Gretel did. Her plans are to overthrow the Lion King, Aslan, and rule forever. Parallels to her world and the world as threatened by the Nazis are striking, and Tilda Swinton's transformation into the very Aryan looking Jadis is chilling, more so in her seductiveness. At times I was reminded of Cate Blanchett (they have very similar features), but I think Blanchett is to Galadriel as Swinton is to Jadis. Marvelous actresses both, but Swinton can claim her breakthrough with her role here.<br/><br/>With much less gravitas than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA arrives much faster to its goal than the former does and the reason is that the books C. S. Lewis wrote are fairly slim volumes while J. R. R. Tolkien's book is a massive tome. Also, there is always the sense that the NARNIA books are more geared towards children and for much of the movie's duration there is little doubt that this is what it is: its four leads are children, many of the talking animals they meet are drawn in a way to appeal to children, and even the White Witch's castle has a storybook quality to it. Only in the appearance of Aslan does the story take a much more adult form, and its Messianic theme will not be lost on the older audience. Even so, the implications surrounding Aslan's self immolation can be interpreted in non-religious forms: if anything, it's also very similar to Gandalf's fall into the pit with the Balrog in tow in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification, only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.<br/><br/>NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children, one by one, are entering its world through the wardrobe. I was reminded of Stephen King's DARK TOWER series: unless the characters believed in the world behind the wardrobe, it didn't exist, and this is true here. Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it, and time, of course, stops... or let's say, it marches at a totally different beat, also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.<br/><br/>Performances are quite remarkable, especially for a fantasy film. All of the actors doing the voice overs bring their characters to bubbling life, and Liam Neeson as Aslan is wise and all-knowing. The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.<br/><br/>All in all a great film, equally meant to be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and one which should spawn a very interesting following."
"tollini","10","329","529","5 December 2005"," A Truly Moving Picture
","I saw this film on November 30th in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>Four young children enter the timeless world of Narnia through the door of a wardrobe piece of furniture while playing hide-and-seek. And what a world it is. There are talking animals, dwarfs, giants, beasts, centaurs, and indescribable half-human combinations. And, in this world of Narnia there is a titanic struggle between the White Witch and her evil army and the good lion Aslan and his noble army. <br/><br/>Although it doesn't seem possible, you can suspend disbelief and become engaged in the story because the artistry and technology are so outstanding. The art direction, special effects, cinematography, editing and sound will most likely and should be nominated for Academy Awards. The lion Aslan dominates your attention in every scene he appears in, and as the story unfolds, he becomes as human-like as any of the four children. <br/><br/>The four children seem normal enough with their constant teasing and fighting among themselves, but when events truly matter, they come together and exemplify the highest standards of sacrifice, courage, fidelity and heroism. Both children and adults will find inspiration and role models in these four children. <br/><br/>The lion Aslan is a mystical and almost biblical hero. There are many parallels between Aslan and Christianity, and you can watch this film anywhere in the religious-secular spectrum you care to. I suspect that over many years the other six books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia will be made into movies and they will have the same type of financial and artistic success as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy had. That is high praise indeed.<br/><br/>FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."

","The visuals for this film are absolutely stunning. Just breathtaking. The acting is done well, the voice-overs included. the CG animation on the creatures are marvelous. <br/><br/>I read this series over and over as a child and just re-read them recently in anticipation of the movie. Although as a purist-at-heart I was slightly disappointed to see even a second of the precious work edited, overall I am amazed at how well they adapted the tale to fit into a neat little 2 hour time frame. I feel that nothing important was omitted and the parts that were adjusted in the script were done so well that it still could have passed for C.S. Lewis' own hand. <br/><br/>I was lucky enough to preview this film (and to see it free, to boot), but I am certain that I will be trekking to the theatre to see it a few more times on the big screen. BRAVO!"

","I was fortunate enough to attend an advanced screening and was magnificently surprised. The film was beautifully made. The acting/voices were all wonderful, including the young talent. I think all ages will be entertained. The story contains important lessons for children, but also relevant reminders for adults. I also think attempts to compare the film to Lord of the Rings and/or Harry Potter would be unfortunate for all parties. They are each uniquely wonderful. Make sure you see this!<br/><br/>By the way, make sure you stay through the end credits to hear a beautiful song Alanis Morisette wrote especially for the film."
"Pasafist","8","70","112","3 December 2005"," Breathtaking (after a weak first act)
","There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.<br/><br/>But I digress! Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.<br/><br/>So anyway, sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive on screen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.<br/><br/>NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals, magical fauns, and the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan (Anna Popplewell), and brothers Peter (William Moseley), and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.<br/><br/>NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen, but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking ""why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS?"" I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.<br/><br/>But fear not, all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour (which really isn't that bad). You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right, and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong, if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.) After that the film only gets better, there is an awesome battle sequence, and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN (or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY) to hit the big screen.<br/><br/>I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley (watch out Dakota Fanning) the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl (in her debut role) has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would? While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission. Seek it out."

","I am, by nature, wary of any film that relies upon children to play the lead roles. I have avoided the Harry Potter films like the plague, working on the (frequently reinforced) principal that no film ever manages to get close to as good as my imagination. At long last I have had that theory disproved. I have just spent the last 2 hours sitting in the cinema with a massive smile in my face (with occasional grimaces as the idiot sitting next to me insisted on talking to his girlfriend. I think there should be some kind of panic button that gets the ushers running in with night-sticks to sort these muppets out). <br/><br/>Having spent the last 2 months trying to get a job it was the most amazing experience to rewind the clock by 15 years and feel the rush of wonder and awe as the magical world of Narnia sprung to life on the big screen. The casting crew did a fantastic job, with practically every character looking and acting exactly as I had imagined them since I was a child. Once again New Zealand came up trumps, and the splendour of the scenery perfectly complimented the fantasy of the story.<br/><br/>I've never felt compelled to write a commentary on this site before, but I was so relieved and enchanted by this film that I couldn't help but try to spread the word.<br/><br/>Sit back, relax and let yourself be taken back to the magic and and excitement of your childhood."

","When examined closely, most of the mud that is being thrown at this movie by the critics will be found to attack the established timeless classic work of C.S. Lewis itself with sales in the hundreds of millions of copies. So much for critics! The only real question left to us does not concern the story at all, but rather Adamson's rendition of the story. That being said, I can tell you that Adamson's inspired work with the characters of Lucy and Aslan, Walden's Special effects and Disney's resources have created a masterpiece of cinematic literature that I believe will prove to be as timeless as ""It's a wonderful life"" or ""The wizard of OZ"". It is tasteful and humane with no unnecessary blood and gore, and faithful in its rendition of Aslan, who does something wonderful not contained in any of Tolkien's trilogies."

I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven. Each book though, unlike the LOTR series, is a completely different story with many different characters. Overall, this movie is a must see and the next six will likely be the same. C.S.

","As a child, I was never a great lover of C. S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". The books were always too preachy in tone for my liking, and if there was one thing that was guaranteed to kill a book stone dead for me it was the suspicion that the adult world were using it to put forward some morally improving message. My suspicions were confirmed when a classmate of mine, a boy whose great ambition, even at the age of ten, was to be Archbishop of Canterbury when he grew up, explained to me that the whole series was essentially one long extended Christian allegory. (And yes, he probably did use the word ""allegory"" even at that tender age). <br/><br/>I have never been tempted to revisit the books in adult life, so was surprised that I enjoyed the film version of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" so much. The story opens in London during the Second World War. Four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, are evacuated during the Blitz to a large house in the countryside, owned by an eccentric professor. While playing hide-and-seek one day they discover a wardrobe which acts as a gateway into the fantasy land of Narnia. Once there, they get caught up in a power-struggle between Aslan the Lion and Jadis, the evil White Witch. White witches, of course, are normally portrayed as being on the side of good, as opposed to the evil black witches, but in the case of Jadis the adjective relates not to her moral character but to her love of dressing in that colour and to the fact that under her rule Narnia is an icy wilderness, a land ""where it is always winter but never Christmas"". <br/><br/>From what I can recall, the film follows Lewis's plot fairly closely, so for those who like that sort of thing the religious symbolism is still there. Aslan clearly represents Christ and Jadis the Devil. There are parallels to the Fall of Man, with a bowl of Turkish Delight standing in for the apple, and to the Crucifixion and Resurrection. This symbolism is, however, applied lightly enough to enable the film to be enjoyed as a family fantasy adventure rather than as a beginner's guide to the Christian religion. Lewis was a colleague and close friend of J R R Tolkien, so it is perhaps appropriate that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" has something in common with Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which was also shot in New Zealand, especially during the battle scenes near the end. It is, however, somewhat lighter in tone than Jackson's mighty epic.<br/><br/>On the acting side, the one really outstanding contribution comes from an icily seductive Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Aslan comes across as a bit one-dimensional, noble and heroic and not much else, but that is less the fault of Liam Neeson, who provided the voice, as of Lewis, who wrote him like that.<br/><br/>Lewis's mythology was essentially a hodge-podge of various other mythologies, especially Greek, so the film features such creatures as fauns, centaurs, griffins, minotaurs, dwarfs and various talking beasts, and the computer-generated imagery is able to bring all of these vividly to life. One thing which did not strike me as a child was just how surreal Lewis's world can be, possibly because surrealism was not a concept with which I was really acquainted at the age of ten. This is, however, something brought out in the film version, particularly in the early scenes where the children enter that eerie snow-covered world, a world where Victorian lamp-posts mysteriously sprout in the middle of a dense coniferous forest, where rather camp fauns invite you back to their homes for tea and cakes and where beavers talk with cockney accents and eat fish-and-chips. Who could fail to enjoy a world like that? Perhaps Lewis, the staid, conservative, devoutly religious Oxford don, had more in common with Salvador Dali than he might have liked to admit. 8/10"

This is a story - a portrayal - a delivery - that is simply overwhelming. A film of over 2 hours in length seemed to fly by. The actors - unknown to us - were delightful.

"susannah-16","6","61","104","8 December 2005"," Too little magic, too much epic
","I saw this with 6 eight year old boys, which may have influenced my opinions somewhat, but they were not gripped by this. Firstly though, there is a lot right with this movie. The special effects are stunning. How they got Susan and Lucy to walk through the forest with Aslan I will never know - the problem was I found myself trying to work that out, rather than gripped by the narrative. The kids are great. Georgie as Lucy is particularly good I think - very Lucyish and Skander manages to make Edmund less of a prig and more angry and at odds with the world. THere are epic scenes (the boys all said they liked the battle scene yet, and acted some of it out in the pizza restaurant afterwards), and swooping vistas and vast tracking shots and rousing music. Its just that I had never really thought of Narnia like that. In becoming epic, they have lost two things - the magic and the playfulness. Lets take the magic first. A tiny point, but the snow didn't sparkle. You know how snow glistens and glints ? Well not in this Narnia it didn't. It wasn't a magical place to wander into - it was all too big for a start - massive walls of rock and huge mountains. Not strange enough a landscape (and it looked VERY like some of the landscapes in Lord of the Rings) - not intimate enough. <br/><br/>And the playfulness ? This Narnia isn't a fun place to be. We lose some of the fun of the Beavers and their house. THey cut some of the scenes which would have lightened up the narrative (like when Aslan comes to life, in the book he runs around and plays tag, and they all end up in a heap laughing and excited and HAVING FUN. In the film, he gives a roar and they are off to the next scene. In the book when they rescue Mr Tumnus they dance around for joy - in the film there are tears and hugs). Now, I can see how a country under the spell of a white witch for 100 years may not be a lot of fun, but its a long movie to sit through without some lightness. Even the crowning scene at the end is too uninvolved and not fun enough - where was the personal, the relationships ? It looked like a really dull party to me. There is also a very curious new scene, which doesn't seem to add much - involving them getting stuck on an ice floe as the snow melts. This takes up quite a bit of time for no apparent reason - I couldn't see how it added to the narrative, and again - the ice in the waterfall is grey, not sparkly and glittering. <br/><br/>SO to sum up - good acting, interesting story - which took itself all a bit too seriously, and missed the point. Its a kids movie which has forgotten what its like to be a kid."
"annegirl8","4","61","106","16 December 2005"," I tried really hard to love this movie but it left me lukewarm
","Let me start by saying this, I am in no way attacking the story itself. I love these books and I think C.S. Lewis was an amazing writer. <br/><br/>I hate to say this because I really wanted to like this movie but I was somewhat disappointed. I have to very much agree with zach-74's review of the movie. I don't expect books to translate directly into movies. They are different mediums. But I thought this was a mediocre attempt. Without re-hashing zach-74's review which I think is right on, there were a couple missing elements that I wished they had put in. Where is the playfulness of Aslan? His playing with the children and also with the animals that he brings back to life gives him a wonderful quality that we don't get in the movie. Another element was the suffering that takes place on the walk to the Stone Table when Aslan is to be killed. Maybe this was getting to close to the underlying Christian element in the book (It is NOT an allegory; those who say it is need to look up the definition of allegory. It has strong Christian overtones but Aslan is not an allegory for Christ...Christ practiced nonviolence, something Aslan does not). At the end, I didn't feel that Aslan was really the amazing, wise, compassionate character that he is in the book. I also missed the humorous asides and narration that are present in the book. I don't know how that could be accomplished in a movie but I think it could have been attempted. There are other movies that have narrators.<br/><br/>As for the characters, I though the children were reasonably good but I was most disappointed in Liam Neeson as Aslan and Tilda Swinton as Jadis. I tried to be impressed by their performances but I was left lukewarm. Neeson didn't have quite the inflection that I would imagine for Aslan. I wanted to feel that I was hearing Aslan and instead I just felt like I was hearing Liam Neeson. Swinton looked good in the previews but in the movie she seemed...small...that's the best word I can think of. Jadis is supposed to be this extraordinarily tall, originally dark haired, magnetic figure. Instead she is just creepy and cruel...there's nothing that makes me understand why Edmund is so entranced with her. Those who have read the Magician's nephew know that there is a fascination with her...she exudes some quality that leads you to be enchanted with her until you discover the cruelty and hardness underneath the surface. <br/><br/>One more thing...for those who have not read the book, that whole bit at the end with them grown up is probably a bit confusing. I feel like movies should be able to stand alone...meaning a person doesn't have to read the book to understand what's going on in the movie. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to say this movie was perfect, I found myself often having to turn to my memories of the book to fill in the blanks in the movie that didn't quite fulfill it's potential."

This movie was SO GOOD my 5 yr old sat through the whole 2 and a half hrs!!!! To me if a movie can make a 5 yr old sit still that long it is better then expected!!! I loved this movie and now my son wants me to buy the series and read them all to him lol. He also wants to go see it again. It is a great move for children, maybe not all that young but in general. I highly recommend this movie i enjoyed it a great deal. So if u haven't seen it go see it!!! It was worth the total $20 i spent on tickets and refreshments!!!"
"ma-cortes","7","10","14","11 December 2007"," Amazing fantasy, breathtaking adventures and overwhelming battles
","This enjoyable story produced by Walt Disney Pictures is based on C.S Lewis books. It begins during German air raids over London in WWII. The Pevensie four children(Henley,Keynes,Moseley and Poppewell) are sent to live at the country house of eccentric teacher Kike(Jim Broadvent). Meantime they're playing hide and seek, Lucy encounters a strange wardrobe that lead the snowy land of Narnia . There, she finds a sympathetic but coward faun(James McAvoy). Later she returns at home and the others don't believe her at first, but soon are convinced. Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world with fauns and centaurs and where animals speaking, a beaver( voice by Ray Winstone), fox(voice by Rupert Everett) and furthermore the Father Christmas(James Cosmo). This magic land with perpetual winter is ruled by the nasty White Witch(Tilda Swinton). But the children are the chosen ones, according an ancient prophecy, and they team up with Aslem, the mighty Lion and real king of Narnia , fighting to defeat the evil witch in an epic finale battle.<br/><br/>The pic is a magic story with rip-snorting adventures, exciting fantasy, sensational scenarios and good feeling. Plenty of action and emotion and with an incredible battle scenes similar to ¨Lord of the Rings¨. Provide enough amusement to keep the chat rooms humming until the epic ending comes out. In spite of overlong runtime and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary and highly detailed work by C. S. Lewis. This two and a half hour movie stays closer to the original work than any of the former efforts, mostly animated. The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Musical score fitting perfectly to the action-adventure by Harry Gregson-Williams. The motion picture is marvellously directed by Andrew Adamson, he's the director,producer, writer of ¨Shrek¨ trilogy. Rating : Above average and worthwhile seeing . It's a very likable adventure-fantasy and enormously appealing for kids, adolescents and all family."
"Lamol-Sthui","9","10","14","22 December 2005"," The perfect family Christmas movie, but also fun for everyone who
","I was a bit disappointed want I watched the trailer of this movie and was therefore a bit reluctant to visit it. Mainly because it showed scenes of these children with weapons and my thought was, what? Those children from the modern world with weapons knowing how to use them ready for battle? The beginning also put question marks to the movie because the city (which one by the way, London?) was bombed and the next day everyone can still take the train? They should have told that part a bit more clearly, but as soon as the Narnia part was beginning I was getting more and more impressed.<br/><br/>Not only did they show a good landscape. The animated animals are also great fun to much. The acting of the children is good, I couldn't note any unnatural acting there. The witch was casted very well, she has a friendly face which lets you wonder if she is good or bad at the beginning.<br/><br/>The lion made a great leader. The battles were displayed awesomely.<br/><br/>In total I left the movie with a very satisfied feeling. I haven't read the book but I feel that the director did the very best in order to make this look like the book.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 9 because a few scenes want to fast and should have been told a bit more clearly, for example, the scene at the beginning, or when The lion turned out to be alive he arrives with another great army (beside from the one already on the battlefield). My girlfriend told me that was because he released the spell of all those frozen by the witch but that wasn't perfectly clear to me."
"Rathko","6","49","88","12 December 2005"," Heartless Adaptation
","A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.<br/><br/>The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God (hell), or the Nazi regime, the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential, none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored, we are not told who she is, where she came from, how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly, the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained, we are simply expected to accept it without question, which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum, with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and one-dimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek, is the complete lack of humor.<br/><br/>The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles, with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings, with Henley bringing the wide-eyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires, and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.<br/><br/>The CGI is competent, but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around, but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth, or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.<br/><br/>Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth, epic range, creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly, it has none of the humor, camaraderie, charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with, it will be very popular, and a sequel is very probable, but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul, the complete cycle seems unlikely."
"jdre","1","129","256","11 December 2005"," Terrible. Just terrible.
","The latest installment of children's lit - turned movie is the weakest. The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop. The CG backgrounds are not detailed and very plain (hill, trees, no movement).<br/><br/>Also, these children could not act, I hate to say it. Emotions, no. Excitement, no. Holding a sword like a human being, no.<br/><br/>The pacing was somehow both too slow AND too fast. There were plenty of dead-air moments that failed to create suspense (people in my theater were snoring, getting up a lot, getting restless), and slow-mo of poorly CG'd battle, but the storyline development (or total lack thereof) was skipped over, pushed ahead, and seemed to take a back seat to the action (as is the formula for modern CD-heavy kids movies).<br/><br/>The gore in the animal cruelty of sacrificing the Lion in a strangely pagan-esquire midnight ritual (I somehow didn't picture it like that as a kid reading the book) was beyond a PG depiction, (despite the cut away for the stab, and lack of blood anywhere) and gratuitous, smacking of The Passion of the Christ... but I guess that's exactly what they were going for.<br/><br/>I guess as long as a movie doesn't show blood, body parts, or swear words, it doesn't go over PG, despite graphic depictions of pagan sacrifice, animal abuse, creepy cyclops and other humanoids, large-scale warfare, stabbings, beatings, and such.<br/><br/>I'm no prude, it is a children's book -- but reading topics is less intense than seeing them graphically depicted on a big-screen, enough for maybe a 13?<br/><br/>The storyline is so very simple - find wonderland, set off human alarm, Savior sacrifices himself for you and resurrects, win war against evil Christmas-hating witch. 4 steps. 3 hours to tell? It just isn't as complex as LOTR or even the better Harry Potters. That's why the pacing felt so slow.<br/><br/>Had the characters been rounded out (one can interpret a book when making it into a movie, but nobody told Disney this) - it might have been better. If Judas, I mean Edmund, had been explored -- why was he so impudent? Did he really have fantasies of being King? Did he learn a lesson, or just go on/off from traitor to Witch-fighter? Any of these could've been explored instead of the dead-air treatment I watched."
"zach-74","5","83","160","12 December 2005"," Narnia Fails To Uphold Responsibility To Book Fans
","Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's ""Narnia"" wasn't quite up to snuff.<br/><br/>I count myself among those who cherish ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" having read them as a child and having re-read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.<br/><br/>Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver:<br/><br/>Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name ""Aslan"" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a ""fantasy"" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)<br/><br/>A couple of outright inventions served only to distract us from the magic and mystery of the real story: The waterfall scene - who came up with that idea? The cricket ball through the window - not as effective as the original story.<br/><br/>Casting - The elder siblings were mediocre, and I can't tell if Tilda Swinton was just awfully directed or totally miscast. (In the book Jadis was a noble and grand enchantress, albeit with dastardly aims; in the movie she was shallow, petty and despicable.) Oh, and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion was not nearly powerful enough--this is one of the most important roles in the film. Was James Earl Jones not available?<br/><br/>Direction of Actors' Performances - This ties in with my comments about casting, above. Performances in individual scenes seemed disjointed from overall character motivations and some character interpretations (such as Jadis and Edmund) were shallow and unsympathetic. Where was the charisma that would have made Jadis's character believable, let alone have enabled her to amass an army of supporters? <br/><br/>Hair/Make-up - Jadis sports blonde distractingly annoying dreadlocks despite her otherwise un-Irie nature. The professor's hair and beard looked about as realistic as a department store Santa, and the main Centaur's make-up also stood out as distractingly awful.<br/><br/>Wardrobe - Jadis has one outfit in particular that looks like it came right off the runway of a bad 80's fashion show. Another includes an atrocious hat shaped like a giant icicle--Mr. Freeze from Batman & Robin would have had hearts in his eyes.<br/><br/>Special Effects - Overall special effects were not nearly as cleanly integrated as WETA's work on LOTR, and cohesion was lacking. For example, the cuts between live action and CGI wolves were painful at best. Also, the teeming masses of bad-guys all looked as though they could have been extras in the Orc armies of LOTR. Mr. Tumnus was an example of the fact that Jadis's supporters were comprised of otherwise beneficent creatures that she'd charmed, threatened and bullied into joining her. Here they were unimaginatively portrayed as one-dimensional twisted, evil fiends.<br/><br/>Cinematography - Boring; All the visual texture and lighting of a made-for-TV movie. <br/><br/>Due to my disappointment in Adamson's interpretation of this work, and in the execution of the movie that resulted, I rate this film a 5 out of 10. It is not completely devoid of entertainment value but fails to uphold the responsibility that a filmmaker shoulders when adapting so well-known and well-loved a story."

","I thought this a very well done film indeed. I will say the film looks just splendid, especially the scenes in Narnia, with beautiful snowy sets (some looked as though it had come from the LOTR trilogy). However, some of the scenes looked as though they had been computerised, such as the scene with the children and beavers running across the ice. There were also some attempts to put some humour into the story like the professor's line ""ah yes, the weeping one"" in reference to Lucy and the beavers especially, but because the director had taken liberties to make the story darker, the humour didn't quite work. However there are a number of positives, like the spirited performances of the children, Georgie Henley especially, better than Sophie Wilcox's rather goofy portrayal in the 1988 series. James McAvoy is charming as Mr. Tumnus, and Liam Neeson was majestic as Aslan. But the acting honours go to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, even with her calmness she dominates the screen, in a sometimes chilling portrayal as the character. The film was fairly faithful to the book, but the added scenes and dialogue failed to engage as much. All, a flawed but enjoyable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","When I first sat down to watch this movie, I admit, I was expecting to see another clichéd movie about good VS. evil, everyone is happy in the end, but I got much more than that.<br/><br/>It starts with The Blitz from the World War II that took place in the 1940's, it took many people by surprise, but I thought it was very good because it gave us look at each of the children. I found myself in tears when the four children (Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter) say goodbye to their mother so they can be evacuated to the country for safety reasons, the story unfolds from there.<br/><br/>As the story grows as does the children. Lucy (Georgie Henley) goes from a small scared child to somewhat of a little valiant. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) goes from a bitter and resentful child into a wise and caring young man. Peter (William Moseley) turns into a mature leader and Susan (Anna Popplewell) realizes that sometimes things are beyond her logic, the four children are played splendidly by their counterparts and I eagerly await to see them in Prince Caspian where I think they will be even better.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film was spectacular and very nicely done, I enjoyed watching the numerous different animals clash in the battle (the most exciting part of the film) and it was good to see the two brothers finally banding together to bet the cold.<br/><br/>Also Liam Nesson brilliantly voices the regal and wonderful lion Aslan, the true leader of Narnia who has returned to help the four children save the day. The Stone Table in which Aslan sacrifices himself in Edmund's place was a very emotional part of the movie and many people (including myself) were crying.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton was amazing as the White Witch and you shuddered in fright every time she raised her voice or merely gave that steely glare, her and Skandar Keynes went wonderfully together and it was a joy to see them go from 'friends' to foes.

","I originally was not going to comment on ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" but as I was reading through the reviews one caught my eye that stated the children cast in the movie could not act. That made me click on the ""review"" button. It's quite the opposite - the four children (although I suppose neither Peter nor Susan are a child) fulfill their roles stupendously, especially Lucy and Peter.<br/><br/>The film is wonderfully shot. The climatic scene is beautiful and throws you right into the middle of the story line. Perhaps what makes the movie so wonderful is that all ages can enjoy it. The expressions, tones, and actions of the characters make the sometimes difficult English vocabulary self-explanatory and simple to follow while providing enough sophistication to satisfy more mature crowds.<br/><br/>Another enchanting aspect of ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is the special effects, which play out like eye candy. All of the amazing creatures looks so realistic that it's hard to believe they could be anything but alive. It's even more fascinating when you think they all came out of the mind of C.S. Lewis. Aslan's animation, for example, is brilliant.<br/><br/>Without giving away any of the story line, I will say that it is unlike any other fantasy movie you've ever seen - but don't trust me on it.

","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was based off of an already popular and compelling story.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking & well-made movie. It successfully beckoned this adult viewer on a journey into the imagination & a world of fantasy. It has a great amount of relevance to the modern issues of child & adult alike. It was dramatic & absorbing in its unfolding story. Thereby appealing to young viewers, but too, held more complex messages for older viewers of any age. It works well on multiple levels, appealing to different kinds of viewers & their personal lives & concerns.<br/><br/>It was also so true to life with the youngest of the children being the one whose concerns were initially overridden & derided. But too, it was this girl who actually was most open to the whole adventure that was about to engulf all their lives. How true of the nature of so many family & school situations, where such young minds are not appreciated or taken seriously or unjustly crushed, in our logical but deceptive world of experts, all bringing their common weight of superiority to dismiss any alternative thought, especially in a younger child.<br/><br/>Yet this innocent girl is the one who finds this world & its curiousities joys & terrors more quickly & fully, while the older children are still struggling to look beyond their sense of self-importance. Isn't this so true of human nature in general? Especially in the modern adult world where any minority belief is mostly harshly scrutinised & criticised & dismissed. This movie offers a gentle message that the imagination & individual creative thought can be encouraged in us all. As surely as each of these children is duly given special gifts & talents that may help their individual personalities, & each other, even their broader community.<br/><br/>The character of the God-like hero of a lion, covering for his kingdom & its constituents, is most thoughtful & impressive. A wise leader who literally serves his kingdom, as the best of leaders do! Also impressive were the use of special effects & magnificent scenery, with intriguing creatures & beautiful colourful costumes.<br/><br/>All in all, those who take this journey to Narnia with an open mind & heart, will be rewarded for whatever gifts & sense of wonder that they bring to this very enjoyable & effective movie."

Obviously, the director is a faithful fan of Lewis and kept the movie as close to the book as was possible. I'm really looking forward to the sequel and I hope that many others agree. All of the characters were played beautifully and I wasn't disappointed by a single one. Peter is the strong, yet still maturing, future King of Narnia. Lucy is the innocent, little girl whose curiosity leads her siblings into a great adventure. Aslan is the majestic, powerful ruler of Narnia whose guidance and love is essential to the children's journey. Overall, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is certainly one of Disney and 2005's best movies."

","I must admit when I first heard they were making The Chronicles Of Narnia the first thought that came to mind was ""great another movie that will follow none of the book!"" but I was surprised at how very wrong I was.<br/><br/>When I walked into the air conditioned cinema, I was expecting it to start of with a snowy beginning but was pleasantly surprised when it started out anything but that, I was actually quite frightened.<br/><br/>Everyone gives a 100% performance of my favourite child hood heroes. Little Georgie Henley shining through as the sweet and innocent Lucy Pevensie, Skandar Keynes perfecting Edmund Pevensie, the most difficult character to play out of the four children. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley, were born for the roles of Susan and Peter, the two eldest children. James McAvoy was the perfect choice for Mr. Tumnus, getting the double agenda perfectly and was there anyone else who could play the evil villain like Tilda Swinton did? Andrew Adamson did a truly marvellous job and I salute everyone who worked on this magical and beautiful film! 10/10"

","...is the only word I can use to describe this picture. It's glorious to see how well Lewis' creation is brought to the screen. Everything is believable, from the recreation of the Blitz, to the children themselves, to the Wardrobe (which looks exactly as I imagined it when I read the books so long ago!) and every facet of the recreation of Narnia, the landscape, the creatures, the White Witch, the Lion, the faun, and the Beavers!<br/><br/>What an achievement. I was weeping with joy when it was over. I was so afraid that Lewis' gorgeous books, which mean so much more than they appear to on the surface, would be diminished by trying to make them into film, but they are enhanced. I want to go back and read them all again! And I can't wait for the next film!"

I remember the story (sort of) from the animated version, but this movie captures the all the beauty and evil and heart and soul of Narnia and its magnificent leader, Aslan. The CGI is seamless, Tilda Swinton is awesome, the children are terrific, and the Beavers are, well, Beavers. Allegory or not, dream-state or not, whatever Lewis had in mind, the story is wonderfulI mean, who wouldn't want to go to Narnia?

"birdie-29","10","3","3","28 May 2006"," A great movie!
","Let me admit that I was wary about this movie at first. The trailers (to me)looked really really dumb, and I was afraid that this movie would be a huge flop and nobody would ever read the books again. I love the books. I loved them when I was a child, and after reading them again, I loved them even more. I wouldn't be able to bear seeing Lewis's books turned into a bunch of cheesy films that only featured too-high-tech computer graphics and dumb child actors that screamed a lot. <br/><br/>Lucky for me, this movie was just the opposite of a disaster. Andrew Adamson does a GREAT job with the graphics, I must say, as that's what he does do best. But he doesn't make it ALL special effects, he adds warmth and love to this movie, he adds depth and feeling. By the end of the movie, you're nearly crying because you don't want the film to end. The child actors that play the four pevensie children are fantastic, Adamson couldn't have picked a better group of kids. Leading them is Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy. She's absolutely great, she lights up the screen, she has amazing talent as an actress, and she's so young! That's the best part, really. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, and he's so evil and bratty at first, it's rather scary. Later on, however, he changes very much, and you can't help but like him. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are great as the two older siblings; Popplewell is bookish and annoying enough, and yet Queenly and beautiful, so that she pulls out a perfect Susan, and Moseley is awesome as Peter. He makes you think, ""Heck, I want this guy to be MY older brother,"" and that's perfect, it's just what is needed.<br/><br/>There's so much more that's majestic and wonderful about this movie, that I could go on for hours, but I'll only end by saying this; you miss out on something beautiful and heart-warming if you neglect seeing this film."

","As a commentator on entertainment celluloid, I have to say that I have been waiting on this flick for a long time. I am an avid reader of C.S. Lewis and have loved this book. The movie didn't disappoint at all. The story is accurately told of little Lucy stumbling into Narnia and changing their world for the better. More importantly, it is a reminder to us that the simplest of good deeds can change our world for the better.<br/><br/>On a technical note, the special effects in the movie could have been better, but when you consider that this is basically a children's story and children aren't as critical as adults, they are fine. As I have said before, one must suspend their disbelief and enjoy the movie for the movie."

The picture and quality is amazing and looks and feels so realistic like you are right there in the action.

"judiciary","10","5","6","29 December 2005"," Faithful and Inspiring Fantasy Which Brings Out the Kid in All of Us
","C.S.Lewis died the same day John F. Kennedy was shot, which partly explains why his passing went unnoticed. Known to the academic world as a literary critic and to the religious world as a defender of traditional Christianity, Lewis nonetheless deserves a high rank among literature's great story tellers. Countless children have thrilled to the story of Lucy and Peter and their siblings discovering the magical land of Narnia where it is ""always winter and never Christmas"" by passing through a musty wardrobe while visiting a remote English castle. Now that tale has been cast on the big screen, and what a production it is!<br/><br/>The graphics work especially well with the live action stars because any evidence of animation adds to the dream quality of the story. The battle scenes are simply breath-taking and the pending attack by wolves frightening even for adults. This is not a movie for preschoolers but one which ought to be required viewing for every teenager with any interest in literature or the Christian faith.<br/><br/>This movie works on so many levels that it is difficult to highlight its successes. The child actors are exceptional and the make-up for imaginary creatures leaves viewers as believers. The scenery from New Zealand, and Czech Republic, and Guatemala, and Los Angeles (oh, I forgot Poland!) suggest someone had a lot of fun tracking down film locations.<br/><br/>References to the Blitz and Turkish Delight bring a charming English quality to the film, but it transcends all nationalities. The only reservation one might have is the blending of myth and history in the modern day miracle play (Saint Nicholas is real, as are unicorns and fauns and satyrs, which may raise doubts about the symbolic lion or the reality of the White Witch in real life) yet this is a story about human nature. Edmund is Everyman who blunders his way into betraying an innocent friend of his sister for the sake of sweets. We see innocent and credulous Lucy, the ""daughter of Eve"" in all of us, who hardly doubts for a minute the reality of what her child like faith has revealed to her.<br/><br/>Don't miss this show for gorilla!"

","Having grown up with the Oz series, the Rings series, and the Narnia series, Watching this movie at age 48 gave me a chance to be a child again. I was drawn into the film from the start. What really got my attention was the comparison of the bombed out London to the land of Narnia where it is always cold and never Christmas... not much joy there, but the children worked together and brought it back just as in the books. I won't comment on the technological aspects, only that this film is a worthwhile view for children of all ages yes, all ages. I wish I could see it with my ten year old daughter and be her age all over again. With all the garbage that is being sold as quality movie viewing, its nice to see a film you can enjoy with your children again. I mean children younger than 13. The potter series is good but I wouldn't take my younger daughter to see it because its a bit much for her to understand. But this series is perfect for your young ones.<br/><br/>Well done Disney!"
"darkmoonnetwork375","10","5","6","28 December 2005"," Best adaptation so far!
","I have been known, both here and in real life, to be largely opposed to adapting books to movies, based on the notion that it cannot be done properly. I hated Lord of the Rings because of the many additions and omissions, I hated Harry Potter largely due to the same reasons and now here is Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is masterly done. With very few additions and omissions, this movie has become a near perfect adaptation of the book. There were some scenes cut short and some scenes added for a better flow but in nearly all instances, it has remained true to the book; both in spirit and in the accuracy of the narrative. It follows the movie almost fanatically. Albeit there are a few scenes which have been cut a bit short, it has left out no vital parts of the book and the few added scenes do nothing to ruin the experience. Many of the scenes, I think, that have been added, have been just that in order to convey some elements of the book. These elements are those, which are so typical of books that they cannot be successfully transported over the the silver screen without it seeming silly or even stupid.<br/><br/>I give it a 10, because the film leaves you with the exact same type of emotion as the book did (indescribable to those who have not read the book) and you leave the cinema with a sense of faith. The book had you believe in Narnia as a world that might - or even should - exist and the film has accomplished the same feat. This will definitely show others in the future how to adapt books to film; and it serves as big and hilarious ""take this"" to Peter Jackson, as he was not able to produce a film so captivating and beautiful as this. An epic and beloved tale springs to life in such an impressive a beautiful way, that I think C.S. Lewis would have shed a proud tear, had he lived to see it."

","I saw this movie as an animated children's program about 20 years ago, so I knew the storyline pretty well. This version was brilliantly done, and the special effects really brought the original story to life. The acting was top draw, and the casting of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was spot on, It was if the character was made for her. Filmed in New Zealand with spectacular scenery this movie was a real visual pleasure. Ray Winston and Dawn French were brilliant as the voices for Mr and Mrs Beaver, with Winstones cockney charm a delight for cinema goers. James Macavoy was splendid as the faun Mr Tumnus he really captured the essence of the character. And Liam Neeson was the perfect choice as the voice for Aslan. <br/><br/>The children were all very good and convincing in the parts they played. Especially little Lucy who was a real little cu-tie and perfect for the part. THE LION WITCH AND THE WARDROBE Is a Children's classic and this movie does it credit, an excellent movie I would recommend to everybody who enjoyed their childhood."

","The scope and presentation of this movie alone make it spectacular. I (unfortunatly) haven't read the books in a couple of years, and even still, I knew what was going to happen - by far the best adaptation of a book i've seen in a long time. It was The Chronicles of Narnia, nothing more, nothing less. (This, unlike some fantasy adaptations of the recent past, was true to the books, didn't rely on special effects, interjections of humour, and actually had a 'comic' dwarf that was in character... impressive) Also a bonus is the fact that the director/screenwriter appear to be dedicated fans of the books themselves - the Witch's name (jadice), while appearing on the police notice, was never mentioned by Lewis until (I believe) The Magician's Nephew. As stated, the books are basically stand-alone stories with several reoccurring (albeit important) characters... hopefully the general public (those who aren't totally devoted to the books) won't lose interest."
"Lauren_Reilly","10","5","6","12 December 2005"," Beautifully done, a wonderful adaptation sure to please!
","This movie is a beautiful retelling of the original story, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" which was my favorite childhood book. Of course there are some slight omissions and additions, but it stays true to the book for the most part. Rupert Everett's fox character was my favorite addition. I do love Liam Neeson as Aslan but personally, I think he could have made Aslan stronger and less subdued. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and believable as the White Witch. She is beautiful and yet does a terrific job of invoking fear as well. The children were wonderfully casted but Susan's character could have been a bit less whiny. Father Christmas was perfectly portrayed. I cried, I laughed and wanted to see more. Remember to stay in the theater to watch the credits! Hopefully, there will be more movies in this series to come and I do hope they win some Oscars. A perfect holiday movie to bring your children to!"

As an adult I found it exciting to watch with times of tension and anticipation, and yet I can't wait to take my two young children.

","This review courtesy of someone who grew up in a house called 'Narnia' (replete with lamp-post in garden)- and as an adult who now owns a boat called 'Dawn Treader'. I guess I'm a bit of a Narnia nut in the same way that King Kong is a bit of a monkey. I read the Chronicles many many times as a child and I've recently had the pleasure of reading them all over again - to my own children.<br/><br/>All of which means (a) I'm not very objective about the film - and (b) I had some major 'views' about how things ought to be done prior to the screening.<br/><br/>For those out there with similar Narnia heritage I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I personally enjoyed the effort a lot - and on only a very few occasions did I sniff disapprovingly into my popcorn. The kids (9 & 7 respectively and with a mere single reading under the belts!) loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The good things. Lucy ( in looks a sort of mini Ann Widdecombe for all you UK politicos out there) was very good. Think the director must take a lot of credit for her performance. If Lucy had been bad, then this venture would have failed. Thankfully she shines. The others children I thought were a little ho-hum with Peter being the weakest.<br/><br/>Tumnus was excellent - although our more cynical time applies some rather uncomfortable sinister overtones to the scenes with Lucy.<br/><br/>Yes the Beavers were fun - as was the fox. Could have done with more explanation about the whole 'animals' talking thing though. It's remarked on rather too briefly I thought. (One of many problems with doing this book first instead of The Magicians Nephew - which explains the genesis of Narnia, how the animals start speaking and where the white witch comes from etc.) The White witch? - pretty good I thought, although maybe a little one dimensional. However I didn't like her 'home' which I felt as others have noted derivative and out of place in look and architecture to the rest of Narnia.<br/><br/>Aslan - bang on. There is nothing CGI cant do now. (My brother and nephew wanted Aslan to be larger relative to other animals. My recollection of the book suggested he changed size to fit the occasion - so I had no problems myself) The stone table scene. Excellent and very true to the book.<br/><br/>Now for those elements that were for me less good.<br/><br/>The wood. Maybe I have the drawings from the books too much in mind - but for me the wood should have been darker, more canopied and claustrophobic. More like being in a wardrobe in fact. And I never felt a sense of size about the wood, or indeed the rest of Narnia. I felt the camera stayed too close the action - and we needed some longer shots. Especially felt in the first meeting with Tumnus - which in other regards was very nearly magical.<br/><br/>The battle at the end. Okay so the charge of the Riders of Rohan is perhaps the most impressive film image of our generation - but it's not really what Narnia is about. I craved for something a little smaller in scale - a little more personal and intimate.<br/><br/>The waterfall/ ice flow scene. Utter nonsense and superfluous to a story that hardly lacks for dramatic drive. Why he didn't just follow the story as written Ill never understand. The wolves weren't sinister enough in looks either - although I have to admit the 'Jaws' moment with Edmund was suitably scary.<br/><br/>The game of cricket and broken window episode. Again - the story as written with the escape from the visitors party and Mrs McCready was subtler and more interesting.<br/><br/>Okay - enough gripes. By and large I did enjoy the film and I look forward to the next. I have concerns that as a book Prince Caspian (which I always felt was the weakest) may not support a very interesting movie. I hope that there is commitment to do all of the rest - or at least as far as Dawn Treader - which I think will make a fantastic vehicle for a film...."

I never thought a movie could capture the book I loved so much as a child. This one did so, far surpassing all my expectations. In all my years of watching movies, I have never been more enraptured with a film. Such a beautifully filmed, well-acted movie ... there are not enough adjectives to express how much I enjoyed this movie. It was well worth going to the midnight showing! I won't write a summary, or my take on the story as a whole, as I'm afraid I would give away too many plot points. Suffice it to say, if you loved the book, you will love the movie.

Narnia is so fantastic it will make you want to see it again and again. <br/><br/>-I thought that the movie was marvelous. There were a few surprising moments in the movie. For some people the movie was sad for some it was happy. For me it was in-between. I thought that when Lucy first found the wardrobe and they didn't believe her it was sad. But when Aslan came and made Peter a knight of Narnia it was very happy moment. <br/><br/>-It's joyful, heart warming and completely brilliant. The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The witch, and The Wardrobe was a hit. The movie everyone wants to see and I am sure you do too. Why? Because this movie is worth it. It was unbelievable to watch. I even read the book and you can find out that the book was just as good as watching the movie because they are both great. However, the book may be more educational. So the movie and the book were a success and we are lucky to have C.S.Lewis that wrote the book. In the movie there were many fantasy and reality things. There ere fauns and beavers that could speak, but I am not going to tell you everything so now it is up to you to read the book and watch the movie, to see and imagine the Chronicles of Narnia. <br/><br/>-Have you been looking for a phenomenal movie to watch lately? Well, you're just going to have to watch the chronicles of Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe. This is an eye catching movie with varieties of different outstanding events. If you're a person that likes fantasy this is your type of movie. Don t hesitate just go and have a merriment time. Enjoy!!! <br/><br/>-140 minutes of passion, excitement, and sadness. It made me grieve in some parts of the movie. It also thrilled me in parts, my heart pumped with light making me want to weep of happiness. It was just like a machine, the machine's purpose was to emotion change. Tears of sorrow swept down my face while watching the death of a whole slew! A ferocious lion goes at it with a witch. No ordinary spell casting witch, a fierce, selfish, hideous, wicked, and a hex witch. So you can sit back watch the movie and try not to soak your face with tears. Also you might be surprised where the tricky cliff can take you.<br/><br/>-The door was opened through the two worlds Narnia and our world, but at what consequence to the pevency family. Four children enter Narnia while hiding in the wardrobe from the house keeper that gives tours of the Professor's house. They enter Narnia as a family and leave as legendary HEROES! While in Narnia they defeat the evil witch that rules Narnia and get dubbed King and Queens! This adventure has so many thrilling parts it be impossible to put them all on one page. Out of ten I give this movie nine! NO movie will top this one for months and months.<br/><br/>-On Friday December9 2005 Kameyosek school grade 5/6 class went to go see the movie, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, at Cineplex Odeon theatres in South Edmonton Common. My grade 5/6 class went to see the movie because we read the book and studied a lot about The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. I thought the movie and the book were both excellent. The movie really pulled me in and wanted me to watch more and more. My favorite part of the movie was the big battle when everybody fought and the scariest part was when Edmund found the Witch and he stepped over Maugrim. I stood up and made a loud noise and every body in the theatres screamed. The saddest part was probably when Aslan died. I did not know what was going to happen. I was felling very depressed when Aslan was killed. I was thrilled at the end of the movie. When Edmund did not go with the witch. Instead Edmund stayed with his family. When Edmund snapped the witches wand that was probably the most heroic thing Edmund ever did in the movie and the novel. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe movie and novel were very entertaining. I would give it a 9 out of 10 rating. And I would recommend it to everybody who likes action and adventurous movies. The lion, the witch and the wardrobe was very exciting so go see it or go read it."
"Elori","4","41","76","4 January 2006"," Empty tale of visual bravado
","Narnia isn't the next Lord of the Rings, nor the next Harry Potter, at least on the cinema screen. Even what spirit those fantasy spectacles had, Narnia lacks. And it seems the whole hundreds-plus audience, many of whom were children, agreed with me in their numb, passive state. No yelps of joy, excitement nor even the slightest scare. After the movie ended, both kids and adults were in such a rush to leave, silent and obviously underwhelmed, that some of them missed the tacked-in ending during the credits.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is a quality work, displaying technical prowess and craftsmanship. You will wonder how they managed to create all beasts from the real world to the mythology, from beavers, panthers and lions to fauns, centaurs and gryphons. There are also some large, captivating sights such as the view of the ice castle and the scene of the final battle. The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.<br/><br/>What is not acceptable is the soullessness and joylessness of the rest of actual content of the film. Much of it weighs down upon the main roles the main roles. Georgie Henley's Lucy Pevensie gets a lot of screen time compared to her siblings, which is for the better thanks to her charisma. The rest of three, however, come off as stiff and unnatural, with perhaps more fault to the script and directing than the actors themselves. The children are portrayed as precocious on some occasions, yet unbelievably daft on others. Due to this, the three eldest siblings are thrown quite off balance during the film, and not in the credible way of children, but rather for the goal-oriented purposes of trying to build up suspense and plot where there is none.<br/><br/>Maybe the producers have tried to make a child-centered movie by explaining the obvious, but it feels more like underestimating its young viewers. On the other hand, the deeper questions are left completely unattended, such as the nature of the Great Magic, and the importance of Humans. This leaves the story empty, and creates a soft of befuddlement over the whole movie: what was all the fighting about? Why were the good creatures good and the bad creatures not? Underneath its eye candy, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is hollow, and without a soul, the exterior fails to impress alone."

","... after reading Narnia as a child and with a daughter who recently read all the books in quick succession, we were waiting for a marvel of imagination and magic, and (why not) a few good special effects.<br/><br/>The film was a total disappointment for all the family, from start to finish.<br/><br/>Dull acting - overlong shots of the children showing standard expressions 1, 2 or 3 (maybe just 1 & 2)<br/><br/>A total lack of expression by Timnis, the Witch and the Centaur (even Shrek had conveyed more emotion)<br/><br/>Dull special effects ... we're spoiled by LOTR of course, but we do expect the Witch's palace to look a little bit better than sheet plastic in soft focus. <br/><br/>The battle scenes would have been impressive to people seeing the film at the time of C.S.Lewis's writing in 1950 but not today ... sorry guys!<br/><br/>In fact we wondered where the $180 million budget had gone ! If the sequel is in production, it's time to call in the auditors !!<br/><br/>Recommendation : If you want Narnia, read the books."

","I'm not a very good writer, I'm a man of few words, but here we go! First of all, the acting: Lucy is charming and adorable, love her; Edmund was cold enough, very good; Susan was bossy in the right time, great; Peter was heroic and a father when he need it to be, so they act very well; The W.witch ( Tilda ) was evil all the time, the best; Mr Tumnus was magical, perfect and the voices of Aslan ( Lian Nesson ), Maugrin, Mr Beaver and Mrs Beaver simply incredible. The direction: A superb job, you have the felling that you entered the wardrobe with the kids, thats make the direction amazing. The effects, make up: No words, I really cant imagine something that this guys couldn't do. Aslan, Mr Tumnus and the Eagles were my favorites. Favorite scene: The Stone Table, touching, emotional and powerful. The Score: it works perfect with the film, movie theme is powerful and the chorus behind, wow!!! The story: Well, is Narnia, Unique! like lord of the rings.<br/><br/>For you to hate this movie, you have to hate the story, because is very faithful to the book.<br/><br/>CS Lewis would be proud. <br/><br/>The only thing I didn't enjoy was the .... don't, sorry, nothing !!!<br/><br/>Go see it, it is not a adult movie, it is not a kids movie. Its a great movie with a touching story, a tale of friendship, courage and have to quote Freud: ""There will be a time when we all have to stop acting like a child and face the life hostile how it is"""

","You really need a tally-sheet to review this movie; so many Great Expectations!<br/><br/>Truth to the original story: really close, 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Let's start with: they did the right story first! The fad, lately, of numbering the books in historical order (starting with ""The Magician's Nephew"") is just inexplicable, must be due to someone who hasn't actually ready them. The stories don't even make sense in that order! That the movie crew began where Lewis did is a very great credit to them.<br/><br/>There were two things missing, though, that are actually quite important to the book: Edmund's inner dialog, and the rather parental voice of the narrator (""how silly it is to close yourself into a wardrobe"", ""that's the problem with magical food""). These really are missed; without them, the tale takes on a very different character, and perhaps even point.<br/><br/>There were three things added as well: a long preamble showing what Lewis' oh-so-brief ""because of the bombing"" really means, a substantial Peter-Jackson reference in the battle scene, and an Exciting Adventure Involving a Waterfall. These are a mixed bag: I think by now, over fifty years after WWII, most folks alive need a bit of explanation as to what ""the bombing"" really meant, and the work here is really, really good. The spectacular battle scene, though, does not so clearly carry its weight: as an attraction for the SFX fans, it's pretty lack-luster; as a fixture in the myth, it's a bit distracting from the important points (though they're all still there). And the bit with the waterfall ... what was that all about? Revolution in the writing squad? ""We must put in one original idea of our own""?<br/><br/>Quality of the Effects: by modern standards, pretty mediocre, 5 of 10. But then again, even what is here begins to distract from the story as it is: it's not really an SFX vehicle, despite the talking animals.<br/><br/>Acting: there's a lot of debate about this, and I'm torn. Part of the debate though, I think, is from folks who haven't read all the books, and don't know how these children will age: some of what seems uncomfortable here is supposed to!<br/><br/>Character development: not too much, 4 of 10. Then again, that's the way of it with the books, too; some Narnians show more character development than the Pevensies.<br/><br/>Tagging up on all the key ideas, images, plot points, metaphors, characters, and other details: really, really good, 10 of 10 (except as noted above). But it did seem, occasionally, to be doing just that: ""ok, now we have to have THIS happen, because it's in the book."""

","The big screen adaptation of the 1st novel under the chronicles of narnia series by C.S.Lewis is a winner.All aspects of film making, from the cinematography to the art-direction to the editing to the rousing score all come together to deliver visually stunning and immensely satisfying movie experience. The world of Narnia and it's inhabitants are brought to life under the expert Andrew Adamson who has previously worked on the Shrek franchise.Fawns, ogres, beavers, magical horses, eagles who turn into flames, mermaids...the whole breadth of fantasy creatures are captured in the movie.And of course, Aslan, the lion messiah who guides the 4 children towards their destiny.Maginificient, grandiose, imposing and with a terrific screen presence. A special word here for Tilda Swanson who plays the role of the Snow Witch.I cannot imagine anyone else in that role,after having watched her. She is like, born for this role.She oozes evil in every movement, every gesture.The final battle scene, where she appears wielding swords and with a lion's mane around her, boy!<br/><br/>A must watch."
"thewandering1","8","6","8","6 January 2006"," All in All it was a fun watch
","For me it was fun and worth the money spent. Having just read all 7 books again (since I hadn't read them in at least 20 years) I was looking forward to this movie with some trepidation. After all Hollywood doesn't do well on book or comic to movie conversions ever.<br/><br/>It was fun, a little slow going at certain points, but fun all told and my fiancÃ© who had never read the books only had a few questions (which if they would have been more faithful to the books they wouldn't have been).<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**** The gratuitous bombing scene of England I personally didn't feel like it added anything to the movie (took away from the beginning quite a bit for me SLOW). The fact that they changed the why of how they all got into the wardrobe (cricket ball versus visitors/guests to the professors estate) worked better in my opinion as more believable for a reason to get kids to hide (and close the door) to the wardrobe. The fact that the professor hinted at the end of the movie that he knew where they had been was kind of a cheap way of saying that if this movie doesn't make enough in the theater's at least now we don't have to explain the entire 7 book series or make them (that's at least how I read into that). The kids actually don't find out until much later in the series about the professor and his involvement with Narnia.<br/><br/>I do agree with other posters that the magic of how the IceQueen got Edmond to follow her lead was lost and in so doing they wrecked his character a little and made it unbelievable that he could 'change sides'. Candy that was addictive and that would never allow you to be full no matter what you ate is a lot easier to swallow then what they did in the movie. I also agree that in cutting the frolicking that aslan did with the kids after he came back to life as well as the scene where they awoke the giant in the IceQueen's castle cut quite a bit of the magic of Narnia out of the movie. Jadia was described in the book as a 'giant' with enormous strength and this actress (forgot her name but other posters have posted it) didn't pull off the character in that regard, but did portray her cold ruthlessness rather well.<br/><br/>Maybe they were hoping that the simple fact that there were speaking animals would assuage the magic feeling for kids and there was no need to include on the simple character building that the books do. I hope they do better with Prince Caspian."

","I took my 12 year old and 8 year old sons to this movie and we all enjoyed it immensely! What an awesome film! I had seen the older videos and this is much much better quality wise! So many really neat special effects and such a great story! There were places the audience laughed, and places that drew a tear to the eye, and places that had us on the edge of our seats! GREAT movie! I am sure it will be a timeless classic! The children who acted in the movie were very good and convincing as the main characters, and the White witch was scary and evil, but not so bad that young children couldn't see the film. I felt the scene with Father Christmas could have been done better, they went over it a bit too quickly. Aslan was so realistic! It made you feel as if a real Lion were talking! SO good! The battle scenes were very well done and so exciting. I highly recommend this film. It is so refreshing to see a family movie with no bad language or sex in it these days."

","Having read the book as a child I thought the whole film was a brilliant interpretation of what I read, although I imagined it set in a Victorian house, not that, that matters. The special effects with the animals are very believable as the talking and voice-overs are superb. The plot from beginning to end has been exceptionally well executed. Only with today's special effects could this film hit the nail on the spot so well, it is so real. The children play their parts spot on and Tilda Swinton/The White Witch with her black eyes and beautiful but chilling figure cuts a fetching but scary witch. I will take my children to see it, in the cinema and buy the DVD when it is out, this will be a classic movie and if the future anticipated films have the same superb ingredients the series will likewise be classics."

","What I mean by that is that C. S. Lewis' The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is FINALLY on big screen. I'm so happy and relieved.<br/><br/>I very much loved the film. Immediately, I say go see it. I say it is an INSTANT classic. Everything, honestly, about this film is wonderful: The acting, the music, the animation, the scenery, etc. See, I'm not displeased at all.<br/><br/>I always loved the BCC form of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe and the cartoon. but it was so truly cool to see it like this. If Mr. Lewis was still alive, I... believe he would really like this one.<br/><br/>Now the actors and actresses were all very excellent. The children and teenagers who played the four Pevensies (Henley, Popplewell, Keynes, Moseley) are very good at acting, really. Swinton makes a perfect fit for the tall, calm and cruel Jadis, the White Witch. And Neeson does a wonderful job for the voice of the divine, strong but loving Aslan, the lion and the King of Narnia.<br/><br/>I'm so pleased with everything about this film and, most of all, just happy Narnia's has gone to theaters after all this time and I hope they will make the fellow sequel books into films too. Here they are: Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse And His Boy, The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. Its absolutely an excellent film, please see it with your family... And if you don't know, there are secrets deeper into the story then you think, huh? Try to find them out."

","To say this movie was anything but brilliant would be an understatement. My own reality seemed to vanish around me and all I could see and smell was this fantasy created by the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Each actor was outstanding, connecting with children and adults alike, from the innocent Lucy to the cold-hearted White Witch and brave Aslan. The computer generated images are nothing short of amazing and the truly intense scenes had me holding my breath in anticipation for what was to come next. I wanted to be in Narnia. I wanted to have a magic wardrobe. But most importantly, I sure wanted to see this movie again when it had finished."

","I have to say that I've always loved the C.S. Lewis Narnia novels and re-read them only recently. Although it was before I heard about this movie. I've also acquired the BBC movies for my very young son, and when I watched them for the first time found it VERY hard to restrain my incredulity at the so very fake animals and 'special' effects. So when I saw the shorts for this movie I was rather excited, and my expectations have been fully satisfied. I went with a friend this very afternoon and loved almost every minute. There were a couple of scenes where the backgrounds don't look quite right but other than that it is just about perfect. It also follows the book so closely it's amazing. Highly recommended to all fans of the novel, you definitely won't be disappointed!"

"Alyoshevna","10","6","8","13 December 2005"," Unique, enthralling, and beautifully realized.
","There is much I could say in praise of this movie, but I won't repeat what others have already said.<br/><br/>One of its best features, for viewers of all ages, is that it doesn't condescend to children. Charming as it was, SHREK -- from the same director -- did not expect children to handle much beyond a few familiar fairy-tale staples. THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE immerses them in a world wholly different from anything an American child knows: WWII England; the clothes, settings, and language of the place and time; Turkish delight, centaurs, even the ""wardrobe"" (which today would be called an armoire) and its mothballs. Many filmmakers wouldn't have touched this tale unless they could transpose it into contemporary America and either change or explain its alien elements. They wouldn't trust children to ""get it."" <br/><br/>But, to children, all the world is new. They are ready, nay, delighted to enter into a wondrous, magical world and take it on its own terms. What they don't understand doesn't matter. What matters is wonder. The creators of this film trust their audience. The result is more thrilling than any dumb-downed, words-of-one-syllable version would have been.<br/><br/>And the film is beautifully imagined. Most of us probably don't appreciate what it takes to adapt such a richly envisioned world to film: what to cut out and how to fill in what the author didn't describe. This movie succeeds remarkably. Its Narnia is true to C.S. Lewis and should be equally enthralling to viewers who have never heard of either.<br/><br/>If the idea of cheetahs, minotaurs, children in medieval armor, and other unlikely creatures rushing together into high-stakes battle intrigues you -- if you've never grown too old for wonder -- this movie is for you."
"hajejan","10","6","8","12 December 2005"," Finally bringing the magic alive
","Every now and again you come across a film that is so beautiful that you just don't want it to end. Even in a fully-seated cinema, you forget that you are there with people. The screen swallows you, the story engulfs you, and the whole film's sole purpose seems to be to tell you, and only you, a story.<br/><br/>I recently had one of those experiences when following the Pevensie siblings on their journey through Narnia, in the form of the 2005 release of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. <br/><br/>There is no doubt in my mind: taking on the magic of C.S. Lewis is beyond the mental capabilities of most directors. When it was announced that the director of the Witch and the Wardrobe had not made any ""real"" feature-length films before, I dreaded the results deeply. How would the maker of Shrek and Shrek 2 translate his skills into transmogrifying one of my favourite childhood memories? <br/><br/>I should not have feared. <br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia is a film that couldn't have been made 10 years ago - it relies so heavily on special effects and digital tricks that even attempting to make it without all the digital trickery would have resulted in a B-movie, regardless of its budget. With his experience as the special effects guy on several of the Batman films, Director and producer Andrew Adamson did manage to put together one hell of a display.<br/><br/>With all the visual do-goodery in place, and one of the best stories ever told to drive it forward, there wasn't a lot to make the Witch and the Wardrobe fail... And of course, it didn't. Striding from strength to strength, effortlessly combining the magical with the mythical, the impossible with the improbable, and the beautiful with the gorgeous, this was 2 hours that couldn't possibly have been filled with more heartwarming surprises. <br/><br/>I'm not the kind of person who cries often, and especially not on films, yet this film had my eyes welling over half a dozen times - that's how beautiful it is.<br/><br/>After I came out of the cinema, I ended up texting an old friend of mine. Her response summarised the film and how I feel about it better than anything else could have: ""There's always a Narnia somewhere""."
"roberthanly","10","6","8","11 December 2005"," Completely Lives Up to the Hype
","This movie blew me away. It exceeded all my expectations in all areas. I have never read the book, so this comes from a person who saw the movie first. Tilda Swinton steals the show in my opinion, as the White Witch, while the CGI and animal-speech is astonishingly believable. The soundtrack is in a league of its own with its own unique feel and its own unique melodies. While the children's' acting doesn't convince very well at the beginning, it all picks up and we see some very talented youngsters, taking on a very passionate story extremely well. The entire film is just such a pleasure to watch - go and see it. It's worth every minute."
"PinkPurple","10","6","8","11 December 2005"," Get Yourself a Oneway Ticket to Narnia!
","I'd say it got almost everything right. Of course nothings perfect But all they really had to get right was being faithful enough to capture the essence of the story, most importantly it's sense of heart, which it does well enough. These characters had a hell of a lot more going for them in the rooting department than most more morden movies of these recent years and it carry's the movie and any flaws through. If they'd tried to attempt anymore then they'd have entered the ""trying to please everyone"" zone of impossibility.<br/><br/>Somehow I found both the personality trates in Peter and Edmund and their character arcs rang true. Edmund's selfishness, the little brother who can't seem to do anything right, who must learn the error of his ways by bitter experience, forced to grow up fast and Peter's struggle to live up to his responsibilities, the boy forced to be something that he isn't certain he can be, the boy who must become the man of the family. I understand how that stuff must feel rather well. Each felt very natural, clearly the makers worked hard to get such performances out of these youngsters. I hear they even deliberately looked for kids who matched the character's persona's which obviously helped.<br/><br/>I liked that nobody was just morphed into a mighty hero, that they remained consistently grounded and humanised. Peter not loosing his sense of humour. I loved how the actor delivered his reply to ""They come in numbers far greater than our own,"" ""Numbers don't win a war"" with simply a ""No...but I bet they help."" I'm very warm to the underdog hero who faces insane odds and who can laugh at them self and use humour as a defence no matter how grave the situation.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only slight criticism is that the girls on the other hand were somewhat more underused, well the older one anyway. Lucy was note worthy.<br/><br/>The voice work guys played an absolute blinder! Ray Winston ruled! That cranky little East-End beaver nearly stole the show! Dawn French served her purpose well as a good compliment to the great Ray.<br/><br/>Aslan the mighty wise old Lion didn't disappoint me either, he looked magnificent and voiced to a tea by the master of such roles, the legendary Liam Neeson. Ah the wonders of the CGI age eh? <br/><br/>The Villain front didn't let the side down neither. I digged the taunting wolf, always great tension when a Villain knows how to mess with the heroes insecurities, especially when it's the best kind of hero, a humanised underdog kind of hero like Peter, whom is bursting with that kind of vulnerability. This lead to some fairly decent built up tenstion and suspense. <br/><br/>That was one creepy as hell White Witch, those eyes, it was all in the eyes and of course her shining moment came in that one all important scene, the scene that if they'd got wrong, the hole movie would have fell to pieces, yep the infamous stone table scene. And boy was it powerful stuff, no easy feat considering it was a puppet! It's A PUPPET!... oh sorry, no I wasn't possessed by British comedian Brian Conery for a moment there, I was checking your paying attenstion and of course mean't...puppet/CGI Lion.<br/><br/>All in all, a film thats refreshingly as character driven as possible for a big epic blockbuster."
"smittysgirl16","10","6","8","10 December 2005"," A Magnificent Accomplisment!
","As a fan of C.S. Lewis' books, I thought that this movie did ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" justice better than any other medium in the past. Even though I was a little skeptical at first, all of my fears were extinguished when I saw the final product.<br/><br/>Since this was such a good movie, I don't want to leave people with the few very minor gripes that I had, so I'm just going to put the bad points at the beginning to get them out of my system. One was that they put a little more emphasis on the children's importance than Aslan's. In the books, spring and Christmas return because Aslan comes back, but according to the movie's Father Christmas, the children were breaking the witch's spell. True, the children are important in the book, but they were tacked with extra importance in the movie. It' obvious from Beaver leaving out the prophecy about Aslan that he talks about in the book. Another of my gripes is that they don't seem to be paying much mind to ""The Magician's Nephew"" when it came to the Professor. In that book, which is supposed to come before LWW, the much younger version of the Professor goes into Narnia using magic rings, not the wardrobe. I got the impression from the very end that he actually went through the wardrobe to get to Narnia. The wardrobe was in fact made from a tree that grew out of a Narnian apple seed in Young Professor's backyard long after he got back from his last trip there. There was never any indication that he even knew the wardrobe led to Narnia until Lucy entered. However, there is a nod to ""The Magician's Nephew"" when we looking at the lamppost. In that book, a lamppost on a busy street in our world that has two little bars sticking out of the near-top gets grabbed by a carriage driver. One of the bars breaks off when the driver gets accidentally taken to Narnia. The bar is then thrown to the ground and makes a full lamppost grow in its place, hence the end marking of the land. The fact that the lamppost of the movie only had one bar was a nice touch. These points in the movie were definitely not enough to quell my enjoyment of it at all, but I still felt that I needed to get them out there.<br/><br/>Let me now state some of the many good points of this movie. First off, the animation was superb. I found it very hard to believe that Aslan was completely computer generated. His mane and his features were so real that I almost doubted the fact that he was a fake animal. The animation of the other creatures was top-notch as well, including the beavers, the wolves, the fox, and pretty much everything else. This is animation that might surpass the ""Lord of the Rings"" and another Disney creation called ""Dinosaur"" in terms of quality. The scenery was also amazing, so much so that it took my breath away.<br/><br/>The acting of the children was top-notch, especially that of the little girl who played Lucy. She captured so much emotion and practically stole the show in every scene. I was also very impressed with the actress who played the White Witch. She did a perfect job of playing an ""actor"". The fact that she could do the fake compassionate and then move on to pure evil was amazing to me. That takes a lot of talent. I very much enjoyed Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. He was perfect for this part and really helped sell Aslan for me. I actually think it's funny that everyone on screen who's old, wise, and British is played by Liam Neeson nowadays. I don't think that there's anything wrong with that, but I just think that it's funny.<br/><br/>The pure heart of the movie was what had me the most. The relationship between the brothers and sisters was great and very touching. The death of Aslan was worthy to be called the climax of the movie with such heart wrenching sadness as well as pure happiness taking over when he resurrected. <br/><br/>That actually brings me to the issue of the Christian allegories. I'm not going to list them specifically since they are very obvious in the movie, but I for one am very happy that Disney didn't water them down. They were my favorite part of the books and they are my favorite part of the movie, too. I'm glad that Disney got smart and realized that the parallels in the story were not offensive in any way, but rather essential to the overall plot.<br/><br/>I actually cannot think of any more great points to this movie because the movie as a whole was so fantastic. If I had to list all of the good points I could think of, then I would have to write a ten-page paper, which I don't think that anyone has time to read.<br/><br/>All in all, I say that this was one of the best movies of the year. After horrible and pointless movies like ""Your, Mine, and Ours"" and ""Aeon Flux"", as well as the good but very adult movies like ""Walk the Line"" out on the screens, this was the breath of fresh air I needed to get geared up for the holiday season. A very good family-friendly movie is hard to find these days and I'm glad that Disney is delivering at long last. I certainly hope that the Oscars recognize the superb animation, beautiful screenplay, and possibly even the picture as a whole (wishful thinking because of the allegories and target audience, but you never know) in its voting. This movie is Disney at its best and I recommend it to anyone, Christian or not, who loves adventure, action, and amazing film-making."

","I went to go see this movie last night and I must say that I was very pleased with what I witnessed. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fun-filled motion picture that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This film also contains a few good laughs as well. This likable adventure has vast diversity when it comes to its principal characters. The intensity contained here is very overwhelming. The four central protagonists are all very charming indeed.<br/><br/>Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are trying to adapt to their new living arrangement when they discover a magical wardrobe in a secret room in the upstairs area. The quartet meets a wide variety of good and evil characters. They gradually realize that the land of Narnia is in danger because of the evil White Witch, who claims to be the queen of the land. Some friendly animals soon tell the children that they are the only hope in ending the witch's reign of terror. A lion named Aslan is brought to their attention and they prepare for a magnificent battle. The lion ends up killing the evil witch. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are all honored and crowned as monarchs in the land of Narnia. The story here comes to a very happy end.<br/><br/>I truly like this movie and its characters. The four kids are, once again, very charming. Peter, the oldest son, is very strong-willed and reliable. Susan, the oldest daughter, has a genuinely delightful personality in addition to her ability to provide help to others when it is needed. Edmund likes to go his own way in a situation when he feels that it is a necessity; therefore, he is something of a rebel. Lucy is an adorable little girl who has a way with making others happy with her cute smile; she is also a bit of a humanitarian. The sadistic White Witch has a huge love of telling others what to do. When the lion killed her, I got very ecstatic. Peace was restored to the land of Narnia and our heroes are greatly honored.<br/><br/>I love this movie! The characters here really captivated me, especially Susan and Lucy, the two lovable girls. The classic story by C.S. Lewis is brought to life in a truly spectacular way. Families everywhere will fall in love with this masterpiece of a motion picture. Long live King Peter, Queen Susan, King Edmund, and Queen Lucy!"

","To see this movie brought to life so fully brings a joy to my heart. As a long time fan of the series, I was worried about how this film was going to be portrayed, but they absolutely nailed it.<br/><br/>When they veered from the book, it only was to enhance the tension at certain plot points, never to change the essence of the story.<br/><br/>Of course, the goal of a good movie isn't only to follow the plot of the movie. It's to make an exciting movie experience. In this case, it was also important not to violate the spirit of the book. Adam Adamson didn't.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most brilliant decision he made was to cast four unknowns as the Pevensie children. They prove unequivocally that level of fame coming in is not synonymous with talent. These children give the movie, and their characters, extreme depth. At its core, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the story of how these four children grow into their destiny. This movie nails that.<br/><br/>By succeeding overwhelmingly in constructing the movie's core, Adamson satisfies his core audience. Which is why it is so easy to accept the other slight changes from the book -- there is a certain trust that any changes will be made by someone who is in tune with C.S. Lewis' spirit and vision.<br/><br/>In a pre-CGI world, Lewis once said that he couldn't envision a live-action Narnia movie that worked. Thanks to Adam Adamson the rest of us can."
"aravis05","10","6","8","9 December 2005"," Absolutely amazing and powerful
","This movie was beyond excellent. I cannot believe how incredibly amazing it was. I cannot wait for the next movie to come out. I have read the books since I was five or six years old. I love these books and this movie was amazingly true to the story. The changes made were effective and did not take away from the story. I am not afraid to admit that I cried at the beginning of the movie, and bawled as Aslan willingly and meekly walked to his death. I also cried as Peter and his army charged against the White Witch. This movie was so powerful. The story is an allegory of the Crucifixion story, with Aslan representing Christ. The children in particular Peter and Lucy were incredible and very convincing. I loved the beavers which looked so real it was amazing. The casting of Liam Leeson as the voice of Aslan was brilliant. Weta and ILM strike again the props, special effects and costumes were beyond description. I encourage all to see this film, but if you have any understanding of the Easter Story bring tissues because you will need them."
"gram_eno","10","6","8","9 December 2005"," This is pure genius
","I believe this movie is as perfect as an adaption of The Lion,The Witch , and The Wardrobe that could be. The casting was perfect and the effects are pure bliss. This is not Christian propaganda ,it just takes the idea of a messianic archetype who gives his life for those he loves. It isn't selling theology its selling love. Thats not a bad thing to teach kids is it?Just because a writer uses his beliefs to be basis the moral under fabric of a story doesn't make it propaganda. If your going to complain about CS Lewis complain about Tolkien who was Catholic and that inspired his writing too. If you want to attack true propaganda attack Left Behind . All it is is just a cheap scare tactic to convert people. Leave Chronicals of Narnia out of the Propaganda label. Watch this film it will inspire you and its just a damn a Good Fantasy film and it is better than Harry Potter. This is one of the truly great fantasy films (equal if not close to Lord Of The Rings ) and it is for all ages. I can not wait for the sequels."

I definitely suggest reading the book first though. There was actually one time where I yelled ""Yes!"". After Aslan roared after being brought back to life, it was great. The sets were beautiful, the actors were above average, and the only changes from the book were improvements.

","One of the most prominent stories from my childhood brought to the big screen and missing hardly anything, if anything at all, from the original book by C. S. Lewis.<br/><br/>At times I found memories of wonder and excitement surging through my head, as the story unfolded but having been long since moved to some dark and distant corner of my psyche.<br/><br/>The children playing out gallant heroes portrayed the very essence of what the characters are supposed to be; executing their roles in natural and believable way.<br/><br/>And although the film is full of special effects, it at no point relied on them to tell this classic tale.<br/><br/>A must see, not only for our children but for the big kid that lingers in every one of us.<br/><br/>Maybe tonight, as did when I was a child, I'll reach into the back of the wardrobe and firmly tap the back...

","Most people already know the story so I won't recap. All I really want to say is that I have waited 25 years for this movie.. and I was not disappointed! If anything my dreams were exceeded. The casting was incredible, there is nothing about any of the characters that I would change. The scenery was fabulous. The special effects were great. I was worried about the use of so many CGI characters but at no point did I feel that they caused any distraction and their implementation was perfect (IMHO) I am a big enough fan of the series that I did go out and buy the BBC version (on VHS and then on DVD when it became available) simply to have SOME cinematic rendering of the text. It wasn't bad for a television series directed at children. But this movie does much more justice to the full grandeur of the book.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the series."

","I really loved this movie! I saw it just today and it was simply outstanding. Though it wasn't like the book a lot, it was really great! From music, to acting, this movie is a must watch for LOTR fans! There were a few problems though: 1-it was a kind of fast movie 2-adding some more sequence and time to it, would not hurt 3-the acting could have been more better (but considering it was the children's first movie, that's okay) all in all this is a must see movie! Aslan's voice was done by Liam Neeson, and that's a good thing because everything matched so perfectly well together. And as the movie starts on, you sit at the edge of your seat, dying to know what happens.(that's because it's way different from the book, and I knew I sat at the edge of my chair!)"

","I saw ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" today, it was the best movie I have seen in a long time.

The movie was great and even though it is a 'battle' movie there was some funny dialog from some of the characters. I loved the centaurs and other creatures. The children were great in this movie as well as the voice of Aslan. I encourage people to go out and watch this movie. It is a wonderfully directed, acted and written film."
"holmqc","9","6","8","9 December 2005"," True to the Story & the Message
","I always applaud directors who stay true to the story and message which this movie does. The story, adventure, and graphics are outstanding and definitely want to see it again. The tale is a classic good vs. evil but for me it also makes the point that people are not all good or all evil. Everyone has good and evil inside them. The most important thing is to realize when you are committing evil acts and ask for forgiveness from the person that your wronged. And as the person wronged forgive others who wrong you. The Edmund and Mr. Thomnus characters speak volumes about being a character with a mixture of good and evil. <br/><br/>My only negative comment on the movie is it could have used more character development. I realize the challenge in this with so many characters while keeping the movie to 2 1/2 hours. I am sure one of my personal heroes, CS Lewis, would be proud especially how it speaks of the Christian message without clobbering you over the head with it."

I wish that that the tie with Aslan the Lion could have been developed more thoroughly before the emotional scenes at the end. <br/><br/>Still, the film is wonderfully done and I can hardly wait for it to be released on DVD so I can own it."

You feel like you are beholding real fauns and centaurs. The actors were perfectly cast, especially little Georgia Henly as Lucy and James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. In the end you are left wanting more and Disney appears to have left the wardrobe door open for a 2nd visit to Narnia. A dream journey, I will await once again with great anticipation. In the meantime, I will just have to go see The Chronicles of Narnia a 2nd and 3rd time. Bravo to Disney Exec's for choosing these books for film development.

","A brilliant performance and adaptation of the novel. The casting seemed to be perfect and the scenes were fantastically visualised, and executed. Even the light hearted humour from the Beavers, was vastly appropriately and fitted well into the believable land of Narnia.<br/><br/>The CGI was fantastically fitting to it's surroundings, it did not feel like they had blown the entire budget on trying to impress the audience was tricks and effects which, happens in so many other movies. Every aspect seemed to be considered equally and carefully. (Although there was a cheetah at the end with glasses drawn on his face...mistake?)<br/><br/>Never before have I felt the emotion which drives this story, from the start to the end (even although I knew the story well) I felt an emotional understanding with all the characters.

So naturally, I went in with very lofty expectations and a ""show me"" attitude. I am more than happy to say that this film surpassed any and all expectations I had really does C.S. Lewis' work justice. Everything right down to the scenery was perfect and the acting was spot on. Only a few really *minor* issues with one or two of the outdoor scenes looking painfully obvious as being shot with a blue screen and matte paintings, but other than that, this film was excellent and I would gladly pay a good amount of money to see it again.<br/><br/>Also, stay for the credits..."

"classyunv02","10","6","8","9 December 2005"," missed parts/extra parts
","So for those of you who read the book you know that there are extra parts and a little bit of missing ones..<br/><br/>I thought the transition from book to movie was pretty good. I was waiting for a big let down, but it was close enough for me. I personally would have loved to see the giant get the handkerchief from Lucy, or Mr. and Mrs. Beaver put on their snow boots. But I also loved some of the extra scenes.. like when the children are in London. I feel bad for some of the people who didn't read the book though, they really are missing out. And like always the book is better then the movie, but this movie was pretty good. :)"
"celo_cattus","10","6","8","8 December 2005"," Not just the best movie of the year but the best film all round..
","Let me start off by saying I'm a fantasy geek; I love the Harry Potter films and the Lord of the Rings films and was very excited when I heard Narnia was being made. Because of this excitement I was a bit sceptical about going in and being disappointed when I came out. I wasn't; I was surprised it exceeded my wild excitement. <br/><br/>The CGI is fantastic; much, much better then how it looks in the trailer. I forgot all about Aslan being CGI and he really became the Aslan you see in the book; and as if it couldn't get better Liam Neeson does a kick-ass job as his voice too. The four children were fantastic, much better then the usual fare of confused kiddies that are awed at but not applauded at. Skander was the best as Edmund I thought but Lucy was excellent too. They all did a brilliant job though and so did all the other actors (Tilda Swinton deserves an honourable mention for embodying the White Witch in all her evil glory). <br/><br/>The story flows really well and even if your a die-hard books fan you won't be disappointed. The only niggle was the part about the children being a lot more important then Aslan but it doesn't throw it in your face and Aslan is still a figure of much respect and awe.<br/><br/>The religious undertones are there and are as present as they are in the book; many Christians will find the Stone Table scene very heartbreaking as I did and its easily the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The music is sensational. I loved the Lord of the Rings soundtrack but this is much much better and different. Its all down to taste in the end but I found it more to my liking. The music at the start with the train is especially beautiful.<br/><br/>What else can I say? The beavers were a definite highlight for me being both funny and serious; the fox also was an excellent addition although he wasn't very present in the book but he fits in very well with the story and makes sense. The wolves had the best CGI, next to Aslan, and though Maugrim was menacing you will probably find yourself awing at them despite them being villains. If I had to put in any bad points it would be that some parts are a little odd; for instance the scene after Aslan pounces on the White Witch made me think Peter was having an acid trip of some kind and the White Witch's dwarf also said the strangest things which will probably have you wondering if you heard him right. These don't distract from the viewing though and the Dwarf's weirdness is actually quite funny at times. First Class film and definitely one I will be re-watching for years to come."

","Congratulations to Andrew Adamson and his entire cast and crew! 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a marvellous film, managing to be that rare thing - a movie which remains faithful to the book, realising the story with wonderful visuals and imbuing the film with real spirit.<br/><br/>Based on children's books, the movie is a children's movie, (albeit fairly scary in parts!) yet all the story elements remain in place, with no dumbing down and little of the added sentimentality which so often chokes children's movies into cloying sweetness.<br/><br/>The sets and scenery are magical, the children very well cast, the White Witch chillingly evil, and the animals and creatures which populate Narnia imaginatively rendered, including the majestic Aslan. Adamson has injected a sense of humour and a fresh look into an extremely well done adaptation, and created a film which will thrill both devoted fans and those new to Narnia.<br/><br/>Loved it!"
"shojun","10","6","8","8 December 2005"," Visually spectacular
","I have just returned from the midnight session of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"". I read the books in 1991, so I could remember there being some wardrobe, and a lion or something, so wasn't sure how I'd find it. But turns out the memory is a great thing, and seeing, say, the lamppost, would instantly bring back the memories of the story. There will surely be many comparisons made between it and Lord of the Rings, and it's a shame that it comes out in the same week as King Kong, because it is a visually spectacular film with a compelling story that they've kept true to from the books, but is being overshadowed by the massive publicity surrounding the great ape. The animals created in the movie are incredible, especially the wolves, and while it is certainly more of a family-oriented movie than the LOTR movies, there were so many scenes where I wish I could have freeze-framed and just looked at all that was there - every scene was so detailed. Don't miss this one, plus you get to play spot-the-New-Zealand-landscape again :)"

","I really enjoyed watching this movie, as did my daughter. While she has not read the book, many kids there had. It was great watching a movie that had both been read and enjoyed by most of the children and parents alike. I overheard one kid telling their parents, I don't remember that part in the book, I think they added it for the movie. It was neat to hear both of the parents say, oh yes it was, I remember that. While the story line itself captured the attention of most of the children, I know that along with the story, the special effects captured that of the adults. They were excellent. At the end of the movie, the parents were saying, that was a cool movie. I will say that some of the younger children seemed to get a bit antsy during the movie, as it may have been a bit too much for them. But there were few. I personally, can't wait to buy it. Disney did the book great justice and then some. It is a must see for everyone."

","I've never read the books but after this movie I'm ready to take a trip to the bookstore. It did feel surprisingly rushed though and I hope this is at least a trilogy from the way they ended it which was also a bit confusing for the audience. There were some questions that hopefully will be better explained in the books. The main being the ending seen of all the kids grown up then going through the wardrobe again as children. Action packed and heart warming. Teaches us the importance of family, friendship, and not being in such a rush to grow up and stop believing in the unbelievable. Over all a high 10 out of 10."

And just what the heck is this Narnia place anyway, other than a magic land with talking animals? I read the books as a kid and liked them. I don't remember them being as stupid as this movie.

","After seeing the movie today I must say it is the closest to keeping to a book I have ever seen on screen!

At times the CGI did seem a tad overwhelming, but it is great CGI in most parts of the movie. It is a amazing movie though and Families and Children should all enjoy it. I really enjoyed the acting of Mr.Tumnus, The Professor, Lucy, The Witch. Aslan looked and sounded great to me. Do not expect any blood in the Film. so it should be a huge family hit. The story keeps its Christian allegory so no worries there. Tilda should get some kind of award. I just did not think it looked 150 million...more like 90 million. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.

This movie contains humor for both parents and children and it is a movie you will enjoy. The best part of the movie was the scenery. It was just absolutely gorgeous and took your breath away. The characters were so real to life, and the situations the children encounter were realistic and you could really empathize with the movie which you do not get in a movie like Harry Potter. Although Harry Potter is a wonderful movie, not all people can identify with Harry and the other characters with the situations they face. With The Chronicles of Narnia, you can empathize and understand someone not believing you, or also for those who were in World War II, the experience during that time. Overall, this movie is a must see and highly recommend it."
"long-ford","Null","7","10","9 January 2009"," excellent filmization of CS Lewis's novel
","The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable filmization of CS Lewis's magical childhood epic. The story expertly weaves in childhood themes with a modern day Christian plot line (including a slightly grisly 'crucifiction' scene) to create an enchanting motion picture. Tilda Swinton is superb as the sinister White Witch. The children are average though young Georgie Henly stands out. The Special effects are more than adequate, with a specially impressive rendering of Aslan. The film moves slowly initially and its epic nature become apparent only towards the end with a vicious (but bloodless) final battle. All told, a pleasant surprise indeed! <br/><br/>Overall 8/10"
"Chris Knipp","8","7","10","29 December 2005"," No disappointments here
","C.S. Lewis encouraged his friend Tolkien with his imaginative writing, but the favor was not returned. As his elaborate system in Lord of the Rings shows, Tolkien obviously liked to create a world that was an internally closed system. He didn't like the way Lewis worked in whatever familiar customs or myths fell to hand. Narnia most notably incorporates central aspects of Christianity; it's also a world where the children the stories are for enter the story, just as Lewis Carroll's pet child Alice Liddell enters his fantasy world in Through the Looking-Glass  in Narnia's case, obviously, through a wardrobe. Lewis's and Carroll's books also have in common talking animals, though the Narnia ones aren't as droll and crazy as the mathematician's. But Narnia is a wonderful story for children, because it has children who are real, but who become heroes.<br/><br/>The first Narnia movie, directed by New Zealand visual effects and Shrek man Andrew Adamson, is perfect in its way. It's almost too perfect: you may wish somebody or something would stand out more. Maybe Tilda Swinton stands out a bit. Unless you recognize Jim Broadbent behind all his whiskers and makeup, Swinton is the only known actor we actually see on screen (Liam Neeson's voice is all too recognizable but it's attached to the Christlike lion, Aslan). Swinton blends in too, though. She's so sure and discreet  and so familiar these days as a wicked sprite (cp. her role in Constantine), even her presence may seem routine. She's even perfectly attired in changing outtits for each scene or season to help her blend in. But she deserves credit, as usual, for her integrity. She plays her role with absolute seriousness and poise. There's no cuteness about it.<br/><br/>The children, Georgie Henley as Lucy, Skandar Keynes as Edmund, William Moseley as Peter, and Susan Prevensie as Anna Popplewell, a most carefully chosen quartet, are charming, distinctive, and very good actors. Somehow the boys seem to carry the action, while the girls carry the feeling.<br/><br/>The movie is like a big beautiful toy box. The children and the animals come out and do their things, the white witch has her great battle with the forces of Aslan, and then they go away and we feel cozy and satisfied like a child who's been read to in bed and dozes off, dreaming of snow in a warm room.<br/><br/>Like the classic Conrad Aiken short story ""Silent Snow, Secret Snow,"" the winter world of Narnia may grow out of a child's sense that snow is magical and unreal, beautiful but perilous. The snowy landscape of the film is enveloping and lovely, and it doesn't matter if it's real or not.<br/><br/>People may take Aslan, the lion of God, differently, but nobody in his right mind can avoid the fact that what happens to him makes him like Christ and his slaughter like the Crucifixion, and his rising back to life off a big slab of stone that cracks like the Resurrection. And the two girls mourning over his body are the two Marys. And young Peter, the King and leader of the army of the good, is St. Peter, the founder of Christ's Church. C.S. Lewis was an adult convert whose enthusiasm for Christianity was so great he had to tell. But one can see Tolkien's point. This is what stands out: the Christian symbolism walks away with the story and spoils it a bit; Tolkien had a point.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's that, seeing all these symbols in a movie simplified, reduced to music and visuals and the voice of Liam Neeson, no longer working solely through the supple language of C. S. Lewis, robs them of some of their original literary mystery and resonance. Once again the adaptation of a book into a film, while making it lovely and vivid for us, has diminished something that in words is accessible to all, more subtle and complex.<br/><br/>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonder, a delightful film, but it hasn't the visual richness of Lord of the Rings, nor has the story the complexity of Tolkien's elaborate mythology, or its immense variety, its real magic  though with the Harry Potter series running dry, it looks fresh. It's bright and shiny, like a Christmas tree ornament. It's a huge project nonetheless, as you see when you watch the credits of Narnia roll. Like Kill Bill's they go on so long the audience is long gone and the cleanup crew is well on its way to getting all the pop cups and corn bags and wrappers gathered up and the floor swept before the names have stopped scrolling. There are complete crews for Los Angeles, Czechoslovakia, Poland, New Zealand, Guatemala, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and special effects people for each location. I wonder what an Oxford don would have made of all that.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is the best androgynous sprite ever, but it's time (here's a plug for the small project) for her to do more roles like the needy mother in Mike Mills's Thumbsucker. She may have taken home a smaller paycheck, but she delivered way more humanity. As for the great battles in The Chronicles of Narnia, they fade quickly from the mind. Better than anything else are the tender early scenes between Mr. Tumnus, the fawn (James McAvoy), and young Lucy. Those who know the book much better than I do tend to say the first part of it is the best. The battle of good and evil may be too much to take in on first viewing, and may sink in when the other parts come out. This is not a great film, but it's impeccable. And the early scenes will stay in the mind a long time. _________________"

I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.<br/><br/>This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.<br/><br/>In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.<br/><br/>Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.<br/><br/>But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.<br/><br/>A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth."
"PeteRose","1","29","56","26 February 2007"," Terrible
","I was really looking forward to this film, considering I was a big fan of the book series as well as a huge fan of the original BBC production. So after seeing ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)"" I was more than a little disappointed.<br/><br/>This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, especially on the part of the two eldest children. I usually love Tilda Swinton, yet I was severely disappointed with her lackluster performance as the White Witch. The pacing of this film is the worst part. The entire movie is extremely rushed in order to reach a major epic battle scene that in the book was a mere afterthought. Though there are a few elements of war and violence, that is not what the story is about. While some of the computer generated effects look okay, most of them are way overdone and instead of serving the story, they overpower it. I'm not a book purist or anything, so I don't mind if a story is changed in order to fit more appropriately on screen, but I do have an issue with filmmakers creating entire sequences that do not appear in the book solely to showcase their supposedly superior computer effects especially when these sequences do nothing to advance the plot.<br/><br/>This movie is bad. Plain and simple, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Not good, not even for children.<br/><br/>Check out the 1988 BBC production and its sequels instead. While they may lack something visually, the story is much richer and more worthwhile."

","So disappointing! I read this book as a child and I cherished every word of it. But the movie misses totally the magic that C.S. Lewis had in mind. There are a couple of nice touches at the beginning -- the eye opening shots of German bombers approaching the city, and the photograph of the father that Edmund tries to preserve. And a great song from the period, ""Oh! Johnny"" just as the magic is starting up.<br/><br/>But the film makers just have no stomach for a real story arc for Edmund. They miss the central theme of sin and redemption. How can you have him saved if he can't be dark and nasty at the beginning? I can't believe how wimpy the film is, almost white washing Edmund, like he is in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's not his fault, and so forth. The Turkish Delight scene falls flat -- no sense of temptation, addiction, compulsion, just Edmund sort of flirting with a nice looking lady and walking off on his own power. And so many silly and pointless touches, like the dwarf jumping him with a knife, like a teen age delinquent in a James Dean movie! Now I want to say there are some nice performances -- Georgie Hensley is PERFECT as Lucy -- her reactions are always breath taking and magical. I wish I could see the movie she was ""reacting"" to -- you have to hand it to her for her innocence and freshness. And she and James McAvoy have totally natural chemistry -- the only thing the movie got right. And the young girl who plays Susan is perfectly cast, and going to be a real beauty in a couple of years. It's a shame the script makes her look like more of a whiner than Edmund! Whose bright idea was that? But all of that pales into insignificance compared to the bad battle scenes. My gosh, I have never seen a battle scene I didn't like -- till today. I can't believe how BORING this battle is. No sense of plans, or courage, or even coherent objectives. Animals we don't know running around in circles, fighting generic looking creepy crawlies, while the White Witch pouts and poses like a high fashion model! (You know it's bad when she's hotter than the battle raging all around her.) I thought Tilda Swinton made a lovely White Witch -- but she's badly lit in a lot of key scenes and seems pointlessly silly at times. (""Do you know what -- he betrayed you! For sweeties!"") All in all, this movie just wanders around, as if afraid to come down to brass tacks on who these children really are, and what they really suffer and what they learn.<br/><br/>If there was a Christian agenda, it was bungled so badly that no one should be offended. And maybe that was just the point!"

","What can I say ? I love the story since I was a child, a teen and when I become a man. If the director doesn't blow it, there are no reason for me to say that this movie is one of the best that I saw. And it is !!! The acting is superb, especially Lucy ( Georgie), WW ( Tilda ) , Tumnus ( McAvoy ). The others were just fine, but this 3 did a amazing job, they had enter the wardrobe for sure. The editing was amazing, the score is perfect, the landscape are just as I imagine, the figurine, make-up, everything!!! But, what really is out of this world is the visual-effects, WOW, Aslan is a real Lion talking, Mr and Mrs Beaver are great, centaurs, gryphon's, minotaur, all creatures are amazing. No more words for this. This movie had a profound meaning and a lesson that we should take for the rest of our lives. This is not a Harry Potter or a Lord of the Rings ( My favorite movie of all time by the way ) , this is Narnia. About the allegories and stuff, the movie will be what you want it to be, if you see Aslan as Jesus, fine, but this is a simple story about helping each other, courage and thrust in what you believe."

","Adam Adamson's film adaptation of C. S. Lewis' first entry in his classic Narnia Series starts off awkwardly like a combination of the ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""Lord of the Rings."" The filmmakers spend too much time early on trying to be cute and Disney-fy the product while clumsily presenting scenes composed of live-action actors and not-so-great computer effects. The result, not surprisingly is like an animated film with some flesh-and-blood actors spliced in. However, once you get used to the film stylistically, all is mostly forgiven.<br/><br/>The filmmakers finally find solid ground when they really start to dig deeply into the story and reveal the blending of nature-based neo-paganism with medieval Christian mythology and wrap it up nicely into a children's fairytale. It's when you start to realize the white witch (played effectively by the always somewhat creepy Tilda Swinton) represents the old pre-Abraham polytheism demanding animal and human sacrifice for appeasing the pantheon of gods/goddesses and the lion king, Aslan, represents the Christian view of one self-sacrificing god that you remember the brilliance of Lewis' source material. And while it isn't terribly well executed, the epic ""Battle-Beast"" style showdown at the end is pretty entertaining from a visual and imaginative standpoint."

I also recommend tissues as there are some very upsetting moments Husbands and Boyfriends beware if you take your Girlfried or Wivies and Young Children they will cry.

","I have never read the book at all, so was completely unaware of the plot line etc. However, I was captivated by the story and the production itself. I thought all the cast acted superbly from youngest to the old professor. I liked the adventure, the humour and the scale of it. Great film, no wonder it is doing great business. I thought the young actors really seemed like a family, with typical sibling rivalries and interaction. THis was a great help in believing that Edmund would go off with the White Witch, having been annoyed by his brother especially. I loved the beavers humour, that gentle ribbing of one spouse to another. I thought the production design was great, with that medieval look to the tents, the armour etc. The terror of Aslan's sacrifice and death was a surprise and I though it was well handled. I am looking forward to the making of Prince Caspian - and I might get around to reading the books - or will that spoil my enjoyment of the next film - a good question!"

The visions I saw on the screen were very similar to those in my head as I was reading the book. The use of colors was wonderful, and the battle scenes were outstanding.

","My kids and I went to see Narnia on the first day and were hopeful that Narnia would be as good at being Narnia as Lord Of The Rings was at being Lord Of The Rings. We had read both series of books to our four children prior to them seeing the movies. My kids were very disappointed with the late '80's BBC, low-budget adaptation. The depth and humor that C.S. Lewis brilliantly added to the characters--with which my children desperately wanted to identify with was missing from the BBC film--but not from Adamson's (Disney's) version. <br/><br/>What a pleasure to watch a 2+hour movie with all my kids and not have to take anyone to the restroom! No one was fidgety or bored. The characterizations were exactly what my kids were hoping for--they were as depicted in the books. From my teenager to my three year old, all were sad when the final credits came and they were immediately ready for the next Narnia picture...and to think this devotion was founded without excessive blood, nudity, violence, cussing or adult situations."
"MovieManMenzel","9","4","5","9 January 2006"," ""Narnia"" is a beautiful and amazing Hollywood Blockbuster.
","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe"" is about four children who are sent away to live with a professor because of a war going on in London. Once at the professor's house, Lucy (Georgia Henley) suggests that they play hide and seek. Lucy runs into a room which contains nothing but a wardrobe closet. Out of curiosity, Lucy opens the wardrobe closet and discovers that this closet leads to the world of Narnia.<br/><br/>When ""Narnia"" first began I will admit I felt quite bored but it wasn't long before I got involved with the story and the beautiful set designs and locations. I also must admit, I have never read this book before yet I was very well aware that it was based on a very popular series of books. As a film, ""Narnia"" really impressed me especially for a Hollywood Blockbuster. What I liked most about the film was how beautiful it was! The director Andrew Adamson really captured the beauty of the set designs and filming locations.<br/><br/>Normally I feel special effects lately are so over used. The last ""Star Wars"" and ""King Kong"" are both perfect examples of how special effects are used to much and actually make a film lag because of it. ""Narnia"" on the other hand used special effects but used them wisely. I also think that the special effects in this film looked more realistic then ""Kong"" and I think they added more to the story. The entire battle scene was captured brilliantly.<br/><br/>The acting was very good in this film. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch and played the bad character like the role was tailor made for her. The children in the film Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) all did fantastic jobs. Not to mention, Liam Neesen who voiced Aslan the lion. Liam really brought the lion to life. Good job all around.<br/><br/>I can't comment much on the writing since it was based on a book and since I never read the book, I can't say whether or not the screenplay was loyal to it. However as a normal Hollywood ""Big Budget"" Blockbuster, I will say that I thought the script was very well done especially when building the story and character development. As I mentioned earlier the director behind ""Narnia"" is Andrew Adamson who was also the director of both ""Shrek"" films. He did a great job directing and capturing all the beauty and emotion of the film.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a near perfect big budget Hollywood film. I for one really enjoyed the film and now can not wait for the sequels. I enjoyed this film as much as I enjoyed the last ""Harry Potter"" film and I think the reason is because it seems like a grown-up type of movie that some kids can enjoy too. The violence in ""Narnia"" probably keeps some parents away from taking their kids to it but I think that's a good thing. This movie is definitely one of the most beautiful films I have seen all year and on top of it is probably one of the best blockbusters I have seen as well. I recommend this movie to all who enjoy fantasy films or well made Hollywood blockbusters.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a 9/10. Definitely one of the best big Hollywood blockbusters I have seen in the last couple of years."
"dstarrboston","10","4","5","9 January 2006"," Excellent movie
","A very satisfying movie. I read the book as a child, read it aloud to my children, and finally went to see it. The movie is a wonderful rendition of the book. The casting is right, the scenery is right, the costumes and dialog are right. The Talking Animals look right and sound right. Nearly all the scenes from the book are there with most of the C.S. Lewis dialog. <br/><br/>There has been some talk about the Christian messages buried in the original text. They are still there in the movie, at the same level of intensity as in the original book. The intensity is so low that as a child I never even noticed the messages as I read the book. Rereading it as an adult, the message is plain to see, but not obtrusive. Neither Lewis nor the movie become preachy, it is a good, exciting, and well told action adventure movie. It comes out right in the end. If you liked the book go see it. If you never heard of the book, go see it anyhow."
"kidhasaces","10","4","5","9 January 2006"," My take on Narnia
","I have been looking at the ratings for this movie for the past few weeks and as much as I wanted to see this movie I didn't get a chance until today. The ratings were decent so I was expecting a decent movie but I didn't get a decent movie, I actually think that this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>I think the rating doesn't pay its respects to this awesome movie. I haven't read any of the books therefore I can't compare both although for someone who has never read these books I must say I was shocked on how beautiful this entire adventure was. I seriously can't remember the last time where I have been at the movies and haven't at least once looked at the time during the movie or left the theater with an ""awww"" feeling about it. I actually felt like I wanted to take part of this amazing adventure.<br/><br/>I got to the movies about twice a week and after watching King Kong I fought it would be impossible to beat but Narnia did that simply for the story and the point of the movie.The effects were well done, the characters were true and so realistic which is what made this movie incredible.<br/><br/>I would vote in 10 on 10 because not once did I ever have a negative comment which is rare in my case :) What I like about this movie it completely removed any worries in my mind, made me think of my youth and how imagination can be at times.<br/><br/>I think that this movie is great for all groups of ages because no matter what we all have youth in us and I truly believe you will at least enjoy this! Enjoy"
"MelyssaRave","8","4","5","7 January 2006"," Amazing,
","I wasn't expecting the movie to open up with as much excitement as it did. The bombers destroying England were spectacularly done. Within the first 5 minutes the characterization of Edward starts. We see him risk his life and Peter's life as they run back into the house to get a picture. The first time Lucy set foot in Narnia was breathtaking. James MacAvoy was a great Mr Tummus. In my opinion the best casting decision was to cast Tilda Swinton as Jadis. For someone who grew up on the books I was able to see things my younger sister couldn't - like the ties between Lion and Nephew like what wood made the wardrobe and how the lamp post got in Narnia. My favorite part was at the end. When Lucy tried to get back to Narnia after all her adventures and the Professor said ""You can't get back that way. Believe me, I've tried."" (Or something along the lines of that). That one line left them so much room to do the prequel."
"tomcat91468","9","4","5","7 January 2006"," Through a child's eyes
","I liked it. I liked the Christian analogy. I liked the symbolism and the message of redemption. It was entertaining and the performances, direction and special effects were excellent. Enough said about that. The movie, Narnia, held my attention as a Grandma; however, I was a little concerned whether my 7 year old Granddaughter would be able to hang in through the long hours. I was also concerned that some of the scarier parts would be frightening to her. Well, she hung in and wasn't particularly scared except when the (I'm trying to avoid a spoiler) lion was put on the stone. It's not for a child younger than 7 and it's not for every 7 year old. I did think the conversation that came afterward was a beneficial one. Explaining why this movie was an analogy to Christianity was a good opening to a discussion about always trying to do one's best and how God's forgiveness is always there for us."
"farraak","10","4","5","6 January 2006"," Excellent movie that shouldn't be lumped into any category
","I've read the book and I had a clear remembrance of the BBC version of this story before going into the theater to see this film. I was ready to be disappointed. I kept hearing on the news and reading about how this is such a strong Christian allegory. I am rather angry that this movie was marketed only as that. First and foremost, it is a wonderful story of childhood adventures and growing up in a wonderful fantastical series of events. I am a Christian and I've known CS Lewis was a great Christian writer, and yes, the events in this movie may mirror that of Christian beliefs, but, it should not be called a Christian movie. I believe that this film has been done an injustice by telling people it is a Christian movie. It limits its audience and its capacity to inspire outside of the (sometimes rather closed minded) realm of Christianity. It is a work of art written for children. My eight year old kid brother does not grasp the Christian allegory and I don't think that he needs to right now. He loved the movie and the book. He likes Lucy because she is adventurous, he relates well with Edmund and he sees Peter as a role model. I've found him standing on his bed holding a play sword and pretending to fight in the great battle just like Peter. He sees courage in these children and relates to them. That is what this movie is about! Inspiration to overcome fear and see what you are really capable of! The Christian allegory is one event in this movie, and yes, it is moving as it reminds us all about Jesus, and I don't want to belittle that, but the people this movie will most effect are the kids. If you go to see this movie, take in the full scope of the story and don't focus alone on the Christian side. Every aspect of this film is filled with uplifting messages and they should not be missed while you are focused on the allegory. The acting is amazing, the set design is beautiful. The story stands alone as a marvelous example of hope and courage. See it for the enjoyment of a great story! Not for your religion."
"smood47","10","4","5","2 January 2006"," A fantastic tale deserves a fantastic movie
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (LWW) may superficially appear to be another youth inspired romp through arbitrary, meaningless and random prototypical fantasy elements (eg. Harry potter) but is instead an incredible realization of an incredible tale.<br/><br/>LWW succeeds in so many ways that its overall quality as a fantasy epic in the vein of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the classic Lord of the Rings is thoroughly apparent.<br/><br/>Acting in the picture is tremendous and little if not none of the acting can be faulted for being unauthentic. The voice of the King Aslan done by Liam Neeson in conjunction with likely the best computer graphics effects today (surpassing even the convincing Gollum of the Lord of the Rings) stands as one of the high achievements of the films character portrayal. Susan Pevensie also masterfully plays an intelligent yet worried girl who throughout the film transforms into a young woman of courage. The actors chosen for the various roles seem perfect for their respective roles and in this case the White Witch played by Tilda Swinton is a unique yet powerful choice that justifies the peril of Narnia and its 100 year winter.<br/><br/>The landscapes are beautiful and appropriate while all the while being believable. The majority of the movie was filmed in New Zealand much like the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy and so the incredible scenery of the country shine through the movie and are heavily exploited in constructing the incredible scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>The music used during the films (as opposed to the credits) is comparable to the tremendous work of Howard Shore in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Harry Gregson-Williams does a tremendous job in constructing an atypical score of beautiful singing and moving orchestral pieces whose excellence is reflected in its ability to complement the non-musical aspects of the movie without overtly standing out. In fact it is not until the soundtrack is heard independently of the movie that one realizes the strength and quality of the musical complement of LWW; such a scenario is ideal. Epic yet unusual is a notion that may be used in describing the score of the LWW.<br/><br/>The visual special effects of the movie are so moving and incredible that labeling them as effects does not justify there reality. LWW commands 'special effects' no longer be weighed independently of the heart of film but instead an integral and in the case of LWW an additive component of the story. Creatures such as King Aslan and both mythical and non-mythical beings bring the movie alive and allow the fantastic nature of the CS. Lewis tale to be genuinely visually explored. Moreover real-life actors interact with computer graphically created characters flawlessly and further cement their reality and film existence.<br/><br/>The only drawback to the film will be if it isn't followed by a sequel from the CS. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia series. A tremendous film for any fantasy enthusiast and casual movie-goer alike. The greatness of the film is likely to make a strong impact on the majority who enjoy it and permeate the mind only to expand one's imagination."

","I have no words to describe it. Actually I left the movie theater a bit dizzy. That movie was one of the best ever made. It's just a pity that not everybody understands the meaning of it all. It's a big metaphor about the story that's in the largest treasure of all: the Creator's Word (commonly known as 'Bible'). I could see it through all the movie. When the Pevensies come to Narnia, it's enslaved by the white witch. It represents the world, enslaved by the devil. Aslan represents The Creator. We can see temptation, the fall of the human race, betrayal, and then come forgiveness (to Edmund, meaning to all of us), love, sacrifice (representing the sacrifice The Lord Jesus made for all of us, taking all our faults over Himself), the resurrection and how The Lord had victory in the battle against death and hell (before the sacrifice, it even shows Aslan walking alone and sad in the garden, like The Lord in the garden of Getsemani), the battle between angels and demons (it's interesting because they were all the same creatures in the beginning, but some of them surrendered to the witch), the breath of life (when Aslan breathes over the dead creatures and bring them back to life, the river that comes from the throne of the King, and etc etc etc. It's wonderful how The Lord can use anything He wants to spread the message of His Gospel. Even something like Disney. I hope this comment will help people to understand and enjoy the real meaning of that movie. C.S. Lewis was a blessed man indeed."

"Mr_PCM","8","4","5","2 January 2006"," Simply magical
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an enchanting tale of magical creatures and places, a battle of good and evil, and of four children coming to terms with both being in a strange new land and their great importance to it. Originally a children's book, there is much for both younger and older viewers to enjoy.<br/><br/>Like many English fans, I grew up with the old BBC television series, which was corny, hammy and wooden in the extreme, yet ultimately endearing and magical. Sunday nights were never the same after it finished. So it was with a slight sense of trepidation that I went to see this sacrilegious new version of one of my favourite books as a child. As it turns out, I needn't have worried, for director Andrew Adamson has blown the Beeb's version out of the water – as was expected by most. While most obviously the film benefits from a mega-budget the BBC could only dream of, the acting of the young leads is also superior. Here, Lucy (Georgia Henley) is even more wide-eyed and innocent, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) even more of a snotty little so-and-so, and Susan (Anna Popplewell) more mother hen-ish and reasoned. But there seems to be also a rather unlikeable quality to Popplewell's Susan; she seems much whinier than many fans will remember from the books – and it is supposed to be Edmund who is the unlikeable one. The best acting of the four however comes from the eldest; William Moseley's Peter here is less assuming or decisive. While he still takes great care of his siblings, the oldest Pevensie is portrayed by Moseley as being a more reluctant hero, taking more seriously his duty to his brother and sisters than that of saviour and King of Narnia – adding previously unseen depth to the character. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the voice of Aslan; his regal, dulcet tones perfectly fitting for the magnificent lion. But the show stealer is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Many have complained about her hair being blonde rather than black, but that is all that there can possibly be to complain about her performance. Her icy stare and cold demeanour, coupled with a restrained performance (in a role such as this it would be very easy to attempt to echo Barbara Kellerman's over-the-top performance in the TV series) perfectly capture the seductive and later chilling essence of Jadis. Ray Winstone, Dawn French and Rupert Everett provide a (greatly required) slightly lighter side to the film as the voices of Mr and Mrs Beaver, and Fox (a new character). Winstone especially is terrifically funny as the geezer beaver with the cockney accent.<br/><br/>The narrative itself is simple and easy to follow, as befits a film which is primarily a children's story. But still, Adamson handles the action extremely competently, especially considering this is his first live-action film (he is primarily known for directing the Shrek films). Obviously there is a heavy allegorical slant to that of the life of Jesus Christ which some may find distasteful, but if you can get past that then there is a terrific story to enjoy, and visuals for your jaw to truly drop at. One of the most important sequences in the book is when Lucy steps into the wardrobe and emerges into Narnia for the first time. The sheer wonder felt by the young girl at seeing this entire snow-covered world in the back of a piece of furniture in an English country house is shared with the audience. The creatures too are excellent, centaurs and fauns blending seamlessly their human and CGI body parts.<br/><br/>There is a smattering of new material in the film that appeared in neither the book or the TV series that may have die-hard fans spitting feathers, but the added scenes, including a stand-off on a slowly-melting frozen river and a prologue in wartime London, serve to add necessary depth to the characters. The final battle scene is also considerably extended from the two pages it had in C. S. Lewis's book to a battle to nearly rival that of Pelennor Fields (the first of many Rings comparisons).<br/><br/>The score is beautiful; Harry Gregson-Williams has created a musical setting to nearly rival anything produced by Mr Shore. However the lack of anything choral or a stand-out phrasing to serve as a signature for the film means that the soundtrack alone will probably be better suited to background music rather than your full attention. A piece with the drama and power of 'The Bridge of Khazad-Dumb, for example, would have topped off the soundtrack very nicely.<br/><br/>But this is only a minor criticism; Andrew Adamson has created a magical interpretation of the ultimate fantasyland, an accurate translation from page to screen, an exciting and captivating story and enchanting characters. As the original story was rather short, he does not need to get bogged down in detail and can therefore proceed through the film at a brisk pace, picking up speed to reach full throttle in time for the final battle. Although the film is over 2 hours, the time will simply not be noticed.<br/><br/>A useful side-note for cinema-goers – watch through the acting credits for an extra sequence with Lucy and the Professor (an under-used Jim Broadbent – not often you can say that about him!) which may provide teasing hints for the future of the franchise.<br/><br/>Roll on Prince Caspian!"

","Absolutely wonderful! I loved it! Obviously Narnia is portrayed differently than what's in my mind but it was awesome overall! The actors did their parts very well. Go see the movie! It's the best! :D I would've expected Aslan's mane to be more longer to create that gentleness but it's all good. And, the witch's castle was so cool-all that ice and that prison! I loved the part where all four of them are seated on the thrones with Aslan dictating, it was glorious. Oh yeah, the faun, Mr.Tumnus-he was coolio! ;) Great movie!<br/><br/>By the way, I went for the 6:45 show and it was sold out! I had to get in for the 9:30 show and even that one had a huge line and it was packed. I am definitely going to get it on DVD when it comes out. <br/><br/>The website is wicked too. There are games to play, and much more! <br/><br/>Adamson should be happy! This is huge! I love this movie because it has a powerful statement. I wonder what C.S. Lewis would think if he knew what was happening to his books (or at least one of them). But, I do hope they continue the series. But, the sequels shouldn't be a bore. I mean look at all the other series! Most of them get boring after the first one or second. <br/><br/>You know what? I think I had tears in my eyes at places but sssshhh! No one would have seen it because it was dark. :)<br/><br/>Go watch it! It's breath-taking!"
"tnrcooper","10","4","5","26 December 2005"," Rich, generous adaptation of the book
","While I'm not too familiar with the book or the faithfulness of the film to it, I'm told by reliable sources (my sister) that it is faithful in important parts-such as the death of Aslan. I found the film very enjoyable and rewarding. While living in England as a little boy in 1981 or 1982, I saw the original BBC adaptation of the book and was blown away by it. Now I'm very curious as to what it was I saw that so amazed me as a little boy. Perhaps it will appear quite hinky or cheesy now-perhaps not. Be that as it may, this film I found very enjoyable. Adamson, the director of Shrek, uses special effects as they should be used-judiciously. While the effects were sometimes unconvincing-such as one shot in which the children are standing in the foreground with the sky behind them-possibly while the children were walking toward the White Witch's home. <br/><br/>By and large though, I found the film to be an exuberant and lively endorsement of the adaptation of books. The book is such a classic but yet it seems to have been quite happily received. I found the director kept the essence of the story-between good and evil-in focus and this holds the focus of the story quite clearly. Adamson keeps the compelling story front and center and does not get waylaid by the temptation to animate or enliven a film with flashy but ultimately unnecessary special effects. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch deserves an Oscar nomination, in my opinion. She was so effective that one can imagine that she might get hate mail in which her character is confused with her real personality. She seems scary and that is the sign that an actor or actress has fully inhabited a character. One really dislikes her and roots for Aslan and the children. <br/><br/>Ultimately though, I would give immense credit to director Adamson for restraint in the creation of this film. He could have easily submitted to the temptation to enliven the film with special effects but he realized that CS Lewis had already written a book that, if adapted quite honestly, would play powerfully by itself. This is a wonderful and inspiring film."
"phredd8675","10","4","5","26 December 2005"," An Excellent Movie that I would recommend to anyone
","I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. I have read just the one book in the series, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, so I am not too up on the rest of the stories. My wife really wanted to see this one (she has read all the books) and she wanted to take our son, who is almost five, to see it. He also knows the stories from videos. We tend to trade off on what movies we see: one time it will be my turn (sci-fi, horror, mystery) the next it will be hers (chick-flick, etc).<br/><br/>I thought this was an excellent movie, very well made and well acted. The special effects are well above par and I look forward to seeing it again. I will not give anything away regarding what happens, because I hate reading things like that before I go to see a movie. I will say that there are some laugh out loud scenes and some tear jerker scenes.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, see the movie. You won't regret it."
"improvkev5","10","4","5","26 December 2005"," Amazing!
","I have never read the books and I never really knew anything about them either. In October, I saw the play at the Children's Theater, and I fell in love with this amazing story. So, when I saw the previews for the movie, I got really excited. Then, I finally saw it, and I was awestruck. It was AMAZING! The acting, the script, the effects, the overall mood of the movie was breathtaking. I, being an inspiring filmmaker actually got chills as the world of Narnia unraveled itself before my eyes. I knew as I was watching this movie, that I wanted to create the same effect for audiences. This movie is simply magical. Yes, it's a little childish, and yes it resembles some Lord of the Rings themes, but don't go into the movie thinking about those things. If you sit back in that seat and just watch the film, you will be flung into a magical and mythical world from which you will never want to leave. I wanted so bad to be inside of Narnia...I wanted to talk to Aslan...I wanted to fight the White Witch. In the end, that's what movies should do. They should make us WANT. They should make us WANT to be some part of the world that had been created for us. They should make us WANT to help the characters or in some cases hurt them. They should make us WANT to experience the film not just watch it. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe makes me WANT to do all of those things, and most of all it makes me WANT to see it again!"

"Thoger","9","4","5","18 December 2005"," Really really cool!
","Hey yo, Well this is my first comment and i think it is the best if i start with Narnia. I would definitely put this movie as the first in my list after LOTR and HP. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell really play their character really well but the one who stole the spotlight would be of course Georgie Henley. She can really make everyone go ""ooowwwwwww!!!"". In my opinion, this movie is not totally cheeky and childish, in fact there is so much drama and character development in just over two hours time. This would be a really good contender against HP = Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>But there is one thing that really capture my attention about this movie, that is the symbolic of Christianity. It is so clear in this movie that. Even though Narnis doesn't have the evangelism factor, but still it was a good encouragement to most Christian out there. All i could say about this movie is that this is a great movie for everyone who has read the book nor haven't read it yet. Most comment i heard from those who read it says that it doesn't live up till their expectations. In my opinion, what the?! How can anyone thought that what they read is what they will get from the movie. Maybe today's society expectations is to high and demanding than ever before. I think this movie is great and there is no other words too describe this movie anymore.<br/><br/>CATCH THIS MOVIE OR YOU WILL BE SORRY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!"
"codeE","9","4","5","12 December 2005"," Great movie for parents and children.
","I read the book a few times over the years, I saw the cartoon when I was a kid(I don't know why they don't show that anymore!?) then there was the live action version they showed on PBS. All of which were very good and worthy of DVD releases(I'm waiting). Now we have a feature length, big budget, special effects laden version to re-tell this great story. So naturally I was scared that it would get ""the treatment"" and suck, or be just OK. Well to my relief it was everything that I hoped for. The actors were great, the CGI effects were top notch and above all the story came through. My kids and I loved the movie. I was worried for my youngest when it came to the sacrifice part but it was handled well and we made it through with a minimum of tears."
"playersww","9","4","5","12 December 2005"," A fantasy world that is not so dark and dismal
","I entered the theater a little worried. I began reading CS Lewis when I was 12 and I had already read the first book to my 6 year old daughter so the cat was out of the bag on Christian morality in our world of myths of legends (as well as a good dose of pagan nature worship). But I was unsettled by some of the reports on the news about how the Christian right had been targeted by Disney for this film and that it managed to get a PG rating (putting it somewhere in between ""Because of Win Dixie"" and ""Racing Stripes""). So, I feared that my beloved books would be zealously Chistianized for the sake of the massive Evangelical movement in this country and its many many dollars. To my delight, I found the same wonderful level of Chistian sentiment in the film that are in the books. Nothing offensive (to me at least), no dogma, no lectures, no secret Jesus messages beyond the original ones that Lewis included. And as I breathed a sigh of relief that this wasn't another ""Vegi-Tales"" the film washed over me like a bath of fantasy come to life. The mythical creatures were delightful and the world of Narnia was worth saving. And I loved Lucy (but I never felt much for Peter or Susan, not in the film, not in the books).<br/><br/>After having watched The Lord of the Rings many times and even the Harry Potter films way more than I needed to I was beginning to grow weary of the fantasy world that was once wonderful, now a dark and forbidding place filled with evil. Peter Jackson's love affair with Orcs, demons and the Dark Lord is forgivable (because Tolkien was obsessed with it too, although Tolkien also created a Middle Earth that was so beautiful and ancient and amazing that you wanted to go there, to live there, but who would really want to live in Jackson's Middle Earth, full of ghosts and loneliness and decay). But Narnia managed to have the villainy without creating a hopeless world of darkness. Again, it felt like the books. And I didn't miss the blood and the slime that Narnia could have had. For me it was a real success.<br/><br/>Now, let's hope that they are quickly shooting the next few books so that they can catch these kids before they get too old."
"tsbraves","9","4","5","12 December 2005"," LOTR's for the entire family!
","The adaptation of ""Jack"" Lewis' story was extraordinary for a major motion picture. Although a few liberties were taken (like the Fox playing such a big part and no mention of the ""Emperor by the Sea"") all in all it was remarkable. <br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, in my opinion, was the fact that it is so good and yet very family friendly. For example: I have a fellow co-worker who took his 5 year old. His son can never sit through a 90 minute movie let alone one as long as LWW. But with 1/2 hour to go he said to his Dad, ""I got to go potty, but I'll wait."" He was that captured by the film. LWW is of that quality... Lord of the Rings excitement but for every member of the family. Don't miss this flick!<br/><br/>Here's my synopsis:<br/><br/>The acting was very good to excellent. The film visually was stunning. The special effects were very good to excellent. (one or two cgi missteps were noticeable) The Directing was excellent. The adaptation was excellent."

","My fairs of this being a Disney production was that the story would be changed to a point that it would lose the magic for me and my children. To my surprise this was not the case and in fact I was very pleased to see that the movie stuck closely to the book. I understand that Disney was only able to secure the rights to the first of the books and that this was a test to see how true they could be. Given the quality and the faithfulness to the book I expect and hope that this will be the first of the six or seven books. The casting was very good with all the characters holding true to the books. An outstanding performance from the Ice Queen, and Lucy added credibility to the movie. The CGI was of a quality we have all come to expect making it seamless and invisible."

","This movie is AMAZING! I love the books and have read them many times and although it does not go strictly by the book it follows it pretty darn well. The acting is great and the special effects are sensational! Before I saw the movie, I was so scared that they were going to hire kids who could not act, but when I watched the movie I was stunned. They were great and may I say Peter (the oldest boy)was pretty good look-in! Anywho,... not once during the entire movie are you bored. Throughout the movie I was laughing, crying, or gripping my seat. You always want to know what is going to happen next. Go to your local theater and spend 8 bucks, it is worth it. If you only see one movie this year, see The Cronicles of Narnia!"
"JediKMan","10","4","5","11 December 2005"," An excellent film
","All I can say is wow. This movie impressed me beyond my comprehension. Now don't get me wrong, I knew it would be good, but I sure didn't expect it to be exquisite. I went in the theater without knowing a thing about the movie. I had never seen a preview, never read the book, never heard anything about the story, and from the moment the adventure began, I felt just as engrossed as the main characters were. One thing that scared me is all the hype. A lot of times, hype scares me. I mean, everyone was talking about it, putting it up on a pedestal, so I expected mediocrity to be honest, but after seeing it, I felt more satisfied than I ever have about a movie.<br/><br/>The musical score, although not as epic as Lord of The Rings or Star Wars, felt very appropriate. I had never heard of the composer before, and it was a bit of a shocker that Disney chose to use him (Stephen Barton) over a few of their usuals (Klaus Badelt or Brian Benison) I have never read a book by C.S. Lewis, but I definitely caught the references to Christianity in the movie. It was so apparent that even non-Christians that are familiar with the bible in the least bit would pick up on them. I have heard a lot of people claim that Lewis was a Christian, hence the reason there are so many, subtle, and non-subtle references. This film was the first since Lord of the Rings, which grabbed me and took me through the adventure, and immersed me in the world of Narnia. The computer generated graphics, in my opinion, are equal to that of Lord of the Rings, if not better. One main difference from, which I feel appropriate to cite, is the fact that this feels more like a fairy-tale than the Lord of the Ringstrilogy. That definitely isn't a bad thing though. Liam Neeson voiced one of the characters, which added so much to the movie. And for the first time in a long time, a movie almost caused me to cry. It's not necessarily because there are sad parts, but when you get so engrossed, and feel like you are there, it almost makes you emotional. Very, very impressive."

","The Chronicles of Narnia was fantastic! I am a big fantasy book fan. When I read the books, I thought they were wonderfully written, with vivid imagery and made a wonderful story. When I heard that Hollywood was making a movie of it, I as a bit uneasy. I love Harry Potter too, and after I saw the third and fourth movies and saw how they butchered the story, I wasn't sure if I wanted Hollywood to make a movie out of another wonderful fantasy novel. Then I saw the movie. The Chronicles of Narnia movie was the book reincarnate; it was perfect. None of the story was changed too dramatically and there weren't a lot of superfluous additions. Personally, I loved The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe and can't wait for The Horse and His Boy."

","I went to see this movie Yesterday, and well, WOW! Even with the screaming children, cellphones going off in the dark, and overexcited mothers, I was completely drawn into the world of Narnia. For a person who has read the books many times, this movie was as big to me as Harry Potter.<br/><br/>I must say that the Children are the main players in this movie. They capture every emotion, every detail. They EVEN LOOK LIKE EACH OTHER. I also must give a shout out to the boy who played Edmund. In my opinion he was the best outa the entire group. Tilda Swanton as the witch was brilliant. HEr make-up, costumes, and acting was superb. All though I felt as though she wasn't getting the right mood for the witch. In some moment s she was nicer then she should of been.<br/><br/>As for Aslan, well..WOW! They pulled him off without it looking corny of puppet-like. Liam Neeson as Alsan, was a great choice. As well as all the other voice actors. They gave their characters more depth then in the book.<br/><br/>But what I most noticed was the music. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL FOLKS! GO BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! The Narnian music was lyrical, beautiful and heroic. The battle scenes were just that more because of the music.<br/><br/>So, all in all, go see THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. What are u doing on the computer, go see it NOW! You will not be disappointed."
"epic1812","10","4","5","11 December 2005"," Completely Surprised: The best film I've seen so far this year!!
","Okay; to start off I grew up with ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" as a child, and was fascinated by the books and the few made-for-TV adaptation of it. But as I grew up, I completely forgot about them, and how good they were.<br/><br/>So I went and saw the movie tonight on a whim. I wasn't expecting anything great. The trailers made the film look like an over-bloated HP/LOTR knockoff. But what a surprise!!! This film brought back fond memories of my youth. It was nice to see that they didn't butcher the story and dumb the film down (although I think there were a few more action scenes in the film then there were in the book. Haven't read the book in a while, so I can't say for sure).<br/><br/>But what a faithful retailing, and a GREAT film in general. Everything about the film was just fascinating and beautifully captured on film! I can't see how anyone could dislike this movie (unless there the Grinch). And in my opinion; Narnia puts LOTR and HP to shame (oops. Maybe I shouldn't of said that? Lots of hate-mail.)<br/><br/>So yeah; there you have it: 10/10. Bravo to Andrew Adamson and his team.<br/><br/>P.S. What's with all this ""Religious Propaganda"" sh*t I see everywhere on these boards? I didn't even know that the Chronicles had anything to do with Religion in anyway shape or form, I just always found the story fascinating and well told. It's a great movie regardless of how you look at it."
"e_m_k","10","4","5","10 December 2005"," very enjoyable
","Heartwarming, intense - a great story. Some parts were more faithfully captured than others, but this movie has plenty of widespread appeal. There is minimal gore, but enough action. Overall, the kid acting wasn't bad, and Tilda Swinton was truly spectacular as the White Witch. At times the story seemed to jump ahead without much explanation, but so does the book. Also, the movie jumps ahead at many of the same places that the book does - but provides more back-story at others. Aesthetically very pleasing, although perhaps not as technically polished as something like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. On the other hand, it was nice that the movie didn't rely much on sweeping visuals. The visual effects were there when needed. Great sound, great soundtrack. Few complaints if any. I think that if anything people might be turned off by the fact that holding to the book also causes the movie to seem kind of anachronistic sometimes. But it was nice not to see the movie suffer because of a need to be updated for contemporary American culture or anything like that. I personally would have appreciated more realistic violence, but I think that this qualifies as a family film, so it works."
"cshighland","10","4","5","10 December 2005"," Brilliant! Absolutely Brilliant!
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe has been my favorite book since early childhood. This adaptation is true to the book and brings Narnia to life stunningly! There are very few deviations from Lewis's text - and those that are present simply move the story along more smoothly. Only uber-fans of the book will even notice the slight deviations. (I said, ""Hey, that line isn't quite right..."" It's that level of minor detail changed!) <br/><br/>Using technology invented for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the crew of this film created all the amazing characters and events of the book in a most realistic fashion. My husband, Mr. Picky, thought a few of the backgrounds were too CG'ed, but I wasn't even aware of the effects - a sign of a very well-done CG film! The battle scenes were spectacular, and reminiscent of those in Braveheart, though with far less gore. (Note to parents: Be familiar with the book/story before bringing very young children. There be monsters herein, as well as battles and deaths...but nothing too gory. Just know what your kid can take!) <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to any fan of fantasy... Lord of the Rings fans and Harry Potter fans will NOT be disappointed. To Narnia fans, you absolutely MUST SEE THIS FILM! I know we plan to see it a few more times ourselves and we already plan to add this to our DVD collection the minute it comes out! 4 stars!"

This is a wonderful film, beautifully told and phenomenally illustrated! One of the best films of the year, easily and in my personal top 2. Georgie Henley as Lucy pulls off the best child acting performance since Dakota Fanning in I Am Sam. Watching her eyes light up as she sees things tells so much, even when what she is looking at is probably a CGI green screen. This film is an instant classic and a masterpiece sure to go down in history. For a children's tale, the battle scene is a little graphic and some of the creatures look like they are right out of Lord Of The Rings! Therefore, I highly recommend this film to anyone ages 13+. It contains a wonderful story and a strong message of family, forgiveness, sacrifice and salvation. A+"

This movie contains really tense moments. (Not spoiling, because every good movie has them.) The movie is a PG because no matter how much slicing or stabbing, the is no blood. Unlike the Lord of the Rings. But this looks quite like LOTR in many respects. And if you watch this movie, you'll see what I mean. I went and saw this movie today and it is long but a lot of it is fresh in my mind. It was a really great movie. Very sad, very happy and some bits are quite scary.

Congratulations to Adamson in bringing this master piece to the screen. Also hats off to the children actors who did a wonderful job portraying the Pevensies, especially Georgia Henley. I give this movie a 9/10 because of its loyalty to the book Lewis's vision. My only gripe is that there was no blood.

"missmissa","9","4","5","10 December 2005"," A truly beautiful film
","When Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings into an epic trilogy, I knew that someday soon my favorite story as a child would come to life. This film is everything I could have hoped for. The special effects were amazing. When the various creatures spoke, it didn't seem like a puppet was speaking, it seemed like the animal was actually speaking. And I don't think anyone has ever managed to make CG fur look this realistic. I am also very impressed with the centaurs. They blended a real person on what was probably CG horse. These centaurs were about 100 times better than the last centaur I saw, which was in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This is also a wonderful film about forgiveness and how families will always stand by one another, even in the darkest of times. This aspect of the film is well acted by all four children in the leading roles. No film is perfect, however. There is at least one shot where the children are very obviously against a backdrop, though I do think there is at least one shot like this in every effects laden film. And while the centaurs are quite impressive, what I think are supposed to be Minotaurs are not impressive at all, they just look like guys in big fury suits, which is probably what they are. There has also been a lot of controversy about how this is some sort of Christian propaganda story, which it's not. It's a fantasy just like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars. I'm really surprised more controversy hasn't been raised over the fact that you basically have children leading others into battle. This idea is kind of a risky notion in today's political climate. This idea will probably go over most children's' heads, but it is definitely something to think about as an adult. I saw this film in an auditorium full of children, parents, grandparents, and teenagers and the end was met with thunderous applause. This is a truly beautiful film that appeals to the young and the old in all of us."

It's been quite awhile since I have read the book, but from what I recall, the movie stayed very true to the novel.<br/><br/>The CGI effects were outstanding and the scenery was breathtaking. The audience was comprised of younger teens and adults and there were quite a few laughs and some outright sobbing at various points throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The human actors were quite good in their roles and dramatic without being over the top. The storyline was easy to follow and no one in the audience left during the film for popcorn or a bathroom break, all eyes were focused on the screen.<br/><br/>Possible Spoiler***There are a few scary scenes that parents of younger children might wish to be aware of - when Peter faces a wolf, the sacrifice of Aslan, and some of the scenes in the battle to name a few.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about the religious undercurrent of the film. If you are looking for it, you will find it, but it is not ""in your face"" obvious. The film can simply be enjoyed as fantasy by anyone of any or no religious persuasion."

","I saw this on the recent DVD release and found it very weak. I've seen others here rave about the performance of the youngest girl. It seemed to me no matter the situation, all she did was present this forced smile which left her face empty of any emotion. The other end of her two color spectrum was the the crying, which seemed more like they just sprayed her face down with water and told her to make a pinched face, again devoid of any emotion. Actually, the performances of all the children were all weak and annoying. They did a horrible job in casting these children. I haven't seen child acting this empty since Star Wars Episode One.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was horrible. There was too much time spent on small pointless scenes. It then moved on to seemingly large leaps in story line. I guess there was an assumption that all viewing this movie had read the book. But, I feel this created that atmosphere others have complained about. This movie is both too slow and too fast.<br/><br/>I was never able to identify with any character in this movie due to the weakness of any development in both character and story. So, I just didn't care.<br/><br/>The only thing interesting in this movie was Tilda Switon's hair."
"courtneypalmbush","1","25","50","19 December 2005"," Disappointed
","The Narnia books occupy a space in my soul, and I couldn't be more unhappy and disappointed by this production. While the Chronicles of Narnia were written to delight children, C.S. Lewis made it a point never to ""talk down"" to children, and this is exactly what is done in this film. The plots of the Narnia books are child-like, while the themes concern (as do great works of literature) what it means to be human. They are anything but childish. Unfortunately, in the hands of this director and Disney, TLTW&TW has been trivialized by the unforgivable overuse of saccharine background music and typical Disney over-sentimentality. All of the power and beauty of this book has been removed--I had the sense that Disney was in such a hurry to cash in on Narnia that the dedication, time, and love necessary to take on a task such as this (the kind that Peter Jackson drew upon in putting the Lord of the Rings on screen) is strikingly, painfully absent."

The music, directing, acting, special effects, and costumes make Narnia seem so real. I absolutely loved it. I hadn't even read the book before seeing it, but it sure did inspire me to read all of the books (finished The Last Battle last night). One of the reasons why I love this movie is because it's so beautiful to watch. The scenery and the cinematography are so amazing. If someone asked me to pick my favorite scene, I couldn't do it. All of the scenes are my favorite. It's a movie that works on so many levels. From little kids, to teens (like me), to adults, and to those who see the Christian symbolism and to those who don't, this is a great movie."

While in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest child (and star of the movie), stumbles across a wardrobe that leads somehow into the magical land of Narnia. When Lucy returns and retells her adventure, everyone thinks she is crazy, but eventually they discover Narnia exists. As they check out Narnia, they become caught up in a battle. You'll need to see it to find out more.<br/><br/>The movie is an adaption of the CS Lewis classic. The movie version, due to Disney's brilliance, brings great power and passion to Lewis's story and I'm pretty sure he'd be happy with the portrayal. Many may not know that the message behind the story is the message of Jesus, portrayed through Aslan. It shows us the purpose of Jesus' life- to die as a sacrifice for others. The story also features many themes close to Lewis' heart- forgiveness, redemption, the search for truth.<br/><br/>Excellent movie for the kids- there are a few scary scenes with some animals and some battles, but most kids 7+ should be fine. Excellent effects too."

","Wow this film absolutely rocked! The whole setting, the gentle snow falling from the sky, the lampost warming the atmosphere, Narnia and beyond and little Lucy finding the magical land. When Edmund follows his sister into the wardrobe, and the crunching of the snow beneath his feet, this movie made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The White Witch played by Tilda Swinton done a fantastic performance giving us a cold, icy Queen full of fear and anger. Her still eyes gave an entrancing feel. The four children especially young Georgie Henley gave a fantastic performance, giving emotion and detail within their character. Dawn French was so funny as Mrs Beaver, the whole Scene set was perfect, an inspiration in film making. The simple yet enthralling story captured the heart of many young and old, and especially mine, making me very happy to come from Belfast the home of Narnia Creator, Clive Staples Lewis.."

","It's amazing what Hollywood can do when they put their mind to it! A film of high quality, amazing acting, superb special effects, beautiful choreography, plus much much more! What's more NO sex, and NO swearing! The pace of the film did not drag for the most part and the screenplay was well written based on the beloved book by C.S. Lewis. *Spoilers throughout* The film opens with the blitz of London in 1940 with German Nazis bombing the city. This forces the children away from home and into the English countryside. The ""Evacuating London"" score is wonderful to listen to as the title comes down like snow as the children are leaving on a train. They're sent to the home of an older professor. One day during rain, the children play Hide and Seek to ""Oh, Johnny, Johnny"" sung by the Andrew Sisters. Lucy, the youngest, finds a wardrobe that goes into Narnia, a land that has been frozen for 100 years by the evil White Witch. Soon all four of the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) embark on an adventure like nothing before. Edmund betrays them when he meets the Witch earlier, and the children must go to meet the TRUE KING Aslan. Aslan preforms the true meaning of sacrifice dying in the place of Edmund for his faults. Killed by the Witch and then rises again and ""death itself started working backwards."" The battle scene at the end is amazing before the children are crowned the kings and queens of Narnia. ""Once a King or Queen of Narnia, always a King or Queen of Narnia"" as Aslan remarks. The children grow up in Narnia going into their 30s I from what I can tell before leaving the wardrobe to return to being children once again. Just as they fall out the professor walks in and says, ""What were you children doing in the wardrobe?"" ""You wouldn't believe us if we told you,"" remarks Peter. With a twinkle in his eye the professor replies, ""Try me."" This film has something for everyone. I was surprised when I saw it opening day and people from all age groups were there. Children who were three all the way to Senior Citizens being 70 or 80. The plot is good and teaching great lessons. The Beavers offer great comic relief and the music sets the mood. Enjoy and be sure to stay through the first part of the credits for a final scene."

"Cel_Stacker","9","5","7","23 December 2005"," Haven't had so much fun since Willow first opened...
","A year of overdone franchises, pretentious biopics, and realistic downers at the movies ends with this well-timed, refreshing piece, which is even more amazing considering it is indeed the most fantastic allegory of the Greatest Story Ever Told.<br/><br/>In short, the four Pevensie children escape the war-torn suburbs of early 40s London, joining their relative, an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent) and his governess-like assistant at his countryside manor. The kids have trouble appreciating one another, despite the harsh circumstances they have just faced. Gradually, they discover that the spare room wardrobe is actually a portal to a world beyond their imagination, the world of Narnia. They find themselves on the run from the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), caught up in the centennial struggle between the Witch and the icon of justice, Aslan (Liam Neeson), and most importantly, becoming a family again.<br/><br/>Despite its most serious origins, this story is just plain fun. I may be biased--I've read the wonderful source material from C.S. Lewis thrice. If accuracy in comparison to the novel would bother you, stay away. This is truly a big screen interpretation, but done most respectfully by Andrew Adamson, the director best known for the Shrek films. (Yeah! I know!) He shows quite a departure here, showing love and reference for the original story in this interpretation. Although a few stars are involved, one of the big reasons to see it is for the previously unknown talent, including breakout performances by James McAvoy (Mr. Tumnus), Patrick Kake (Oreius the Centaur General), and, of course, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley as Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy respectively. Breathtaking visuals, that quite frankly, outdo the best of Potter round out the mix. The final battle is not to be missed. Finally, nothing from the original work that was left out of the film will be terribly missed. (I was delighted, in fact, that the Christmas Party was not attempted. Arguably, the saddest part of the story.) The audience aimed at is certainly children, but don't be surprised to find yourself enchanted as well. Even though you may not like to, please, PLEASE stay for the credits to see the epilogue, straight from the book, as well as some nice compositions. A very good time."
"yeyahbenji","9","5","7","22 December 2005"," Faithful to all who venture into Narnia
","When I had first heard that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" would be hitting theaters, I practically shouted with glee. It had been about seven or eight years since I had read all the books, and the upcoming film persuaded me that now was a good time to revisit the land of Narnia, which I encourage all to do (it takes a steady-paced reader only three to five hours to finish the book).<br/><br/>I had anticipated that the movie was going to add its own bits and pieces here and there, since the book is not so heavily detailed on the actions of its characters (the emotions and feelings, however, C.S. Lewis delves into particularly). I was correct in assuming so, but I believe the additions to the movie were very effective from the cinematic storytelling standpoint, the only scene that seemed a bit far-fetched being the melting ice river. Overall, the movie is a faithful representation of what the book is, which is what I had hoped to see upon watching it.<br/><br/>Though apprehension comes with knowing the movie will star four child actors, the children did exceptionally well with their roles. They were not perfect by any means, but their overall performance was crafted very well. The voice acting was superb, and even though I always seemed to imagine Aslan's voice as a much deeper, booming voice, Liam Neeson delivered well and stuck on to me after a few moments.<br/><br/>The computer generated effects were mostly outstanding. Yes, the battle scene was definitely not as glamorous as Lord of the Rings, but the size of the battle in Narnia was just right; ultimately, much of it was left to the imagination of the director and screenwriters, since C.S. Lewis covers it only briefly. What they did come up with fit well into the scheme of the film.<br/><br/>I believe that the film is best viewed right after having read the book. Though many movies based off books have failed miserably in the past, today's slew of movies is being helped greatly with modern technology and the fantasy genre in particular (a la LOTR and Harry Potter) benefits well from it. Narnia has now reached its time for the same conclusion."
"bradus","8","5","7","19 December 2005"," I want to go to Narnia
","I read Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and found the movie rendition to be severely lacking in detail. I read Chronicles of Narnia and felt the director did an excellent job capturing all the important points of the movie.<br/><br/>I took my 11 and 14 year old kids to see this movie yesterday and they, like me, loved the movie immensely. I would probably hesitate taking any child younger than 10 because some of the battle scenes are quite intense; that having been said, I don't recall seeing any blood or anything like that so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.<br/><br/>The set locations were breath-taking and really captured the magic of a place like Narnia. The animation/computer special effects were for the most part excellent, especially the animals. There is one particular scene where the main characters stand with a vast scene behind them and it's quite obvious they're standing in front of a blue wall and the image was imposed afterward. Other than that though, brilliant.<br/><br/>For kid actors, these guys did much better than the Harry Potter crew did their first time out; they were a lot more convincing in my opinion.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","I very much enjoyed this movie. It helped that my 22 year old daughter saw it first. She's an avid C.S. Lewis fan and expressed disappointment that the magic of his writing wasn't captured by the film. So I was prepared to be disappointed, which for me is a good thing. I hate having movies over-hyped...it seems they never live up to it. I agree with my daughter by the way. It would be very difficult to capture Lewis' magic from any of his books. It would have to be done in the dialogue if anywhere. But, like Lord of the Rings, I was able to put my memory of the book aside and enjoy the movie for what it was. I would have liked to have seen the majesty and omniscience of Aslan better displayed. He almost seemed to be too much a creature and not who he really represented. I would also have liked to see more development of the relationships between the kids and Aslan as happened in the book. But all in all, very good. I'd give it an 8.8"
"sumpleby","8","5","7","13 December 2005"," Bravo! Excellent fantasy film for children.
","First of all, I want to say...let this film stand on its own merits! It is not Lord of the Rings reborn, nor is it the same sort of fantasy as Harry Potter. And while teens and adults will enjoy the film it is definitely aimed primarily at a younger crowd or ""family"" audiences. Some reviewers have called this film ""boring"" and I can only think that they are either trying to appear sophisticated or they are judging on the wrong level. I went the day after it opened; the theatre was completely sold out and, being a matinÃ©e, I would say that at least 50% (& probably more) were children ranging in age from preschoolers to age 12--but they were so mesmerized by the film that you wouldn't have known they were there. No fidgeting. No crying. No getting up & down. No talking. And when the film was over, the audience broke into applause which doesn't happen often.<br/><br/>I went to see this film with a bit of trepidation: I had enjoyed the BBC miniseries years ago and doubted a 140 minute film could equal it. I am happy to say that I was wrong. Although the CGI is a bit shaky in certain parts (notably the centaurs) and the ears for Mr. Tumnus & the centaurs being done on the cheap, overall Disney and director Andrew Adamson have brought the fantasy world of Narnia to life so well you have no problem suspending disbelief for it.<br/><br/>The casting of the child actors is, for the most part, ideal. Unusually for these times we are presented with non-bratty, non-smart-mouthed characters--a refreshing change. The young actors do a great job of portraying the more innocent, less sophisticated kids of the 1940's. Georgie Henley, in particular, is perfect for her role of Lucy Pevensie, evoking the wide-eyed wonder of a young child discovering a magical land. The scene in which she first discovers the wardrobe and then goes through it is well-handled by the director. William Mosely as Peter gives the weakest portrayal & the scenes in which he wields a sword are simply not believable.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the White Witch makes for an excellent villain. Her glacial stares send a clear message that she cares for nothing but herself and her own goals; her costumes distort her shape, especially around the shoulders & neck, giving her an inhuman look.<br/><br/>Aslan, the CGI'd lion, is totally believable and Liam Neeson's voice can raise chills on your spine.<br/><br/>Finally--yes, this story is a Christian allegory. If you are a devout Christian this film will speak to you. Aslan's death and rebirth in particular. However, the film works as a plain fantasy as well and if one is not a Christian (as I am not) the spiritual aspects don't get in the way."

","It's been about 40 years since i read the books. They were among my favorites ever and while reading them, my visual mind made up its own movie. So i was uncertain about going to see this movie. But it's perfect. It's all the images i saw in my head and more. It's brilliant. I'm a very critical person about entertainment and literature. But i'm hard pressed to come up with one thing i didn't like about this movie. Maybe the choice of adult actors in the first sequences, but they weren't very much part of the story. The battle scene at the beginning was really well done, better than most depictions of England during the war. At first i thought the witch wasn't working but, wow, she really got better. The centaurs are the best Hollywood's come up with yet. Completely believable. As are the fawns. Great. But the most important part, the one i was most worried about, was the lion. And he was perfect. Wonderful. Awesome. This movie should win all the prizes."

","I totally enjoyed this film, particularly since I knew very little about it. The splashy ad in the newspaper gave me the impression that it was more of a cartoon than its highly developed graphics animation with tight script and direction.<br/><br/>The best of what could be said has already been accurately written by others. What I walked away with was desire to know more about C. S. Lewis along his other books and writings.<br/><br/>There was a wonderful mixing of Western religious dogma, spiritualism, witchcraft and perhaps a tinge of voodoo or whatever. Perhaps there was a hint of at least one portal somewhere that connects other universes or realms that co-exist with our own -- the one that Adam and Eve acquired. Quite contemporary concepts, for sure.<br/><br/>Lewis' creative writing definitely fits well in uniting into one platform the debate between Darwin and Intelligent Design theories. Combine those two, and we get ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (2005). I mean there were enough variant animals and critters in this film to temper the flotation Noah's Ark.<br/><br/>And we don't have to even ponder about these four children of Adam and Eve and how they would select their life-partners -- presuming they cannot mate with those on the other side due to genetic differences. After all, they have only six Hobson's choices between Peter (P), Edmund (E), Lucy (L) and Susan (S): L+E, L+P,P+E and S+L, P+E. Any of those are within the Combo Darwin and Intelligent Design offerings.<br/><br/>Just a thought about a great cinematic experience."

However, I had low expectations for the acting and plot. I had no clue what will the directing, music, sound effects, and picture will be like. I believe my expectations were clearly justifiable since I have read the book, I have seen the BBC version, and we all know about the deficiencies of remakes. The following were my impressions after I have seen the movie: I loved the Movie. It exceeded all my expectations. The acting was excellent; then I realized that Aslan's voice was performed by Liam Neelsen. How can you go wrong with that? The children actors in the BBC version were very good. They raised the bar for any remake. But the actors in this movie were excellent, especially Lucy and Edmond. The Music is fabulous and the picture is one of the best. The battle scenes are beautiful and the graphics are wonderful. The supporting actors are all good. I was very surprised that the movie was very faithful to the book. The author plot and intention was the heart of the movie. I really thought that C.S. Lewis was actually the director. One more observation, the movie was so entertaining and every scene was so beautiful, I left that movie hoping for the second and the third part.<br/><br/>I watched lot of movies and if there is one I recommend you see in the theater for the last one year, it is this one.

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a wonderful movie with wonderful characters. I had read the book when I was about 12 years old and had forgotten a lot of the story. All I could remember how wonderful Aslan the lion seemed (who even as a twelve year old I picked it out that he resembled a Jesus/God-like figure) and it was the same in this movie. The White Witch was pretty scary but not too scary for little children. Overall, this movie captured my attention and my emotions but as a Radio/TV/Film major I was slightly disappointed with some of the scenes. I expected a little more Lord of the Rings quality but felt it didn't quite reach its level. (Maybe I am too critical from being in the business.) However, we could all use a story about the battle over good and evil, the Messiah, and learning about family love/loyalty!"
"dstdiva","7","5","7","9 December 2005"," Beautiful and faithful translation to film
","This version of the first Narnia chronicle is visually beautiful and in most respects, faithful to the CS Lewis book. The story is set up well, and it moves without losing any of the crucial plot details in the book. The four Pevonsie children are well-acted and believable, and the housekeeper is properly frightening.<br/><br/>However, there are some problems with the film adaptation that are less noticeable in the book. First, the Narnia of the film is almost too beautiful, pristine and serene, without any note of harshness of the 100 year winter caused by the rule of the witch, or the sense that the landscape has been depopulated by war. The return of Azlan to fight the witch with his army is introduced without comment on where he--or they--have been all this time. Finally, and perhaps most seriously, the resurrection of Azlan, which Lewis intended as a parallel to Christ's resurrection, is the pivotal moment of the book, but is made unbelievable in the film. Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, by expecting anything to be ""believable"" in a world populated by talking beavers, foxes, badgers, not to mention centaurs and fauns, and where everyone has lived through a 100-year long winter yet still believes in the eminent return of their lion king, but I was disappointed by the way the death and resurrection scene was handled.<br/><br/>That said, the film does a satisfying job overall of conveying the fairy-tale escape to Narnia. The casting is superb, with Georgie Henley as Lucy giving the most outstanding performance. Take a kid if you must, but don't miss it."
"DaisyOfWales-1","9","5","7","9 December 2005"," A beautiful rush of emotions and fantasy!
","I just went to see the midnight showing, and first off, let me say, it did my heart so good to see it *jam packed* full of college students! In fact, the only people there were college students, or people of equal age. =) I remember hearing critics and fans say that marketing young people, specifically males between the ages of 15-25, would be difficult . Never fear! The atmosphere was electric with whoops and hollers and clapping and open crying (yes, a lot of it on my part as well!). So there we go! I have to say that the acting was superb! I had no trouble buying into the characters. In fact, I didn't see them as anything but characters! I didn't have to think, Oh, this is Tilda Swinton from Constantine, or this is an unknown actor playing Peter. I just looked at them as The White Witch, Peter, Tumnus...etc. They all flowed wonderfully together. I even wound up forgetting that Liam Neeson was Aslan's voice. It just turned into Aslan. The special effects were amazing. I was looking at them to study at first, but finally just gave up, and was able to accept it all as real. The only shots I didn't do this with were the shots from a distance, and the animals looked animated. The fox wasn't nearly as well done as the others, but it still looked top of the line, though not photorealistic. The other shot was a blue screen of the children on the stone bridge looking out, it looked fake, but it was a quick shot, and pretty much the only blue screen shot that was visibly fake. Out of a CGI intense film, that is amazing I think. The cinematography and score were beautiful, breathtaking and awe inspiring. I couldn't have been more pleased! It all went together seamlessly. For a little gushing now....okay, yes I bawled and bawled. =) When Lucy first entered the wardrobe, when she met Tumnus, the Stone Table (ohmy!), and the battle. I just couldn't help myself. And hearing the beautiful Aslan roar was amazing. The cinema was literally shaking! Fans, to forewarn you, not everything is in there. Yes, I do agree, hands down, that this is an extremely faithful adaptation. And I don't think they could have done better. However, as an extreme Narnia fans since the age of 6 (I'm 21 now), I was a bit saddened that certain parts aren't in there.<br/><br/>~**Spoiler**~<br/><br/>There is no romp with Aslan after He comes back to life. I must say this saddened me most of all. That is the one and only scene I was truly longing for, and alas, it is absent. But, because of the battle going on at the time, I understand it. Also, I wish they would have said the infamous line, ""Safe? Course He isn't safe, but He is good."" Although they do make a nice try at it between Tumnus and Lucy at the end. And they do not explain to the children that Aslan is a Lion. Wish they could have done that. However these are tiny little pieces, and although important and very special to me, like I said before, I can understand it. <br/><br/>Overall....SUPERB! I am so very happy! The job was brilliantly done. I am hoping for an extended edition DVD, because indeed it did feel a bit rushed, which I must say surprised me. The scenes seemed a bit short, not quite as in depth, but everything was done beautifully....and the gushing of emotion, the clapping and the happy, light and beautiful storytelling is put forth in a beautiful film that I believe will become a classic. I am very well pleased indeed!!!!!"
"Groovey","10","5","7","9 December 2005"," Outstanding Book Adaptation
","Children's fantasy is a most difficult genre to adapt for the screen, because the agendas of book and screen are so different. Fantasy allows such swift and non-rational changes that capturing it on a movie screen is much more difficult than painting the pictures in your head with words.<br/><br/>Even with all the nice trailers, hype and good reviews, I went to see this with no small amount of trepidation. I first read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe about 40 years ago, and I've probably read it more than a dozen times since then. I was afraid that no amount of skillful CGI could make a convincing Aslan. More than that, I was afraid of a Disney-fied movie that washed out the messages in the movie, or included propaganda for various causes.<br/><br/>I was wrong. This film succeeds in bringing Narnia to life beyond my wildest expectations. Aslan is believable, as is the witch.<br/><br/>Most wonderful of all, however, is what they have done with the plot: almost nothing. There are quite a few changes in things for flow, but not a single one significantly affects the the story. No wonder, with a member of the Lewis family watching over every word and every scene. (I'm sure there will be ""purists"" who will scream because the beavers look like real beavers instead of furry people who wear clothes, who object to other little things as well, but who nevertheless missed the movie.) I can't judge how someone who has never read the Narnia books would read it, because they are written too deeply into my soul to set aside. I think those who had not read the books would nevertheless love the movie, but I cannot be sure. If you have read the books and wondered if the movie is up to the books, wonder no more.<br/><br/>It is possibly the best book adaptation I have ever seen. The Lord of the Rings was an excellent adaptation, but it took a lot of liberties with the characters and plot. I think, on the whole, the adaptations were good, but there were several places in that most excellent trilogy where the characterization changes bothered me. Not so here.<br/><br/>These are indeed the beloved characters and story from the book.<br/><br/>Don't miss this film. Go see it in the theatres, if you can."

The story of a little girl who goes to a magic land has delighted readers for fifty years now, but never before have filmmakers had the technology to convincingly create the things C.S. Lewis imagined with such clarity. The special effects and creatures are marvelous.<br/><br/>The acting is also laudable. The children deliver obviously heartfelt performances, particularly commendable because the story requires them to display so many different emotions.<br/><br/>The score contributes to the beauty of the film, adding a subtle layer of mood that never overpowers the action.<br/><br/>The story is well told, fast-paced and moving. As huge fan of the book, I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe there is something transcendent about this movie. It moves beyond the realm of most children's films, even good ones, and explores themes of loss, courage, death, fear, weakness, and ultimate sacrifice. <br/><br/>I leave every viewer to find out for himself or herself what it all means. <br/><br/>What I believe you'll be sure of is that it definitely means something, and it just might take your breath away."

Sure, some dialogue is left out; some scenes are cut and/or extended; and some things are not explained--but this is the MOVIE version of Narnia. If we want it exactly as the book, we might as well just read it again. This film stays true to the important and outstanding parts from the book, and I was simply awed. Tilda Swinton plays an excellent and very cold White Witch--she was indeed convincing. Her portrayal of Jadis is very well-done. The scenery, the magical creatures--just stupendous. People are calling this a miniature Lord of the Rings. Well of course--C.S. Lewis and J.R.R Tolkien were friends, so it would make sense. I have already said all I could say about this wonderful film. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful =) <br/><br/>8.8/10 Stars"
"Metalfairy","9","5","7","8 December 2005"," Wonderful
","I expected a lovely, lavish children's movie along the same lines as Harry Potter with huge chunks likely to be omitted. Once I started watching I just no longer cared. The acting was absolutely fantastic and Tilda Swinton was an absolute joy to watch. I cried, I laughed, I admired the courage of Peter. The little girl who played Lucy was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>For those unaware of CS Lewis's masterpieces, this is the second book of seven ""Chronicles of Narnia"", about the four Pevensie children who accidentally stumble across the Land of Narnia and a tense situation between Aslan (voiced wonderfully by Liam Neeson) and the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br/><br/>The Christian Allegory so many press articles seem to be picking up on is there and very blatant. But so what? What I saw was a fantastic retelling of CS Lewis's book and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>The two and a half hours just flew by and I wished it could have been longer but no doubt the fidgeting children would have been a nuisance. Perfectly condensed, great casting and some lovely effects. I could not have asked for more."

","From the moment I saw Lucy's eyes as she entered the room with the Wardrobe I knew I was in for a thrill. What can you say about a children's (and adult) classic that has been faithfully brought to the screen? I could almost feel the pine needles pricking my skin as they backed into the woods from the rear of the wardrobe. The snow falling on Lucy's hair and eyelashes (god help me, shades of the Sound Of Music) but it really was effective.<br/><br/>The acting (both human and animal) was right and not over done. I was lucky to see a special preview with lots of children and with some adults who remember their childhood. All seemed pleased.<br/><br/>A note of caution. There is some violence, mild and no gore, but small children in attendance did find it hard to watch some of the battles and especially were upset with the death of Aslan. But, they recovered well when he re-appeared.<br/><br/>Loved the book as a child and love the movie as an adult. If you do not have a child, borrow one and go to the movies."

","With all the pseudo-Gothic dark, twisted and ""scary"" fantasy flicks now on offer, it's a refreshing and welcome change to have the fun magical brand of Andrew Adamson come to a live action realisation.<br/><br/>And the first installment Narnia is all the twinkling eyed New Zealand director (do we know any other people like that?) could have hoped for in the bid to revive the imaginations of the many so that the Hollywood of the future can make movies and games out of original material.<br/><br/>Narnia unashamedly re-kindles the romance so many have with the fantastical, taking us through the wardrobe in our minds and into an endless and wonderful place. That place is luscious and vivid with colour. It's inhabited by the bubbly, the wise and noble, and even the evil and sinister.<br/><br/>There exists everything from our imagination<br/><br/>--Spoilers from here on--<br/><br/>From talking animals to completely imaginary ones. A Santa Clause who hands out lethal weapons made by Weta Workshop. Fauns, centaurs and cyclops warriors. Massive battles where polar bears and big cats and minotaurs fight against each other.<br/><br/>Oh but not a drop of blood! It's a family movie with Disney writing the cheques, but the rating does not come at a cost to the action, rest assured. <br/><br/>The film will appeal to a wide audience, and deserves it too. Thankfully, it's done with such delightful escapism that whoever watches it is magically transformed into a child. A child that still understands the generous helping of adult-aimed jokes in the side-comments, that is.<br/><br/>This movie will get compared to others of its type, which is only partly fair. I'll try it in brief: LOTR: OK, it's like LOTR for kids and anyone who wants the fantasy experience without a massive and serious emotional bond to the characters. Harry Potter: Potter fans who scream endlessly for ""darker"" films would do well to be reminded that colourful fantasy is a wonderful thing. This is just the ticket. Oh, and it has a plot other than ""time passes and not much of any consequence happens."" Shrek: This would be a good comparison. Narnia is certainly more serious, but Shrek's youngest fans will have a new favourite movie.<br/><br/>It's understatement to say Adamson's visionary film does the book justice.<br/><br/>Narnia exists!"

Both types of audiences will enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing: The acting is good by whoever plays Edmund, the younger son and Peter the older one, and Lucy's character was cute and believable.<br/><br/>C.S.

","A little game of hide and seek can be surprising. Four English children are sent to a countryside mansion during World War II to escape the bombings. While there, they discover, through playing a game of hide and seek, a way to visit Narnia through a wardrobe. Narnia proves to be a parallel world undergoing a crisis similar to that which faces their own world. The plot then takes several fairy tale like turns including the delightful faun, a whole menagerie of charming animals who talk like humans, a scary witch queen, centaurs, and finally a medieval battle similar to those found in the Lord of the Rings. But, C.S. Lewis clearly intends to use this story to share his heartfelt theology of grace, to which he devoted much of his life. Of course, Aslan the Lion is used to represent Christ the King in this parallel world. And Aslan, like Christ, is the real meaning of sacrifice and resurrection in Narnia. So, C.S. Lewis shares again, in effect, the miracles of meekness, prophecy, grace, suffering, and glory of the Gospel in this fresh story of triumph. Mere Christianity is not so mere, after all. Meanwhile, the animation of this film is nothing short of breathtaking while the script and actors are all first rate, even the talking beavers."

","In the World War II, four children are sent by their mother to the countryside to escape from the bombing of London.

When her two brothers, Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) and Peter Pevensie (William Moseley), and her older sister Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell), cross the passage to Narnia, a prophecy is fulfilled and the rebel forces leaded by the lion Aslan and Peter fight against the evil witch.<br/><br/>""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a good story, where moral values of honesty, loyalty, sacrifice, freedom, friendship and love battle and win dishonesty, betrayal, selfishness, tyranny, betrayal and hate.

Unfortunately the young Georgie Henley is too weak for the lead and very important role of Lucy, wasting many scenes with her constant smile.

","Very rarely does a movie leave me speechless when the credits begin rolling, but this one did. <br/><br/>Where to start? Beautiful scenery, some truly extraordinary sets and scenes. The world of Narnia was superbly portrayed, with fantastic visual effects and animated characters.<br/><br/>But of course it was the performances of the main characters that truly held up this film and made it what it was. The four lead children are all charming and highly convincing in their roles. It is clear to see they are all talented actors. They are all exceptionally natural and give truly heart-warming portrayals of their characters, displaying a wide range of emotions.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is suitably terrifying in her role of the White Witch, and Liam Neeson's voice was just right for the role of Aslan. All the other characters, such as the beavers and the wolves, were all done fantastically, but I can't mention them all!<br/><br/>From the moment the film started, with the dramatic music accompanying the air raid in London, I was gripped till the very end. Tears were brought to my eyes more than once, and I felt like bursting into applause in the middle of the film several times, such as during the battle scene - though I refrained for fear of appearing like a complete idiot.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to describe one particular thing that made this film so appealing; it truly has to be seen to be appreciated. One of the best films I ever seen!"

","This was meant to be a ""stocking-filler"" - just a movie on a cold Christmas holiday afternoon. A children's story from over 50 years ago - probably with so many anachronisms and cuteness it might even be kitsch.<br/><br/>Having already suffered the appalling massacre of JK Rowling's 4th book, I knew I could manage anything. However, when ""Disney"" came up in the opening credits I settled down for a good snooze. Definitely this was not a film this ""Grumpy Old Man"" could possibly enjoy!! Well how wrong I was!!! The cast was excellent. All credit to the 4 children, great young actors. The animation was stunning and the scenery, wow!! I was enthralled right from the start.<br/><br/>There were a few tongue-in-cheek pieces of ""modern"" dialogue - but I found them to enhance the believability rather than the opposite. I would have to be a real old *** to find fault at all.<br/><br/>Reading a couple of the (very few) negative reviews for this film  I wonder just what those critics expected from Narnia. This was a superbly-made children's fantasy!!"
"BaronBl00d","8","6","9","29 December 2005"," Leave it to Beaver(s)
","A truly inventive, oft times breathtaking journey into the fertile mind of C. S. Lewis. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is refreshing; it tells a ""simple"" story in a simple manner yet is anything but simple. Four siblings need to be placed in a home during the blitz in WWII and come to the huge manse of one Professor Kirke. There they find a huge wardrobe which sometimes acts as a portal to another world. I never read these books as a child but will go back and read them now. The story is allegorical and symbolic to be sure, but for those of you that do not want to be bogged down with that - have no fear it isn't needed at all to enjoy this. The rest of the story takes on a Lord of the Rings scope as good vs. evil in the form of the four youngsters(now in a mythical world called Narnia) and aided by Aslan a giant of a lion fight the wicked White Witch and her evil minions for supremacy. Director Andrew Adamson, also from New Zealand(like Peter Jackson), is able to pull off much in this his first full-scale non-animation film. Previously he directed both Shrek films. Adamson hits a couple of slow patches early on but his world that he created comes bursting to life on the screen with vibrant colors and weird, fairly believable characters. There are many weird creatures such as a centaur, a pair of cockney-speaking beavers, and a pack of deadly wolves. The film ends with a typical battle scene but that is done rather well at any rate. What makes this film work besides the energetic direction and the imaginative script is the acting. The four children all do a reasonably good job: a must when having youngsters perform as protagonists. None of them is particularly detrimental. The young girl playing Lucy is particularly good. Liam Neeson lends his mighty voice to the Lion - a feat of filming. The two digitally created beavers are also most impressive and bring lots of subtle laughs to the proceedings. But the real star if you will is Tilda Swinton giving lessons on how to be wicked and look as pale as ever. Swinton plays evil almost too well. Jim Broadbent plays the professor and even though his role is minor, his presence is necessary. A very good film."

","At the tender young age of 7 I remember sitting down every Sunday evening to watch the BBC's adaptation of Narnia and so 16 years later it was with trepidation that I ventured to the cinema to watch Narnia FINALLY on the big screen. From the opening credits to the last it drew me in and I was immediately taken back to my childhood. The acting is marvellous, the special effects amazing, the scenery is breathtaking and the music is powerful and invoking. Funny at times, it is also deeply moving and in some parts quite distressing (for this, I must wander why it got given a PG certificate). However, if like me you are a child of the 80s with memories of the TV series then this film is a MUST SEE. I felt like was 7 again and wishing that I were Lucy so I too could go into the wardrobe.

After it was over I was tempted to sneak into another theater where it was playing and watch it again. I can't wait to take my family to see it. The battle sequence was cool...but the parts I liked the best were the personal moments between characters. I enjoyed the fact that I didn't know very many of the cast members; it was refreshing to see new talent on the screen. It helped me to be more into the characters.

There was almost nothing left out of the movie from the book, and only a very little added. Except for the embellishment of a couple action scenes (which were extremely well done and very well gouged to the Narnian world), most additions were only to keep the pace quick enough to keep the average movie watcher interested.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the screen version, occurs at the very end, but its only a slight omission of what amounts to one paragraph in the book, (I was hoping the movie might have detailed this point).

","At times I view myself as a writer, mostly as avocation, but a writer nevertheless. When a beloved book is converted into cinema, especially a beloved book, I view it with apprehension.<br/><br/>I imagined what Tim Burton would have done with this book and I simply shuddered. I can hear him now, ""No, I must make this 'my' Narnia."" While I recognize Burton as an imaginary and talented film maker, he is someone who does not normally respect the work of others. Fortunately for us all that he did not make ""Narnia."" When a film maker looks at this book, he is faced with the same challenges that Peter Jackson faced with the Lord of the Rings. First of all it was a book that belonged to J.R.R. Tolkien, and more recently the Tolkien family. Secondly it is a series of books that belongs to the generations of fans that sustained the remarkable publishing history. So it is with ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Andrew Adamson is a fine cinematic story teller as proved with both Shrek films. Here he took a book with tens of millions of owners, and made a film that carefully walks the line common to all of the owners. It was a joy to watch his rendering of the story, and caring not to water down the more 'dynamic' portions of the book.<br/><br/>I am amazed that Disney, better know for witches and ghosts, would allow a movie such as this to be made under their banner. The movie turns out to create a much better legacy than Michael Eisner deserves.<br/><br/>Three cheers for Mr. Adamson"

"bkoganbing","10","7","11","7 January 2006"," Children's Escapist Fare
","There's one good rule about the writing of children's stories, that you should never treat children like children. I believe that is the reason for the success of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia down through the years. And it's the reason for the success of this film, sure to take home some Oscar gold this year for special effects if nothing else.<br/><br/>Before writing this review I did a little research on C.S. Lewis. I found that he had started writing this first story of the Narnia Chronicles during World War II. Lots of British families did like the Pevensies, ship their kids to the country side to escape the bombing of cities. They sent them abroad if they could afford to. <br/><br/>What Lewis did was bring his Christian background and a vivid imagination in creating an escapist world for four kids who were in an unfamiliar area in the first place. These kids faced the real prospect of losing one or more parents and siblings. Enough of them did.<br/><br/>Like American kids grow up on cowboys and Indians, British kids grow up on Knights of the Round Table and Robin Hood. Add some animals who all have the souls of humans, some mythical creatures, a wicked witch, and the King of Beasts and put these four Pevensie kids through a magic door and you've got Narnia.<br/><br/>By the way I don't think it's an accident that Aslan, the Christ figure in the film is a lion. Remember the British national symbol is also a lion. Lewis didn't have the saviour of the kingdom be a Russian bear or an American bald eagle.<br/><br/>I'm also sure that the success of the first book had a lot to do with the fact that it was published in 1950 at the height of the Cold War which a lot of people thought could get hot any minute. Parents wanted escapist stuff for their kids and for themselves as well. I'll bet reading all The Chronicles of Narnia was a secret pleasure.<br/><br/>I think this film will be a guilty pleasure for a lot of folks."

"noonflyproject","10","7","11","28 December 2005"," Adamson truly brings Lewis' masterpiece to the modern audience
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was simple an amazing and captivating film, full of life and representative of the deep imagination of C.S. Lewis. The parts were well-cast, the animation was incredible and appropriate, and the battle scenes were quite exciting.<br/><br/>All of the characters were represented well, especially the four Pevensie children. The four child actors truly understood their characters and brought them to life. Tilda Swinton as Jadis seemed to be off at first, but soon became quite convincing as the White Witch, demonstrating her wicked and relentless nature through her calm but stern personage. While James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus seemed to be the weakest and most scattered character, he did possess enough charm to play off his seemingly flat expressions. All the voice-overs were great, and the conversations between the beavers offered timely comic relief. Liam Neeson as Aslan seemed at first to be almost too predictable, but his booming voice worked great with the awesome appearance of the lion.<br/><br/>In terms of animation, the movie was a true triumph. The creators chose just the correct mixture of realistic and clearly CGI animation to present the animals and beasts in a fashion that reminded the audience of the fact that while they were fantasy creatures, they appeared to be perfectly in place in the magical world of Narnia. Not once throughout the movie did I think to myself that the animation looked ""fake"" or ""overdone,"" and it was the way in which the animators depicted the entire world of Narnia, the landscapes and creatures, that made it appear so delightfully real. I especially enjoyed the facial expressions and speaking of the creatures, which was very realistic.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie was completed by the awesome battle scenes that took place near its end. In true Lord of the Rings style, Weta Workshop crafted a fully-armed battle that could stand up to those of the Jackson series. However, a comparison of the Lord of the Rings' battles and the one in Narnia cannot truly be made, for the movies are completely different. Narnia was much more a fantasy than LOTR, simply because it possessed a real world and a fantasy one, while LOTR was completely fantasy. It is for precisely this reason that the battle scenes, full of minotaurs and ogres, centaurs and satyrs, worked so well, and were seen as not only appropriate but a true triumph of modern animation.<br/><br/>Overall, Adamson should be highly commended for bringing the genius work of C.S. Lewis to life in this movie. I only hope he will agree to make more movies in the series. If you haven't seen it, you must, and prepare to be truly captivated by the magical world of Narnia."

When I first saw the trailers to this movie I thought it would be a nice movie but it appeared to me to be more geared toward younger audiences. I thought that because of the apparent target age it might be somewhat slow and so I figured I might try to catch it on video and watch it when I had nothing better to do. As chance would have it my plans were altered and I ended up watching it at the movies on Christmas day and I must say I was on the edge of my seat from the very beginning of the movie until the very end! I now plan to recommend this movie to everyone I know.<br/><br/>The special effects grabbed my attention during the very first minute of the movie (the blitz scene was very well done) and I remained awed by them until the very last scene (the one after the credits started to roll). The battle scenes were astounding and the talking animals really did not come across as one-dimensional as they appeared (at least to me) on the trailer. The transition from reality to fantasy was gradual and easily accepted. After a few minutes of watching I actually found it easy to accept that the animals were talking! In short, the movie made it very easy for me to immerse myself in the fantasy world of Narnia.<br/><br/>Aside from the movie magic the story was nothing short of beautiful and was a *greatly* welcomed change from the despair-filled, over-sexed, foul-mouthed trash that Hollywood mass-produces these days. This is a wonderful story of hope, redemption, and forgiveness. I must say that if more movies like this were made I would find myself gladly returning the theater with more frequency. It would also be easier for me to pay the ticket prices these days if I knew that after buying a ticket for a movie like Narnia I would actually leave the theater with a feeling of peace and hope, and not filled with angst/despair.<br/><br/>The movie combines a beautifully meaningful story with remarkable special effects. The battle scenes were magnificent and I absolutely loved the storyline. This is a feel-good movie and I recommend this to everyone and anyone who loves watching *GOOD* movies!"
"talbaineric","10","7","11","10 December 2005"," A movie for the ages!
","Sure, we have mega blockbusters like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, both of which were excellent movies in their own right. But the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe shines in it's own right. A true masterpiece among the ages that deserves just as much praise as HP or LoTR, probably even more.<br/><br/>I won't go into a synopsis of the movie, seeing as how most of you have either read the books or have seen the movie already and know it's plot. The accidental discovering of an enchanted land ruled forever by winter by the evil White Witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton in all her icy splendor) prompts the Pevensie family (with little Lucy first discovering the land) to eventually realizing their destiny and joining forces with the powerful Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), ensuing in one of the coolest battles in cinema history.<br/><br/>This film was very magical indeed. Not only does it capture the essence of the book very well, it also adds it's own little touches of Disney magic here and there. Hard to believe you were watching a Disney-made movie, but that's what it is. Truly cinema magic. I also felt that it was more drama-free than Harry Potter franchise and much more joyous and cheerful then the Lord of the Rings franchise.<br/><br/>Looks like Disney has struck gold once again with this one. Go with the family or take a friend (or a few friends) and go see this!"
"Lady-of-Rohan","Null","7","11","9 December 2005"," A worthy family film that's a bit slow out of the gate but enchants both young and old...
","One of the most anticipated films of the year is the adaption of the beloved book by C.S. Lewis ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". With a cinema filled of families and people of all ages (there were more adults than kids), I was very excited about enjoying a film that I had waited impatiently for weeks to see. <br/><br/>Just to get the negatives out of the way, Narnia is a bit slow. The first 40 minutes crawl by at a snails pace and the lead up to the meeting of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy is dragged out too much. But when all four kids get through the wardrobe, the story really gets to picked up by likable characters (the beavers come to mind) and tense scenes with the White Witch.<br/><br/>As for the positive notes, the scenery was top notch, with many people in the audience audibly playing ""Where in the country was this scene filmed?"" The animation and special effects are brilliant as well. Most notably, Aslan, the lion saviour, is wonderfully animated and incredibly realistic. At times, you could just as well be looking at a real lion. Other effects of centaurs, fauns, griffins, beavers, and bull-headed monsters are also top notch.<br/><br/>On an entirely different note, I really don't understand what all the fuss is about with the religious allegory. The symbolism is there for all to see including all the elements of sacrifice, and forgiveness, but it's not ""in your face"" or distracts you from the rest of the story. If you enter the cinema seeking an allegory on Somebody's sacrifice, you'll be content with what you see. And if you plan seeing this film just as a family friendly holiday movie, you'll be content too.<br/><br/>In all, Narnia deserves a worthy 7/10. It may be a bit slow out of the gate and outstay it's welcome length, but it's a worthy family film that enchants both young and old and transports you effectively into the land of Narnia."
"cosmic_quest","8","7","11","8 December 2005"," An Epic Almost on the Scale of LotR
","As a loyal Harry Potter fan, it pains me to say this film totally blows all four HP films off the map and it's even in league with the excellent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It definitely deserves to rake it in at the box office and rank as Christmas number one. Based on second of the classic Narnia chronicles (the first in the series as CS Lewis intended), 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is centred around the four Pevensie children-- fifteen-year-old Peter, thirteen-year-old Susan, eleven-year-old Edmound and eight-year-old Lucy-- who are sent to the vast country estate following the London Blitz. There, the children discover a wardrobe which contains the path to the magical world of Narnia, dominated by the cruel and vile White Witch and her minions. As prophesised, it lies to the children to join forces with the majestic Aslan to lead Narnia to freedom.<br/><br/>It's been many years since I read the book (far more than I like to think although I'm going to remedy that by re-reading it as soon as possible) but I felt that Ann Peacock did a wonderful job of adapting the novel to screen and fitting it into a measly two hours and twenty minutes. There obviously were some cuts made but everything that was important remained intact and the story stands well on the big screen, particularly the Stone Table scene and the battle.<br/><br/>The characters were portrayed perfectly with Edmound being impudent without being totally hideous while Susan's bossiness is not too overbearing. Fans of Peter and Lucy will enjoy how they come across as the lead heroes of the film, both being depicted as brave and loyal in their own way. It is refreshing to see the characters depicted almost exactly as they are in the books, rather than being dumbed down or made out to be 'cool' just to appeal to children in the audience. Those who fear a repeat of the rather mediocre Harry Potter young cast spoiling the film need not worry as the four child actors were excellent from start to finish. Adorable wee Georgie Henley stole the show as Lucy despite her tender age (and this being her debut film) and Skandar Keynes managed to portray a careful balance with Peter, showing his traitorous side but also his bravery and kinder nature. I wouldn't be surprised if all four went onto do many other projects.<br/><br/>However, it was Aslan's scenes that dominate even if he is a CGI character! I know many people were worried about this, unable to see past Jar-Jar Binks, but it worked well and you'd honestly think they had a real lion do the shots. And Liam Neeson's vocal work was brilliant in thundering across Aslan's strength and nobility. Tilda Swinton was just positively vile as the White Witch, exactly as she should be! She was able to carry off how wicked and callow the White Witch was in a way that will leave the audience close to horrified.<br/><br/>Overall, this film should certainly go down as a classic in the years to come. Everything was done so well, from the acting to the CGI to the musical score to the cinematography, and I'm sure both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy themselves. For something produced by Disney, 'Narnia' delivers as awe-inspiring performance without pandering to toddlers or mutilating the book. If anything, I think the PG rating it was given in the UK might have been a tad complacent as young and sensitive children may find some scenes hard to stomach (I know I would have bawled my eyes out at the Stone Table scene had I watched it at six years old; I nearly did even now and I'm in my twenties!). I recommend this to anyone looking to see a decent Christmas film."
"MovieAddict2016","6","13","24","3 January 2006"," A very faithful adaptation of the book, but I wasn't overly impressed
","I left ""Narnia"" feeling kind of cold. I loved the books as a child, and most specifically ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" which I read numerous times when I was young...but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place.<br/><br/>I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book. The themes and actions that take place in C.S. Lewis' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen. I felt that something was off. The direction by Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"") is commendable, but the second half of the movie is very bright, the animation throughout is quite poor (except for Aslan), and the final battle comes across as utterly silly.<br/><br/>Also, by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel, Adamson's film lacks cohesion. It all happens too fast. The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly. For example, when Edmund first meets the White Witch -- if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe, then told by a queen you were going to be the king, don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement? Instead, Edmund returns into the real world, and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about.<br/><br/>The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well. One minute they're reluctant to fight, the next minute they're armored up. The problem is that with a two-hour film like this, it's hard to develop the characters. In a novel, it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters. WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all.<br/><br/>Also, maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley (who plays Lucy) was always smiling. Not just a happy smile, though. A wicked smile, like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge. It's kind of creepy. When she cries at the end, it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh.<br/><br/>Am I being harsh? Probably a bit too much, yes. It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago, I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre. I felt disattached from the characters, I thought the animation was poor, some scenes were handled poorly, and the final battle was a joke.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth seeing if you like the book(s). I was personally disappointed by the film, but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't.<br/><br/>Hopefully the sequel will be better."
"gallowglas","4","12","22","3 January 2006"," Well... nice CGI
","What to say? I truly expected more. Trying to please both adult and children audiences, I am afraid that Disney fell flat in between.<br/><br/>Well, actually I cannot speak for the six-years-olds: They might love it and I wouldn't know, but then again the whole movie is so slowly paced that your average hyperactive kid is bound to loose track between two cuts. That's Narnia's biggest problem: It's plain boring. You just never get involved.<br/><br/>I appreciate the effort Disney made to give more depth to the story: Peter's got more doubts about doing the right thing, Edmund is more of a rebel but simply a spoiled kid. Problem is though: kids (for whom Lewis wrote his book) won't know the difference while adults, who (like me) might appreciate a little more character development, may find many issues unresolved. There are movies that appeal to both young and old, but Narnia certainly does not join the fray.<br/><br/>One more thing: ""Nice CGI"" refers to the animals, whose animation is sometimes short of outstanding. On the other hand there are just too many obvious computer graphics. Every other minute you get the impression of watching a video game. This might be due to somebody thinking that an impressive lion's fur carries a movie farther than a realistic scenery. Well, you can't spend one buck twice...<br/><br/>All in all, I don't know for whom this film was made (certainly not for me) and I can find no excuse to recommend it."
"pbp720-1","4","15","29","12 December 2005"," How to turn a 190-page kid's story into a 2.5 hour ""epic""
","I wanted to be generous and give this 5 out of 10 but this film really doesn't deserve even that extra star to rate it as mediocre.<br/><br/>Let's start from the top: The film opens inside the bomber planes of Germans, dropping bombs on London during WWII. It next cuts to a scene of a mother frantically herding her four youngsters (the 4 who protagonists of the film) to their bomb shelter. In this scene, Edmund disobeys and runs back inside so he can grab a picture of his dad, who is fighting the war. There is a close call with a bomb, followed by Peter admonishing Edmund with the line ""why can't you do as you're told?"" (or something like that). This scene is followed by a long and boring goodbye scene at the railway station.<br/><br/>On the one hand, I like the fact that these scenes place the story in their proper timeframe; essentially, they act as a historical backdrop to the tale. On the other hand, however, they're not precisely necessary. They're nothing that a couple of text stills or voice-over narration couldn't have accomplished. One might argue that they give the film emotional weight (or some such crock), but they really don't, especially since they don't really have any bearing later. In my cynical opinion, they're an excuse to give Peter something to say (the aforementioned line to Edmund) that he will say later (though not in any meaningful way); a popular Hollywood convention, apparently. Also, I might add this is a kid's book. Why the need to open the movie with such grim scenes as the WWII bombing of London? Again, unnecessary.<br/><br/>However, this stands apart from the main story, so no real harm done...that is until they get to that main story. Changes are made, seemingly at random. Presumably they are done to enhance the drama of the story but all they really do is impede narrative flow and create scenes that are simply wrong. For example, there is a scene involving the four children in the Beavers' dam, getting the scoop on Narnia from the Beavers. Before this scene there is a scene with Edmund and the Witch, with the latter showing the former where her castle lies, between two hills, quite a ways away off in the distance. In the Beavers' dam scene, Edmund is shown to look at the hills, still quite a ways a way. Later in the scene, Edmund sneaks off to report to the Witch. His absence is quickly discovered by his siblings, who follow with the Beavers. It is quickly seen, though, that that prodigious distance to the Witch's house wasn't very great at all, as Edmund is soon shown to be at the castle, with his siblings and the Beavers close behind! Did I somehow miss the teleportation scene? I won't even comment on how this deviates from the book; the scene, by itself, is just ridiculous. In another scene, a fox (a character invented for the movie, as is the scene he is in) helps the children escape by throwing the pursuing wolves off their trail. On moment, the fox is telling the children and beavers that he will throw the pursuing wolves off, the next the wolves have arrived and demand the fox tell them where their quarry is. He tells them they went north, but it turns out that they are in the very tall tree towering over them. Again, I must have blinked and missed the crucial scene where the fox sprinkled fairy dust on the pursued.<br/><br/>Then there's the problem of acting. The four children aren't terrible but they're not very good either. And two of them (the elder two) are made out to be whiners. I guess you can't blame them too much, especially as they're made to say and do things not in the book (they might have fared better if they stuck closer to the original text).<br/><br/>But how do others, more experienced actors fare? Not all that well either. Tilda Swinton does not make a very good White Witch. In fact, she doesn't seem to know what to do with this role, underplaying it to the point of distraction. Also, the physical match between book and film is poor. Similarly, James McEvoy, paints a very limp portrait of Tumnus. No real conviction or anything of interest there either.<br/><br/>The other main gripe I have with the movie is its mimicry of the Lord of the Rings movies. Lots of armor and weapons and posturing and clashing of armies. Unfortunately, it's all pretty dull and hackneyed (and, please...beavers in armor?)<br/><br/>Overall, there's not much of a sense of fun about the film. Everything seems either overblown or underdeveloped. Too much effort has gone into making things look real and not enough into making things wondrous. For instance, a key piece of dialog by the Witch (one in which she calls out for the creatures in her army), is absent. It's moments like those that made the book so much fun that are noticeably missing from the movie.<br/><br/>I don't mean to nitpick this film to death and come off like someone who thinks the movie should have followed the book to the letter. That is not precisely so, although I don't think there's any excuse for not doing so in this case. Sure, there are parts of the book that could have used embellishment or even improvement but there was no real need to drastically change or add anything. Wasn't the reason the Lord of the Rings (or book to film) couldn't be adapted faithfully that the books were too long? Well, there's no such excuse here."
"bob the moo","Null","2","2","11 April 2008"," Impresses with CGI but not where it counts
","Sent away from the city to escape the bombing raids of the war, siblings Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find themselves in the large home of Professor Kirke. Although bored out of their tiny minds, the older children are not so bored that they escape Lucy flight of fancy about a magical world inside Kirke's wardrobe. They don't, that is, until they stumble into themselves. Initially enjoying the frozen world of talking creatures, things change when the family are betrayed from within and find themselves key players in a war between the forces of good and evil for the very world of Narnia.<br/><br/>Ironically enough it was perhaps a certain amount of fatigue from the Lord of the Rings films that made me decide not to bother with this new film series, even though I had read all the books as a child. I watched it recently on television though and must admit that, in the overall sweep, it does work. Technically it is impressive of course, with the effects being realistic and convincing throughout (well  as convincing as Ray Winstone as a beaver can be at any rate). The battle sequences and the creation of Narnia is all equally as convincing but yet it was not the design and visual delivery where I had a problem at all.<br/><br/>No. Where I felt the film lacked was in the areas of heart and characters. The material is fine and I personally was not put off by the obvious themes from Christianity  although I can understand why some others might. If anything I was surprised by how dark it was with many characters being ""killed"" across the whole running time of the film. Problem is that it is only really ""dark"" in these very specific actions  not even ""moments"" but just in exact acts. This lack of depth sees the film be superficially enjoyable but offer nothing more beyond. Perhaps it is the comparatively short running time that does it but generally the film seems to be constantly moving forward but without ever taking time to sink its roots. For me this mean that I spent a lot of the film watching a spectacle rather than being engaging by a great story.<br/><br/>The script is the clear weakness as it does focus on events rather than characters. In this regard perhaps it is telling that director Adamson has his background in visual effects and animated features rather ""films"". The casting process has not produced much to work with either, although in fairness the children do not have much to work with even if they had the range (which personally I do not think they did). Keynes, Moseley, Henley and Popplewell are all very English children and in this regard they suit the narrative and the style, however they do not have the range or material to deliver more than ""English children"". It is a shame because the film does feature a very strong performance from Swinton as the White Witch; she is a real presence and the film is never better than when she is on the screen. Broadbent, is OK; McAvoy is OK; Cosmo is OK; Winstone is fun; French is OK; Everett is a random but enjoyable touch but the best piece of casting is Madsen as the main wolf, his voice being very distinctive and mean.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a technically impressive film that has plenty for the eye if you are looking for a spectacle. However if, like me, you are looking for something with depth, character and heart then this sadly is not the film for you. Having said that, I was not that impressed by the first LoTR film so maybe this series will find its depth with time and I will probably give it a few more chances to impress me with more than CGI."
"Aureias","6","11","20","3 January 2006"," weak in believability
","I went to see this movie expecting something relatively decent, something on the scale of LOTR's epic as some people have been making the comparison to. However, it was disappointing besides the visual eye candy.<br/><br/>Human characters particularly weak besides Swinton, I was rooting for the white witch the entire time. The kids themselves are irritating, lame, and whiny, besides maybe the smallest of the four. They're relatively one dimensional.<br/><br/>There's several points in the story in which believability is thrown out the window, given that it is a ""children's fantasy,"" in which I'll allow some sort of leeway, but there HAS to be some sort of rational sequence of events that leads up to the acquiring a certain skill or a turn of events.<br/><br/>Strategy and stupidity of the armies is enormous, I refuse to believe that a white witch who has ruled over the world for the past 100 years is that bad of a tactician.<br/><br/>All in all, the CG animals, such as the talking beavers are the redeeming aspect the adaptation.<br/><br/>Probably entertaining for someone not as critical or for little kids."
"barry_mooney","5","11","20","3 January 2006"," Decidedly dull
","I just saw this film last night and I have to say that I was very under-whelmed. Yes, it's a children's film - I know. But, other so-called children's films seem to entertain adults quite easily (most of the animated Disney films as just one example). I would concede that my enjoyment may have been spoilt by the fact that I was aware of the negative publicity surrounding the film. All the way through I couldn't help but notice the heavy-handed religious symbolism. The sickly-sweet sentimentality was also quite hard to wade through. For the first time in quite a while I found myself longing for a film to reach the end, which was pretty predictable and far from exciting - despite the impressive visual effects. My teenage kids thought it was OK and they didn't notice the Christian sledgehammer, which backs up my point that the publicity might have ruined it for me. I hear that there will be more Narnia films appearing in the cinema over the next few years - but not for me, thanks."

"ferguson-6","8","10","18","10 December 2005"," Ray Harryhausen 40 years later
","Greetings again from the darkness. How wonderful to see a family action/adventure that makes sense to those of us who have not contributed to J.K. Rowling's enormous fortune. Director Andrew Adamson (of ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" fame) brings to life the enormously popular stories of C.S. Lewis. ""Narnia"" is a thrilling ride with a story, a message and some amazing characters and action.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint the battle scene challenges most anything accomplished in the ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" movies. The effects make me believe this is what legendary effects specialist Ray Harryhausen envisioned as he worked his magic in the ""Sinbad"" movies and later in ""Clash of the Titans"".<br/><br/>Lewis did little to hide the biblical allegory, going as far as calling the 4 children of the prophecy the children of Adam. Good versus evil, sacrifice for the good of others and the confused doubter all play a part in the story. It is, however, initially a bit off-setting to experience talking beavers and wolves and a sly, deceitful fox. The impact is that we care very much for the characters and their desire and reluctance to do the right (and courageous) things.<br/><br/>The four children are all pretty much unknown to American audiences and newcomer Georgie Henley is marvelous as bright-eyed Lucy Pevensie. She is the heart of the film and of the family. Tilda Swinton is perfect as the White Witch. She is a real life Cruella Deville on steroids. She has the icy stare and cut features that Adamson's first choice Michelle Pfeiffer lacks. We really dislike her ... and that's a good thing!! Liam Neeson was brought in to replace Brian Cox as the voice of the majestic Aslan, and a better choice is difficult to imagine. Other voices that stand out are Dawn French and Ray Winstone as Mrs. and Mr. Beaver and Rupert Everett as the fox.<br/><br/>Parents be warned that the battle scene is very intense and some of the visuals will frighten the youngest viewers. On the bright side, most adults will enjoy the film every bit as much as the kids in the audience. Now will someone please figure out a way to make C.S. Lewis' ""The Screwtape Letters"" into a film?"

","okay where to start... i've never read the book, but i think i need to, to get this horrible movie replaced by a better, more convincing, Narnia.<br/><br/>The acting was really below average. It seemed all Peter wanted to do was point his sword at everybody, but as Susan said 'Peter, just because a man in a red coat gives you a sword doesn't make you a hero!. d-mn straight it doesn't. it was extremely obvious that the boy needed more training with a sword or something, because he seemed extremely uncomfortable and weirdly 'proud and wanting-to-seem-cool-' while holding the sword. it just made me want to bang my head against the wall next to me. i really wasn't convinced at all.<br/><br/>and the girl playing Lucy seemed to be the better one at acting, yet all she seemed to do was either smile or cry. after the second time she started crying i was already tired of her weeping.<br/><br/>Susan... well what about her? i didn't get much from her at all. Was she suppose to have a personality? Edmund... well... i got the impression he just wanted to be king, and to hell with his family. such hatred... so after the queen kicks him in a prison, he finally realizes he'll probably get more 'fame' being with his family, or what? The characters really didn't convince me, and where was the development? i really think Edmund must have had an extremely important character development in the book, but it was really lacking in the movie, i was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>Also, the prophecy about the four human kids. i really don't see what they brought to the table that was so important. they didn't do anything, really... i don't see why they were needed. the lion seemed to be a much better leader than those four. they were unexperienced and just not worth much. they didn't give a reason as to why the four kids could restore Narnia. To me, they didn't do anything, but receive the throne in the end. They didn't really do anything worthy of the throne, the two girls where just crying over the lion's death instead of acting on it, and doing something for 'good' itself. They failed to say what the children did that made them so much more important than any other average person in Narnia.<br/><br/>It really seemed rushed, and i didn't get the feel of Narnia in the movie. Many times it seemed to copy of Lord of the Rings, and that is just not cool. I never read the book, as i have mentioned, but when the Lion, what's-its-name, was being dragged unto the stone thing, many of the 'bad' creatures really seemed to orc-like for my taste. Also at one point, i think it was Peter talking, but it felt like they were trying to make a really hero-ish Aragon moment, and Peter is just not Aragon, it was just extremely cliché and badly done, though i can't remember when it was, which i think i'm quite glad about. i almost really couldn't bare to watch that, or hear it. It seemed to try and fit the Lord of the Rings standards of a truly amazing epic and world, but it didn't come anywhere near it.<br/><br/>The special effects where pretty cool actually. but the fact that Peter lead the army of 'good' after he's only been in Narnia for like what seemed like 3 days or something is extremely unrealistic. and suddenly he can fight the Witch, when did he have sword practise during those days he was there? He couldn't even hold the sword right! what does that tell one about his abilities to fight? Yet he 'fought' better than half the Narnian people! i mean what is that about? <br/><br/>The only thing that had me watching in the end were the really cute cheetahs or what they were and the wolves, just because they were well done. and they get the star, nothing else. i had to go home and watch another movie, just to get this one out of my head for a while. it was so disappointing, i really do not recommend it at all. and i don't understand how it got 7.4 was it? so disappointingly bad."

","This horrid adaptation of C.S. Lewis' classic tale is a bland, cookie-cutter modern fantasy flick that makes shameless attempts to cash in on both Christian religious dogma and horrifyingly average special effects at every turn.<br/><br/>The British TV versions from the '80s and early '90s were almost *infinitely* better. Here, Edmund is more than a self-absorbed brat; he's also a coward. And the White Witch is not scary-- she looks like she escaped from a very, *very* cheap porn film. And then there's Mr. Tumnus, who, here, comes across as some kind of creepy pedophile (hey, the White Witch does, too!). Not to mention the fact that Liam Neeson (while a great actor) is *no* suitable Aslan.<br/><br/>Then there are the battle scenes-- oh wow. These scenes make Rob Zombie flicks look like cinema deluxe! Throw in some poor character animation and even more *dismal* performances and you've got yourself one insipidly *hideous* film."

","My fiancé and I saw Narnia on opening weekend. Visibly, I thought it was a beautiful film. But something was missing in the plot-- it seemed too superficial and rushed to me. Granted, I haven't read the book in twenty years, so it's possible that the children would become instant friends with a lion they'd never met. Or perhaps it's just my adult mind looking at a childhood story where it doesn't seem plausible anymore. Plus, the ""main characters"" (being the children) didn't seem important as leads at all. They were just sort of... there.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton was wonderful as the White Witch. She has such a unique beauty about her that can go from elegant to fierce evil with just a change of expression. She sold me.<br/><br/>I could see it being a fun movie to take the elementary age group children. But as adults, it was just okay and won't be on my DVD purchase list.<br/><br/>There's something lacking in this movie... and I just can't figure out what it was..."
"DICK STEEL","6","9","16","12 December 2005"," A Nutshell Review: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
","This is one of seven books by CS Lewis on the fantasy world of Narnia. My earliest recall of the story was an animated cartoon, where 4 children chanced upon a wardrobe which transported them to a medieval-fantasy ice world ruled by an evil witch.<br/><br/>The introductory scene might confuse audiences that their watching Band of Brothers, though the German blitz over London is a sight to behold. Father Pevensie has gone off to fight in the war, and Mother Pevensie decided to pack the 4 Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, to the countryside to seek safe havens. They get to live with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent in an extremely underutilized role), and the youngest of them all, Lucy, discovers the Wardrobe in one of the mansion's rooms.<br/><br/>The children bicker a lot, and through their Narnia adventures, learn about the importance of family and cooperation. Disbelieving Lucy at first, the rest got introduced to the wardrobe soon enough, and thus begin their stay in Narnia only after an hour into the movie (Yes, it takes that long before something decent happens on screen). Put under an icy curse, Narnia awaits the arrival of 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve to deliver it from the clutches of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swindon, perhaps the only human form in Narnia).<br/><br/>But first, the children have to learn to make sense of the gifts bestowed upon them by Father Christmas, as well as to seek out Aslan, the mystical (speaking) lion, voiced by the regal Liam Neeson, in yet another mentor-like role after this years Kingdom of Heaven and Batman Begins. Yes, he's a good choice, but used too often it becomes deja-vu.<br/><br/>The talking animals became the talk of the town amongst some critical circles, but I say, give it a break. There are talking lions, beavers, wolves, foxes, etc, whose lips move in sync with their impeccable English, that I'm sure will sell many merchandise, probably soft toys.<br/><br/>While the cinematography is beautiful, somehow, familiarity with the source material brought about a monotone feel to the narrative. You'd know what will happen next, and the way this movie is delivered, there isn't much of a crescendo or scenes to excite. Shrek director Andrew Adamson should have known better, but opted for the safe and boring route.<br/><br/>The acting by the animals surpassed their human counterparts. The four Pevensie children are excruciating painful to watch. Their acting's very contrived and forced, and I wonder if there could be other worthy contenders amongst those who auditioned. The pixel-creations of the animators gave the animals more range than the 4 kids. Tilda Swindon looked evil throughout, but that's about it. Somehow her androgynous role as Gabriel in Constantine was way better than her role here as the resident witch.<br/><br/>The highlight is probably the much talked about, effects laden war scene, but from scenes in the trailer, there isn't much else to add. Already spoilt by mega war scenes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Chronicles doesn't go one up against what audiences already experienced, safe to substitute Uruk-hais and various Orcs with animals and mythical creatures like the centaurs. Lacking intensity throughout the battle, I was taking stock of which animal was on whose side, like the polar bears and white tigers on the side of the White Witch, and the mass of centaurs on Aslan's.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the religiousness and the classification that this film is ""Passion of the Christ"" for kids. If you subscribe to that, you'll believe anything. I think one must have read too much into the major sacrificial and resurrection scene. There is hardly any blood spilt, nor is there any major bloody torture scene to rival Mel Gibson's picture. Just because this scene is similar to Christ's resurrection, or the theme of the coming of the messiah(s), or the betrayal scene makes one label this movie as such, is stretching it a bit too far. It's a children's movie/story, for crying out loud, so just leave it as such.<br/><br/>Will this movie make money? Sure, on the fact that it's an event movie. Chronicles of Narnia built its hype, but didn't offer anything new in terms of special effects, and was weighted down by mediocre acting and a plain, bland narrative. Should there be another movie based on the books, let's hope it betters the first one."
"jandrews05","7","12","23","12 December 2005"," Didn't live up to the hype
","I've been hearing a lot about this movie for quite some time, mostly surrounding the fact that it's supposed to be the ""new"" Lord of the Rings, or replace Harry Potter and give something back to people who remember Narnia more favorably than Hogwarts from their childhood readings. I've actually never read any of the books except for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, so I was looking forward to seeing the film. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The story itself was well-told, and it remained true to C.S. Lewis' writings. Unfortunately, the child-actors were a bit on the weak side and didn't really add to the drama and epic nature of the film. Also, the CGI work was very disappointing- I expected much more from such a high-budget movie. You could most definitely tell this movie was directed by the same guy who did Shrek, a lot of the animals and larger scenes of the encampment looked fake and cheap. <br/><br/>Everyone seems to be up in arms over the religious overtones/undertones (however you like to perceive it). I myself being a Christian didn't go to the movie looking for it, I just wanted to enjoy a good movie. However, the allegories are pretty hard to miss for any educated adult who has knowledge of Christianity. And yes, some pastor's have used that too their advantage, and rightly so - that's their job. But in all honesty, if you were looking for a strong film to formulate a message from, I'd go with something that had a better quality to it. <br/><br/>The movie is indeed a fun film, full of adventure and wonder. Not quite on the epic level of Lord of the Rings, so don't get your hopes up. For kids and teens, I think its an excellent movie that might inspire some kids to pick up the book when they get home. It's a good thing too, because I think the book captures the imagination much more than the movie did."
"stranger-23","3","12","23","12 December 2005"," Disneyfying a classic
","There've been quite a few rave reviews of this film, but many of them are raving about the story. The story is undeniably excellent -- there are reasons it has stood the test of time. It's powerful and resonates to adults and children alike.<br/><br/>This adaptation, however, was tremendously disappointing. Adamson made the strange choice of cutting out or glossing over several moments in the book that, while small, were pivotal indications that the children were in the process of maturing -- growing from the uncertainty and fear of childhood to the strength and responsibility of young adulthood. This was an important theme in the book; by removing it from the movie, the children are boring, static, and mostly unchanging. Protagonists that do not change through conflict don't make an interesting story.<br/><br/>Moreover, due to this being a Disney film, there was no blood or actual violence. This is a book with violent and bloody moments -- battles, deaths, and a pivotal scene of torture and sacrifice. In the movie, at the end of this sacrifice, Aslan looked like a cuddly stuffed animal, not a broken, dead victim. When Edmund was stabbed, there was a little spot on his shirt; no actual blood. There was no sense of the danger Edmund put himself in to destroy the Witch's wand if you couldn't see the repercussions. Why would Disney option a story with crucial violent and bloody scenes if they weren't willing to depict them?<br/><br/>The CGI animals were beautifully done -- the beavers, Aslan, Mr. Tumnus. Excellent. No surprise from the director of Shrek. But the green-screen work was some of the worst I've seen in the last ten years; I dread seeing this on DVD if it looked that bad on the big screen.<br/><br/>That said, I'd give high marks for the acting. The children did very well with what they had, Mr. Tumnus was one of the high points of the film, and Tilda Swinton took my breath away every time I saw her. Aslan was very well-voiced. Good acting can make up for a whole lot of sloppy directing."
"Bachfeuer","9","8","14","10 December 2005"," Whose Christianity?
","It has been a long time since I found a fantasy film with a lot of special effects so satisfying as ""Narnia."" It is exquisitely crafted, visually gorgeous, has some fine performances, and itlike the underlying materialis more challenging than Harry Potter and more interesting than Tolkien.<br/><br/>There is huge irony and hypocrisy to the embrace of ""Narnia"" by the same conservative Christians who would burn Harry Potter at the stake for witchcraft. The free mixture of some Christian symbolism with the CelticPaganfairy world ought to offend them just as much. Doing a talking lion to death on a Druid altar and then bringing him back to life is not the same thing as the resurrection, after all. By their lights, that fairy world is demonic, and the premise is abominable heresy. It would seem that fundamentalist Christians embrace C.S. Lewis because doing so is good for wedge-issue politics.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that backlash from the studio's misrepresentation of ""Narnia"" as some sort of bitter, right-wing medicine like ""The Passion of the Christ"" will deny it some of the popular success it deserves."
"tedg","Null","11","21","15 December 2005"," Lucy in the Sky
","Writing about big movies like this is a real pleasure because you can assume that the reader has already been exposed to the mainstream opinions and obvious controversies. So one can focus on other, perhaps more interesting issues.<br/><br/>I was never a fan of Lewis' romantic Christianity and his allegorical crusade, not with the genius of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as the benchmark. Or the King Arthur stories. But I have to admit that while I found his written tale dull as Oxford dust, his storytelling ability had magic, and that was what made the thing fun for many. That business about the narrator being explicit and commenting on what is happening is lost in the two movies.<br/><br/>Oh, I should say that you really should see the 88 BBC version first. It was both cheaper and more magical. It had much better kids except for the young girl. Neither production gave us an awareness of the powers of the Queen (except via wand), so that power had to be carried by intensity. Therefore, the screaming queen of 1988 fit better into the dynamics of the world.<br/><br/>If you do see the 1988 version, it will remind you how artless this modern one is. I'd say about a quarter of the shots in this new one are almost perfect copies from the older. Look at really great productions; ""Aliens"" comes to mind, and you will note that there is not a single interesting design in this whole thing. Every shot, every character (mostly dumb rubber masks in queen associates) every character action is from the third bin down in familiarity. That is, except Tilda.<br/><br/>Magic should be in the way the thing is portrayed. Nothing here seems magical at all, nothing like ""Time Bandits"" for instance, or a few of the better parts of ""Lord or the Rings."" The sets were dull, the magical places ordinary.<br/><br/>I am an admirer of Tilda. I'll see anything she is in and expect to enjoy it. She did have a captivating sequence here in the final battle, but it was ruined in a way by the dreadfully staged ""stone table"" sequence before. Straight out of a 40s cannibal movie, with a set so cheesy and artless it made me squirm. No Baz Luhrman here.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. Tilda knows a whole lot more about what works and what doesn't than the director. So she's created her own character in his vacuum, her own wardrobe and makeup. Some of that is great, but it doesn't fit anything, not the book, and not the lumpy director's vision, or what it seems to be.<br/><br/>So what you end up with that's positive, is an appealing young girl, an amazing witch in the battle scene, and one extremely nice cinematic effect. It was so good it made everything else seem cinematically unimaginative. This was when Lucy pulled the sheet off the wardrobe to reveal the tree carving (Alice again!). The dramatic movement of that drape was wonderful, just wonderful. It was featured in the trailer. Then you got Lucy's gaze for the first time, one that is repeated tiresomely thereafter.<br/><br/>That this wonderful bit of magic came and went before Narnia appears made me look in vain for more.<br/><br/>(There's another scene that could have been great. While Lucy is being hypnotized, virtual satyrs dance in the fireplace, a sort of dream within the vision within the movie. Another director might have implied what Lewis does, that everything that follows could be Lucy's Dream.)<br/><br/>Oh, there's one overt decision the director made. A sad one. He decided to play up the Nazi angle. So we have that incongruous bombing sequence where the Germans look like monsters. This gave Tilda her cue to have an Aryan look and movieland Nazi coldness.<br/><br/>What follows is an intrusion of the American battle narrative on the original British one: war is depicted as inherently vile at the beginning up until Santa Claus becomes an arms merchant. Thereafter it is depicted as glorious, with the girls now involved as warriors. The shift is that Christians are battling evildoers, you see. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","Although the movie's mood is much brighter than C.S. Lewis' book ""The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe"" - it's still not your average Disney-family adventure. For one thing the child actors actually look like people, not like surgically enhanced dolls (the actor of Peter actually really much resembles Englands Prince William...) - and they play pleasantly subtle. The decor of the world Narnia is not too fanciful and the lighting looks mostly natural. The CGI's are amazing: all the talking, running, flying animals - and especially the great lion Aslan - actually seem to have some weight at last. If it wasn't for the grand epic score that all too much resembles the ""Lord of the Rings""- Trilogy, this would be a likable enough. But the score is over-persuasive all through the film. It doesn't allow you a second to take a breath, think for yourself and makes you feel strained out after the first half hour or so. A contradiction in itself: how the images work so hard on creating a whole different universe. And the soundtrack/score at the same time works so hard on making it sound like any other blockbuster of the season ..."

","Awful dreck. I read the books as a kid and I really wanted to like this movie.

It is CS Lewis, for God's sake, how on earth could they mess this up? The story of Narnia is rich, fulfilling and extremely gripping and entertaining. Mr. Lewis wrote a marvelous tale of fantasy and adventure that surely any trained professional screen writer could adapt into a marvelous movie.<br/><br/>Not so the case here. This movie was full of boring clichés, idiotic dialogue, boring scenes of nothing, then too fast scenes where actions take place so fast you can not be sure exactly what is happening and why.<br/><br/>These people should have studied The Lord of the Ring films. I mean for the cost of a weekend rental they could have had an epic movie making seminar and maybe they would not have ended up with this mess of a film that is right now playing in the background on my lap top.<br/><br/>Writing this review is more entertaining than this watching movie. <br/><br/>What is up with the acting in this movie? Seriously, not a good performance among the cast is to be had. Everyone seems as bored as I am right now. I just could care less about any of the main characters. Honestly.<br/><br/>I will say the one thing I was impressed with was the lion. Good special effect. But that is it. The actor doing the voice of Aslan sounds like he is reading a long menu and can't decide what he wants to order.<br/><br/>Well, watch it if you must. But you should read the books. As I said, they are fun, exciting, well imagined and written.<br/><br/>I hope someone who knows how to make a great epic adventure film comes along and has a go at Narnia.

","I went to watch this movie expecting it to be the usual winter big budget movie (not much substance park your brain at the door but still entertaining), but came away very disappointed. <br/><br/>The Positives: The special effects were quite good! Aslan was amazing.<br/><br/>Sadly though, that is all I can say that was good with this movie. They spent too much time trying to awe you with scenery and cgi characters rather than developing the movie. There was almost no character development so I failed to connect or care about the characters. I think a better casting job could have been done for the main characters. Tilda looked excellent as the White Witch, but she came across as a clichéd evil witch in a movie. The children were for the most part annoying. I'm not sure if this is in part, the children have limited acting experience, or if the director failed to make the characters interesting (ala George Lucas failing to make you care for the characters in Star Wars episode I II II). It's never good when the most engaging characters in the movie are cgi generated Beavers. They basically glossed over the plot of the movie leaving out parts that were key to making audience understand the underlying motivation for the characters. <br/><br/>As sad as I am to say this, I wish I never watched this movie. The failure to make the characters interesting sinks this movie for me. I was ready to leave the theatre after 45 minutes. <br/><br/>As a counter to my opinion, my Girlfriend enjoyed the movie very much."
"Paul1149","6","7","12","8 May 2008"," A disappointment
","I wanted to like this movie, but at almost all times I was aware that I was ""watching a movie"". It never really moved my soul. The acting was frankly very bad. The emotional depictions were worse. The screenplay wasn't great either. The scenery, the special effects, however - with the exception of most of the animals' talking - were good. <br/><br/>I began to hope that the appearance of Aslan would save the film, but he was a disappointment as well. The majestic King seems like a big stuffed toy from FAO Swartz.<br/><br/>The whole thing comes off as childish. I often thought that it would be OK to pass this movie off on a kid, but not an adult. Even the classic lines at the end, ""After all, Aslan is not a tame lion / But he is good"" simply had no power whatsoever.<br/><br/>In the inevitable comparison to the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy, there simply is no contest. That's a shame, because the Lewis writings are truly superb and deserve far better treatment. Now that this version is done, it will serve as a firewall preventing a better interpretation from being done for a long time.<br/><br/>As I said, I wanted to like the movie. Not only do I enjoy the richness of the original story, I love its Christian underpinnings as well. I remember years ago being genuinely moved by a simple animated version of this story, especially the scene of the death of Aslan, where there was a holy silence that descended not only on the land of Narnia but on my own heart as well; but this expensive production barely stirred me. It may well be that Disney is simply out of its depth with this kind of rendering, that its massive corporate group-think actually works against producing an artistic work of this kind when using real actors rather than pictures.<br/><br/>That's sad, for what could have been but is not."

","Narnia: a world created in the mind of C.S. Lewis and transferred onto paper to be shared with the rest of the world. For the longest time it was believed that his world, along with the world of fellow Inkling J.R.R. Tolkien could not be done any justice on a two dimensional screen. The imagination of the writer in combination with the reader was by far superior.<br/><br/>However, both worlds have come to life in a big way. Thanks to some spectacular CGI characters and landscapes, Narnia has been transferred from the pages of this beloved children's series onto the big screen.<br/><br/>Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are sent off to the countryside during the bombing raids over London. They are taken in by a professor, and find his house suitable for playing hide and seek. During the game, the youngest Pevensie, Lucy, discovers a wardrobe and finds her way inside, only to be transported to the land of Narnia.<br/><br/>While there, she meets one of the Narnian's, a faun named Tumnus. He tells her why Narnia is in the condition that it is, and then allows her to go back to her world.<br/><br/>Lucy then tries to convince everyone else of this world, but nobody believes her. Edmund is the next one to find his way into Narnia, and meets Jadis the White Witch. After giving him something to drink and some candy, she sends him back to bring his brother and sisters to her.<br/><br/>It then happens that one day all the children find themselves running for cover after a mishap into the wardrobe. It is then that the adventure begins.<br/><br/>Other than some scenes where it was obvious that a green screen was used, the integration of live action and animation was simply amazing. The mythological creatures not only looked real, their movements were fluid and extremely believable. And considering the cast was made up of mostly unknown names (other than a couple big names) the acting was superb on all counts.<br/><br/>It may not be a film quite on the scale of Lord of the Rings, but make a note that it is a franchise well on it's way for years to come."
"orcristtheblack","9","6","10","9 December 2005"," Lord of the Rings Lite
","I thought I would begin by getting the comparison to the blockbuster of the last few years out in the open. This film has much of the same magic, the same keen eye for details in a fantasy world, the same scope and majesty. It is just as good, and in some ways better. It clocks in at a much more manageable time, especially for those who got the extended cuts,and doesn't weigh in quite as heavily on the psyche. That said, this film was beautiful. Image after image, that was the word that continued to pop into my head. The special effects did their job beautifully and fleshed out one of the greatest fantasy worlds, even if the story wasn't well done, which it is, it was practically worth the price of admission just for the visual and audio feast. As far as the story goes, those who feared overt Christian allegory need fear no more. Yes, this is the Aslan from the books, who dies and comes back to life. Yes, much has been made of Aslan as a Christ figure. Yes, the comparison can be made in the film. But, there is no push to force the audience to see it that way. If you prefer taking Aslan's death and rebirth as exactly portrayed in the film, an aspect of the magic of Narnia, then there is nothing to impede you from doing so. And Aslan was beautiful, perhaps not quite as majestic as the filmmakers were hoping, but well done nevertheless. And the minotaurs were oh so cool. This was a good film that had only minor glitches that come from working with a very young cast and a huge amount of CGI. Definitely one to watch and keep an eye out for at the Oscars."

Everybody who enjoys fantasy literature and movies, or never lost that special kid that exists in all of us will like this film.<br/><br/>Narnia is different (and much older) than Harry Potter by the way.Without Narnia I really don't know if Harry Potter books (among others) would exist, since C.S. Lewis is one of the inspirations of J.K. Rowlling, the author of the Harry Potter's books. Spite some similarities with Lord of the Rings, the plot is different , and in fact, C.S. Lewis and Tolkien were friends, so I guess they both had mutual inspirations and mutual interferences in each other's stories. The reason why I am writing this is because I am tired of seeing so many people comparing Harry Potter to Narnia, and Lord of the Rings to Narnia, when the only thing they have in common is the fantasy genre.<br/><br/>Many people also think that Narnia is an allegory for Christianity or for its message, because of the Aslan's death(meaning his sacrifice for Edmund) and his resurrection after that.

It may be a bit slow at times but they captured the story well. Jim Broadbent has a small role and is so adorable as the Professor especially when you think about the roles he's done in Moulin Rouge and Bridget Jones. I also thought Lucy was just as sweet although sometimes she seems like shes smiling when shes crying. The animation was amazing from the beavers to Aslan and it wasn't used excessively (e.g they used real people in the war scene -at least when they were cheering - not computer mess). But let me criticize. Tilda Swinton is a good actress but I felt like the Queen was like a Xena Warrior Princess wannabe and some of the lines were so corny I wanted to laugh. I was disappointed when Lucy enters Narnia for the first time as I felt she could have expressed more surprise and made it like a Dorothy entering the coloured world of Oz scene - which by the way is so magical it always gives me goosebumps.

They alternated between real animals, real animals with realistic movements (see: Babe), and full CG, the latter of which was extremely realistic. Make-up and costuming for creatures like the fawns, centaurs, minotaurs, orcs, goblins, etc. were mostly well done, in some cases, amazing. The White Witch, played by Tilda Swinton (Gabriel from Constantine) did an extremely superb job. I don't think they could have found a better actress to play the part. She was extremely cold, cruel, and distant, something only she could pull off that perfectly. Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn from Star Wars) voices Aslan and does a better job than Sean Connery could ever hope to.<br/><br/>Fans of the book or the original movie will notice a few changes. Nothing major. Basically, they made the story better by adding a few more intense scenes of action where there were previously boring segments of nothing. Some talk was cut short to keep the story moving at an even pace, so you won't get too bored with this one. A mighty fine film, something you must all see! <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this one better than Goblet of Fire. Some people will probably disagree, but it really depends on what elements you like in a story. I love me my Harry Potter movies, don't get me wrong, but something about this was just so wonderful and enchanting that I can't help but walk away a bit more impressed. It gives Lord of the Rings a run for it's money, and seeing how all seven books have been optioned for film development, I can't wait for the rest! <br/><br/>Long story short: SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"

","This film ruins any good memories of reading the book as a child. The acting skills are poor, especially the four children. The effects and sets are cheap and tacky ,eg - Mr Tumnus's ears! The worst thing was the ""star"" voices of the animals which do not fit at all especially the wolf, the beavers and aslan. The film is totally boring and dull and people were leaving early. On a plus point, I didn't notice any god-bothering message to the film its just a total bore, The book is so much better ,this film is so cheap looking and it is directed like a lifeless pop video.

Then it just went downhill really really REALLY far downhill, the acting throughout was utterly terrible, the cgi disgracefully poor, the bad rip offs of lord of the rings almost as laughably poor as the scene stolen from harold and kumar! i tried looking at the film as an afterthought from a film student's perspective after all that is what i am, i really wish i hadn't done that now as that just made it even worse if it was possible.<br/><br/>I guess the one and only well 1 and a half good things the film's got going for it Jim broadbent is fairly spot on at bringing the delightful professor to life, and the half goes to the half decent reasonably chucklesome beavers.<br/><br/>Save your money don't go see it, read the book and let your imagination take you to narnia rather than a terrible movie."
"sarahwarea","2","11","23","8 December 2005"," What happened, where did the magic go?
","I have been looking forward to this film for months. Every time a trailer has played before another film, I have become more and more excited about it, I've hyperventilated, I've been counting down the days, I even persuaded my boyfriend to come and see it with me - I was really really looking forward to it...<br/><br/>...And I was so disappointed. I wanted to cry halfway through, and not because the film was 'moving' me in any way at all. I don't mind changes being made to the book so long as I can understand why the changes were made. I agreed with all of Peter Jackson's changes to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I just wish that the same discretion and consideration had been taken here. Parts of the book were needlessly cut, whilst others were added and didn't even make sense  for example, was the scene with the river and the wolves really necessary? Other than to make us all question why they didn't die of hypothermia? I was also looking forward to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. I really believed that she could carry it off and believe me she was trying, but a really bad script didn't help her; there was no space for her to even attempt evil and scary (Barbara Kellerman did much better in the TV series). It's also hard to be afraid of someone with extra shoulders and back built into her dress.<br/><br/>The pace of the film was too fast in my opinion, leaving no time for the audience to really care about the characters. The script was lacking tending too much towards clichés and flippant comments. The music seemed to me to jar with the scenes. Even the direction was questionable. I feel cheated, this was meant to be perfect, a new 'Lord of the Rings' for 2005 hopefully leading to a new series, something to look forward to every Christmas. I don't think I'll be going to see any of the others if they get made, not if they are like this.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the film and the only reason it has two stars rather than one is down to two things. Firstly the acting of the children  especially Georgie Henley and William Moseley. Also the location and scenery was really well chosen making Narnia a real country. Other than that, I don't think I have been more disappointed by a film in my life."
"moooser42","10","7","13","9 December 2005"," Wow!
","After i saw this movie on Thursday, there was not much i could say. I was speechless. This film is definitely worthy of the book, and follows it very well. It begins amazing from the start with the World war, england bombings and the four children having to leave England. It is then when they must go to the mansion with the wardrobe. Narnia is not only a great action movie, but also quite funny. The whole theater laughed exuberantly at several parts of the movie. As the book continues, the laughs continue but larger emotions come into play. The director does a wonderful job switching emotions from tears to smiles. Of course the most amazing part, in which ever one will be talking about is the war scene. This was spectacular! The graphics are amazing and the scenes feel realistic while maintaining a PG rating. Last off, the ending does not fall short or have less impact than the ending in the book. It wonderfully finishes the film. Also, it's important to stay in the theater after the credits, there is one more small scene. The movie is brilliant, however there are some parts where people who haven't read the book may be a bit unsure of whats going on ex: the white stag, i suggest you read at least part of the book before watching this breathtaking movie!"
"OneLuvlyGrl","10","7","13","7 December 2005"," Saw ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" in an advance screening...
","Wow, what can I say about this movie? In one word: Phenomenal! As a fan of the whole fantasy D&D genera, I have to say that ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" did a wonderful job in capturing the essence of that all around. <br/><br/>The sets and scenery that were chosen was perfect. The Centaur (half-human, half-horse) race in the movie has to be the BEST on screen vision of them I have ever seen. The fawn, Mr. Tumnus played by James McAvoy was completely superb. He brought such a warmth and sympathy to the character, even when he was about to turn in Lucy, played by Georgie Henley. Georgie is quite the cute girl and beyond her 10 year old age in talent. The other kids in the film, Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), and Anna Popplewell (Susan) were also amazing. With their talent I felt like I was watching adults versus children on screen. It was great to see Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. I enjoyed here in ""Constantine"" (starring Keanu Reeves) and after seeing her in Narnia, I had wondered why she wasn't in more big films. After this I hope she will be in more! <br/><br/>Also, I must add that Liem Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion and Rupert Everett as the voice of the Fox, were pure genius! Most of the time, with the vocal acting and the computer animation I forgot that what I was watching were animals. Speaking of animals....could Mr. and Mrs. Beaver be any cuter? I loved it!<br/><br/>I am glad I didn't jump out of my seat right and the end as well...I might have missed that one last scene!<br/><br/>As for me, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" is the MUST SEE movie of the holiday season that is great for the whole family. Not only will children love it, but adults will become mesmerized with this film that gives a good message and leaves you with warmth in your heart. I can't wait for more!"
"amyruss_554","6","6","11","15 December 2005"," A little let down
","Was this a good movie? - Yes. Was it well cast and acted? Yes. Was the scenery and animation convincing and even beautiful? I thought so. But as someone who first heard this tale as a bedtime story when I was 3 or 4 years old and having read the book now numerous times, I have to say I was disappointed. I know I can't expect perfection or a word to word exact translation from book to film but the movie seemed to alter the personality of the book just enough for me to feel let down. It was as if they took the body of the book striped it down to it's bare bones and then fitted it with a new body. So much of the charm of the book is in the humor and wit of its author which I didn't see or feel in the movie at all. The rhythm felt all off to me. I don't understand why they added some stuff that didn't enhance the story any (in my opinion) and didn't make it any shorter, and took out important dialogue that gave much more depth to the different characters. There were scenes I thought were done very well and if I had never read the book I'm sure I would think it a great and entertaining movie. But I have read the book, backwards and forwards, and to a hard core fan like me this movie did not cut it. I am sorry to be such a downer in the midst of all this praise, and I think those involved in the film should feel proud - it is a good movie - I just can't help but feel it could of been more. But maybe a movie maker has more to consider than keeping us hard core book fans happy and also need to think of those who have never read the book at all. And I will always have the book - just the way it is, and I can always use my imagination to go to the Narnia I have gone to as a child. I hope I never lose that magic and never grow to old and lose the power of my imagination - I don't believe C.S. Lewis ever did."

Aslan (while not exactly what I had pictured in my mind's eye) was pretty good.<br/><br/>Amazing special effects that often made you forget that you were looking at CGI.<br/><br/>It is nice to be able to see a movie that is actually worth the cost of admission."
"divaclv","9","6","11","10 December 2005"," A doorway to magic
","Those who go to ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" expecting another ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" will be disappointed--but it's their own fault if they are. Just as C.S. Lewis' fairytale kingdom is a different animal entirely from Tolkien's culturally and historically complex Middle-Earth or Rowling's strange-yet-familiar Hogwarts, so the films based on these three landmark fantasy series differ in style and tone and must be taken on their own terms. And on its own terms, ""Narnia"" is a delight.<br/><br/>Like many stories in which denizens of our reality are thrust into another one, the opening scenes of ""Narnia"" are dark and dreary--it's World War II, the Germans are bombing London, and children are being sent to the countryside to ensure the future of the nation. The four Pevensie siblings find themselves relocated to a dusty mansion owned by a reclusive and eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent in a brilliant cameo) in a tiny backwater. The housekeeper tells the kids they are not to run, or touch anything, or in any way behave like normal children. It looks like they're in for a dull time--until youngest sister Lucy (Georgie Henley) discovers a wardrobe that opens up into Narnia, where animals and trees talk, centaurs and griffins roam freely and the entire country is on the brink of its own war between the evil White Witch (a chillingly cruel Tilda Swinton) and the lion-messiah Aslan (voice by Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>Lewis was vocally opposed to a live-action film of his vision--but in his day, this would have certainly meant people in animal suits and puppets. It would be presumptuous to speculate whether or not he would have approved of this Narnia, but for my own part I found it enchanting. From the moment Lucy backs her way through a sea of fur coats and is startled to brush against a snow-covered evergreen, director Andrew Adamson and his production team strike all the right notes visually and emotionally, while avoiding almost all the inherent stumbling blocks. A key example is the scene where Father Christmas (James Cosmo) enters Narnia, after the Witch's magic prevented the holiday for a century despite an endless winter. This is a moment that could have easily been dull or ridiculous, but it works here, with Cosmo providing a ideal physical embodiment of the hope and joy that has languished under the White Witch's rule. Humor abounds--Lucy's first encounter with the faun Tumnus (James McAvoy) is wonderfully light-hearted--but chases and battles pack the necessary punch, and the climactic scene where Aslan fulfills a dreadful bargain with the Witch is perfectly chilling. The visuals are splendid, and the computer-generated characters are mostly convincing--Aslan in particular is rendered with the right amount of quiet majesty and dignity, which compliments Neeson's restrained yet authoritative vocal performance.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the Christian parallels inherent in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" but ultimately the religious undertones of the movie depend on the viewer. The allegory is clearly drawn for those who seek it, but it is not so obtrusive as to alienate those simply looking for a good family movie. With the wonders of ""Narnia"" playing right next door to the marvelous ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" young moviegoers and their parents have an embarrassment of riches this holiday."
"cwboldt","9","6","11","10 December 2005"," Striking, Elegant and Incredible
","I'll keep this short.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully done. Visually it is stunning, with several 'gasp inspiring' moments. The direction is fantastic- especially with the use of music and silence and sudden chaotic action. The musical score fits perfectly with the movie and is unique.<br/><br/>All the acting is very credible- especially by children so young. Tilda is amazing (naturally). Also, I thought I may hate Liam as the Lion, but I honestly didn't.<br/><br/>The Christian allegory is all there to be sure, but I don't think Christianity has a monopoly on the theme of self-sacrifice for the greater good. That theme is used time and again in good storytelling. And in the context of this movie, it is utterly powerful.<br/><br/>And best of all, the story hasn't been tampered with (too much). Granted there are some differences, but overall the storyline stays very faithful to the book (unlike the most recent Harry Potter movie).<br/><br/>This Buddhist DEFINITELY recommends this movie."
"dreg_87","7","6","11","9 December 2005"," Great visual adventure, but somewhat flat
","I have read all of the Narnia books, and being a film student in college, I was eagerly anticipating this movie, and went to the opening show. After leaving the theater at 2:30 in the morning, I felt it difficult to describe how I felt about the film. As a visual epic, it is beautiful, and well done. The land of Narnia is beautifully brought to life, and the art direction, props, creatures, costumes, are all equally spectacular. It is a very broad and epic movie, with all sorts of different creatures and monsters for the audience to stare in fascination at. So visually, well done, I have very few complaints. But the story, the actual film as a whole felt lacking to me. As I said I have read the books, and I was impressed that very little was changed at all, in fact I had a hard time remembering anything. Nearly everything important was preserved from the book, with little to no alteration. Yet in the end, I didn't feel the story, it didn't emotionally move me. The acting was good, yet flat and predictable much of the time. In fact because so much of the story was preserved, I felt like it was just a copy of the books. And while that is good, especially to 'purists' of the book, film is a different medium from literature, and thus the style has to change somewhat in order to evoke what the books do. But I don't hate the film, I thought it was quite good, I loved the books, and I like this film as well. It just didn't have the depth and emotional truth of the books. See this movie, it is good, I will again, because I imagine many people will have a different reaction."
"sprocketmason","3","8","16","9 December 2005"," oh dearie me - Harry Potter and Aragorn have little to worry about
","Pace: this movie was soooo slow to start with - the first hour dragged terribly, and degenerated into a predictable tennis match of terrible jeopardy and close shaves and narrow rescues and shouts of defiance.<br/><br/>Effects: some of the creature animation was not bad, but the integration of the real world with the studio stuff and the animated backgrounds and creatures was awful: including the cartoon-like German bombers at the beginning. Some of the shots of the kids in the Narnia landscapes looked like they were done at a cheap photographic studio in Yonkers. The makeup was often dodgy (the professor's facial hair, Mr Tumnus' nose, the witch's battle mascara at the final battle). Most annoyingly the real world production design (the professor's house, the interior of the ice palace, the snowy forest, the bits of dressed stone and wood, the Narnia interiors) looked sooooo fake, like an Olde Englishe theme bar. In fact, it looked like nothing had advanced in fantasy cineman since The Neverending Story!!!<br/><br/>Acting: the kids looked as if they could have been out-acted by princes William and Harry, apart from Edmund who was quite good. The faun was weird and should have been cast much older than the valiant McAvoy. Tilda Swinton was not nearly as menacing or sexy as she should have been (and she could have been), her combat and wand-waving/magic skills were garbage.<br/><br/>Music: generic fantasy type orchestral swells with no memorable themes a la LOTR, and some uneasily integrated modern stuff, with a forgettable pop song at the closing credits."

This poorly acted (except for Georgie Henley) rendition of one of my childhood favourites was so chalk full of preachy goodness and disgustingly saccharine sentimentality that my teeth ached by the end of the film.

The effects are... hmm... decent... but not as well done as they were hyped and the epic battle scene was rather cliché. Though, it is Disney and I can almost understand why there would be a conscious decision to pull out some of the intensity for the sake of the children.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that this is a case of crispy on the outside, raw on the inside, typical, Disney trash. And now that I have lowered your expectation, hopefully you can enjoy it more than I did."
"haltseven","1","11","24","12 December 2005"," Laugh Out Loud Funny
","The movie is seriously ""laugh out loud funny."" The sad thing is that it's not supposed to be a comedy. It's really unfortunate because I recall the book being excellent when I read it as a child.<br/><br/>When we saw the movie, there were several scenes that were supposed to be serious where we literally couldn't help but laugh. For instance, the moment in the battle where the white witch tries to cut Peter's neck with the two swords and he leans back just in time - DRAMA! - there's a pause in the scene to catch it in a quasi-matrix mode. So funny because it's so pathetic.<br/><br/>Also, I felt that the casting of the children was off, with the exception of William Moseley as Peter Pevensie. Look, I get that the littlest girl, Lucy, is supposed to be cute. Frankly, the girl who plays her isn't - she's being overly directed to try to come across as cute, which of course, kills it. Plus, it would be extremely helpful if each of these young actors learned that when you're supposed to be ""crying"" you probably shouldn't be ""smiling."" The feeling I was left with throughout the film was that I could sense the director speaking to the children and all of the extras from behind the camera. His entire direction would be something to the effect of telling his actors, ""Okay now, look happy! Everyone be happy! Yay!!!"" ""Okay, now everybody be sad. Look sad... turn down the sides of your mouth and whimper a bit... Great!!!"" The children and extras' acting styles were forced, which is an obvious result of the directors failings - it's clear that professionals like Tilda Swinton know how to carry a scene without the awful distraction of Andrew Adamson's direction. Previous to this movie, Adamson's directing has been kept to animated films like Shrek. He should have stuck with that.<br/><br/>This movie was so bad I would have much rather spent the 2+ hours actually reading Lewis' masterpiece. Disney, can I get my money AND my time back please? Thanks."

","Too juvenile for those of us who were fans from our youth. Great for kids 12 and under - great cinematography, but really poor script and acting from a number of the child characters. I found myself sitting in my seat more interested in some of the effects and film shots rather than being enthralled by the story. The script attempted very dumb humor after some very interesting character play in the beginning. The film also, in my view, attempted a very ""Lord of the Rings"" cinema feel; this has been seen in some other movies, attempting to make Peter Jackson's work a style of movie rather than the interpretation of one series that it was. I think I would have rather seen Jackson's take on this movie, but he was too busy directing ""King Kong"", I guess. The movie showed promise, but the lack of such promise was realized when the title ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" was emblazoned across the screen in a branding-type manner. The movie is more about a brand than telling a classic story."

","As much as my wife and I were looking forward to the recent release of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" I very disappointed with the movie, even judging it on its own merits and not comparing it to the book or previous movies. However, as primitive as the 1998 movie version of this book was, it far exceeded ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" in so many ways. In this movie, the casting was horrible, the dialog was terrible and emotionless (especially Tumnus  James McAvoy), the actors unattractive (Tilda Swinton and Georgie Henley), and most importantly, the Andrew Adamson (director) didn't capture the essence of the C.S. Lewis book. There was too much focus on Mrs. MacReady (minor character) and not enough focus on the Professor. The audio of the special effect characters, such as Aslan, Beavers, and Fox, was too close to the audience and not in place with the setting of the scene.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie 1 of 5 stars had it not been for the special effects, which were truly amazing. Talking animals, flying beasts, hybrid goons, and a fantastic battle scene added to the excitement of the moment and I temporarily forgot how awful the rest of it was.<br/><br/>The movie ending doesn't allow for a smooth continuation, and I seriously doubt they'll get the funding to do a sequel.

"jburtroald95","1","5","9","8 March 2009"," Utterly disgusting, a shameful mockery of the beloved fantasy classic
","Many years ago a great literary genius captured children's imaginations with an astonishing fantastical masterpiece inspired an old vision of his in which a faun was standing in the snow holding an umbrella.<br/><br/>In 2005, Disney  after watching for years the excitement and wonder that the Harry Potter adaptations had conjured up - became jealous of Warner Brothers for their incredible ability to create such an incredible fantasy series that people of all ages could enjoy and used this novel to try and do the same.<br/><br/>The results are ghastly, clearly all these people are interested in is making just another depthless action blockbuster and since they can't be bothered coming up with their own story they've borrowed someone else'. Here we see that in chasing this nightmarish dream the director  Andrew Adamson  has abandoned the story, the richness, the warmth and the characters and left them to rot while he tries to cook up an entire film based purely on special effects and stunt work. Well I must say he's failed at that, the cheaply done CG animals are so lifeless and fake that they make plastic figurines look like the real thing. The same can be said for the painfully numerous action scenes which are slow, irritating, completely unnecessary and appear to be merely dodgy tricks to fill in time.<br/><br/>The cast is almost no help at all; most of them give such bland performances that the marvellous array of different characters just becomes one big tedious mess. I doubt any of them have even read the book let alone understood it, and they seem to have just gone with the obvious stereotype. The best example of this is the clueless Tilda Swinton, who gives such a revolting performance that she should have her Oscar confiscated. Jardis is a tyrannical monster of a woman that seeks to control all of Narnia no matter the cost, Swinton turns her into a harmless ditsy little fairy princess.<br/><br/>Though that said there are a few exceptions: Georgie Henley is just perfect as Lucy, the young actress portrays the character with all the sweetness, innocence and vulnerability that she deserves; James McAvoy does show the tentative, emotional and brave sides of Mr Tumnus very well; and Jim Broadbent does a fair job in the role of the professor.<br/><br/>But all in all this is nothing short of pathetic, aside from those three actors there is not a smidgeon of talent to be seen in any areas of this film and it is a terrible adaptation of C.S.Lewis' treasured rare gem.<br/><br/>However, devoted fans of the book do not despair: there is a splendidly done 1988 BBC television adaptation directed by Marilyn Fox and starring Sophie Wilcox, Jonathan.R.Scott, Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Barbara Kellerman and William Todd Jones."
"Falconeer","3","5","9","11 August 2006"," Typical Disney mess
","The problem with Disney is that they try way too hard to sell the product, to rake in the big bucks, and it is quite obvious when one watches this ""epic."" While the cast is quite good and attractive, too much just did not work here. Why does Disney always have to include the standard ""talking animals doing the stand-up comedy bit?"" The wolves looked good, genuinely scary, until the lead wolf started to talk. He sounded as menacing as Richard Simmons. I guess the guys at Disney were afraid that if they included any scary or intense moments at all, then the parents wouldn't shell out the bucks at the movie houses and then at the DVD store. Everything was so fanatically politically correct. No, the oldest boy could never stab the wolf that was about to eat his brother and sisters. The wolf literally jumped on the sword. I am not saying the film should have been filled with the same frightful images as the thousand times better LOTR. But this limp adaption of a classic children's book is just disappointing. Every commercial stunt was pulled here to ensure big numbers at the box office. I hate this kind of movie-making. And even more, i miss the days before computer imaging replaced real special effects, or real anything for that matter. Why build a magnificent kingdom, even if it is on miniature scale, when they can simply super-impose the image onto the screen? It must save the studios billions of dollars. The only problem is, it looks like crap. It was obvious that most of the landscape was simply not there. Personally if i want to look at this kind of thing, I would prefer simple animation, classic Saturday morning cartoons. I suppose after the cinematic milestone that was Lord Of the Rings, it will be quite difficult for anything to live up to that films grandeur. And perhaps computer imaging was used in LOTR, but it was done so much better. The landscapes, the cities, the million plus armies, actually looked real for the most part. I guess however, that kids will love ""Narnia."" Most kids are fairly easy to please. Look at all the junk on TV every Saturday morning! This one is a disappointment."

When I saw this movie in the theaters, I didn't realize all the allusions to the bible for some unknown reason, but after reading some comments in here, I totally agree with all of them.<br/><br/>The battle sequences were short and monotonous and boring. Not were they any exciting, and it all seemed like the director tried to make something like Peter Jackson did with his magnificent LOTR trilogy. This movie doesn't even come close. not even.<br/><br/>BTW, does anyone agree that Mr. Tumnus first seemed like a pedophile when he met Lucy the first time? Tilda Swinton and some of the technical aspects of the movie were the only good parts about this, but what does that matter when the story and storytelling is horrible? The only thing I could think of when leaving the theater, was how much one could've gotten for that wardrobe on some auction. And the only reason I give it a 2 in rating is that it had one part that was completely superb - the end credits - it marked the end of this cinematic equivalent of a turd. Skip this turgid mess."

","Perhaps when I went into the cinema to watch this movie I had set my expectations too high. After all, the book has been my favourite thing to read since i was about nine and I was nineteen when the movie came out. However just because i was older does not mean i love the book any less; i can read it whenever i have a minute because the story is just so gripping. Sadly this did not transfer over to the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly i have to say that the casting of the children was a terrible one. Not a single one of them could act and the compassion i feel for their book counterparts was lost on them. They all seemed very wooden and unable to put any feeling into what they were doing.<br/><br/>I also felt that they start of the movie seemed very long. Too much time seemed to be spent setting the scene in this world rather than focusing time on the events of Narnia. There was also a lack of focus on Edmund and the enchanted food Jadis gave him. I can't recall anyone mentioning the potency of the magic in the food, making Edmund seem even more of a brat than he is in the book (and I'm an Edmund fan). Jadis herself seemed like a total wash out, unable of striking any kind of fear into anyone making Edmunds scene in the battle when he broke her wand losing its importance.<br/><br/>Another scene that annoyed me as I am such a fan of the book was when the characters are fleeing from the beaver's house and Maugrim is seen chasing them and eventually trapping them on the ice. When the heck does that happen? One of the things I always liked about the book when they are fleeing from the secret police is that the reader never knows how close behind they are. The wolves aren't seen but you get the feeling that they're close. Instead we have a really lousy scene of Peter making a prat of himself (which he just seemed to do a lot in the movie) Saying all that, the visuals were very good. Seeing Aslan and the beavers made for very interesting watching and are perhaps the only high points of the film. That and the costumes and scenery. It was hard to stomach when Liam Neeson did such a good job providing Aslan with a voice, and was then cast along a group of children whose whiny voices and forced acting made me want to leave the cinema and come back when the animals were on.<br/><br/>If you've not seen it, don't bother. I would recommend reading the book as it explains far more in a much more pleasant way or watch Prince Caspian, because despite the children still being shocking actors, that movie isn't half bad."

","Like many other reviewers, I read the series of books years ago when I was a kid. Lewis's writing has a light touch that is easily read and understood by children, and the deeper messages are there for anyone who looks for them. For children, his writing is bold and exciting, and stepping into Narnia for the first time is like a breath of fresh air: the characters are rich and sharp, and the scenes are clearly portrayed. The Chronicles of Narnia are not just a work of escapism for children, but at their heart they represent an idealistic moralism that, unfortunately, many religious people have claimed as their own, when in actuality they stand on their own merit without any reinterpretation by religious nuts. Lewis was keenly aware of how his work was viewed, and never intended his children's books to be interpreted as metaphors for religion.<br/><br/>That said, there is something about Lewis's excitement and sense of immediacy that is sorely lacking in this beautiful but flat film. It all seems kind of cheap and slapped together somehow. Where Lewis describes Narnia in terms of its newness and its impression upon the Pevensie children, Adamson the director fails to convey this excitement on screen. The characters are flat, one does not feel their sense of wonder at this new world, and in no other recent movie that I can think of has it been more obvious that the actors were tired of standing in front of green screens conjuring up reactions to things that are added in later during post production.<br/><br/>The special effects are ho-hum. The waterfall scene, for example, went on far too long and contributed nothing to the story, on top of looking like a scene out of a made-for-TV movie. Aslan is particularly hokey, with his fur that doesn't move like the fur of any other lion in the world, and it doesn't help that Liam Neeson's forced, creepy voice is meant to impart the deep wisdom that Lewis so carefully portrayed in the book. I hear Liam Neeson and I think of his tongue-in-cheek role in Darkman, and it kind of blows the whole Aslan thing for me.<br/><br/>One might expect that the icily beautiful Tilda Swinton was perfectly cast as the white witch, when in actuality most of the time she appears as though she can't remember her lines. The best actor of the bunch is Georgie Henley as Lucy, a natural born actor if there ever was one.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointing effort from what was probably a collaboration by hundreds of people and millions of dollars, desperately trying to inject some humanity or heart into a film composed largely of poorly rendered computer graphics.<br/><br/>Lewis would probably have walked out of this film, shaking his head and thinking ""oh well, children can still have a much better time reading the book. Long after this movie is forgotten, they will be reading the book."""
"fabulousrice","1","7","15","5 May 2006"," The Chronicles of Phoney: lame visuals, no ideas, no rhythm.
","Here's yet another awful set of (badly) moving images from Diss-ney.<br/><br/>Actors: they don't act. It's shocking how little dramatic direction they got, how flat and emotionless their acting is. Main reason that will make you forget the film 10 minutes after you're out: they just can't act. The kids weren't even cast to look alike (they're supposed to be siblings!). Tilda Swinton, very fine actress most of the time, shouts and acts with grandioso gestures as if she thinks she's in a Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter scale epic... which it isn't. <br/><br/>Director: he doesn't direct either. You'd think there would be interesting camera angles, intelligent editing, mysterious travelings into the forest? No. The cinematography is awful, brightness always makes everything so obvious and plain that all sense of mystery disappears instantly, the sets are almost over-lit sometimes. The camera surely remained locked on its tripod during the whole shoot. It does move a tiny bit during a sleigh chase sequence, only sequence in which something really happens (""happen"" might not be the word), and it instantly qualifies as the worst chase sequence in the history of cinema. The action is reduced to some running scared, never gets any better. Even the ""war"" scene (yes, I know, there aren't supposed to be ""war scenes"" in films for kids... don't ask me) is disgustingly still and heavily-directed. <br/><br/>Wardrobe design: absolutely horribly disgusting design, the ugliest and stupidest designs for clothes I've seen in long. Whenever the actors wore a different outfit, I could barely restrain myself from laughing because it was even stupider than the previous one. Hence the Witch with her ""ice"" hat, hilarious it's so ugly.<br/><br/>Computer graphics: the worst I've ever seen. The beavers look like two obese humans, the fox looks like anything BUT a fox, and the LION... oh my, the lion is the worst piece of computer graphics I have ever seen in my life. Anything animatronic would have looked more realistic than this, a man in a lion suit would look more realistic than what they did here, hell, they should even have used a real lion, but this lion is absolutely rotten computer graphics, and makes Godzilla look like a masterpiece of realism and good taste. But you know, nowadays, everything HAS to be computer graphics, n'est-ce pas? Even if it's the phoniest visuals ever seen, they're still going to do it and not question themselves a single second. <br/><br/>The plot: I haven't read the books, I have no interest in religion, Christianity or paganism, and yet when in a kid's film Santa Claus shows up distributing magic whistles, swords, potions and what not, I really can't help wondering why I paid to be watching a film with such stupid ideas. Or maybe the film's target is kids who are yet to be taught that consumerism and bigotry are not the only two ways to see the world. It doesn't go anywhere. The Witch can freeze people, but Aslan can make them live again. You can be wounded, but the magic juice heals your wound instantly. The lion dies, yet the magic stone table gives him his life back. It's not going a-ny-where. <br/><br/>Production design: as cheap and uninventive as the rest of the visuals. The snow looks fake, every supposedly ""cold"" area depicted in the film is blatantly shot on a sound-stage (they don't even try to add some steam, mist, or anything, when someone talks in the middle of the snow-filled forest, the girls don't sneeze while all they're wearing is stockings and a skirt, etc). Nothing in the atmosphere of the film remotely compares to such fantasy masterpieces as ""Legend"" (dwarves & unicorns) or ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" (little girl lost far from home in fantasy world), which were made long before computer graphics and with a lot less money. But with plenty ideas. <br/><br/>Make up effects: bad bad bad bad bad. Once again, totally uninventive, very very cheap-looking, ugly to look at. Just plain ugly. <br/><br/>Cohesion: a lion with no lips saying the word ""past"". Kids living during World War II who need to fight on horses and with swords to defeat a Witch surrounded by cyclops (why don't they just go out of the closet and go get a good old tommy gun somewhere to get rid of the filthy stinky one-legged scum?). There is NO cohesion. But maybe that's from the books themselves.<br/><br/>To sum up, I'd just say ""phoney"". Phoney acting, phoney snow, phoney computer graphics, phoney animals, phoney everything, this is the state of the art of phoney. Even if it was made-for-TV, or straight to video, it would be a phoney TV movie. When the film was over and the atrocious song started to play (awful song, really), I hadn't felt like I went on a trip anywhere, I just felt like I was stuck at the bottom of a closet for two hours, talk about escaping! Some people say that the film has a Christian content. The only message I could ""read"" through the film was that ""inside the closet"" was better than ""out"". I'd love to know if it's a Christian message as well?<br/><br/>It is very important that I say that the gratuitous violence, the various occurrences of plain hatred, resent, graphic violence or bodily harm and purposeless humiliation or torture towards friendly characters of the story make this film highly unsuitable for kids under 15 or 16. Disney and the rating associations probably had to work hand-in-hand to get a PG, but the kids that cried and sobbed in the theater when I went and saw the film, I'm sure they didn't hear that."
"tigerlynny","3","7","15","18 December 2005"," A Film that I'm sorry I'm close to hating
","Now I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Like many other people I was mesmerised by the book when I was young and when I heard that they were shooting in New Zealand, I did think for a little while that they may have been borrowing a little too much from Peter Jackson. But I decided that these was going to be nothing like LOTR because the book was its own and so would the film be. <br/><br/>How RIGHT I was!<br/><br/>Unlike the film version of LOTR, this film left me with an empty feeling in my stomach and for a number of reasons. First things first,as 'Ward deBussac' correctly said, an epic cannot be found just in special effects. And in the case of this film I wasn't at all satisfied with what could be seen as the easiest way to achieve a 'crowdpleaser' (in terms of blockbuster films). The film seem to veer from excellent (beavers and Aslan) to the extremely poor (seeing the outline of the children bodies and the green screen as they 'cross a mountain'ad some of the sets looked like they had been stolen from some school plays). When it came to the special effects I felt a flurry of mixed emotions and I really feel that the beautiful scenery of New Zealand was not put to as good a use as it could have been.<br/><br/>My next major problem concerns some of the acting. The oldest's acting was deplorable. A cardboard cutout could have done as good a job. I know that sounds a little harsh but I was extremely disappointed. Then there was little Lucy - yes she was mesmerised. We get it!That same look became very tiring after a while...and what was with the smiling while she was 'crying'? Better than Peter? Yes. Cute? I think not. The actress who played her is more cute in real life than the younger girl she was playing. 6 going on 16 is what I saw. <br/><br/>I felt that Tilda Swinton was given too little to work with in terms of her character...and instead of being the frightening figure I remembered from the book she was left looking rather petty and small...hardly a formidable enemy. She was more imposing at the London Premiere!<br/><br/>There were parts of the film that I enjoyed such as the beavers purely because I love both Dawn french and Ray Whinestone. However,like many others I felt that there were over important characters that were just swept over or barely acknowledged such as Father Christmas (that scene looking particularly out of place) and Aslan wasn't as imposing of affecting as he could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, I desperately wanted to tell people that I enjoyed the film and that I fully recommended it. But alas my expressionless face said otherwise. Like Harry Potter films before, Narnia left me feeling tired and disappointed and desperately hoping for better book adaptations ahead. Go Memoirs of a Geisha!"
"imdb-9790","3","7","15","8 December 2005"," Not as good as it thinks it is
","I'm not going to go over the ground so many of the other comments have made, although several of the comments frankly baffle me. Tilda Swinton was great as the ice-cold Machiavellian ruler, but fell far short believably beguiling Edmund. Why he should have considered trusting such an obviously ill-intentioned character was incomprehensible, and I put this down to her simply not understanding what her character was up to. I read the book the best part of 30 years ago and recall her being sweet and enticing rather than simply ordering him to betray his siblings. (Surely, being just a little older than myself, she read the books as a child? They were all the rage in the late 60s with younger kids, as LOTR was with older ones.) My other big gripe is with the SFX. Did I really see the same film as the one those who praised the CGI, the landscapes and the animals? A significant amount of the blue/green screen work looked cheap and unfinished - it may have passed muster 10 years ago, but not today! I've never been a fan of anthropomorphous animals (except for the occasional cartoon), but with the possible exception of the beavers, the sounds being made did not believably emanate from the animals' mouths. I found this particularly weird given Adamson's experience with CGI animation.<br/><br/>Of course, many of the reviews here (and elsewhere) have compared this movie to the LOTR trilogy or the Potter franchise: Disney probably doesn't discourage such comparisons, if they're favourable. Regrettably, in my mind, such favourable comparisons are misplaced: LOTR's scope and geography beats Narnia into a cocked hat, and the mass battles of Jackson's trilogy have set a very high benchmark; Narnia doesn't come close with its battle, which I couldn't even call ""eye candy"". Potter is a very different animal, the continuing storyline being its main attraction, and characterisation built over the series as the trainee witches and wizards mature. Attempting to show such growth in the limited running time of a single movie was always going to be difficult, and given even my foggy recollection of the book, much development was lost at the expense of under-whelming visuals.<br/><br/>A fairly crude measure of my enjoyment of a film is how long into it I am desperate for a break and how often I need to check my watch, and by that measure, this film fails rather spectacularly, as I lasted no more than half an hour before my attention wavered. LOTR and all but the first Potter movie came off admirably in comparison, but even that did better than this piece of over-hyped bandwagon-jumping."
"Tinuvielas","3","79","279","25 November 2005"," Disappointing: Narnia doesn't come across as convincingly real
","A short advance review  I saw the film last night and I won't bother with a summary here: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is disappointing from the moment the child-actors enter Narnia, and it becomes outright bad after Father Christmas passes by on his sledge. Unlike The Lord of the Rings'""Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as real. The reasons for this are four: <br/><br/>1.) The Special Effects are very mixed: some work, others don't. While the wolves are impressive and Aslan seems hyper-realistic, if somewhat like a giant talking toy-animal, many of the other creatures are lifeless or rather, soulless. Worse, the wintry landscapes recreated on sound-stages are plainly artificial, and the matte paintings in some scenes are simply awful, as is the breaking ice on the CGI-river. Then there's the lack of attention to detail. Why on earth do Mr. Tumnus' ears never move? They seem like nothing so much as fur-covered rubber-attachments, which in fact they are. (Otherwise Mr. Tumnus, played by James McAvoy is one of the film's few highlights.) <br/><br/>2.) More importantly, the child actors are obviously out of their depths when it comes to acting in front of a blue-screen. A lot of ""The Lord of the Rings"" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the fantastic environment . In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also hopelessly foundering when asked to portray the admittedly difficult process of turning into kings and queens. It's not enough to dress them up with some live action role playing costumes and hand them a sword for them to have them overcome their apparent awkwardness when faced with their roles.<br/><br/>3.) Some of the above may be due to the fact that director Andrew Adamson doesn't have much experience with live action movies, but comes from a Special Effects background. One example: When Edmund  incidentally the only child whose acting was impressive (but then, unlike the others, he had some character-development to portray)  stumbles into Narnia and falls backwards into the snow, he doesn't even bother to shake off the wet stuff that must have entered his clothes at the neckline. Anyone ever went skiing and fell? Or got hit by a snowball? See what I mean? <br/><br/>4.) Then of course some of the problems lie with Lewis'book. An amalgamate of fairy-creatures from all the myths in the world that don't really have any important dramatic justification just isn't to everybody's taste (it certainly wasn't to Tolkien's, a fact which caused their friendship to cool considerably). While such a miscellaneous fairy-world may work in print, i.e. in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without going heavy on the cliché-side.<br/><br/>Thus the tag of a Lord of the Rings""-for-kids used to describe this film is misleading. It marks perhaps the aspirations of the filmmakers, but not the final product, rather underlining once more the unique achievement of Peter Jackson (whose LotR-films, I haste to say, I didn't wholly like either; see my reviews). It also draws attention to some obvious parallels: The monsters, the final battle, the way Jadis walks up to and fights Edmund  this last very reminiscent of Lurtz fighting Boromir, who was also a traitor, and Aragorn, who was also a king.<br/><br/>The one thing I liked about this movie was Jadis as the Evil White Witch, played superbly by Tilda Swanson. I also thought that the costume-designers/make up artists did a nice job when they endowed her with a neat black and white imagery that underlined the black-and-white-opposition of good and evil that Lewis' plot is based on: The evil witch is white as ice, but her eyes never light up. The Faun opposing her is dark and rugged, but his eyes shine.<br/><br/>Thus in the end, with Jadis, Edmund and Mr. Tumnus respectively standing out, if not redeeming this film, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is another instance of the fact well known since Dante's Hell and Milton's Paradise Lost, i.e. that it is always a lot easier to portray the absolute evil than it is to portray the absolute good."

","My wife and I were very disappointed with the Narnia movie.During the first 45 minutes particularly it was very labored.Throughout the movie the children acted in an overly polite speaking style, which bordered on the robotic. The two oldest children appeared to have a physical age of 15-16 years, yet they spoke and acted like children of a considerably younger age. The youngest girl appeared to have a physical age of 7-8 years,but she spoke like a sophisticated 12 year old. When the children tramped about in the snow they exhibited little discomfort from the cold temperature despite only wearing flimsy clothing. The highlight of the movie proved to be the lion and the witch and the costumes of the other various characters, all of whom prevented this movie from being a total disappointment for my wife and I."
"davoarid@hotmail.com","4","6","13","10 December 2005"," The Lion, the Witch, and the annoying beavers.
","This was not a great movie. Its tone shifts severely from serious drama to near slap-stick comedy. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, otherwise ""straight"" characters in the book, function in this movie as comic relief, throwing out ""witty"" one-liners every scene--scenes that were (and are!) serious within the confines of the story.<br/><br/>Beyond that change (which, and I can't stress this enough, really ruins the entire movie. Certain parts feel like Shrek; it's almost as though the director didn't trust the material enough to play it straight, to keep it Romantic, so instead makes it so we have to laugh at the characters; the book is Dr. No while the movie is Die Another Day), the other bad parts are largely expected for a Hollywood movie. The children's escape from the beavers is now filled with harrowing adventure (including a fancy escape on a floating iceberg down the river), entirely absent from the novel. The movie, obviously a product of its times, mentions ""the War"" (World War II) about a dozen times (it is mentioned once in the novel, in its opening sentence, and never again; the Nazi's London bombing raid is the reason the kids leave their parents), including a five-minute opening scene of the air raids.<br/><br/>The worst part is the battle scene. In the novel, the last battle is largely unimportant (in fact, it lasts about 5 pages); once Aslan is resurrected, we know who's going to win. However, in this movie, we get a huge, 20-minute spectacle of giant computer-generated armies clashing with each other (scenes inspired, in no doubt, by Lord of the Rings and Troy). Perhaps I'm just jaded, but I'm quite frankly sick of these scenes, as they are always the same. This movie's contribution has one good addition (the director doesn't include a score, a welcome change) and one bad addition (the movie is rated PG, so when characters maim each other with swords, no blood is shed; plus, we get some crazy editing to keep some violent parts off-screen).<br/><br/>As for the Christianity... I actually felt the movie expressed them better than the novel. The story is still the same (Aslan still sacrifices himself and is miraculously resurrected), but the director shoots certain scenes to more directly make the Biblical connections, particularly the scene in which Aslan is beginning to make his walk to the witch to end his life. The novel is very vague, but the film actually shows Aslan wrestling with his thoughts in a garden, obviously referencing Gethsemane. This movie also includes some curious Biblical dialogue. After binding Aslan, the White Witch declares to the crowd ""Behold the Great Lion,"" echoing Pilate's ""Behold the man ('Ecce Homo')"" in John 19:5. Also, at the end of the battle scene, Aslan magnanimously says to no one in particular, ""It is finished."" (John 19:30) However, it was still entirely possible to just enjoy the movie; the Christian themes aren't overwhelming.<br/><br/>However, even on a purely cinematic level, it failed. I can't find the right words for it, but... none of the scenes were ""magical."" Nothing I saw in the film will stick in my head, while dozens of scenes from the novel will. It is just... any time the director could do something great with a scene, something fresh, something memorable--he just takes the easy way out. It just wasn't memorable. I just felt like I'd seen everything before, except executed much better in much better movies.<br/><br/>4 out of 10. Please no sequel."
"TheMovieMark","10","6","13","9 December 2005"," I easily recommend it to all ages
","As quoted in the press notes...<br/><br/>""And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off...she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air..."" With that, C.S. Lewis sends young Lucy Pevensie into the magical world of Narnia. Likewise, once the big screen version of the wardrobe materializes, moviegoers follow Lucy into this alternate universe.<br/><br/>That's the true beauty of Narnia - it isn't portrayed as just a figment of the children's imagination; it's a completely believable, imaginary world. C.S. Lewis never told the reader how he was supposed to perceive it; Lewis was content to leave a lot to the imagination. Even the final battle for Narnia is described in fewer than two pages.<br/><br/>And that's the true beauty of the film - it takes the source material and fills in the blanks that had previously been left to the reader's mind. Visualizing in your head the fight between Aslan's army and the witch's minions is a joy for the creative, but watching a massive battle involving centaurs, minotaurs, dwarfs, giants, and a wide variety of other mythical creatures is truly a sight to behold.<br/><br/>C.S. Lewis theorized that if a book is worth reading when you're five, then it needs to be equally worth reading when you're 50. The same holds for the movie - I gladly recommend this regardless of whether you're five or 50 or anywhere over, under, and in between.<br/><br/>What makes The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe so accessible is its focus on topics that we can all relate to in some form - betrayal, forgiveness, selfless sacrifice, family, and loyalty. For Christians, the allegory behind the story certainly gives the film more meaning as Aslan, the Christ figure, battles the Devil's representative - the witch. But those who aren't as spiritually inclined will find this to be a great epic story of a battle between good and evil. The spiritual parallels are easy to recognize, but they're never heavy-handed.<br/><br/>Fans of the book will notice that the movie has implemented some minor changes, and you may be puzzled by some curious exclusions (why was there no Giant Rumblebuffin?), but overall this is a faithful adaptation that should live up to and probably exceed your expectations. What is there not to like? The actors are great (particularly Tilda Swinton as the witch and the adorable Georgie Henley as Lucy), the CGI is remarkably impressive (Aslan looks very real!), the battle is genuinely exciting, the world of Narnia feels real, the creatures are given life without ever becoming cartoonish, and the moviegoer is treated to a two-hour vacation from whatever stress or hardships he or she may be enduring.<br/><br/>There aren't a whole lot of movies these days that completely suck me into their world and force me to concentrate on the characters and the story rather than on the actors that I'm watching. Tom Cruise will always be Tom Cruise, and Angelina Jolie will always be Angelina Jolie. But for two hours Tilda Swinton is the evil witch, Georgie Henley is a little girl whose reactions feel real and sincere, and Aslan feels like more than just an impressive piece of CGI.<br/><br/>This is exactly the kind of movie I want to see more of. Go see it. If you think you're too grown up to enjoy this and can't let your imagination get the best of you then perhaps it's time for you to, in the words of Todd Snider, grow back down."

""Narnia"", on the other hand, didn't seemed to put forth as much effort as the others. The technology used in the film didn't create the same magic as the other fantasy-stories did. As the film progressed, it became abundantly clear that ""Narnia"" was nothing more than a competition to ""Lord"" and ""Harry"" (with an obviously smaller budget).<br/><br/>Many people impressed with the film can argue that it was entertaining and enjoyable. This is all fine and dandy. However, it is mere fact that the film's creators didn't go about the project with the love and passion for the story like those of ""Lord"" and ""Harry"".

Loads of well detailed places that can leave you in awe. The castle of the witch is nicely detailed and I thought the wolf guards were well done.<br/><br/>However, the flow of everything else is lukewarm. The characters of the children are OK, but they are missing with those outside the children. Nor does the film explain a lot about the children, at least not in the beginning.<br/><br/>Plus, the fights and battles certainly don't inspire much out of a person who loved LOTR. Instead, they were disappointing and mildly funny in a bad way.<br/><br/>Overall, this is average. And for so much hype, that is not good. ""C"""

","Everyone who has read the book will agree with me, the movie is rubbish: There is no magic, Aslan is 'just' a lion. The books have a lot of room for your own imagination: anthropomorphic animals and especially Aslan are just things you can't film. And if you can, you're one hell of a Filmer, this one just couldn't.<br/><br/>I quote C.S. Lewis himself in a letter from him to producer Lance Sieveking: 'But I am absolutely opposed  adamant isn't in it!  to a TV version. Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare. At least, with photography. Cartoons (if only Disney did not combine so much vulgarity with his genius!) would be another matter. A human, pantomime, Aslan would be to me blasphemy'<br/><br/>Nowadays, because of technology, animals don't turn into buffoonery like C.S. Lewis says, but he is still right about Aslan.<br/><br/>There is no spirit in this movie!"
"mnpollio","5","3","5","9 August 2008"," A big shiny package with nothing inside
","I have never read the C. S. Lewis novel from which this film originates so I am going in cold and judging the film on its own merits and have no idea how closely it adheres to its source. The film starts off quite well with a lot of potential, but somewhere along the way misses its footing and ends up delivering a rather empty viewing experience. The end result fails to achieve the emotional depth or scope of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy (films it appears to want to emulate), the imagination of the Harry Potter films, or even the ambition of the more recent The Golden Compass. The opening is fascinating and sets the stage nicely, taking the four central characters - two brothers and two sisters - from war-torn London to a more pastoral setting. The youngest child, played by the adorable Georgie Henley, stumbles onto a wardrobe that opens into another realm filled with talking animals, ice queens and epic battles of good vs. evil. Naturally, she compels her siblings to return with her and aid the forces of good - embodied by a wise, noble lion voiced by Liam Neeson - against the forces of evil, led by Tilda Swinton's queen. Unfortunately, it is around this point that the film begins to falter and lose its initial impact. The visuals range from good to merely adequate, with the battle scenes particularly smacking of CGI phoniness. Purportedly there is some pro-Christian agenda at work in Lewis' novel, but one really has to stretch to find it in the film as it just never seems that deep - in fact, it is amazing how quickly the film evaporates from the mind after it concludes. Swinton is suitably malevolent as the queen, but despite that none of the characters ever truly seem to be at great risk from her, which results in a veritable dearth of suspense. By contrast, Neeson appears to have become entombed in the role of wise mentor and desperately needs to stretch himself. He has become a veritable cliché. James McAvoy is charming as an impish faun who befriends young Henley, but then he is off-screen for far too long. The biggest problem lies with the central characters. The film works well when the emphasis is on young Henley, who is the most appealing and accessible of the siblings. Unfortunately, the second half punts her into a supporting role in favor of Skander Keynes, as her conflicted brother and the younger of the boys. Keynes's role requires some degree of acting prowess to carry one over the contortions his character is forced to go through during the running time, but he seems to only have two reactions - very surly and slightly less surly, which confounds any evolution. The older siblings have it even rougher. Blond pretty-boy William Moseley seems on hand only to appeal to the teenyboppers in the bland hero role and the film/story never seems to know what to do with the older sister, played by Anna Popplewell, so she instead just seems...there, like a prop. And therein lies the film's problem as a whole. It ends up performing the same function as a Christmas gift box wrapped in sparkling paper that holds nothing inside. It is lovely to look at for a short time, but then one is ready to move on to something with substance."
"moose888","3","3","5","18 May 2008"," Not absolutely terrible, but nowhere close to good.
","While I loved the work of C.S. Lewis, I was not expecting a masterpiece out of this movie seeing as though it garnered much pop-culture hype, Burger King endorsements, etc. But I still thought it would, or perhaps more aptly, could very much be a good film considering the original material they were working with. It saddens me to say that I was wrong. Well it doesn't sadden me that much. Just that one of the great stories of modern literature was so terribly adapted. But I'll get back to that.<br/><br/>For starters, I feel the filmmakers did an extremely poor job of accentuating the emotional mountains and valleys that take place in Lewis' original work; The discovery of Narnia, the death of Aslan, the resurrection of Aslan, etc. I could go on and on. All of these, terribly executed. We see Susan and Lucy absolutely weeping over Aslan when they've known him for, what, two scenes? Also, how is the audience even supposed to care by then, especially if strangers to the story? And the discovery of Narnia. When the children all discover Narnia for their respective first times, their on-screen action basically says,(in bland monotone) ""Oh. Wow. Looook. A maagicall land called Narrniaaa..."" Where is the wonder, awe, excitement? In the films, it is nowhere. It seems at almost every major turn of plot, plot clichés and digestible drama is used instead of bringing out the full power of the situations.<br/><br/>I won't do a big section on dialogue, but I'll just say that I'm glad I rented this movie and wasn't in the theaters because, on multiple occasions, I could just not hold back explosions of laughter. Again, clichés and digestible, ""I've heard this line 1000 times in 1000 movies"" lines seemed to dominate this film.<br/><br/>GRANTED, this film does not absolutely fail. Tilda Swinton did great. And, while some may disagree, the overall acting wasn't bad at all. It was as good as the script allowed it to be. Well almost. But you know what I mean. Anyways, like I was saying, this film does not fail completely because of ONE thing, and one thing only: The story. Like I said before, Lewis' original work is just simply classic. Heck, even a comic flip book based on The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe couldn't be TOO bad.<br/><br/>All in all, I was extremely disappointed in this adaptation. I know some people get sick of LOTR comparisons, but there's no way you can not compare the two. The LOTR films captured the heart of Tokien's writings, with drama, intellectuality, AND accessibility. TLTWATW just seemed to capture the heart of the box office. Nothing more."

","I loved every minute of this movie and cried several times. I think it captured the book so well and was true to every detail. I would suggest that everyone read the books first not only because C.S. Lewis wrote such an incredible set of books, but it will allow you truly appreciate the movie and get over the whole talking animals bit. I thought all the images in movie looked so real and the makers of this film captured the greatness and majesty of Aslan perfectly. All the actors did a great job playing their roles, especially those playing Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. I remember watching a play of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe when I was child and I loved it; to watch it again on DVD as an adult makes me feel like a little girl again. I truly hope they make movies out of the rest of the books. I think this movie is right up there with Lord of the Rings!"

Many elements in the film are very similar to Christian belief, for instance the Lion can be thought to be representative of Jesus Christ if you look within the context.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is especially exquisite, especially that one song by Alanis Morrissette and that 'I can't take it all in' song.<br/><br/>Jim Broadbent and Liam Neeson co-star."

","Having grown up reading the Chronicles of Narnia, from The Magician's Nefew through to The Last Battle, I was quite pleasantly surprised with this film.<br/><br/>I have an issue with making good books into bad movies. That did not happen this time. I understand that sometimes the books are just too full of characters, or sub-plots to be able to make a 2 hour movie without loosing something. I was quite happy to see that this did not happen with this movie.<br/><br/>""Gone With The Wind"" is a perfect example of what I meant. The book was so powerful that they did the whole book on film. Then proceeded to cut/edit about 4 hours worth of the story, possibly more. The end result was still over 5 hours long. Fortunately, they managed to keep the flow of the story without damaging the integrity of it.<br/><br/>Then you take ""Flowers in the Attic"". They not only trimmed the original book, they mushed all four of the books into a very poorly produced 1 3/4 hour movie.<br/><br/>I was very happy to see that not only did they keep the integrity of ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"", I was able to anticipate scenes. Scenes which were important to the story in the novel.<br/><br/>I understand that C.S.Lewis was a Minister, and had attempted to use these books as a way of teaching Christian Morales. Having read all 7 books repeatedly since I was 6 yr old, I honestly do not recall any attempts to teach me better Christian beliefs or morales.<br/><br/>The movie dos not have the feel of being anything more than a really well done Fantasy. If you are boycotting this film simply for religious reasons, perhaps you should watch it before you judge it.<br/><br/>I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in this well written and so far, well produced, series."

","I went into the film with mixed expectations - a friend of mine was enthused about it, another claimed it to be a total waste of time.<br/><br/>Itis a waste of time. The book by Lewis is a classic, which doesn't automatically make it good, filmable, or even relevant to todays society, morals, people, or just the individual viewer. <br/><br/>The acting by the kids is substandard, and that is relative to a standard set by child actors, who for the most part only succeed in being kids. Which they are supposed to be, during the first few minutes of the movie, at that point doing fine, therefore. Afterwards, when they're supposed to be heroes and villains, they simply fail. The costumes are outrageously bad. The white witch seems to protrude from some kind of portable xxl mix of victorian dress, refrigerator and michelin-man, the garb of the kids looks like cheap halloween costumes, the plate armour shows that the creator has at least seen lotr, but sadly also admits that he hasn't understood what was so great about the armour there. The cgi is not good. it's not bad either, but it fails to take you to fantastic places, meeting fantastic creatures;<br/><br/>some plot elements are awful, or awfully acted out: ------ the transition to traitor comes in a blink; ------ all kids, including the nearly grownup ones hide in a closet? ------ the girl is always chided for its seemingly extraordinary 'logicalness' whilst being only marginally more coherent than the rest. ------ is aslan a sadist, or why doesn't he tell the girls in advance he'll survive? ------ what, exactly, have the white witch and her secret police been doing these last 100 years, if the revolutionary army can peacefully assemble in a valley full of banners and brightly coloured tents? ------ the chase scene is as bad as any in 'knight rider' ever was; ------ the wolves, secret police of the evil witch, are incredibly inept; ------ the alpha-wolf, right hand to the evil witch, big bad evil overlord himself, attacks a kid with a sword - by jumping right into the point?? ------ no place in narnia is farther than an hours walk away, seemingly; ------ the whole ice-floe-waterfall thingy is plain dumb and the (cgi?)water oozes Caribbean warmth; ----- hiding under an outcropping while thunder of hooves is nearing (very lotr by the way) is fine, but in untouched snow? with the only traces leading directly there? (the traces-in-snow issue is completely left out throughout the film, presumably because all of it was edited in later, thanks, again, to cgi); ------ nothing relevant the children do has to be done by them or even any human children ------ why the fuss?. their sheer existence seems to provide the solution to all ill; ------ the white witch has not the voice needed to whip up three henchmen, bar thousands of them; ------ the battles (lotr-esque, again) are bloodless and pathetic. if that's for the sake of the children in the audience, so be it, but then as a consequence the battle ought have been a less integral part of the storytelling. ------ no props or buildings in narnia that weren't either bad, cgi, or bad cgi.<br/><br/>summary: avoid it, or take your kids <10 (the 12yo behind me noticed a major logical flaw(not mentioned above, trying to find it helps against the urge to sleep through the movie))"

I also went to view the film to fulfill my hopes of producing an entertaining and moving version of one of my favorite childhood stories. Sadly, it failed to do so. The film was boring and slow in many parts and I felt the cartoon version when I was 12 was a lot more enthralling. Either it is because I lost the spirit for talking animal films, or because it is difficult for some people to relive their childhood favorites. <br/><br/>The only saving graces were those of the Beaver family which I thought were rather cute and sometimes funny, and I thought little Lucy was cute.

"the-evil-cult","4","3","5","22 January 2006"," I liked Georgie Henley. Otherwise, an Ordinary Movie.
","We watched The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. How was it? Let's just say that the first half was good. I liked the mood created by the music, which was really nice and consisted of smooth woodwind noises.<br/><br/>But then the movie just got bad. I really didn't like some of the messages of the film. I didn't like it how the professor says that it is ""logical"" to trust in your family. What if your dad sexually abuses you?. Genetic relatedness means nothing. The kindest person in the world may be someone with completely different genes to you and the most evil person in the world may be your brother, sister, or father. Saying, ""Trust in your father. He knows what is good,"" may sound nice, but what if you were giving this advice to Adolf Hitler's hypothetical children? The way Edmond all of a sudden changes I thought was weird. Still it all seemed unrealistic. The worst part about the movie would be the battle scene. It's the same old thing we've seen in The Phantom Menace, Lord of the Rings, Troy, Alexandra, and maybe more movies. When some concept is popular, the media executives really milk it, don't they? Whether it's martial arts wire-fu or reality TV, surely people must get sick of the same thing over and over again. I was yawning throughout the whole battle scene. We've seen it all before. Some other people are saying this movie was more incoherent and sanitized, and yes I suppose these are fair concerns.<br/><br/>I should also add that Georgie Henley, the girl who played Lucy, was strangely realistic in her acting. She was also a very likable character."
"PopRonny","4","3","5","20 January 2006"," Technically perfect, the soul is missing
","Yes, it is quite perfect from a technical point of view. The animations are very well done, especially the beavers faces have inspired a great deal of respect to the makers of this movie. Also the voices of the animated actors are very well chosen and fit the faces like a glove.<br/><br/>But the story... I will now write spoilers, so maybe you shouldn't' continue to read.<br/><br/>Maybe I am just too stupid for this one. I love adventure movies where the hero gets into trouble or is helped out of it by pure and utter chance, this so unlike that in normal life the hero would have died long ago. I really mean chance, not some special skill the hero had or some gadget (like in most Bond-movies). But in this movie, it is often pure chance that ensures the heroes survival. Luck at its best. Okay, that fits the quite hectic change of camera positions, or unexplained changes of scene, apparently quite a bad attempt at portraying simultaneously happening scenes.<br/><br/>I also don't get some of the plot, the white witch (nicely played by Tilda Swinton) is the overpowerful master of narnia, some children appear, they are told that they would help to defeat her. One of them she tried to corrupt, but at his first visit she reveals her plan, losing all control over the child, instead of drawing him closer to her, although he would have been the perfect solution to her plan, since there had to be FOUR of them, as will be stressed enough later on in the story. <br/><br/>When they arrived, it was deep winter, since the white witch controlled the land. These children at first do nothing of any significance, and they are told that Aslan will try to defeat Her Majesty. So... up until the final battle, she is the ruler of Narnia, she is the reason for winter... But, also she hasn't suffered the smallest blow yet, nobody had stood up to her, everybody is just fleeing, suddenly the winter is over and spring breaks out. So they only had to arrive... Strange, especially when you look at the end of The Battle, aslan had to rescue the children and defeat the white witch; he is the only one she is afraid of, not the children or the hordes of enemies, she has enough soldiers herself. So, the children were useless, all in all, more a hindrance. I don't get it, maybe the original from 1988 was more easy to follow."
"mentalcritic","4","3","5","17 January 2006"," Fantasy for infants
","One of the great things about fantasy as a genre is that it can be used to satirise aspects of our own world that we find repugnant. However, the trap of all fantasy films is that a certain grounding in reality has to take place. When a plot device is used, its function must be explained. When a character is able to perform a great feat, the reasons and means must be laid out. Before I go on, I should point out that one video critic laid out a series of rules for judging motion pictures by their titles. One such rule is that the longer the title, the worse the film will be. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very, very long title. And in spite of having a special effects budget that would have had C.S. Lewis salivating, it becomes a very average, ordinary film. Then again, Lewis only gets it as bad as his more famous contemporary, relatively speaking.<br/><br/>There is another saying in creative work that when you adapt something into a new medium, you inherit the source material's flaws. Lion inherits quite a few of them, not least of which is Lewis' childish conception of a fantasy world and how it works. Characters are repeatedly killed, turned to stone, or otherwise unpleasantly dealt with. Prophecy, magic, and general plot devices are used to undo all these events. Gee, a world where there is no conflict, no death, and no consequence. You can keep this world, mister Lewis, because it sounds like the same thing as being dead to me. Admittedly, it has been a while since I read the novel on which this extended Play School was based, but I do remember a serious problem with being able to deal with consequence or change there, too. I know this will come as a shock after I have talked about how fantasy epics such as The Lord Of The Rings suffered from the director's wholesale mauling, but this is one case where a big difference from the source material would have helped.<br/><br/>Another amusing moment comes when a Santa Claus figure, riding a sleigh into the edge of a forest, hands three of the four children tools for their quest. He tells us that MoneyMas has not been celebrated in Narnia for a century, since the oh-so-evil White Witch came to dominate this land. The audience they are quite obviously aiming this film at might be too young to appreciate this, but as films like Bad Santa helped us appreciate, MoneyMas is only a celebration when you have succumbed to the brainwashing. So Jadis does not celebrate MoneyMas? Okay, get a fantasy creature army going on me, because I do not celebrate it, either. One more amusement is when Dwarrow are shown in the film as simply being diminutive Humans (and yet the presence of regular-sized Human children and adolescents seems so significant). Granted, this is Lewis' fantasy world and not necessarily meant to make physiological sense, but sending such creatures into battle does not tend to strike me as a good tactic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is the battles of the film that let it down the worst. After years of viewing such delightful films as RoboCop, violence without consequence easily equals boring to me. And as I indicated earlier, consequence does not seem to have been a word in Lewis' vocabulary. There is no situation from which our characters cannot be given a reset button. Nor, it seems, is there any blood when a five hundred pound lion leaps on a woman who has to weigh a hundred and seventy pounds, tops. And therein lies the fatal flaw that has killed every fantasy film of the past ten years. Lion tries so hard to appeal to that mythical audience of all ages, and winds up appealing to nobody. Tilda Swinton does her best to appear menacing, and she does a decent job in some sequences, to give her credit, but the script literally undercuts her at every turn. It would have been interesting to see how Lion and the next Harry Potty film would have clashed together at the box office, because heaven knows they are made with the same mindset.<br/><br/>Words fail me when I try to describe the positives of this exercise in driving in the middle of the road. The film is slower than dragging a dead lion across a yard up to the end, when it suddenly attempts to give the sleeping adults in the audience some positive memories by staging a very ordinary battle sequence. To the credit of the director, he manages to resist the urge to shake the camera about, but the framing of shots is still nonsensical from the point of view of anyone who wants to see anything. To be fair, the film also manages to give viewers a sense of the chaos and suffering that drives the children into rural England in order to set up the action. It is rather amusing to hear Roger Ebert, a man who has been criticising films for several decades, describe Lion as a film sitting on the line between traditional family fare and some new kind of action-oriented family fare. To me, this is symptomatic of the MPAA's utter inability to recognise that there are adults in the audience, and they also have a right, as one expects when they pay obscene amounts of money, to be entertained.<br/><br/>I gave Lion a four out of ten. I was gnashing my teeth over whether to give it a five as I gave Jackson's abysmal attempt to put half of The Return Of The King on the silver screen. I even said to another audience member that Lion was a better film, as it certainly had a better sense of pace and flow. However, I lowered the score to four when I realised that so too do most test patterns."

","I was very excited when I saw the trailer for Narnia, mainly cause this is one of my favorite books and it looked like it was very well done. The first half of the movie or where they were at the proffesor's house was according to the book and the actors they chose for the kids were very good all of them believable, Lucy was the innocent, Edmund was the bully, Susan was the sensible one and last but not at all least was Peter the heroic one. However Liam Neeson was not believable as Aslan and I don't understand why they didn't get somebody like Anthony Hopskins to talk for him. Jadis was not believable as the charming evil witch in the beginning and I feel that they didn't give her a good enough introduction. The biggest mistake were the relationships. Peter and Edmund didn't seem to have as much hatred towards each other as in the books, and there was way too much hugging and crying, in fact I felt like they were concentrating more on making this a blockbuster then making this a good movie. There was no playfulness in Aslan as there is in the book and they didn't make Aslan as respectable and fun as they could have, again I felt like he didn't get a decent introduction and therefore when the whitch killed him I wasn't sad at all. The part where the girls were crying over his death was long and I got sick of it. Jadis looked ridiculous in those clothes which seem to be cut from an 80's magazine. I definitely think that they should have spent more time on the script and less time on making this a Hollywood movie, I don't know if it is the producer or the directors or even just because this was a Disney film. So to sum up this movie left me lukewarm like annegirl8 said and this could have been a much better movie if they wouldn't have made it so lame. Kids movie not for the adult fans."

","Hi, <br/><br/>I'm from Germany and I just saw ""The Chronicles of Narnia-The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" and I was impressed by the movie. The movie is nearly a complete adaption of the book written by C.S. Lewis in the Fifties of the last century. Although, I have to mention that there are some elements of the story which I personally missed but maybe it is because I saw ""Narnia"" from an adult perspective. For example the criticism of using drugs. However, the movie was impressive but if you do not like speaking beavers and several other animals you know of the world of fantasy like a lion, which is the king of the world of Narnia you won't get satisfied with the movie. Furthermore it is noteworthy that it was written for children this is why the story isn't of that complexity compared to the one of the ""Lord of the Rings"". Well, the story begins in WW-II and four children are being evacuated from the city to the countryside of the Kingdom of England, to prevent that the nation will have to face a lack of procreation after the war. The children get to the house of an old professor by train. At first sight it seemed to them like a boring place and they don't know what to do there but as the youngest of them finds a mysterious wardrobe as a hiding place in which she finds another world, called Narnia. Boredom is over and the adventures begins. It is an adventure, on the one hand containing betrayal and evil but on the other hand love and the good. The destination of the four children is to to break the spell of an 100 year lasting winter in Narnia spoken by the evil white which.If they are able to confirm their dangerous quest or fail I won't tell...<br/><br/>In conclusion I want to say, why I didn't gave the movie 10 out of 10. To my mind Andrew Adamson played a ""bit"" to much with bytes! You'll sometimes get the feeling that they have a photographic wallpaper put behind the scene declared as a background. In my opinion nowadays technology of SFX is that advanced, as we saw in the lord of the rings that one is able to make it look more realistic than it was in this movie. For example the beavers would perfectly fit into ice age 2 but not into Narnia. Another important thing to mention is that it wasn't such a bad movie but people who aren't interested in the world of fantasy shouldn't spent their hard earned money for Narnia because I aren't willing to listen to your cant that the movie sucked. Most of those people should read the book before watching the movie to get another perspective to it! <br/><br/>After all it is not easy to make a quick judgment. There are only little aspects being mentioned and I have to tell so much more...<br/><br/>And finally don't forget that Narnia is not Middle earth!"

Even if the rest were fine (that is not the case), they would spoil the movie just by themselves. I wonder what was the casting director doing while that maniac was doing his work. The movie is slow, very very slow, and never really tells anything. The main important questions in the story remain unexplained in the end. It's just images and cgis appearing one after the other for 2 hours. The cgis were very nice to look at, though. And finally, leaving the Christian issue aside, it's a story full of clichés, and tries to perpetuate the most traditional roles. It's two couples of kids and in each couple the elder kid is a boy (woman dependency on man). There is an obvious reference to grow up(sex) and how kids should avoid it and remain pure.

Behind the corner a carriage comes up.<br/><br/>The audience: - Gandalf?<br/><br/>NOP, its just me the strict butler (not to forget we are in england)<br/><br/>Half and hour screen time goes by, and a kid finds its self in front of a wardrobe, she is so excited to find it that she nearly grows wings! So the kid finds a wardrobe filled with fur coats ( probably of killed Narnia beasts, probably symbols) the kid goes Through the wardrobe and finds it self in the the snowed up forest of Narnia. <br/><br/>Forest. And in the middle of the picture, a gas lamp. SYMBOL.<br/><br/>The audience: ( gets the idea) - This must be some kind of a symbol.<br/><br/>After a few boring minutes the conflict in the family is all ""good to go"" for the movie...<br/><br/>Then we meet Tilda Swinton ( with her shocking beauty she played an angel as well as a witch) <br/><br/>Andrew - director bursts : -THE WHITE WITCH!!! NOT THE SNOW QUEEN!!! THE WHITE WITCH!!! STOP IT!! <br/><br/>The audience: -But Andrew, nobody said anything, it kinda looks like her, not to say it kinda the same thing ...<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton - THE WHITE WITCH!!!NOT THE SNOW QUEEN : -Young SON OF ADAM, have some Turkish delight, have some, have some, drink up your tea, do you want some pie ?<br/><br/>And it goes on, the young kids find out that all decedents of Adam and Eve are wanted criminals for been a part of some prophecy, and they all so get the SHOCKING news that Narnia didn't have Xmas in a 100 years!!!<br/><br/>The audience: -Did they say Xmas ? So they have Jisus in Narnia? So they have the Roman empire, which means the got the Jews too, so are we waiting for the Nazis to start bombing Narnia!?? What about everything else! What is going on here!? How does Narnia know about Adam and Eve? Do the creatures there read the bible? Or this is another SYMBOL ? You naughty boy Lewis (author), this is probably some ""modern"" style ...<br/><br/>In the mean time the conflict between the children is so hot that they are ready to start bitch slapping each other...<br/><br/>Stupid brother a.k.a The traitor<br/><br/>Screw you all!, ill sell you out for a lump of sugar!<br/><br/>The kids find a family of beavers which help them get away from the gestapo wolves which chase them because the kids got reported by STUPID BROTHER a.k.a THE TRAITOR! Yet the gestapo wolves don't give up, and the escape goes along with the arguing - ""Whos the leader"", ""where are we running to"", ""whos fault is it"". Its the fox's turn to help.<br/><br/>The hardcore fantasy fans : Whats with the zoo? When do the ORCS show up?!<br/><br/>Andrew (director): You probably dint get it, there are no ORCS!<br/><br/>The hardcore fantasy fans : Xa!, even kids know that there is no fantasy with no ORCS LOL.<br/><br/>Andrew (director): Ah, well there is fantasy... and fantasy ...<br/><br/>The gestapo wolves find the tracks of the two girls and bigger brother a.k.a future king, since they were again reported by stupid brother a.k.a THE TRAITOR!<br/><br/>STUPID BROTHER a.k.a THE TRAITOR : -I've done so much don't i get a Snikers or something, apple pie better!<br/><br/>Gestapo wolves, beavers, fox and kids all run around, hide, jump, swim and WALLA they find Santa! <br/><br/>Then he starts with the gifts;<br/><br/><ul><li>For you little girl a dagger!, to cut enemy throats in the night.. - For you bigger girl, a bow and some arrows, nail em between the eyes! - And for you DUDE it The sword to cut the skulls open of whatever stands in your way... - And for the other guy ? Aaah he is a lowlife nothing for him. - Merry Xmas kids, wish you many killing sprees ...</li></ul><br/><br/>The audience: -Santa is preparing kids for a massacre? -Oooh, we probably missed something between word or frames. -There gotta be some UBER DEEP THOUGHT and SYMBOLS YEAH MHM! Well we should be happy he didn't give them adult videos.<br/><br/>After some boring and stupid adventures, never giving the sword a brake, they arrive in the headquarters of the good forces. And out of the main tent comes the guarantee of and happy ending The LION!<br/><br/>The lion: Grrrr!(and then goes on to English official language of all Narnia creatures) - Why are you only 3 ?<br/><br/>Future King a.k.a Bigger bother : - Well our brother turned out to be a dumb bitch, sold as out of some Turkish delight...<br/><br/>Lion: -Dont be so harsh on him, he probably has a GOOD reason for it.<br/><br/>The audience: -Is that lion stupid!?

","IMDb gives the above number as the budget of this film. I'm wondering where all that money went to: The acting is of the worst kind, the story unbelievably laughable, the dialogue is tiring, CGI and effects look awful, there's no kind of storytelling whatsoever, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Here's some of the (dozens of) questions that came up and were left unanswered during this movie:<br/><br/>Why are humans so important in that world? Why are pigs and cattle 'bad' animals and others (beaver, fox) 'good'? Why is everybody eager to give their life for some children that never have proved themselves worthy for it? Why doesn't Mr. Tumnus fall over when standing still - I mean, he's only got two hooves and according to physics and gravity he has to fall over unless he scuttles. What did the professor give the children at the end of the movie? Why is the white witch able to put a whole country under snow, but isn't able to kill some inept children? Why does everybody in this movie have to speak in such a momentous and meaningful voice - all of the time? Did anybody ever think about what this raw blend of racism, violence and salvation myths does to the suggestible minds of children (i.e. the target audience)?<br/><br/>I guess the idea behind all that was just to make tons of money from people wanting to see some pseudo-Christian-and-fantasy-themed movie. So they spent 1.50 $ on screenplay, actors, effects and direction respectively and the rest of all those millions went into advertising to trick people into paying money for this thing. It's the only way I can understand how such a piece (that would get the worst grade at every writing and directing school) could make it onto screen.<br/><br/>Go for the 1989 version instead - at least it had no budget to go along with no story, lame acting and even worse effects. Or simply wait till it's on free-TV - don't support something like that with your hard earned money."

","I saw this at a midnight showing and I couldn't stop checking my watch every 20 or 30 minutes.<br/><br/>***Some SPOILERS present*** (not that there's really any surprises to spoil) While Tilda Swinton is as awesome as ever as the White Witch, everyone else is as dull as the clichéd storyline and special effects. Nothing about this film was believable. Thing such as Peter being able to fight off the witch, who obviously knows what she's doing, with a sword only with a couple of days of sword training, Santa popping out of nowhere to give the children gifts which happen to solve all their problems, everyone that died coming back to life at the end just by the Lion breathing on them, things like this caused my eyes to roll numerous times. Of course the battle scenes, nothing is shown, just some off screen animal cries and jagged camera-work that makes you care even less what is happening.<br/><br/>By the end, I was not caring anything about any of the characters in this film and was only truly enjoying the scenes where the White Witch was present. This is yet another franchise that will probably make tons at the box office, but mostly due to the religious masses who will go to see the Aslan ""Jesus"" figure and the other numerous biblical undertones.<br/><br/>All in all, a forgettable, strictly by the numbers, bland film and I can only hope that they don't make films from the other books in the series."

","I haven't read the books. My wife had, whom I accompanied to this movie. I like fiction, however.<br/><br/>But this movie was a waste of time. Another 2005 dose of British kids in a stuffy old mansion and a stern housekeeper. Oh no, they can't play like proper British kids! Oh no, the little one is bored and sad! (OK, so maybe that was in the book, but couldn't they tone it down a bit?) Then Narnia is discovered, a soundstage with some rocks. Next, a cute British kid's interaction with a goat-boy. Later, a queen on the same soundstage. Then when they all come, more soundstage action and a CGI house. And the requisite funny small furries, which are always so appropriate when millions of lives are at stake.<br/><br/>Then there's a Q-branch scene out of Bond where the kids get gadgets from Santa Claus (??). Then the kids go lead an army which has somehow assembled under a Queen's nose without her knowledge, despite having the forest creatures on her side (she needs to get off that soundstage and survey her land a little bit). Somehow no professional in the grand army cares that inexperienced CHILDREN are leading thousands into battle.<br/><br/>Then the lion dies. And is resurrected - in the sloppiest plot ""fuhgeddaboutit"" since the latest episode of DragonBall Z. So the queen just forgot to read the fine print? Jeez, weren't the Queen and Aslan in the tent debating this for like, a long time? So the battle happens. It's more like a big schoolyard slapfest. No divisions, no regimented forces. Hills on both sides remain unoccupied. Flanking & maneuvering are ignored by this professional army with generals and officers, despite the gobs of gold obviously spent on Windex and nice tents. Cavalry is thrown pell-mell into the fray with the infantry. The flying rock-dropping Griffins glide blindly into a curtain of arrows. Couldn't they use the air power to soften the enemy at night? Did CS Lewis pay attention to the war raging around him? In all, I was astonished by the characters' lack of accountability. Pure imagination without regard for consequence. Lazy, lazy, lazy storytelling. And at the end, the entire movie cancels ITSELF out by kicking the kids out of Narnia. Somehow, the kids don't care. Their loyal subjects, which were promised these rulers by prophecy, have now lost them. And these four little British brats simply dust themselves off and continue their childhoods. None of them cry out for their lost kingdoms. I hope the people of Narnia die of sheer stupidity."

","My heart aflutter, I settled in the seat for what promised to be, well, a modern classic. The movie does have its moments - the special effects are terrific, the overall ""environment"" created splendid and the ""feel"" of the film is technically excellent. The music is enjoyable.<br/><br/>But frankly, thats where the accolades end. I am pained that a film with such tremendous potential could fall so flat that finally it was an exercise in patience to sit through the whole 140 mins. Having said as much, it is worth a see ~ but with MUCH lowered expectations than what the studios and marketing drones in Hollywood would have us collectively believe the delights the film holds.<br/><br/>I found in Tilda Swinton's portrayal of the Evil White Queen absolutely excellent ! She was interesting, and a character who though evil, one could not help silently rooting for at some level. A brilliant actress indeed.<br/><br/>The 4 children, who were the key players in the plot, should all be sent to the Prisons of Askaban - where perhaps they might pick up some acting tips from the excellent cast of the Harry Potter films. I have seldom seen such a pathetic and uninspiring performance as from the two boys who were supposed to carry the film. The little Poppelwell girl did a half decent job, but she ain't no Dakota Fanning. Frankly I found the animated characters far better at acting real than the children in fulfilling the roles allotted to them.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this film as it is well made technically and well, because i am a fantasy movie buff. But please watch it with a nice big tub of popcorn and a large coke - you'll need them to get through the more dragging parts."

","General thoughts were that it was poor. The casting was terrible, at one point Georgie Henley was supposed to be upset and crying and she looked like she was laughing. I know she's a child actor but take Dakota Fanning for example who CAN actually act! Effects at times were brilliant, but in others absolutely poor (eg. the mountains that shook when there were closeups of characters because of bad green-screening). In terms of story telling it was average, i often thought that at moments the tension could have been heightened by having better directing. It did not seem to me to have the fantasy element that it deserved, it just 'seemed like another film' and not as mythological or as grand as the book portrays. Worth a rent when it comes out on DVD, but halfway through you may decide to fast forward as it gets a little B-O-R-I-N-G. The battle scene its good, but you soon realise that the White Witches army must be pretty terrible as both Edmund and Peter half-heartedly kill a few soldiers which seem to stand there and wait for the sword to tap them dead. THIS FILM COULD HAVE BEEN DONE SO MUCH BETTER!"

","The original CS lewis books listed great battles but Disney serves us up a very watered down and bloodless version of the CS Lewis epic tale.

I was disappointed with the battle scenes and the unimaginative swordplay that always ""killed"" without ever drawing blood. LAME.<br/><br/>For little kids who are ignorant of the original books this movie is a fine outing for them. For adults who haven't read the books it will be OK. And for those of us who are literate in CS Lewis we will always hold the books far above this fart of a movie. This rendition of the tale makes simply makes the books even that much more inviting.<br/><br/>THE BATTLE SCENES: Some of them were duplicates of footage from the video game Age of Mythology, along with the characters(Minotaurs to name just one) and their armor styles.

I don't mean to be an elitist either, I went into the movie wanting to like it. I was just stunned by the standard looking CGI, unimaginative lighting and visual theme, wooden acting and general feeling of ""Is this thing almost over?"". It also, unfortunately, had to conform to the trappings of what is considered a ""family"" movie. That runs the risk of causing unintentional laughs. The filmmakers had a choice: 1. A smaller, quirkier film focusing on the more magical and charming elements to the story 2. A big bloated ""epic"" (even though that word is reserved exclusively now for films of LOTR caliber)with an unneeded battle scene and very little in the way of character development.<br/><br/>Given all the positive reviews and the box office returns, they made the right choice for the consumers."

At several points in the movie, I got the distinct impression that the movie was made to be translated - the characters spent so little time actually speaking. I guess I've been spoiled by LoTR.<br/><br/>I found myself frustrated with the characters. How does someone get really good with a sword/bow/knife/etc so quickly? The battle scene was poor, terrible tactics, poor use of cavalry.

Lastly Rupert Everett as the fox expanded from the book but still a great character. All in all a great film for all ages even though not for the really young however.

","The feelings leading up to watching this movie was a mixture of skepticism and anticipation - I read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe a million times as a kid and I reread it in my most recent years since my cousin gave me the series two Christmases ago (God bless her). <br/><br/>But now after watching the movie I have to say ... well, I don't really know what to say first because I can't say enough good things about it!<br/><br/>Superbly cast, excellently acted, wonderful cinematography and special effects... and most importantly, it followed the book to the T. This is how movie remakes of books should be like - for once, Hollywood executives didn't leave anything out and instead added their own little bits and pieces where they felt needed a boost.. yet they still maintained all the important elements of the story AND made it flow correctly. Not an easy task and very well done. I mean, it is a blockbuster movie, so I'm sure they had to spice it up a bit, but I love how the story just picked right back up at the precise moments mentioned in the book after the extra elements were added... you didn't miss anything.<br/><br/>For kids no older than 18 years of age, these actors can convey such great emotion in their eyes and faces that it's not even imperative to have words leave their mouths to explain what they're feeling. Another daunting task, but well executed.<br/><br/>And finally, the Pevensie kids are exactly how I pictured them. Peter as the tall, handsome looking and righteous boy, that really plays out his elderly brother role (how about that final scene with Edmund, huh? Amazing). Susan as the pretty, logical, matter-of-fact girl - tall like her brother, brave enough to do anything. Edmund as the black sheep, the shorter, dark haired kid, always looking scruffy and having that look of mischief in his eyes. And Lucy, with the brown bob haircut and the adorable buck teeth when she smiles.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this movie. But I'll let the others handles the rest. Can't wait for the rest of the series. C.S. Lewis, you are my hero."

","Who could ever have believed Disney would do it? Make a faithful, magical, complex, touching, funny and exciting screen version of Lewis's children's classic. But they have. What is so terrific about this film is that the children--all portrayed with remarkable unfaked authenticity--beautifully portray the tensions and problems of any siblings. We feel their difficulties, their rivalries, their problems--not manufactured movie-type problems but the usual conflicts apparent in any family. And the tensions between them mirror the split in the magical world in which they find themselves. I never dreamed that one of the very greatest children's books could make it to the screen in such a consummate way. Tilda Swinton is superb as the White Witch and the story, built around a great human myth that is not necessarily or exclusively Christian, is simpler and finally more satisfying on a human level than 'Rings;. Oh and Harry Potter' pales by comparison. This is a hundred times more enjoyable and more original than 'Goblet'."
"lewboskian","3","6","14","11 December 2005"," Disney shouldn't make anymore of the Chronicles
","This movie was way, way, way below my expectations and was a pathetic final product for the amount of money spent on its production. It seemed like I was watching a wildlife preserve rather than a magical kingdom with all the animals randomly appearing throughout the movie in the corners of the screen. The CGI was crap. It was so unrealistic, they could have used stop-motion techniques like in the Nightmare Before Christmas and it would have been 10 times better. There was also a shortage of dialogue. I suppose the actors and actresses had a difficult time remembering their lines. Most of the scenes that involved character interaction were nothing more than people staring at each other, then crying or smiling, then hugging. The fight choreography was embarrassing. If you can fight the way Peter and Edmond did to win the fight for Narnia, then you're probably fighting in the land of pansies.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no character development whatsoever and there was not a decent introduction to the story. Without at least a little background or plot outline, nobody cares about what will transpire for the next two hours! Which creatures are on whose side? How did the White Witch come to power? Why are the children staying with a professor that appears to do nothing but smoke a pipe and lock himself in his room all day? It seemed like whoever edited the movie went back and re-spliced additional footage from scenes that went too long and placed it into the original version of the film to break up the action, causing the flow of the movie to suffer terribly. I read the books a long time ago as a kid and thought that they would eventually make great movies someday. But Mr. Adamson was definitely the wrong choice to helm this project.<br/><br/>Spielberg could have made this movie a blockbuster with one hand holding onto ET. Narnia's fantasy characters were also crap. Seriously, they must have hired 1st year makeup students from liberal arts colleges to design the creatures with spray paint, play dough, hot glue guns and heads from dead animals. And Liam Neeson as Aslan? Sorry, it just doesn't work. He doesn't have a voice with a lot of forcefulness. Get somebody like Sean Connery for crying out loud! If you haven't read the books, you'll just plod along with the movie and you probably won't care at all for Lucy, Susan, Peter or Edmond, or even Aslan when he gets sacrificed, or what happens to Narnia for that matter. The producers were obviously trying very hard to make this movie feel exactly like the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The castle designs, panoramic shots of the battlefield and camps, and the camera work are such a rip off from Peter Jackson that its nauseating. To top it all off, people in the audience were laughing at how comical the acting was, especially when Susan kills the White Witch's henchman (talk about a dwarf with an attitude problem). It was one of the worst action scenes I have ever seen that involved saving someones life in the nick of time. This was a huge waste of $15 for my wife and I. Don't see this movie unless you take something to enhance your movie going experience before entering the theater."

","I've been looking out for this film for some time, and was anxious to see it. Now i've seen it... and i've seldomly seen a worse book to film translation. Taking into consideration this is an incredibly good fantasy story.<br/><br/>The film itself looks great. Visual effects were cleaner then ever and everything was vibrant and full. Sure this is needed for this big a story. 3 CG companies worked on it, and it show's. They did their part perfectly... bravo, another step forward in CGI.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand - lacked almost everything that makes the book what it is. The book has a grand depth which makes these big fantasy stories work. It's not about the talking animals, but why they talk... it's not about the fact the 'god' is a lion, but it's about why he's a lion. This is what makes the book work on so many levels. The movie only worked on the shallow end. Aslan was far to weak compared to the book's character. The BBC version of narnia portrayed aslan as a being to be feared and loved at the same time - that is Aslan - incredibly powerful. In this movie he lacks the huge wisdom on one hand and the power on the other. A tame Aslan. Disney's Mufasa from the Lion King was twice as strong as this Aslan, and Aslan from the book is much more then Mufasa's character.<br/><br/>The audience had to laugh about the adult peter at the end of the movie - and that's about the worst thing that can happen to a story like narnia's. He resembles 'prince charming' from Shrek 2 - who was portrayed as a self-absorbed egotistic figure. Incredibly big flaw...<br/><br/>These are a couple of the bigger faults - but the whole movie is desaturated in the same way. If you read the book and find this film satisfying in comparison, please read the book again, because the book is meant to tell much much more then this movie does. This film ended up in the McDonalds-commercial category. Very sweet... very colorful... very smartly adapted to what-the-public-likes... very empty... no vitamins, just a short lasting good taste.<br/><br/>There were some good parts. The Lucy character was nicely done, and really made an imprint. The other 3 didn't... i couldn't describe their personalities if i was asked now. Which negates Lucy's quality.<br/><br/>I've seen about a zillion stars for this film, but i really, really don't understand. Maybe the big posters and the visuals indeed are enough. The quality of Peter Jackson's Lord of The Rings must be very much underestimated if this movie gets this high a rating. Hope Disney chooses another director, because Narnia requires someone deeper... and less American.<br/><br/>Walt would never approve."
"astronic","4","5","11","11 December 2005"," Underwhelming
","After the huge success of ""The Lord of the Rings"", studio money seems to flow rather easy for films of the fantasy genre. Money alone however does not make a good film, and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a sad example for this.<br/><br/>In this movie, really nothing is as it should be. First, at over 40 minutes the exposition is way too long and provides little in terms of establishing characters: OK, Edmund is seemingly not that nice and Lucy willingly accompanies half-naked beings she meets in the forest to their home, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Secondly (and this is what hurts most): Narnia doesn't live, in fact, it looks like (and probably is) an indoor studio environment. The snow looks fake, except in very few scenes at the end there is absolutely no wind, the skin color of the characters doesn't look like it's cold and there is no icy breath to been seen. Actually, after getting bathed in a river that was frozen minutes ago, instead of shaking the characters look like they've just left a hot tub. Additionally, in the first 2/3 of the movie, we don't get to see anybody but characters with talking roles, which contributes to the feeling that there isn't a Narnia outside the main storyline we follow. All in all (and given a budget of 180 million USD) regarding atmosphere, this movie is a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the story is much too simple (having never read the novel, I don't know if it's the screenplay's or Lewis' fault): 4 children enter a new world, which they are destined to save according to some prophecy, and there is an evil witch, who is, well, evil. That's about it. And at the end you can't even tell, what these children actually did to save Narnia and why they were needed. For reason unknown, they get crowned as kings and queens of Narnia anyway. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie does everything to prevent creating tension or being taken seriously, which comes down to three big mistakes: <br/><br/>1) Death is not final. Every character which gets frozen by the witch, can easily be defrosted later. Actually, getting defeated by the witch is nothing but a short cryostasis and no drama at all. And the only character that gets killed the conventional way, gets resurrected by some random magical mojo, which doesn't play a part before or after.<br/><br/>2) Violence is totally ungraphic. You actually wonder, if those Narnia creatures have any blood in their veins at all. The film doesn't even make the effort to switch to fast MTV style cutting to avoid showing explicit scenes (like Peter Jackson did to get the Lord of the Rings a PG-13 rating), they just refrain from showing blood, even if there would be tones of it.<br/><br/>3) Battle environments and choreography look like the big battle in Star Wars Episode I, and have the seriousness of an on-stage performance in Disney World. I mean, come on, the final battle takes place under a clear blue sky, surrounded by green hills, is being fought by colorful creatures, who obviously don't even hurt each other (you never see a killing or even just a defeated warrior lying dead on the ground).<br/><br/>There are a few positive points as well: Some of the animals are nicely animated, dialogue isn't too bad for this kind of movie, the children are not annoying for the most parts and there are a few nice landscape shots.<br/><br/>But after all that doesn't prevent Narnia from being a sterile, soulless movie without a story worth talking about. It might be fine for kids under 12 who can gasp at the whole ""fantasy world with funny beings and kids as heroes"" kind of thing, but it surely is nothing I would recommend to an adult viewer, who has seen at least one decent fantasy movie."

","Having been eagerly anticipating the much awaited chronicles or narnia I was upset when it turned out to be such a monotoned, slow and sleep inducing film.<br/><br/>Right up until the final battle scene staying awake was less appealing than running off to the toilets for a quick whizz, the story takes far too long before any real action occurrs, and the only scene which does the original storyline any credit is the grand fight scene, a little over-dramatic and a waste of time, my verdict is please don't waste your time. allow your imagination to create narnia, rather than ruin a what should be epic of a film."

Usually this is understandable for the requirements of the medium, but in this case it is totally unnecessary, for example a melting ice river scene. <br/><br/>The screenwriters have added 21st century gags into a 1950s story. The gags work better than the story (well they did with the audience I was with).<br/><br/>Unfortunately the White Witch just isn't white enough for me. She could be described as pale. So she's not the pantomime baddie you expect her to look like, but her clothes and her Ice Palace are pretty cheap looking. Bad memories of Die Another Day and Batman & Robin came back - they look good but are totally unbelievable. And when a certain man in a beard turns up you either know it's Father Christmas (because you've read the book) or it's a random man in a beard - i.e. he looks nothing like an image of Father Christmas.<br/><br/>I am being hard with the film, but there are good points to raise. The effects are overall terrific, even if they do conjure up happier memories of a Peter Jackson blockbuster. Aslan does look real, and the beasts have been created with care. Harry Gregson-William's music is good when used in the right scene, but here again it's way too rhythmic and 21st century for the scenarios most of the time.<br/><br/>The acting is good, with Tilda Swinton providing a strong, though not menacing performance. Of the four children, I'd say Lucy was the strongest, though they all did above average work for a film like this.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film lies with director Andrew Adamson. He's a master of CGI work (a-la Shrek) and he deals with the fantasy world well...for a Shrek film, but in my book the vivid colours and style is more suited to a comedy, not a serious fantasy film. And Peter suddenly can wield a sword and ride horses, just like that. Of course everything has to be compared with Lord of the Rings, but in this case, it falls so far short it shouldn't be compared at all. Or maybe I'm being unfair and Narnia isn't supposed to be like Middle-Earth.<br/><br/>Adamson has had to work with a compromised script so that scenes we are meant to feel something in don't work because there's been no emotional build up to (Aslan's introduction is very under whelming, as is conveying his ""Legend"" status). Then there are the logical mistakes, such as screaming at the top of your voice about how to evade capture when you're only a few feet away from the enemy, or hearing a whisper half a mile away etc.<br/><br/>The allegorical argument is lost on me, I am a person who knows nothing about bible stories, but I think this is an easy recruiting film for the evangelicals in America (who part-financed the film anyway). However, for young children not of the Christian faith, this will simply be a good story.<br/><br/>Overall I give marks for technical prowess and the opening 30 minutes. However the rest of the film is lacklustre to me, a very cynical 22 year old, but I know younger children will enjoy this film a lot, and rightly so. I don't see this franchise living up to the Harry Potter status because, basically, the stories are really dated. LW&W was very faithful to the source novel, but subsequent stories with much less ""money-shot action"" will no doubt be altered beyond recognition for the lowest common denominator audience. Hopefully the series will be an allegory of Aslan - die soon, then resurrect for the force of good. The later stories deserve better than this."

I went in to it with high hopes as i loved the books as a child but within half an hour i was waiting for it to end, it was only two hours long but felt like it was four hours. I thought it was to slow, to long and badly acted (with the exception of the witch who was alright), But the main problem was that none and i mean none of the main characters was either likable or engaging.

"petcrows","1","9","24","26 December 2005"," a vacuous vehicle latched onto by philistine fools
","Disney's approaching the philistine mega & evangelical churches was a disgusting marketing ploy along the same lines as the equally disgusting yet aptly bloodthirsty worshiping ""Passion of the Christ"" - it's all a sign of the times. A time when corporatism and warmongering and religion go hand in hand. A time when the worship of money and power match up quite nicely with what was wrought from 2000 years of bloody history from organized religion.<br/><br/>But what the mega & evangelical church pastors didn't bargain for perhaps was a plot-less heartless mess of the film. Knowing how it was being used by the churches & Disney cast a wide shadow which almost prevented me from seeing it. But I did see it Christmas day. And what I found was a soulless movie. A movie which matches up with the soulless corporatist warmongering which modern conservative churches wallow in today in America. There was no plot. No feeling. The talking animals were absurd, and their talking disgraced & demeaned what our fellow animals really are - just as Disney's films did in the past.<br/><br/>The only useful thing I got out of the film was thinking again about the whole absurd nature of the mythical Jesus's resurrection. Lewis makes a vague reference to it with when the lion sacrifices himself. But what does he sacrifice himself for? Why does he do it? Because of an arbitrary and chosen law. An adherence to ""old magic."" ""It's all poppycock,"" I thought, ""just as is what Christians claim happened with their mythical Jesus, in paying for sins passed down to us by our fathers. The concept that sons & daughters must pay for the sins of their fathers is a reprehensible concept,"" I thought some more.<br/><br/>So perhaps the church preachers succeeded in having a message conveyed, by latching onto Disney's corporatist fascist greed in a disgusting marketing attempt to use religion to market their mess of a film - but the message conveyed is perhaps not what the preachers wanted perhaps. The synergistic marketing conveyed a message that organized religion in America today primarily worships at the feet of fascist corporatist warmongering. And the film itself, with it's vacuous & wrote nature, shows that it's little more than a self serving vehicle for the corporation known as Disney, a vehicle which the philistine evangelical churches latched on to to serve their own selfish interests.<br/><br/>The poor person centered teachings of the mythical Jesus are far removed from these blatant but vacuous attempts to suck ever more of the uneducated & increasingly disenfranchised American workers, into an ever increasing sense of self denial & delusion - but a state of self denial which serves New American Fascism. Yes, fascism is on the march in America, and sadly Lewis's Narnia is yet another victim.<br/><br/>For comparison, the Narnia story as conveyed on PBS a few years ago was more interesting. But I recommend not wasting your time on this latest mess. Instead, go buy the expanded DVD versions of Lord of the Rings, and maybe check out the PBS Narnia version from your local library or buy it - if you were a fan of the written version. But don't waste your time on this wannabee imitator - on this vacuous soulless sham of the film latched onto by preachers who love war, money, and corporatist power wrought through disgusting marketing synergies. Bletch. Away from me you trashy film. Away from me thou philistines."
"bigverybadtom","2","2","3","13 August 2013"," Disappointing Adventure
","C. S. Lewis was the author of the Narnia story series, which was meant to be a ""Lord Of The Rings""-type scenario for children. Lewis himself wrote about religion and was a convert to Christianity later in life, but the Narnia series was not necessarily intended to be an allegory about Christianity, contrary to popular myth. Degrading death and rebirth of someone is obviously not exclusive to the Bible.<br/><br/>I mention this because the novels (which I haven't read) and the movie are simply epic adventure stories. So how are they on their own merits? The establishing parts are good; siblings living in London during the Blitz are sent to safety in the countryside, and while playing they discover the title magical kingdom.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the children don't really engage us, nor does anyone else, and the story is rather confusing. Worst of all is the ending, where the kids have grown into adults during their time there, but when they get back to their home, they are kids again. Huh? Special effects are okay, but that was about it. Go see Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" instead."
"alexott2013","8","2","3","28 June 2012"," Four siblings set out to save a secret land from a freezing dictatorship.
","Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, created from the novel by C.S. Lewis, depicts a family of four kids who find a hidden land in the back of a wardrobe. Upon entering the land of Narnia, they find out that they are the ones who are supposed to save it from the White Witch's reign. The four children befriend, fight, and rebel against the witch, in order to save Narnia from her wickedness.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we come to find a lion by the name of Aslan, who is the true King of Narnia, and is closely related to Jesus Christ. The director of the movie, Andrew Adamson, has a consistent emphasis on Aslan's presence through out the land. His peers and friends respect him in a way similar to the way that Jesus Christ was respected by those close to him. Adamson brings this point to the front in that Aslan goes through many of the same actions as Jesus. Such actions included healing, teaching, sacrificing himself, and resurrecting from his death. In the same thought that Aslan is Jesus, the four children, Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter are disciples of Aslan. His generous actions and his supportive cast make for a direct reflection of Jesus and his disciples. <br/><br/>This movie was not only a great alternative depiction to the life of Jesus, but it was also entertaining. It's a movie that can be appealing to everyone, especially children and families. After reading the book in grade school, it was really a pleasure to see the classic unfold in a visual way. Being older and watching the story unfold made it a lot easier for me to understand what was really going on, compared to reading the book when I was younger. As for the cinematic part of it, the CGI put in to this movie is stunning and really draws you in closer. Also, with the awesome roar of Aslan, this movie easily makes you want to hear it again in theaters."

","I saw this movie about a week after Christmas 2005 in a theater. I must say that I am very glad I did. This is one of the best movies ever! This movie is adapted from the C.S Lewis book. The story tells a wonderful, but dark story of four kids who are sent away to live with a professor while London is being bombed by the Germans. There, the youngest child, Lucy finds a wardrobe and she discovers a magical land-Narnia. No one believes her until the family were forced to hide in the cupboard. Once they are in Narnia, they must defeat the evil White Witch with the help of Aslan the lion and all of the good creatures. This film is about close as the book as it could be. Adamson did a very good job directing. The kids were great and had very good chemistry. I liked the bond of the family. The CGI Animation was good as well. The talking beavers and Aslan looked very real and believable. The score for this film was good as it should be. It's very moody and unpredictable, which is a good thing. I recommend to not only Christians, but for everybody. I rate this film a 10/10."

"dkncd","10","2","3","17 September 2007"," Great C.S. Lewis adaptation
","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is the long-awaited modern adaptation of C.S. Lewis' fantasy novel. Rumors of the film floated around for awhile, and no doubt the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies encouraged this film's production. The BBC produced three Narnia films in the late 1980s and 1990 that captured the stories nicely, but were lacking in quality special effects. This adaptation captures the story nicely and has the special effects to match. With modern CGI effects the filmmakers are able to render the creatures of Narnia to be more believable than the people in suits of the BBC movies. The film captures the land of Narnia beautifully and has a great score to complement the scenery.<br/><br/>The casting choices for the film were appropriate. All of the child actors were believable, and so were the actors and actresses that played or voiced the creatures of Narnia. Liam Neeson is an apt choice to voice Aslan and brings the needed authority to the character. Tilda Swinton was also an excellent choice as the White Witch and is appropriately menacing in the role. I enjoyed Jim Broadbent's performance in his minor role as Professor Kirke.<br/><br/>The film is faithful to Lewis' novel and develops the material well. The film's battle scenes were well-staged and paced. The story developed here is not an epic of the same scale of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but is an exceptional fantasy story none the less. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" nicely captures C.S. Lewis' novel and I await the next film in the chronicles, ""Prince Caspian"", with great anticipation."

","I have love ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" since childhood, reading this particular book over 10 times. I just finished it again today and watched this movie again. Unfortunately, this film relies on fabricated tension instead of the tension still built into the book, and it makes for a very weak story that never really builds to the emotional climax the book delivers. Some tense words from the book are simply removed from this movie, or re-fashioned in the name of excitement. The movie adds tension that simply doesn't exist in the book. It hurts to say that it this is a clear attempt to follow in the LOTR greatness and simply comes up short."

","Classic literature and CGI technology don't always mix. They did an admirable job of it but at the same time it became a distraction. C.S Lewis had developed such rich characters replete with conflict and emotional frailty. The actors, particularly Peter and Edmund, were horrendous. I thought their performances were so wooden and two dimensional I thought maybe they were CGI. Peter was too wimpy, Edmund failed to broadcast the internal complexity of his Judas nature, the girls I thought, were fantastic. I didn't hate the movie, but I did not get the veneration surrounding it either. It could have been much more were it not for, yet again, the focus on computer generated spectacle winning out over simply telling the story.

I could see a little bit of everyone's naughty little brother in Edmund. The Narnia world was overwhelming and all I could do is wish I lived there. I really appreciated that the movie stayed along the ""Christian"" lines too. The lion was so real and majestic. Even I felt a tingling of fear at the first sight of him.

"TxMike","Null","2","3","9 May 2006"," Entertaining fantasy. What's in your wardrobe??
","A lot has been made of CS Lewis and the Christian message that is contained in this story. I can see where one can make that connection, with the Lion, but it isn't by any means a necessary connection. <br/><br/>While I enjoyed this movie, I don't find it great. For many of us there is a secret fascination with the idea of a fantasy passage into another world. We saw it years ago in ""Wizard of Oz"", we saw it more recently in ""Zathura."" There have been many fantasy stories with this theme. <br/><br/>Here the youngest of the 4 Pevensie children, sent to a rural estate to be safe from WW II bombing of London, goes into a piece of furniture, a regular wardrobe, during a game of hide and seek with her siblings. As she goes past the various fur coats hanging up, suddenly and magically she is in an outdoor snow setting, nothing like the grounds outside the house. She quickly meets a faun, a strange looking creature that looks almost human above the waist, but had animal-like legs with hooves. She finds out she is in a land called 'Narnia.'<br/><br/>Eventually all the children end up in Narnia, where it has been cold for 100 years under the rule of wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton). Plus, the children find out they have the duty to help bring springtime to Narnia, and make things right again. <br/><br/>Jim Broadbent has the small role of Professor Kirke, who lives at the country retreat. There are a couple of scenes where it appears that he knew about the passage to Narnia, perhaps even went there himself when he was small, but it is not treated in a definitive manner. At the end I didn't know what his role was in the whole story, if any. Perhaps fans of the CS Lewis books understand the whole story better. For me it was just ""OK"" entertainment."

Great stuff. The actors and actresses play their parts perfectly, particularly the Pevensies, the White Witch and Professor Kirke.

If ""Rings"" is a Cadillac, I thought ""Narnia"" would be a Buick. A Buick Regal, no less, but still a Buick.<br/><br/>But after popping out this DVD, I found myself thoroughly entertained. I actually applauded at the end, even though I was alone. ""Narnia"" can take its place as perhaps second to ""Lord of the Rings"" in the fantasy adaptations trophy room.<br/><br/>I hadn't heard of any of the children in this movie, but they were all good. Expect that main little girl to get more work in the future, she was excellent. Tilda Swinton was so-so as the villain, but she wasn't very scary. The wicked witch in ""Wizard of Oz"" is more gangster than her.<br/><br/>There were a few distractions while watching the movie. For one, there are more talking animals than a Disney animated film (wait, this is a Disney movie)! And it bugged me that I couldn't figure out who voiced the Lion. I thought for sure it was Sam Neill, but instead it was that Cadillac among Buicks, Liam Neeson who provided the vocal chops.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Narnia"" is a very regal movie: exciting, good lessons for children, and spectacular visual effects.

"Luminaria","10","2","3","19 April 2006"," Simply wonderful!
","I can't think of enough good things to say about this movie! We saw it three times in the theater when it came out! And scooped it up right away when it came out on DVD! Historically, I've always found something wanting in a book I've loved and read over and over that comes to film. So, it was with a bit of trepidation that we went to see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe on opening day. I was just plain blown away! They kept every element of the story that was important - and filled in bits that helped make things a bit more clear to modern kids - such as the little scene at the beginning at the train station - when the children are sent off out of war-time London to the country for safety. In the books, that's just a line or two - but for a modern young person, they may have forgotten the London Blitz, and how very dangerous and terrifying it really was for quite a while in England's major cities, especially London. I still wonder how the bombs managed to miss Big Ben, though.... (grin) Visually - they got everything right - it's just fantastic! The Professor's house, the Wardrobe, even the Beavers! They remembered the tiniest details - like the fact that the White Witch didn't just give Edmund food to eat, but beverage to drink - and in C.S. Lewis's symbolism, that's important - a kind of ""backwards"" evil communion, that bewitches him. (That is one thing I wish they'd made clearer - that Edmond was bewitched, not just being a brat. He WAS a brat quite a bit of the time, before that - but his betrayal wasn't completely his own doing. It was quite clear in the book that he was under a compulsion that was as strong as opiate addiction, longing for more of that Turkish Delight.) The White Witch was beautiful - so you can see why Edmund would be drawn to her - but she had that coldness and distance to her - she was wonderfully evil! And tall! They kept her tall - Jadis was almost 7 feet tall in the books! Little things.... they add up - they're important. A phoenix needs to look like a phoenix, a griffin needs to look like a griffin, and a woman that can casually rip a bar off a lamp post (which is how the lamppost gets ""planted"" in Narnia anyway - Jadis did that - long story - read the books!) - needs to be strong - so the chariot scene in the battle was delightful - only an incredibly strong woman could have held those reins! I could go on and on - it was just a beautiful film! And we've waited so long for this - but it's something they simply couldn't have made 10 years ago - maybe not even 5 years ago - the technology just didn't exist. I'm so glad these films are here - and so glad they are obviously being made by someone who loves the BOOKS! The only other thing that was irksome was using Liam Neeson for the voice of Aslan. It was kind of distracting - and as much as I like him as an actor - his voice just wasn't deep enough. Aslan's a baritone. He just IS. (Sorry) I particularly enjoyed the way they did Aslan's resurrection. If you are familiar with Christian resurrection theology at all, you'll know how important this scene was to Lewis. It would have been easy to have overdone it. Or understate it. But I think they caught just the right tone, without smacking you between the eyes.<br/><br/>All the metaphor and allegory are right there - without beating you over the head - and the great story is firmly in place. I loved it. My son loved it - and he's 15 and won't admit he likes ANYTHING any more, especially if Mom likes it too! (LOL) My nephew's are 9 and 6, and they loved it too. My brother-in-law isn't especially religious, is plain down-to-earth and practical - and he enjoyed it. So - all in all, I'd say it's a win-win for anyone in the family, no matter what their tastes!"

Or have they....<br/><br/>I couldn't stop myself from catching the fact that the film was dull. I mean, they really stayed faithful to the original, which can be as far as I'm concerned, only a good thing, but the result was vastly disappointing. Maybe it was just a bad mood, or too high expectations, but still:""Boooooooooooring""! However I must give credits to Tilda Swinton for her performance in acting the Snow witch. Her deeds were as cruel and as hysterical as I remember them from cartoon. As the snow laied throughout the Narnia was melting, so was she getting more and more repulsive. Her attractive blistering pale skin from beginning was steadily turning into a red burned dermal cancer.<br/><br/>""And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling kids."" Don't we all remember that line from Scooby Dooby Doo. Why did those pesky children had to interfere. Who is to say that wood animals are better in views of good versus evil, than mountain goblins, minotaurs and other black marked animals. The way I see it, all they did was playing a role of a revolutionary, stepping on a side of anarchy. Fairy-tales can get disturbing sometimes. What I resent them the most is that if they wanted to film a movie for children, why did they have to make it so violent. I get the filling like they wanted to make an universal film, for anybody to watch. If they really wanted that, why filming a fairy-tale??"
"baker-9","6","2","3","18 January 2006"," Solid but not Inspired
","Despite some fine scenes and special effects here and there, ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" doesn't quite scale the heights of film fantasy to which it aspires. There's a kind of dramatic flatness to the story, at least as adapted here.<br/><br/>Granted, the original isn't particularly complex emotionally even compared to Lord of the Rings. Director Andrew Adamson has only directed the animated ""Shrek"" films before this, so that could also be a reason for the one-dimensional quality of the drama.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is very uneven. Among the children, the wonderful Georgie Henley as Lucy and Skandar Keynes as Edmund are fine, but Anna Popplewell is a dull Susan, and William Moseley is a stiff Peter whose transformation into a soldier is impossible to take seriously on any level. Tilda Swinton has a imperious coldness as the White Witch - I liked her though you could say that she isn't quite terrifying enough. Another highlight is James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus - his scenes with Lucy are among the best in the film.<br/><br/>The final battle scene - not explicitly described in the novel - is Lord of the Rings Lite, but it works well enough. One disappointment is the voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan. Obviously it was recorded separately, but Neeson's line readings aren't very engaging and the sound has a disembodied quality that exposes the artificiality of the special effects. Some of the other voice performers (Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the beavers, and Rupert Everett as the fox) fare better. This film gets its job done well enough, but classic fantasy film it isn't.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see when/if the rest of the Narnia books get adapted. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings"" or the more recent ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy, the remaining Narnia books are extremely variable in quality (and increasingly preachy), the final volume being downright dull."

I had no concept of the life outside the theater for those two hours. But this movie was definitely over-hyped. There was no element of the beauty that was promised and it was most definitely not profound, or moving, and it did not change my life in any way. Maybe if I had heard overwhelmingly positive reviews I would have expected less and liked it better."

","This film was excellent. As an avid fan of the C.S. Lewis books, I found it incredible to have the images in my mind seen on the big (or small) screen! The animation lacked a bit, but the storyline, acting and imaging was incredible. I actually found myself crying (again) with the ""death"" of Aslan. And even though I am 26 and in my own language, a boertjie, which means that we are tough and robust, I cried in the theater and at home when I went to read that scene again.<br/><br/>The director and creative staff that took part in this movie should be congratulated for a job well done.<br/><br/>Thank you for making a movie that I can show my kids one day.<br/><br/>a Grateful boertjie"
"Jay_Exiomo","8","2","3","8 January 2006"," Not perfect, but good enough to start a potential franchise
","I admit I have never read a single ""Narnia"" novel (although I've read a few chapters of C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity""), but I did get excited about ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe"" getting its cinematic treatment considering the great awe I had for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, of whom the author of the novel it was based on - J.R.R. Tolkien - was a good friend of Lewis.<br/><br/>The first part of what could be a new installment in the fantasy genre tells the story of four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - who are brought far away from London to an old country house to escape the perils of World War II. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy stumbles upon a seemingly ordinary wardrobe in an otherwise empty room. She hides inside only to realize she is transported to the perpetually snowing land of Narnia, a land where animals talk and the evil White Witch rules causing the winter spell.<br/><br/>Soon, all four of them get to enter the land and they learn of Narnia's history: the great lion Aslan is the true guardian of the kingdom and has been absent for many years but is ""on the move again."" It is also prophesied that when four children are to take the throne, the witch's powers will fail.<br/><br/>As I've said, I've never read the book and was not sure what to expect when I came to watch the movie, other than it was set in Narnia, that there was a lion, there was a witch, and there was a wardrobe. And from the plot summaries at the back of so many versions of the book, I also knew there were four children. But after watching it I'm now thinking of catching up on what I missed on my reading list during my childhood years. ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" presents a variety of messages, both within the Christian context (which should be obvious) and the world in general.<br/><br/>I don't know how much liberty was done with the book but I like the direction director and co-writer Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely took the audience on. Adamson has accomplished to retell a story that includes talking lions, beavers, foxes, fauns, centaurs and other fantastical creatures which could have been otherwise ineffective, and maybe even unintentionally funny. His experience with Donkey and Puss in Boots may have helped.<br/><br/>Adamson succeeds in all this while the script provides it with humor. It is also filled with impressive visuals, peppered with good soundtrack. The film also boasts of first-rate CGI but unlike ""King Kong,"" where CGI was used in an over-indulging fashion, Adamson uses it to perfection. Through all this, he works with a cast of mostly first-time actors, especially the children. The performance in particular by Georgie Henley as Lucy, is sweet but never cloying. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch provides menace to her character.<br/><br/>I think it has enough charm and enough depth to stand quite well on it's own. I guess it depends on how the viewer will react to the thematic story beloved by many (unread by me) in this Disney interpretation. Perhaps a lot of people will be inclined to dismiss it, partly because the religious theme may turn them off, partly because they hate Disney, and partly because fantasy is just not their thing.<br/><br/>While I would not say this movie is better than other fantasy films of the contemporary era, it certainly does bring a positive outlook for what's to come to the series or even to the whole genre. ""Lord of the Rings"" has attained such great heights and even the ""Harry Potter"" has elevated itself so much that, personally, this first installment of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" finds itself a little wanting. Still, it is well-made, and that says a lot for a first installment... that is, if it IS the first installment."
"klfbooks","9","2","3","7 January 2006"," Poor score the only fault
","I am a great fan of the books and I was very satisfied with this film. I don't think it could have been done any better or more faithfully than it was EXCEPT for the score. Yawn. In a couple of places it sounded like LOTR wannabe. In a couple of other places, PASSION OF Christ wannabe. Mostly, it was instantly forgettable. Can you hum a single tune from the score a month after seeing the movie? Neither can I. How about some fantastic music next time around? Loved the kids, the faun, the professor, the centaurs, the witch, and the beautiful scenery. Aslan was as good as a CG lion can be, though he is still fake-looking...I'm not sure it's possible to perfectly portray a feline deity."
"pmac1978","10","2","3","5 January 2006"," Kudos and congrats on a new Children's Classic!
","My first introduction to the Narnia, (prior to reading and falling in love with the book) was through the 1979 cartoon. I had seen bits and pieces of the 1988 BBC production, and while it captured my attention I can't say I was ever really that crazy about it. I found it extremely slow paced. While a discussion has been on-going about the look of the Pevensie children in this current film version, it should be pointed out that the young girl playing Lucy in that version is Eleanor Roosevelt in training, sporting an over-bite that enters each frame before she does. Not exactly a pretty picture.<br/><br/>For years I had hoped someone would bring this tale to life on the big screen. It was rumored that the movie version would be updated and set in the city of Los Angeles. Why not?! Good idea! Let's take a story that children of all ages have loved for over 40 years and ""improve it, by modernizing it and giving it that Hollywood touch!"". Wonderful. While we're at it, let's remake ""The Wizard of Oz"" and cast Brittney Spears as Dorothy and Jim Carey as the wizard.<br/><br/>Producer Perry Moore and director Andrew Adamson should be praised and applauded for their beautiful, endearing , magical and most importantly, FAITHFUL film adaptation of a children's classic. Again, I highly disagree with the rantings of those attacking the children and their ""looks"", and let's not forget people they are just kids, ,so lay off, OK ? It's bad enough having bullies on the playground at a young and tender age, but to have the American public attack them on a message board, Come on! Personally, I think William Mosely is adorable as Peter Pevensie. Georgie Henely is the perfect choice for the wide and innocent Lucy. She is thoroughly believable as the little girl who stumbles upon the magical world of Narnia. Every giggle, every tear drop is right on the money and honest. I never once got the impression that this kid was forcing her performance. She could certainly be a model to most other child actors in Hollywood, and more then half of the adult's as well.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton turns in a riveting, bravura performance as the White Witch. Aside from being stunning , she is deliciously wicked. Liam Neeson is the perfect choice for the voice of ""Aslan"", rightful ruler of the magical world. James McAvoy is a delight as Mr. Tumnus. Jim Broadbent deserves a nod in his small but pivotal and endearing role of Professor Kirke. Mr. and Mrs. Beaver are a hoot!<br/><br/>I also found the movie visually stunning. In particular the moments at the castle of the White Witch, the children's journey with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver to the meet Aslan and of course the great palace of Cair Parevel. If you see anything this Holiday season , make it ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"". You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Oh, yes...I do have one complaint. There is a marvelous moment between Lucy and the Professor at the end of the film, edited as it is, it shows up after some credits are rolling and so often times people miss out as they are leaving the theater . I have seen the film several times now. I hope when they release the DVD version, they will tag the moment between Lucy and the Professor on BEFORE they roll the credits."

","After watching the verbal bashing given by Jonathan Ross on BBC a few weeks ago, I was a little wary of going to watch this one. Since my kids and other half wanted to see it, I quashed my reservations and off we went...<br/><br/>Well, what a delight! I have read the Narnia books several times over the years and had a good mental visualisation of what I thought it was like. In many cases, the film echoed this pretty well, with the exception of the witch's palace. I just loved Mr Tumnus! My other half, who is notoriously choosy about his film viewing was entranced, too, not to mention the children, my teenage daughter, especially who was viewing for the second time! So, I think the film will appeal to all.<br/><br/>I must mention that the filming, special effects and photography were beautiful, with such wonderful scenery that it briefly made me want to emigrate to NZ! The musical score was also lovely; it reminded me a bit of the Lord of the Rings score at times - along with the scenery, of course. Fantastic! <br/><br/>So, to summarise, great film, well worth watching however old you are. You don't need to have read the book to understand the film, either. I'd recommend to Jonathan Ross that he should go and read the book of the film he rubbished, whether he has read it before or not. Then, he will see it ain't half bad, mate!

"MaxBorg89","8","2","3","28 December 2005"," A very promising beginning
","Before Harry Potter made his appearance, there was another fantasy series people (not just children) all over the world loved, and still love: The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.Lewis. Now the saga has been successfully transferred to the screen (an attempt had already been made on TV in 1988-1990, but the result, while faithful to the book, was rather annoying).<br/><br/>Based on the first volume in the series (it's actually the second if you follow the suggested reading order, but the first Lewis wrote), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe tells the story of the four Pevensie siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, who have to leave their home in London during WWII and live in Professor Kirke's (Jim Broadbent) huge mansion. It is there that they find the titular piece of furniture, which will lead them to Narnia, a magical world inhabited by all kinds of creatures: talking animals, fauns, centaurs, and of course the great lion, creator and king of Narnia, Aslan himself (voiced by Liam Neeson), who reveals to the children their arrival has been foretold and anticipated for years, as they're supposed to help him defeat the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire enchanted world with an everlasting winter. It's all gonna be a huge adventure, part Harry Potter (the kids who are introduced to another world and find out they are ""chosen ones""), part Lord of the Rings (the epic battle between good and evil).<br/><br/>Okay, let's calm down with the ""epic battle"" bit. As visually mesmerizing as it may be, it suffers from the camera being a little prudish and looking away in the crucial moments. After all, we're talking about a PG feature, but come on: we're in the 21st century and this is actually the darkest opus in the saga (alongside The Silver Chair). They have even added a sequence which wasn't in the book to make the story more dramatic.<br/><br/>That said, this wonderful movie doesn't seem to have any significant flaws, except the fact that some of the CGI wolves look a little bit too fake. The other beasts, however, look fine, and their voices are provided by a bunch of talented people: Ray Winstone's Mr.Beaver (and spouse) perfectly serves his purpose as the funny sidekick and Rupert Everett's turn as Fox makes it pretty clear why said animal is the symbol of unreliability, while Neeson's Aslan is the wise and kind mentor/father figure, in the same league as Richard Harris'Dumbledore and Ian McKellen's Gandalf. On the human side, Swinton is the standout as usual, proving you don't need excessive make-up to be a threatening presence. She is a very worthy villain for this film. The kids are good too, the quality of their acting increasing as the story goes on (lucky for us the movie was shot in chronological order).<br/><br/>As for the Christian subtext everyone's been talking about, it is present but you don't have to interpret the film that way if you don't want to. Just consider it a hugely exciting fantasy outing and you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>So, after this remarkable experience, will the other six books be turned into movies as well? To paraphrase Professor Kirke, keep your eyes open..."
"nablaquadro","8","2","3","28 December 2005"," An epic transposition of reality in the fantasy
","Normally, I'm never skeptical towards child-target movies, but I were (little) afraid to waste 5 euros in the ticket of ""The Chronicle of Narnia"". A big budget and good advertisement not always mean a success.<br/><br/>What a great surprise ! The first 10 minutes, the rush during the war is emotionally stunning! I felt myself involved in the story since the first scenes, the sweetness of Lucy, the consciousness of the olders and the complex character of Edmund.<br/><br/>Writers of the script deleted the blood and the cruel scenes (present in the original book of Lewis) to package a bittersweet gift for children and ""parents"" non-voted to bloody action. This is an aspect I appreciated a lot. Children (and adults too) don't need any additional violence than the ordinary aired daily on TV.<br/><br/>An entire paragraph should be dedicated at the witch Tilda Swinton, a glacial actress I always loved in her past films; and her role in Narnia seems to fit her like a glove.<br/><br/>I found ""The chronicles of Narnia"" very instructive principally for (another) war between The Good and the Evil, but the experience of Edmund and his redemption, the love between brothers (or friends) is an universal rule, in Narnia like in the real world. The crystal winter where the land is trapped, the repression against the fauns are a representation of totalitarian regimes raised in Europe before World War II - and the springs can be read as the return to the peace. Don't we forget Lewis wrote the books around 1950, when the memory of the World War II was living.<br/><br/>All the actors, from the witch, the children and the minor characters fit their roles perfectly, giving off a sensation reality even in a queer world like that (inspired to the Italian city of Narni).<br/><br/>The negative side of this movie, very little, maybe are the 140 minutes, too long for a child and some boring scenes. Anyway I enjoyed this movie very much and I surely recommend it for the families, the adults and for the Lord of the Rings lovers too !<br/><br/>A must see."
"autumn-stock","9","2","3","27 December 2005"," Exciting and True to the Book
","The only complaint I have is that it didn't last longer! Despite his wish to avoid a live action version of any of the seven Chronicles, C.S. Lewis would be proud. Tilda Swinton IS the White Witch, she is as cold and calculating as one would expect her to be. Her violent cruelty as well as some of the other violent themes are toned down a bit, though - a little Disneyfied - however, the strangeness of the tale is uncompromised and it is truly magnificent. It is obvious to me that, like The Lord of the Rings, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was made by some who appreciate the book, if not absolutely love it. The cinematography is phenomenal and the casting couldn't have been better. I can't wait to see the rest of them!"
"mortenw-1","9","2","3","27 December 2005"," One down - six to go...
","Most people will be wanting to compare the Narnia movie with the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings. How could you not? So how do you do it? You do not.<br/><br/>This film stands on its own and it does it well. The movie grabs you and pulls you into the universe of Narnia as well as the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The effects are as good as LotR... but given that it was the same company, you would expect so. If you liked the Look and 'feel' of LotR, you will let yourself get swept away by this one.<br/><br/>The story line is as per the novel, with a few variations here and there. On the whole, I felt that the movie has an impact close to what the book had on me so many years ago.<br/><br/>Now we come to where the movie lost the point that would have scored it a perfect 10. The actors. Almost all are good if not terrific, however there is something lacking. To name names and point fingers, Peter and Susan. Lucy is great and Edmund is just as believable in the role as the self absorbed coming of age teen ager that redeems himself. Peter and Suan are weak and not all that believable, which is a shame, as you find yourself stretching to feel for them.<br/><br/>My hat is off to Liam as Aslan. I thought that he would be awful and not have the voice for it, but after 'seeing' him in action, I am more than happy to eat my words.<br/><br/>Where does this leave us? Do not go to see this expecting the next Lord of the Rings. Go to see this as the simple Narnia novel it is. Outstanding in it's own right.<br/><br/>Am actually hoping that they will continue and make the other 6 novels into equally great films."

The choice for the voice of Aslan was also perfect, It was exactly how I imagined him when I read the books as a child. THANK YOU Disney for bringing my favorite classics to life. To anyone who may still have doubts, it is a must see. We need more stories like this one to watch with our families. I love this movie and could not have envisioned it any better.

"scorrch","10","2","3","16 December 2005"," Magnificent, gentle, just, and valiant
","I have seen The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe twice now and it was even better the second time! I loved it even more the second time because I didn't have to take it all in and have to miss something while doing so.<br/><br/>DO NOT read if you have NOT seen the movie yet.. Be warned, many spoilers!!!<br/><br/>Usually you'd find the performances begin to dull after multiple viewings, but I thought the acting was still great! I often read about other people saying how great Georgie Henley (Lucy) was and stole the show, but I personally thought that Skandar Keynes (Edmund) was the best. I thought Skandar is a really good actor and I think he is even more so now, especially for his age.. And I just thought Georgie was as adorable as ever. Maybe I'm biased because Edmund has been my favorite character, but I really noticed Skandar's more subtle performance the second time. All those times, you could really see Edmund's guilt about all the things he's told the White Witch. After the incident with the White Witch and the fox, those teary eyes of Edmund's were so real.. BIG SPOILER ahead: Oh! and the scene when he's dying... amazing! I really do start to like actors when I like the characters they play... ;)<br/><br/>I think I like this movie even more than Harry Potter. I thought this was more emotional and the kids did a marvelous job at conveying the emotion. Some people say the acting was wooden and worse than Harry Potter, but it didn't seem cheesy to me at all. They were all able to transform from sadness to happiness and vice versa realistically, and their relationship was very believable. I think the actors in Harry Potter are great as well, but I felt basically one emotion in each scene. Well, I don't know.. I just didn't like the scene when Ron begrudged Harry for supposedly putting his name in the Goblet of Fire. I thought that was kind of stiff and unrealistic.. but then I don't know if that's how guys really act like in these kinds of situations.. Other emotional scenes also seemed kind of forced in the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>Of the four children, I think Skandar gave the best, most powerful performance through his subtle transition. Edmund's character is more complex and I believe Skandar played the part wonderfully. Georgie handled her scenes professionally; she was so cute and I felt genuine awe and love from her character. I particularly loved her relationship with Edmund and how Lucy was so quick to forgive. William Moseley (Peter) was great as well and some scenes were emotional, especially at the end of the battle.. Anna Popplewell (Susan) was as I expected and was there at the right moments.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton (the White Witch) was cruel and menacing. I loved her scenes with Edmund and seeing her evil on screen, providing a great obstacle to the four Pevensies. Her combat skills were also quite amazing. James McAvoy (Mr. Tumnus) was also brilliant and perfectly cast.<br/><br/>Aslan was so tangible and Liam Neeson as the voice was perfect! It was not as easy to tell that Aslan is computer generated. Obviously, you can tell since you already know, but it is still immensely realistic nonetheless.<br/><br/>The action was also very entertaining. I loved the battle scene. The visual effects for this part were amazing. I didn't remember much about the battle in the book because there wasn't much, but it fits in the movie and it's great. I also loved other added scenes in the movie like the beginning London Blitz with the evacuation. That really was emotional for me. There were quite a few humorous moments as well. :)<br/><br/>The music was beautiful and the sound effects were great. The silence and heartbeat sound effects really reflect the audience's feelings, and they were very effective. The music has beautiful themes and helps convey the feel of every scene. My heart beat louder at the moments of silence and when the music swells to epic tunes.<br/><br/>You'll enjoy this movie a lot more when you don't have any expectations. I think this can be like a ""Lord of the Rings for kids"" because it isn't as dark, but everyone will still enjoy it. I think Lord of the Rings is more professionally made and well done, but Narnia does not look cheap and it still works out. You can't expect a perfect film to fit to your exact tastes because you will most likely never enjoy many movies if you nitpick about things. Go see this movie without preconceptions and be surprised. I was so excited to see this film when I first saw the trailer and I loved the books. I tried to lower my expectations, but I knew I'd like it anyway. However, I was still surprised by how good it was even though I already knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is still a high-quality film that is emotional, exciting, and enthralling. I recommend this to anyone, and I think everyone would enjoy it. I personally enjoyed this more as a movie than Lord of the Rings only because it is a more comfortable length of time for a movie, and it did not drag on as much. Sometimes Lord of the Rings just felt too long. I think I can watch The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe more often than Lord of the Rings simply because of this. I think I am still a kid at heart too, so Narnia sparked a childhood excitement in me.<br/><br/>Here's to another lovely children's movie that's enjoyable for all ages. I hope we'll get to see six more movies in the near future."

Even my husband, who is the king of cinematic nitpickers, couldn't find a single thing in this movie that he thought should be changed. It's simply gorgeous.<br/><br/>If you have not seen it, there's no way you can appreciate just how magnificent it is. And if you have seen it, there's no way you can properly describe it.<br/><br/>The best way I can think to phrase it is to borrow a line from the movie itself.

"junk-16","6","2","3","11 December 2005"," A complete special effects let down.
","While I definitely would have liked a more mature version of this film than it was, it was Disney and I can let that part go. What I can't let go is how terrible the special effects were done. <br/><br/>#1 Blue/Green Screening This is 2005, there is NO reason for half assed blue screen effects. There were several scenes where the children were standing in front of a pictureeque mountain top view and it was so obvious it was a blue/green screen that it completely ruined any emotion they were trying to get across. <br/><br/>#2 Proportions This is a film which has many characters with differing sizes: Giants, Minitaurs, Centaurs, Dwarfs, etc. It's clearly important that they look proper when they're in the same scene together and not like some cheap photoshop editing. Unfortunately the latter is what you get. There are loads of scenes where I have no idea what they were thinking. I mean, I understand digital animation isn't cheap, but if you're going to rely so heavily on it you should be prepared to do it well (Peter Jackson, LOTR well).<br/><br/>#3 Limitations in digital animation One of the most difficult forms to emulate with digital animation is hair and/or fur. Short or curly is sigificantly easier to render than long (2+ inches), flowy hair. This is because each hair has to be independent of the others and animated in a similar fashion, but not exactly the same. Unfortunately there were several major characters in this film whom were created digitally and had long, flowy hair. The result is they looked poorly animated, digital characters. <br/><br/>It's a shame that Disney, a company who once owned the animation market is no trailing so far behind. I had such high hopes for this film and the ones to follow. Unfortunately, I don't think they'll ever be realized."
"linuxsharkey","8","2","3","11 December 2005"," Brilliant, Just Brilliant
","Over the week before going to the film, I read all seven books again; in random order. Of course after not reading them in about 6 years or so I enjoyed again the biggest masterpiece of Children's literature since Moonfleet.<br/><br/>The film's beginning I found an essential add-on. It really reflected the attitudes of the children and their different personalities. All except I think for Lucy. The beginning of the film made nothing much of her, but as soon as they stepped off the train her talent came to life. I especially loved the attention to detail when she first enters the Wardrobe, speaking of course of the three mothballs that fall out, just a small detail of the book which made me anyway; savour the film all the more.<br/><br/>Of the four children in the film, the one I most enjoyed was Edmund. The was he was acted was just perfect and you could almost believe that he had sprung right out of CS Lewis's masterpiece, so well was he played.<br/><br/>I didn't recognise Liam Neeson's voice. I don't know what he did, but I could not find one trace of the accent he has in all other films I've seen him in. It just disappeared. He was perfect as Aslan, and even though I first thought before I watched the film that he would be one of the worst voices for Aslan, I have to admit I was mistaken, a brilliant performance.<br/><br/>~spoiler~<br/><br/>They cut out two scenes of which I can remember. The point at which the Giant (on Aslan's side) breaks open the gates. I don't know, but I have to say I was slightly disappointed with that cut.<br/><br/>Also of course the part where Jadis turns the Christmas Party into stone. They replaced that as far as I can see with some fox cameo (played by Rupert Everett)...<br/><br/>They also changed the storyline quite a lot. Especially the point at where they are escaping from the Beaver's Dam. The fox (Everett) was also put in which caused quite a change to the storyline. It meant there had to be a chase, when in actual fact, there was none. But I think the fox was inserted for comic reasons, to make up for Lewis's one-liners in the book.<br/><br/>One thing I was especially annoyed about was the fact that Jadis and her servant weren't alone when Edmund was saved, it would have been interesting to see them change into a tree stump and a rock. Of course the other thing is pole Bearers which carried Jadis through the camp when she was to talk to Aslan. If they hadn't been there, then it would have been quite nice to insert the scene from the book where Jadis runs from Aslan after questioning his promise. It just shows that at heart she is really terrified of Aslan.<br/><br/>Amazing film. I hope my criticism doesn't hide that fact. I would nominate it for best film in the Oscars at least. There aren't many films to beat it come out this year. However, Time will tell."

","I'm always skeptical about classic literature being made into movies. Too often there's a sense of disappointment when the end credits roll. Too much left out, too much changed, too much just /not right/ about it.<br/><br/>As I walked out of the theater today after seeing Chronicles of Narnia: Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I felt like I had just finished reading the book all over again.<br/><br/>The four children could not have been better cast. I was annoyed by them in the beginning and loved them by the end -- just as I did in the book. They're going to be highly sought after, should the choose to continue acting. Tilda Swinton could not have played the cold Witch better. Even the tepid Southern winters could not stave the chill down my spine. The c-g characters were alive. I swear they were. Even the wardrobe looked exactly how I imagined it.<br/><br/>Very little had actually been left out of the movie, nothing really changed. I'm having to reevaluate my opinion on books-into-movies. The movie is a bit intense for the youngest children, but then, so was the book. I look forward to the rest of the series.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 (from a very tough audience)"

","This is the movie that I've been waiting for, not the televised played back in the seventies (or eighties) that I had to endure with much disappointment. C.S. Lewis would've definitely been proud of the way Andrew Adamson handled the story, and the visual effects were of course spellbinding to watch. A worthy rival to Lord of the Rings, and I cannot wait for the next six to be completed. Until then, I will just have to read the rest of them, won't I? Great performances by the new-coming performers for Edmund, Lucy, Susan, and Peter, and of course Jim Broadbent. Tilda Swinton was vicious and just chilling (pun intended) as the White Witch, and Liam Neeson was just great as portraying the voice of Aslan. I totally recommend this film, though I think it would be far better if you read the novel(s) first, as I should have."
"MarsHill2001","5","2","3","10 December 2005"," Film not as good as the trailer.
","I have waited the better part of 6 months for.....this. I do want to see all of the books of the series come to the screen. This director, if he can be called that must be banned from doing further harm. The film simply doesn't work. Changes were made that were not needed, parts of the story were cut for the flop of a battle scene at the end. Which by the way was known as the battle of Beruna, though you won't find that out in this film. The Characters were not developed properly, the pace was rushed way too fast. If you had not read the book, I doubt you would have clue one as to what you were watching. Nothing is adequately explained. Nothing is shown with any real sense or purpose. Some parts were quite moving. The scenery and special effects are stunning. But not enough to carry the story. The portrayal of Aslan was indeed powerful. Liam Nielsn did a B+ performance, but I prefer the depth of emotion and deep base resonance that David Suchet gave in the Focus on the Family Radio theater production. It is not a total loss. The 10 minute clip shown on Stars is far better and much more majestically scored than the final full length production.It is not the spectacular epic that I was hoping for either. The buck stops with the director, he is responsible in the end. I sincerely hope that this is the end of his association with The Chronicles of Narnia. Let the epic series continue under fresh leadership. As far as comparison to the Lord of the Rings series and Harry Potter? Potter is just a waste of good film and I will give it no further discussion. Where Narnia is fast, the Lord of the Rings just plods along like an aged boxer who has no punch left and no good sense to quit. They are way too slow paced, very dark and depressing and much too long. I really felt that the entire story could have been told in one or at most two well edited faster paced films. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe could have easily had ten to fifteen minutes of good character development added and a better film would have been the result. Great special effects and a strong musical score may build a nice box office but the story is what makes it a classic, most of that unfortunately; was left behind on the cutting room floor."
"TaZmAnOO7","1","10","28","9 December 2005"," Disappointing Movie. The book was excellent - The movie was terrible.
","I was expecting a lot from this movie, given the hype and the fact that the book is brilliant - The movie however was terrible.<br/><br/>I really felt as though the movie rushed through the story WAY too fast, and never came close to what the book offers. The battles also felt hollow and rushed. I also felt that the story was americanised and toned down for a Disney audience. You didn't get a true feel for Narnia at all in this movie, nor did it build the characters enough. It seems to me to be one of the biggest wasted opportunities in movie making possible. It was hard to believe that someone could ruin such a good book. I really wish Peter Jackson had made this movie. So much was missing in this movie - The movie really felt like a cheap Lord of the Rings wannabe. If you are at all interested in Narnia, please read the book and don't waste your money watching this rubbish."

","This is a such a great movie, especially for kids. It's fun and exciting and draws you into the fantasy. But you don't feel like they're holding back for kids. This really ignited the innocent kid inside of me. Good to see technology catching up to the imaginations of writers so we can see these visions on screen.<br/><br/>And that aside they did such a good job adapting the book it's kinda insane. The mood is perfect and they way they portray Aslan... Even his voice sounds like Lewis is describing Nesson. They didn't change much. Really in the book you don't see the final battle and in this you do because it's a movie and it works better.<br/><br/>I remember when this came out atheist didn't want their kids to see this because of the Christian aspects. I'm technically an atheist, but I don't like to call myself one because I don't like associating myself those people or with any group for that matter. But this isn't going to make your kid Christian. The Adam and Eve reference is brief and in a movie so full of stuff that kids don't know what they're talking about this reference will be included in there. And if you are so atheist that you can't understand the good messages that come out of religion or you don't even want your kid to wonder if there is a God then I don't think this family movie is your biggest problem. I like that they didn't remove this aspect because that's what CS Lewis believed in and we should respect other points of view and artist integrity.<br/><br/>All in all great fun for the kids and the kids in us."

"ConnorMacleodoftheClanMacleod","8","1","1","5 June 2019"," For Narnia!!
","My second Fantasy genre review is that of The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. Fitting considering my first was Lord of the Rings and both Tolkien and Lewis were good friends in real life.<br/><br/>After LOTR arrived it opened up the pathway for all book to film adaptations and with this came, in my personal opinion, the second greatest fantasy book series ever. C.S.Lewis creates Narnia, a world ever on the brink of destruction, in which good vs evil occurs.<br/><br/>Although the second book of the franchise this was the first cinematic introduction we had to the Narniaverse and it started off strong! We join Pevensie family during the height of the Blitz, chaos ensues all around and it is a dark time for Londoners. As a result the children are sent away from London to the countryside, Where they stay with the strange Professor Kirke. During a rainy day Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy play hide and seek, Lucy ends up hiding in... you guessed it, the Wardrobe. She is transported to the world of Narnia and I shall ruin nothing else.<br/><br/>Big screen debuts from James McAvoy and Tilda Swinton, who are phenomenal, compliment this film greatly. Oh top of that the scenery and special effects really draw you into this magical universe. For those that read the books as children it is everything you imagined, from badgers house to the final battle this film does not disappoint. It is a beautiful homage to C.S.Lewis and his writing.<br/><br/>For those looking for a bit of magic and adventure look no further, this film provides it all!"

"areatw","7","1","1","28 October 2018"," Strong and loyal adaptation of the classic adventure novel
","Film adaptations of classic novels often prove controversial and divisive, but I think this is a good example of how a classic fantasy adventure novel can be succesfully turned into a film while retaining everything that made the original book so popular. Taking on a special book series that brings back positive childhood memories for many is always risky and I think this film deserves a lot a credit for largely capturing the magic of the novels.<br/><br/>It's a very well-made film, with impressive CGI and special effects, beautiful visuals and scenery and a great cast, but perhaps the most impressive part of this film is how it remains loyal to the original story. The temptation would have been there to chop and change to make the plot more screen-friendly, but keeping it as close to the original story as possible was definitely a wise choice. As fantasy/adventure films go, this has to be one of my personal favourites."
"cliftonofun","6","1","1","11 February 2018"," Not perfect, but not half bad either
","I somehow did not watch this movie for 15 years, despite having enjoyed these books as a child and as a parent. I'm not totally positive what held me back, but it may have been the sense that even with great CGI (check), some strong performances (check), and faithfulness to the book (check) this would be hard to get totally right. I was mostly right about that. That said, we watched right after re-reading this book with my youngest, and I can say that it mostly worked. It is not LOTR (or anywhere close), but that's not a fair standard - especially for a children's book. The middle sagged, and the embellishments were unnecessary...but it was worth watching."
"colm-hearne365","9","1","1","28 August 2017"," A wonderful adaptation
","I remember seeing this movie over ten years ago in the cinema and even back then I thought it was a great movie. Even though it's not as good as the book (which has always remained a classic in children's literature), I consider this film to be The Lord of the Rings for kids and like the Lord of the Rings, it was filmed in New Zealand as well and some aspects reminded me of the Lord of the Rings trilogy like the effects or the action scenes or the fact that it all took place in a fantasy world. I enjoyed all the actors that played the Pevensie children and I loved Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. I'm very glad that I read the book before I saw the film. I also enjoyed the two other sequels. But I think the Narnia movie trilogy is kind of underrated. While it's nowhere near as good The Lord of the Rings trilogy, they deserve more credit."

Lucy finds Narnia behind the coats inside the wardrobe. Aslan is there. It is the best character of the film. It is a brave, loyal, honest lion that helps the main characters on their adventures.<br/><br/>My favorite part is the final war between the Witch's army and Aslan's army, and I can't say more... :)<br/><br/>It is a very good film for all audience and also the soundtrack is amazing.

"zkonedog","9","1","1","4 March 2017"," Don't Compare It To LOTR (Let It Stand On Its Own)
","When I first saw ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in theaters, I left with a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. The reason? At the time, I couldn't help but comparing it to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series. However, after reading Tolkien's classic novel again and then re-re-watching this movie, I can now see it as a great adaptation that is very true to the source material.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the Pevensie family siblings, who are shipped off into the English countryside to avoid the carnage of WWII. While at the mansion of their eccentric uncle, they find a wardrobe that mysterious leads to another world called Narnia. Little Lucy (Georgia Henley) goes in first and meets a Faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). Then Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stumbles in and meets a much more nefarious personality...the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), self-proclaimed ""Queen of Narnia"". Later on, older siblings Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley) discover Narnia and find themselves in a conflict that they themselves have been deeply prophesized within.<br/><br/>The Narnia books were made for children (but well-written enough for adults to enjoy the experience), and that is exactly what this movie is like. If you try (like I once did) to compare it to LOTR, it will never measure up because you are not comparing like quantities. LOTR is an epic drama, while the Chronicles are a lighter-hearted children's drama. This film really captures that spirit, what with the great special effects, the sibling interplay, and just the general whimsical- ness of the overall production. It's ""played straight"", don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fun involved too.<br/><br/>What might just stand out the most, though, is the acting. Little Georgia as Lucy almost steals the show at some points with her incredible emotional range for such a young child, while Skandar's Edmund is spot-on as the mischievous Edmund (a character who is so important in showing that even in Narnia it can be difficult to tell the good from the bad sometimes). Also, casting Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan, the true ruler of Narnia, was a stroke of genius. Each time the great lion speaks, it will send chills down your spine.<br/><br/>So, even though I didn't fully appreciate this movie when it first came out, I can now see it as a faithful adaptation to its source novel. Both mediums are meant for children and not to be compared to older, more adult fare. I don't know of a child alive who wouldn't be captivated by this movie, and I'm sure that's just the way C.S. Lewis would have wanted it."
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","1","1","6 August 2015"," First rate fantasy adventure
","I never had been able to get into the novel, but I found my self swept up by the movie when it was released (On DVD. I didn't see it at the theater, sadly). Peter Jackson's adaptation of 'Lord Of The Rings' had certainly raised the bar on a genre that had really become rather bargain bin fare, but I felt fellow Kiwi Andrew Adamson's take on C.S. Lewis' beloved (by people other than me) book nearly matched him. And working with inferior (at least in my view) source material to boot.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that after not having watched it for several years, it still holds up. Motley armies massing against each other across a large field and then charging into a CG-aided flurry of sword clashing bombast has become the stuff of eye-rollingly dull cliché these days, but I was engrossed here because I had come to actually care about the characters and the stakes. The latter is typically a forgotten ingredient in the recipe of far too many modern epics and blockbusters.<br/><br/>The young leads are all quite good, and they're supplemented by strong vets like Liam Neeson and particularly the always amazing Tilda Swinton.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this first Narnia film may occupy a step below Jackson's 'Lord Of The Rings', but it absolutely crushes his muddled take on 'The Hobbit', and most other fantasy and young adult genre fare that's been released in such great numbers since."
"ibelauram","10","1","1","26 July 2015"," Amazing job!
","I think that the entire story was very creative and imaginative. I loved it all! The actors did a fantastic job on playing their roles as they also did in the following movies. I do wish that they would have made more movies though, perhaps a series with younger characters to fill in the roles of the four children since they are much older now. I've seen all three movies about a dozen times and I would definitely give them a ten out of ten for excellent work and and amazing job on the scenery! I know that these movies were over 5 years ago and I'm just now writing this review, but to those who haven't seen it yet should definitely watch it especially if you're into fantasy, family, and adventure movies!"
"msloane1","8","1","1","5 January 2015"," The Wonder of Narnia
","Let me say right up front that I am an atheist and a secularist and such do not care about any religious allegory or undertones this movie may possess. I am reviewing it from the point of view of the book to movie transition and how good it is as a fantasy film.<br/><br/>The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a fantastic fantasy film. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe has an awesome feel of magic and wonder to it. This movie is reasonably faithful to the book and even makes some improvements on it. I really appreciated that the filmmakers actually showed the kids being evacuated from the wartime air raids. In the book this is mentioned once in passing at the start of the first paragraph. But in the book I never got the sense of children who had been truly affected by the war. The movie, by actually showing the evacuations and making them a decent length scene, and by showing some of the kids emotions in the midst and aftermath of this scene, better capture the fact that the kids are sent away during wartime and how this has affected them emotionally. After that the movie pretty much follows the book and is generally quite faithful to it with one exception. The Deeper Magic From Before the Dawn of Time is eliminated and replaced by Aslan having a ""different interpretation"" of the Deep Magic From the Dawn of Time. This eliminates a major plot point and alters another. This is not a good thing. Everything else is mostly as you'd expect. The visual work on this movie is fantastic. The outstanding visual work both help capture the sense of wonder and magic of Narnia and make the story feel more realistic. My personal favorite scene was when Lucy first entered Narnia through the Wardrobe. The pure joy and wonder of discovering Narnia is a beautiful thing to behold. And it feels so genuine. The filmmakers had Georgie enter the set of the wintry Narnia blindfolded so that her very first reaction to seeing the set could be used in the film as an authentic first reaction. What a brilliant move! The CGI animals, especially Aslan, look pretty realistic to me. Now the casting and acting were fairly good. Goergie was a PERFECT Lucy and Liam Neeson was an outstanding choice for the voice of Aslan. William Mosley just fit right into the role of Peter. An underrated role is Jim Broadbent's portrayal of Professor Kirke. The only weakness here is that the character of Edmund seems a bit forced and phony but overall the casting and acting are good. The pacing is a bit slow in the first half hour or so but picks up when the children have all gotten into Narnia and is pretty good from there on. To address a common complaint, a number of people have complained about the ""bloodless"" battle. First of all, remember that this is fantasy. More importantly, it should be noted that the filmmakers were contractually required by the studio to attain a rating of no higher than PG. Thus, we wind up with battle scenes that are violent and intense but not bloody or gory. Now, this movie should not be viewed by toddlers, preschoolers, or kindergarteners due to intense and intensely sad scenes, especially the evacuation scene, the Aslan sacrifice plot, and the epic final battle. This movie is okay for kids in grades 3 and up. For kids in grades 1-2 it depends on the individual. I don't think this movie is as good as the Harry Potter series or the Middle Earth trilogies but it is a worthy part of the fantasy genre and is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Casting/acting: 8 out of 10. Special effects/visuals: 9 out of 10. Pacing: 7 out of 10. Overall: 8 out of 10."
"orourkec-292-269155","7","1","1","27 December 2014"," Not very good but it nevertheless doesn't stop the movie from pleasing.
","I watched this Narnia movie and even though it isn't a very good film and is kinda simple-minded overall, I enjoyed watching it nevertheless. I think that it is a movie that moviegoers of any age can enjoy, even if not in a 'very' sense. I was pleased with the film because I thought it was well paced, well filmed and that storytelling was crazy fun. Not only that but other pleasing things as well are the movie's humor, the comical touch to it, the innocent wonder and the main characters' play on words. The voice of Liam Neeson as the lion Aslan is compelling and worth a WAOUW exclamation. The voice fits the lion character perfectly. Lucy and Edmund are also compelling children characters and extremely believable. I even liked the evil White Witch whom I thought was a fabulous villain - just by her looks and calm presence you can instantly feel uneasy and feel hatred too. Well done on that, really. Oh, and last but not least is the direct visual imagery switch which I found really good and groundbreaking. Now, I'm going to say something else which I think the movie should have improved upon: I think that the wonderfully CGI designed Aslan lacks an outside character feel, which means that he should have been made into a character from or for (do you say for or from for that sentence?) whom you can feel respect and/or fear in all of his scenes in a powerfully irresistible way. That I think would have made him a better character. My rating: 7.0/10"
"oscar-stainton","8","1","1","29 June 2014"," Excellent adaptation and heartfelt tale
","Sometimes certain films can leave a big impact on first arrival, but don't have the staying power to remain in public conscious. Despite a lot of comparisons to 'Lord of the Rings' (often unfavourable ones), I believe 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' is probably one of the best films to recommend to a young person starting out in live action fantasy films, and can stay as an exemplary adaptation of C.S. Lewis' first part of The Chronicles of Narnia.<br/><br/>During the London Blitz of WWII, four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, are evacuated to stay in a professor's house in the countryside. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a wardrobe that leads to the frozen land of Narnia, and befriends the benevolent faun Mr. Tumnus. She learns that Narnia is ruled by an evil sorceress known as the White Witch, who has made the land ""always winter but never Christmas"", ruling with an iron fist. Her siblings don't believe her at first, but soon they enter into Narnia with her and become caught in a brewing war between the White Witch and the noble lion Aslan, and must save their brother Edmund and all of Narnia from the White Witch.<br/><br/>The performances from the young actors are all solid; Skandar Keynes manages to portray Edmund as a misguided boy and not wholly malevolent as both sullen and sympathetic, William Mosely and Anna Popplewell provide warm and earnest performances and work well off their siblings, but young Georgie Henley simply glows as the innocent and sweet natured Lucy with boundless emotion and charm and my personal favourite among the Pevensies. Thanks to the added backdrop of WWII, I believe they feel more realized as characters, and it parallels the Narnian war they find themselves in.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton encapsulates the cold cruelty and commanding presence of the White Witch; her inhumanity and seductive ways can be pretty creepy. James McAvoy brings Mr Tumnus to live right off the pages and I can find no fault in his portrayal. I especially love his interactions with Lucy, bringing a truly innocent friendship to life. James Cosmo even cameos as Father Christmas! In terms of voice acting, Ray Winstone and Dawn French turn in humorous and likable beavers, Rupert Everett has a fun cameo as a fox, and Aslan's warmth and wisdom is conveyed by Liam Neeson's excellent voice work.<br/><br/>By today's standards many argue that the CGI is rather dated and in some instances not well rendered, but it is still reliable in telling the story rather than showing off special effects for their own sake. Thankfully Aslan is consistently emotive, well rendered and animated to the point where you can easily buy into the movie illusion. The digital artistry, New Zealand locations and physical sets blend together to create a lot of beautiful visuals from the lamppost in the wintry forest to the epic battle between Aslan's army and the White Witch. Considering Andrew Adamson's earlier involvement in the first two Shrek films, this was a rather smooth transition from animation to live action film, but not a perfect one. For me at least, there's something incredible about seeing so many fantastical creatures like centaurs, fauns, satyrs, minotaurs and dwarfs amidst griffons, werewolves, lions, leopards, unicorns and other creatures come together to fight for a land of pure fantasy. The accompanying music of Harry Gregson-Williams is gorgeous, with lilting, gentle melodies and uplifting choruses for the many awe inspiring scenes, and it really compliments the film.<br/><br/>While LOTR was a war epic with a serious tone, the final battle feels more like an act of hope, in which Aslan would still be with them in spirit, which fits perfectly with Lewis' allegory of faith. The religious subtext is present but it's not forced, in fact it's rather subtle when compared to the book and anybody may be able enjoy the film without feeling bludgeoned by the religious symbolism. I feel that because of the simplicity of the story and characters, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' feels less engaging and very slight compared to Game of Thrones or LOTR, which is why it skews best towards a younger audience. The focus is largely on the sense of wonder and discovery of Narnia as opposed to the war, unlike LOTR, which I never believed the filmmakers were trying to directly imitate. Ultimately 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is an inspiring and heartfelt film that manages to capture the spirit of Lewis and brings a grand fantasy world to life."
"ruby-wells764","10","1","1","17 January 2014"," Absolutely fantastic - In my opinion, better than the books...
","I have seen this film more times than I can count, and haven't once gotten bored of it! What impresses me every time is the perfection of the child cast - they are fantastic young actors and actresses, and I particularly enjoy Skandar Keynes' performance as Edmund. In fact, pretty much everything in this production is close to perfection - the sets, the costumes, the script - everything comes together to make a beautiful film. The continued brilliance of this film is that it is perfect for all the family - you will never be too old to enter the magic of Narnia... I did read the books as a child, and although they were fantastic, I feel that I just 'clicked' more with the film adaption of this timeless tale, perhaps because of the more 'epic' feel to it when C S Lewis' beautiful story is up on the big screen. I do also feel that the film narrative is quite close to the book - always a positive thing!<br/><br/>Don't miss this incredible film - it will be a very valuable asset to your film collection!"

Watching on DVD at home I really loved it! The things that i disliked about the cinema release seemed to have changed... possibly they fixed a few things for home release? The battle scene seemed much longer and not as tame this time (a good thing!) and Aslan seemed bigger than I recall from the cinema. Few movies ever do the books justice, and C.S. Lewis's writing could never be matched, but this movie does do a very good job in bringing it to life. A great film that's quite moving and beautiful at times."
"angel-blair","8","1","1","30 March 2012"," Magical and Amazing
","I thought that ""Chronicles of Narnia"" the movie represented the book well, including many of the important nuances. The entire effect of the film, however, will be to render even to the most faithful reader a better, more complete understanding of the book. Just great....kids should see it, young adults, and the old folks, too! For those who have read the entire Chronicles, something that really matters is how well the movie provides insight into the characters of the four children. The real mystery child is Susan, and viewers should pay special attention to her actions and reactions. Viewers should also note the time slippage between Narnia and England, for that is key to understanding the other books.<br/><br/>There are two ways to read the Chronicles...in the order they were written or in order of events in Narnia, as they are usually arranged now. If you are intrigued by Narnia after the film, the Magician's Nephew, the first volume in the beginning of Narnia to end of Narnia sequencing of the books, will answer some key questions---like why that Lamppost is there?...And where did the wardrobe come from?...And why Professor Kirke is likely to believe the children? My bet is that there is going to be a whole lot of reading of all seven volumes of the Chronicles in the next year....The 50th Anniversary edition with colored versions of the original Paula Baynes illustrations is worth its weight in gold.<br/><br/>See the movie, read Lion Witch Wardrobe, and then reading the other six. Unlike Lord of the Rings, most of the loose ends are tied by the end of the read. If Hollywood undertakes to produce the other six books, there are some great motion pictures ahead, but they are going to need special effects that go way beyond this first picture, for the full magic of Narnia is only hinted at in LWW. You simply don't stop reading once you start because the magic just gets better and better."

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","1","5 February 2012"," Finally, C.S. Lewis' classic has come to the big screen
","It can be difficult to write a review on both the book and the movie in the same day. I read the book recently, but I am unlikely to pick it up anytime soon despite it being quite a good book, so when I watched the movie again last night I decided that as well as doing a review of the movie I would also review the book as well. The catch is that I am likely to go over a lot of the things that I have already gone over in the book, and I am not the type of reviewer that looks at a films technical aspects but rather at its content.<br/><br/>I would probably suggest that this falls into the same content as what one would expect from a Hollywood movie. It has heroes and villains, and there is a movement to the climax where the heroes defeat the villain, save the world, and become kings and queens. However it is not so much the film but the underlying book upon which this film is based that I believe is important for considering the content. However, I would suggest that while it does not strictly follow the book (for that will be difficult in the best of cases) I do feel that it does faithfully stick to the themes that are present.<br/><br/>This movie is basically allegory, though it is also a children's film, and the use of allegory can be difficult when we are looking at children. However, Lewis' original work was allegorical, and it was also targeted at children, though the theme of the book is really about redemption. This is the type of film that I would definitely show children, but I would also like to discuss the themes of the film afterwards, particularly the theme of redemption.<br/><br/>There are two important elements to this film, that is redemption, and hope. The idea of redemption focuses entirely on the character of Edmund. To put it simply he not only betrays his siblings, but in doing so he betrays Narnia, Aslan, and of course himself, and it is all over lust for Turkish delight (which is allegorical for pleasure). The White Witch is an allegory of Satan, in that she holds Narnia in her grip and drains all that is good and pleasant from the land (as is represented by the enternal winter). When she first appears she treats Edmund as if he was important, and showers him with gifts, but upon taking the gift, he comes within her power, and it is only through the sacrifice of an innocent (being Aslan) that rescues Edmund from her grip.<br/><br/>The idea of hope is also present, and that is represented by the appearance of Father Christmas halfway through the film. While the film does not paint him as Father Christmas, it does become noticeable that this is what this character is supposed to be. Christmas falls on the Winter Solstice, meaning that it is the shortest day of the year, and also heart of winter, when everything is at its bleakest. However what Christmas tells us is that the worst is over, and we now have Spring to look forward too. In the film that is demonstrated by the snow melting and green shoots appearing. It is allegorical of Christ's first appearance in that it is said he came at the deepest and darkest point of human history. The Republic had collapsed to be replaced by the Roman Imperium, and everybody was under the yoke of the emperor. While things did get worse, what Christ's appearance heralded was the arrival of hope, hope that there is more to the pain and suffering in the world, and that there is a God who loves us, cares for us, and wants an intimate relationship with us."

","This is my review of the Chronicals of Narnia. These kids moved to some posh house and didn't like it. The youngest fell into a wardrobe, fought with some coats and crashed through the back of the wardrobe into someone else's garden. She wandered about a bit, met some strange man then went back home. Then they all did the same, landing in the garden. Then a lion came along and gave them swords. They had a fight with some foxes and stuff then the Lion died. Then the lion came back alive and they went home through the wardrobe. I think the Lion stayed alive.<br/><br/>I liked this film"
"byrann_gowan","8","1","1","19 November 2011"," One of my favourite movies of all time from one of my favourite books of all time
","I will start off by saying that, while this is a very good movie, I do think that the next two are unfairly criticized for not following the source material as this one did. Now, I haven't seen ""Dawn Treader"" yet, but I should remind people that ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" is, in my opinion, the most famous Narnia tale of all the Narnia movies. For this reason, I think that the people behind the scenes had a bit more freedom with the second and third movies, while this one, they had to have it really close to the book in order for it to work the way it did. Don't get me wrong; it is good to follow the books. I'm just saying that ""Prince Caspian"" and ""Dawn Treader"" are not as famous as TLTWATW.<br/><br/>Now, onto this movie.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised that this only got a 6.9. This deserves a way higher rating. I won't go into too much details about the story, but for those who don't know, it's basically about 4 children who end up stumbling into a magical land via wardrobe, and find out about a prophecy that includes them in a huge way.<br/><br/>I can't emphasize how much I love this movie. I'm 18 years old, and as a Christian person, I instantly fell in love with this back when it came out in theatres. I wasn't worried about whether or not it would follow the book, and I'm glad I wasn't worried. This film delivers.<br/><br/>You could say that the special effects are amazing, but what really steals the show are the performances. Let's start out with the stars of the film: the four Pevensies. William Mosely definitely is the weakest, and is really the only reason why I gave it a 9 out of 10, but he is good. Anna Popplewell has that motherly look that you feel when she is on screen, which makes her perfect for Susan. Skandar Keynes is great as the mean little brat known as Edmund, who learns a ""little"" lesson as the film goes on. But, Georgie Henley is the star that shines the most. It is through her character that we see Narnia first, and when she's on screen, she gives the child-like energy to her performance that is needed for the character of Lucy.<br/><br/>Now, it's not all new faces here. The first movie star that we see is James McAvoy as the faun Tumnus, and he gives off a performance that will make children love Mr. Tumnus just as much as he seems to love them (as seen in his interaction with Lucy). Tilda Swinton gets the most screen time out of the heavyweights here, and she is chilling (no pun intended) in her performance as the White Witch. Fans of the Shrek series will recognize Rupert Everett's (aka Prince Charming) voice as the fox who appears throughout the movie. But, the most recognizable actor here is the voice of Liam Neeson as Aslan. I could listen to that man read a telephone book with that voice. He is among Morgan Freeman and James Earl Jones as to having a soothing voice, and he proves it with his performance of Aslan.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that should not be missed; it will please you whether you are old or young. The special effects are completely first class, the story is gripping and stays true to the book, and the actors all do their jobs well. A 9/10 for me."
"p-braham","3","1","1","5 January 2010"," unconvincing and badly acted
","Loved the books, I have to say. But this film, right from the beginning, fails to convince. It's impossible to be carried along with it; everything is too unlikely and the child actors are, unfortunately, terrible. The director lets them down horribly - it should at least be possible to relate to their characters, but they are allowed to behave in the most preposterous ways. Only the most credulous would be able to settle down and watch this film. The rest of us, after 5 minutes, are wishing we're somewhere else. <br/><br/>That just about says all you need to know.<br/><br/>The rest of this review is padding to make up the requisite ten lines - I suggest you read no further.<br/><br/>There is no god. Christian allegories are best forgotten as an embarrassing part of the human race's history."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","1","1","23 November 2009"," It isn't as good as L.O.T.R., but is still a good movie.
","Shrek director Andrew Adamson makes his big screen version of a classic novel. Perhaps I am a little too late reviewing this movie. Because it came out four years ago. But here I am now, reviewing it because I never have before. <br/><br/>In this decade, there has been quite a few fantasy films. We've had Lord of the rings, Harry Potter, The Golden compass, Spiderwick, Twilight. I could go on forever. But I left out one film series. Probably the oldest one of them all. The Chonicles of Narnia:The lion, the witch and the wardrobe(try saying that ten times fast), the first of C.S. Lewis' novels. <br/><br/>There are only two films as of right now. I think that the original is best, as what I thought on the books. Only cause I read the first one. I'll admit that the Narnia films aren't as good as Lord of the rings, but i'll admit that they go more for the family audience, which I kind of appreciate. A lot of children's films recently have sucked. Besides Up and Where the wild things are. Both have made my favorites of the year list.<br/><br/>The Narnia films have something special. They have a happy mood throughout a lot of them. The Lord of the rings, though better, has a darker creepy mood. Same goes for Mr. Potter, The Golden compass and others. The Narnia films have some disturbing things, just look at Tilda Swinton as the White witch. Ew.<br/><br/>The films revolves around The Pevinseive children, Susan, Peter, Edmund, and Lucy. When they are sent off to live somewhere else during the war, Lucy, the youngest, discovers a passage way to another land,m called Narnia, through a wardrobe. Where she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus(James Mcavoy). Edmund also discovers Narnia, but screws everyone over when he meets The White witch (played very well by Tilda Swinton)and says that he can bring his brother and sisters for some treats. What a deal.<br/><br/>So, the four children enter Narnia, where they meet a few Beavers(one voiced by Ray Winstone). Soon, once they learn of their brother's betrayal, Susan, Peter, and Lucy and the beavers set off to find their brother and save him.Also, they must fight in a war for Narnia with the king, Aslan(voiced by Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>As I said before, these films aren't as good as Lord of the rings or Harry Potter. But I like what they aim for. They don't want to scare children, though they may do it occasionally. I like the Narnia films, and I hope to see more of them in the future."

","My husband and I have loved C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories since we were children. Shortly after we became engaged, he took me to Wheaton College so that I could see the Wardrobe. I had to suppress my joy, but when when I got to open it, the path to Narnia was blocked.<br/><br/>After more years than I care to admit, I finally managed to find my way to that a place more comforting than Oz or Wonderland by watching this film. I screamed at Edmund when he placed his trust in the evil Snow Queen because she made him Turkish Delight (something I've never liked, but I tolerate those who do). I was proud of Peter, Susan and Lucy as they braved things that I would have never been able to do by myself. <br/><br/>And, then, there's Aslan. He was the giant symbol of great heart, power and love that lions are often equated with. His joy in life and the deep magic which protects everyone alive lies in every movement and that beautiful voice (Liam Neeeson). I'd seen many of the other mythic creatures before with Harry Potter, but here, even these wanting no contact with humans all became heroes fighting for what they believed in, including four children from another place and time.<br/><br/>Lewis'series reflects the horror that England went through during World War II and the trouble it endured afterward. It's also true that they contain more than the usual amount of Christian symbolism something that some people of other religions might not care for. No matter that, because the beauty and love the movie creates can be felt by any person of every background. It is one of those things that can unify people from all over the world.<br/><br/>When I am full of doubt that the Universe will turn out right, I pull out my copy, watch it, and my doubt starts to go away.

","Four bloodless, pasty-white British kids on an adventure in a magical wardrobe.<br/><br/>Set during WWII, young teen and pasty Brit, Peter Pevensie (William Moseley) and his younger, pastier siblings, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, discover a wormhole in a wardrobe, leading to a land of eternal winter and constant special effects called Narnia. <br/><br/>Two factions battle in this land (where every animal speaks English and is either CGI, or a human in heavy makeup): ""good"" animals pander to Aslan the Christ-y Lion (voice of Liam Neeson, who does more acting as this lion's pixels than in all his screen time on PHANTOM MENACE), and ""bad"" animals aid the White Witch (Tilda Swinton, badly in need of a boyfriend or a vibrator).<br/><br/>The pasty Brit kids join Aslan, except for Edmund (Skandar Keynes), who is tempted to the side of the White Witch with Turkish Delight. (If there was any more evidence needed as to how infrequently these pasty kids get out in the sun or get out of the house at all, I think that Turkish Delight scam should tell you all you need to know.) <br/><br/>Also starring James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus the Faun, James Cosmo as Father Christmas, Rupert Everett as a Fox, Jim Broadbent as Professor Kirke, and Ray Winstone as The Beaver (yes, I meant it to sound like that).<br/><br/>There are spectacular sights in CHRONICLES - centaurs and moving statues and mythical muscled beasts - which will no doubt entice the kids, but the messages of good versus evil come across loud and unclear. Just like a Disney movie on steroids, the contradictions and all the insufferable prophesy just make us feel stupid and dirty and insulted.<br/><br/>For example, Edmund constantly betrays his siblings, yet is brought back into the fold after Aslan gives him a stern talk. We don't hear the conversation, but we'd like it to go something like, ""You do this again and I will rip your limbs from your torso and make you watch me bitchslap you with your own limp wrist!"" but we know it would be closer to, ""That was very bad, Edmund!"" No lessons learned in earning absolution, or even getting the snot kicked out of you as retribution for being an utter Benedict Arnold.<br/><br/>It is no secret that author C.S. Lewis was an indoctrinated insane person, i.e. someone who believed fervently in Christianity. So no surprise when Aslan gets all allegorical and sacrifices his life for the sins of others - and is resurrected. How very Jesus of him. And then there's Santa Claus - the OTHER Jesus.<br/><br/>Father Christmas (called ""Christmas"" even though Christ never visited Narnia) bequeaths the Brit kids weapons, even though his credo is ""War is an ugly affair."" Thanks, Santa - leave the hardware and sod off! When Christmas hands an archery set to Susan (Anna Popplewell), and she asks, ""What happened to 'War is an ugly affair'? he just chuckles and changes the subject! Piling stupidity on stupidity, these ""magic"" weapons supposedly ""work every time,"" so why does Susan bother ""getting in some practice"" with them? And if they are NOT magic, getting in ten minutes of practice is not going to save your pasty British arse.<br/><br/>But we find that standards are pretty low out here in Narnia - all it takes for Peter to be knighted by Aslan is for a wolf to jump at him and for his sword to be in the way. Suddenly he's ""Sir Peter Wolfsbane."" Now... if the weapons are magical, then what credit should Peter take for the sword killing a wolf? These kids don't earn one whit of their ""battle"" experience, yet they are lauded throughout the story as prophesied saviors of Narnia.<br/><br/>How come, in any prophesy-heavy fiction (REVENGE OF THE SITH, LORD OF THE RINGS, The King James Bible), no one ever admits to a prophesy being unfulfilled, thereby proving what a load of bunkum it is? <br/><br/>The fact that the White Witch's wolves speak the King's English makes them less scary. It means they can be reasoned with. That doesn't seem to stop the kids doing one stupid thing after another: in an effort to stop an ice floe from melting, Peter stabs his sword into the ice to use as a handhold - but wouldn't stabbing the ice make it split exactly where he stabbed it? Instead, they all hold onto this lever and ride the rapids away from the wolves.<br/><br/>When they exit the freezing river, Peter, who was holding onto little Lucy by her jacket, now only holds her jacket and has lost Lucy. Susan looks at Peter and cries out, ""What have you done?!"" as if he meant to lose her on purpose. While I'm busy looking at Susan, all wet and cold, looking pretty damn hot - in a stuck-up, Catholic School kinda way.<br/><br/>Silliness continues to the end of the movie, director Andrew Adamson hoping he can sweep it under the banner of ""kid's movie"" and throwing action battle at us like beaver at a strip club. But like Disney's debacles, the treacle runs so thick it will choke children on unreality before they can enter the real world, wholly unprepared to be choked by its reality.<br/><br/>Like LEAVE IT TO BEAVER with better special effects.

As much as i love the BBC version, it's to long and after a while it gets boring but this version is a dead on 2 hours approximately and features some really great effects and costumes.<br/><br/>The only reason i never gave this film a 9 and not a 10 was because most of the effects and animal characters were computer animated which works really well but its still nice to see live action acting.<br/><br/>I think that this will be bigger than all it's future sequels because this is the story people know best and it's not too long, not over acted and has some amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Normally the White Witch has too many lines in other versions and she over acts but Tilda Swinton kept relaxed and managed to pull a really mean witch.<br/><br/>Overall a very good version of C.S.Lewis' most popular book."
"ShootingShark","6","1","1","2 January 2009"," Well-Made And Enjoyable But Slightly Disappointing Adaptation Of Fantastical Children's Classic
","The Pevensie children - Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan - are evacuated from London during the Blitz to a rambling country house. There they discover a magical wardrobe which leads into a mystical land called Narnia, where it seems they are destined to free the inhabitants from the tyranny of a cruel witch <br/><br/>This is the first theatrical filming of C.S. Lewis' classic fairy-tale, and is the faithful, big-budget, spectacular imagining it deserves, as Narnia with all its talking beasts and myths and legends are brought vividly to life. It captures the essence of the story well, as the children stumble into the adventure and shudder with anxiety and disbelief as they learn that they are monarchs in waiting, expected to do bloody battle to save the kingdom. It also doesn't water down all their faults; Lucy is sweet, but Edmund is greedy, petty and jealous, Peter is pompous and stiff, and Susan is just a bit boring. Henley and Keynes are both very good as the younger children, Neeson is an inspired choice for the voice of Aslan and McAvoy is terrific as the faun Mr Tumnus. Swinton is odd as the Witch; her blank, imperious looks are ideally suited and she is suitably nasty, but she never quite dominates the proceedings as she should. I guess this isn't my favourite fable - it's well written and imaginative, and I like the religious allegories, but I tend to agree with the criticism of Lewis' writing as too conservative and morally superior, which is reflected in the film. It does have a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams however, and was shot in a myriad of differing locations - the Czech Republic, Poland, New Zealand, Los Angeles, Shropshire and London. All in all then a mixed bag; a spectacular but not entirely successful adaptation of a terrific yet flawed children's classic. It's a treat to watch, but not nearly a match for Peter Jackson's J.R.R. Tolkien films or the Harry Potter movies in my view. A word on chronology; this was the first of the seven Narnia books (written in 1950), but the events of the prequel, The Magician's Nephew, take place before it. This movie has since been followed by a film of Prince Caspian, which is the fourth book chronologically, but was the second to be published. Confused ? The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe was first filmed as a British TV serial in 1967, then as an animated TV-movie in 1979, and then again as a BBC serial in 1988."

","It is true that my relationship with the Narnia universe is rather haphazard since I have read half the book on which this movie is based, i have watched Prince Caspian and afterwards I saw this movie which was judged correctly as a suitable one for Christmas.<br/><br/>This movie along with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have done the most to popularize elements of the mythology of Northern European peoples as well as public school British culture than anything else. One could argue that they are powerful tools of creating a certain image of the western middle ages in the popular mind.<br/><br/>But of course these ideological aspects should not bar someone from enjoying the sheer artistry of the movie both on account of the acting as well as the special effects and costumes. It was a feast for the eye for those that enjoy watching wonderful and terrible creatures.<br/><br/>Sometimes the Christian overtones of the book were said to be underplayed, at least this is what I had read in critiques in magazines.It was a choice of the company for commercial reasons. As far as I was concerned at least in the case of the resurrection they could never have been more obvious:the presentation of the altar and the fact that women learn the happy news first.<br/><br/>The device of talking animals goes back to Aesop as well as Lafontaine for those with more westernized sensibilities and it was aptly used in this movie.<br/><br/>The schoolchildren destined to fulfill a prophecy is the main convergence with Harry Potter, the magical pseudo-medieval universe with Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Both boys and girls radiate charm and intelligence, as well as the trio of schoolchildren in Harry Potter movies and I confess that as a foreigner I developed a certain feeling of inferiority towards Anglo-Saxon schoolchildren. The Hobbits of Tolkien are I think rather more humble in demeanor therefore perhaps acquiring a vaster possible audience as role models.<br/><br/>The evil witch is typically a fairy tale personage, even more so when she appears good to further her purposes. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie especially for Christmas time."

","The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a story about four children and their adventure to save a mythical world called Narnia. This world is accessible by a magic wardrobe in their guardian's mansion. The youngest of the four children named Lucy wanders into the wardrobe while playing a game with her other siblings. In order to not be found she scampers into a nearby empty room with a wardrobe in it. She climbs in and realizes that she is pushing on a tree and then immediately after she falls into snow. She, who has never been in a place like that, was in pure awe. The starts right after she discovers this magnificent world.<br/><br/>In my opinion the story was good. Also the story was very exciting at a lot of points during the story. I think that the book and the movie were quite similar. In the movie the dialogue seemed more up to date and it showed more things that would make you understand. The movie, on the downside left out some minor situations that the book did not. I'm not a big reader so I thought the movie better suited me, but if you're a big reader the book would be a better choice. There is more in the book apposed to the movie, also in the book things are better explained. I thought altogether that the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was an all around good book and movie."

While hiding in the wardrobe, Lucy stumbles upon a magical land called Narnia, where she meets a Faun called Tumnus. When the false ruler of Narnia, the White Witch, finds out about Tumnus' meeting with Lucy, she takes him prisoner in her castle. Lucy returns to Narnia with her sister and two brothers and they find themselves racing against time to save Mr. Tumnus and free Narnia from the tyranny of the White Witch.<br/><br/>Having read the book and watched the movie, I can say that the movie definitely elaborated more on the battle scenes, which was fantastic because they were somewhat hard to follow and grasp in the book. I also liked that the rivalry between Peter and Edmund was played up a little more in the movie than it was in the book. It helped you get into Edmund's head and really understand why he felt so unappreciated. I think this movie really stuck to the main plot of the book, and, even though it missed a few parts that helped the audience understand the White Witch and some of her motives, I definitely recommend that people read this book and watch the movie."
"fearfulofspiders","7","1","1","8 September 2008"," Nicely Done...
","Face it, after the immense success of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Harry Potter films, it was bound to happen one day when a studio was going to unleash a big-budget adaptation of C.S. Lewis's novels of The Chronicles of Narnia. While not nearly coming close to the epic scale or emotional level that The Lord of the Rings gave its audiences, it is far more magical than the Harry Potter films, and needless to say it is more faithful to the source material than any of Potter's strongest installments. It is a nicely done fantasy for younger kids.<br/><br/>While beautifully shot, to call this an epic is too much credit. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is quite slow in pace, and the scale of the film is too small. It's great for kids, but slightly flawed.<br/><br/>The acting is well done. Everyone is great in their roles, and Tilda Swinton plays the witch so well, we hate her like a living person. It's a lovely cast, that all fit in their roles well.<br/><br/>The special effects are about as good as the work done in The Prisoner of Azkaban. It's okay, though there's points when a little fine-tuning could've resulted in a better execution. The battle at the end of the movie has soaring points, yet the ogres, centaurs, wolves and polar bears all seem lackluster.<br/><br/>Harry Gregson-Williams' score is very disappointing. The guy didn't even do his homework when composing this very drowse-inducing music, not listening to what the music sounded like for The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, and as a result, it sounds nearly the same if the two were combined. Very unoriginal, and the sheer lack of intelligence in the composer has made him one that I will try hard to avoid in the years to come.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film, as aforementioned, is slightly dull. The only rousing moments are the wolves chasing the kids on the icy river, and the final battle between the Narnians and the White Witch's army. The action is nicely choreographed, however, I highly doubt that kids of that age are capable of killing or fighting in battles. Very unrealistic, even for a fantasy. What would've made it more believable, would be if the screenplay writers incorporated some sort of motive, or something endearing that could be lost as a consequence to failure, I mean, even if it's Narnia, the kid's only real connection to anyone are the Beavers and Mr. Tumnus... who I'm sure they could live without in the long run. The lack of screen time and character development allows for fast relationships with Aslan and many of the characters, it's just not likely to fight for someone you've only known for two days. Horton Hears a Who has a stronger message and executed better.<br/><br/>All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is definitely one of the better films of 2005, after a lackluster summer. I recommend it to kids 12 and under, as older ones will find more interest in The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films."

Great effects 2. Great production, places, costumes, everything wonderful. Now the bad things.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie itself is slow, too slow indeed. There are times when you want to forward it because you get bored. For example, the part where Aslan ""dies"" Oh my God I almost fell asleep in that part, the girls cried like for 15 minutes. You can see they made a real effort making it long. Second of all, bad actors. Please, this kids just don't know how to act. The Lucy girl would make a great job as a teddy bear. And maybe Peter could be a model, but not an actor. Third of all, wrong expectations. The trailer and all the propaganda, made the movie look something like the lord of the rings, an epic movie, but it was just a show. If you are going to make a kids movie, then just say it. Last of all. I don't know what you think about the book, but I just hate the idea of C.S. Lewis to make this lion who always solves everything. He just needs to blink and voilà! everything is O.K again. A little bit of drama wouldn't go wrong.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This is a great movie for kids from 7 to 10 years old, but if you want to see some kind of Celtics wars, go for the Lord of the Rings."

In fact, it's even better than any of the Harry Potter movies I've seen (another book to cinema series of tales).<br/><br/>Set during World War II in England, at the time of the German air-raids, it's the tale of the Pevensie family. The children are sent to the countryside to avoid the worst of the blitz. The children comprise the elder role-models Peter and Susan, along with their younger brother and sister Edmund and Lucy. I must say that Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie is absolutely adorable. Don't let that description put you off...these are English characters, not those highly annoying 'cute' kids American popular culture likes to foist on us.<br/><br/>In this movie's favour is the humour...I was often amused by exchanges between the characters-like when Lucy first meets Mr. Tumnus.<br/><br/>Anyway, from the grim opening of this movie, it eventually explores the fantastic alternative universe that is Narnia...a land of mythical creatures, both good and evil. On that level, this movie is a great adventure with great spectacle and terrific CGI effects (computer generated special effects-of places and creatures).<br/><br/>Not exactly sure what age group this movie is pitched at, but I think it is a PG movie...perhaps a bit to dark for very young children-it does get into 'heavy' topics at times, which very young children might get upset by.<br/><br/>Another big plus for this movie is the complex depictions of the characters. The eldest children are sensible. Lucy is good and Edmund has a more interesting trajectory to follow. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is brilliant-one of those 'complex' characters I mentioned earlier. She also happens to be more menacing than Darth Maul!<br/><br/>One very small gripe-a little annoyed at one of the mythical characters that made an appearance in this moviesomething for Virginia, perhaps?<br/><br/>Anyway, this was such a promising opening movie that I will definitely see the first sequel next week, at the cinema. Sometimes you watch a movie that you know will or may become a franchise. More often than not, you make up your mind to not watch anymore in the series. The sequel will have to be really bad to kill this franchise.<br/><br/>P.S. I've seen the sequel to this movie and will post up my review now."

","In their first major career roles, Georgie Henley (Lucy) Skandar Keynes (Edmund) William Moseley (Peter) and Anna Popplewell (Susan) star in this C.S Lewis adaptation about their characters finding a magical world in the back of a wardrobe.<br/><br/>Having never read the book but heard rave reviews, I was intrigued to see this film and wasn't to be disappointed.<br/><br/>In a magical fairytale for the whole family, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe has something for everybody, the mystical adventure for the younger generations, and a few good characters and experienced ideologies for adults.<br/><br/>A question mark hovers over the acting but with first performances it is understandable.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) is excellent as the witch, her cold personality and the character epitomizes the true essence of evil, which is what the story follows.<br/><br/>Good vs evil is often very obvious, which is the case here with the golden spirit of Aslan and the cold white heart of the witch, giving the film good balance.<br/><br/>The writing and mystery behind Narnia is very good. The sheer imagination of a wardrobe containing a magical kingdom is a good enough reason to go and see the film and is well established by Andrew Adamson. Though not the best direction, it gets the required effect.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge lover of CGI being a person for realism in context and etc. There is no question that the work that has gone into creating all the creatures and scenery is outstanding. But I'm personally not a fan of it, but if you do like it, then this is CGI at its peak.<br/><br/>Apart from a few lapses in the story and pretty bad acting, it is an enjoyable fun film for the whole family."

","Is it such a good idea that a young child goes home to tea with a stranger, even one who has hooves? Perhaps, given the age in which we live, it is not the best example to set. I grew up in England during the war in question and well remember a teacher telling us at the age of nine or so, that there was less danger as fewer people had cars in which to abduct a child, (and little or no candy with which to tempt us). Yes this is a delightful film and the effects are astounding, with a touch of ""Pan's Laberynth"", but perhaps some sort of warning could have been included. The vast majority are kind and would certainly never harm a child but there are exceptions, as we all know."

William is just right for the role his bearing is like that of royalty and he fits well for the character's character. Anne is very good in her acting I like the scene where she & Goergie were bonding before they were attacked by Maugrim.

","What can I say about this film, other than it is absolutely brilliant, marvellous, fab, out of this world? I LOVED it. It has everything, comedy, drama, suspense, fantasy. I loved the original as a young child, and when I went to see it in the cinema, I admit I didn't stay awake, but that was because I had had a very long day at work, and missed the fantastic battle sequence. However, I saw it again and couldn't stop gasping at the wonderful effects. The young girl playing Lucy was simply adorable, and although the other characters were annoying, they soon made you like them as the film went on.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was...well...damn scary. She played the part so well. You wouldn't want to cross her, would you? All the other supporting actors were fab too.<br/><br/>I am soooo excited about the sequel.

Not that Harry Potter isn't a great series as well but this movie was breathtaking. The acting and history of these stories should make this movie #1 for 2005. It is in so many Narnia fans opinions. I was so pleased and interested to see these characters come to life, I hope that the story will continue in the movie's but with these ratings it looks as though the public was not pleased? May I ask why? This is an excellent piece, highly-recommended!<br/><br/>This story of Lucy the girl and her siblings (one older sister ) and her brother Peter escape reality into the mysterious wardrobe to find another world. Perfectly magic contents reveal another land-Narnia. The Chronicles of Narnia correlate so well with the most well written delightful books.

","I've been reading the book to my school kids ( third fourth and fifth graders) for 30 years and they have all loved the book. One of my kids told his parents about the book and his dad brought back some Turkish delight for us when he went to England. I enjoy the BBC version of the movie because it is so faithful to the book. I wasn't sure I would like this movie version because I knew it added and subtracted from the book. It was so well done and brought the characters so vividly to life that I really enjoyed it anyway. The message of the book stayed intact and that was what really mattered. The only thing that disappointed me a bit was the voice of Aslan. I expected a voice like James Earl Jones - very deep and commanding. I wish they would make an IMAX version."
"mmckinley-5","10","1","1","3 December 2006"," Beautifully done and true
","Those of us - and there are many - who know and love the works of the great Christian apologist CS Lewis, found this movie version of his first children's book surprisingly true to the original and really beautifully done in every way. <br/><br/>Perhaps not everyone on this list knows the background of the Chronicles but, briefly, he and Tolkien were close friends at Oxford and belonged to the same writers' club. While discussing the impossibility of reaching youngsters with the message of Christianity, they each decided to write thrilling stories for children that would also include Christian morality and voilà! we have Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the only way to really appreciate the Narnia books is to 1) read them aloud to a child and 2) read some of Lewis' other works, so that you get the context."

","« Welcome to Duloch, such a perfect place » : sugarcoated, soulless, lifeless, artificial, phony, kitsch and without imagination. Interesting irony: the director of ""Shrek"" doing this. I guess he felt he needed to apologize from too much subversive thinking.<br/><br/>The huge success of this so-called « movie » tells a lot about our society and the way people want to « dream » nowadays. It's frightening. It's been a long time since I have attended something so lifeless, watered-down, sugary, tame, devoid of any genuine emotion, entirely virtual and fabricated. In comparison, the blockbusters that it tries to emulate (the LOTR and Harry Potter movies) look like timeless masterpieces, and this is coming from someone who'd rather eat a cactus than attend a LOTR movie ever again, as bombast and overkill tend to make me feel nauseous. As for the HP movies, I only celebrated the third one as a « real » movie, thanks to the extremely talented Alfonso Cuaron. To each his own, for my part I'm still in love with Scott's « Legend » (the export version, with Goldsmith's score, not the awful USA cut / Tangerine dream one) as nothing has ever come close to it in terms of painting a fantasy/magical world on the screen. Yes, it's mushy, but it works. Scott was a genius, at this time, at pulling off coherent, alive, breathing, working cinematic worlds (Alien, Blade Runner, Legend).<br/><br/>Here, everything you look at is artless and lifeless, just petty/pretty, sugarcoated pinch-beck images, a « 3-D Barbie fantasy show » as a friend of mine called this, CGI prowess presented as great achievements while being just pseudo-realistic digital dolls on a stage (it kinda looks like the real thing until you try to smell it and discover it has no smell whatsoever, or any taste for that matter) while all sense of depth, substance, emotion, soul, magic, is meticulously wiped off. The whole thing looks like a phony plastic Xmas tree. Pretty to look at, but anyone used to a real tree can only be very disappointed, and feel sad that the magic is gone.<br/><br/>As usual, Tilda is absolutely jaw-dropping. A Queen she is indeed, not only in the story but in the movie team as well. Looks like she was the only artistically competent (grown-up) person in this team. Why such a fantastic actress isn't hired for A-works (artistically speaking) is beyond me.<br/><br/>If you like real fantasy, look somewhere else. If you insist on having some family sugar-coated evening, even the Sound of Music and Mary Poppins are leagues ahead this soulless digital fest. Watch these again instead. Want the real thing ? (Re) discover Legend, the fully restored director's cut."
"polishanya","8","1","1","11 August 2006"," Wonderful movie and book although...
","I have watched this film numerous times and enjoyed it immensely. However, I believe that the gruesome faces in this movie are not needed. In addition, I think that these faces are completely inspired by the Lord of the Rings and are almost the same. <br/><br/>Another thing that annoyed me while I watched this movie was that in the end, when they show the children as adults, they have hardly any resemblance with the four young children. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this is an enchanting movie full of bravery, humor, adventure and loyalty. I would gladly watch it over and over again. This movie is a classic and I think everyone should watch it, although I would advise reading the book first so you can imagine the characters yourself and then see how someone else imagined them.<br/><br/>C.S.Lewis has this heartwarming style of writing and the movie remains faithful to the book in this. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, is a good movie for children, full of morals and values, but it is also a good movie for adults. It is actually really religious, since C.S.Lewis was a faithful Christian. But don't let this put you off, the movie is fun and adventurous without the religious aspect too."
"funkyfry","8","1","1","2 August 2006"," A very enjoyable fantasy film
","I highly approve of this fantasy film for young people, and would also recommend it to older fantasy fans with fond memories of C.S. Lewis' memorable series. However, I would urge parents to keep kids under the age of 8 away as the film has some complex themes and a lot of violence.<br/><br/>As a long-time fan of the Narnia books, I was as usual expecting to be under-whelmed by this film from the director of ""Shrek"", a film I really did not enjoy. But the film is beautifully photographed and is more original and enjoyable than the Harry Potter films, though it is not quite as good as ""Lord of the Rings"". The child actors, first of all, were astounding. And if you have seen a lot of movies with child actors you know what I mean. Usually they are just ciphers, they just represent something for the adult characters to defend and love. But this film is really about the children, and the director has managed to get performances out of the children that are truly nuanced and alive.<br/><br/>The sense of the fantasy world itself is very fulfilling. This is a film that satisfies the requirements for a faerie tale, and I enjoyed the way the movie used the idea of having Lucy go in first, then Edmund, and finally all 4 children. It really made the contrast between the faerie and the human worlds vivid. The audience is with Lucy 100% and so through her we experience the resistance that ""reality"" presents when faced with the fey, which is one of the central themes in quality fantasy literature/film (see also ""Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" for example, or the novel ""Don Quixote""). Then when Edmund denies having been there when the audience knows he ""really"" was, it introduces the aspects of his character that are less than admirable in a believable way, which makes it easier for us to understand why he does side with the White Witch at first.<br/><br/>Speaking of the White Witch, I have to say Tilda Swinton makes this movie worthwhile even if there were nothing else in the film. She is one of the best female villains I have ever seen in a film. If people want to make comparisons to the classic Margaret Hamilton performance in ""The Wizard of Oz"", it wouldn't be too far out of line. Truly inspired work, she becomes more and more ferocious as she goes on. Unfortunately I don't really think they captured the sense that she was seductive in her early scenes with Edmund, and other than his jealous personality it's somewhat hard to imagine Edmund siding with her instead of being creeped out by her. I don't think that was so much Swinton's fault as how she was directed. This is a very good film but it lacks subtlety on certain levels.<br/><br/>But a fantasy movie doesn't have to be subtle to be great. This film in its best moments truly soars. Aslan's death is handled very well, the scene is appropriately disgusting and the girls' lamentation convincing. Aside from the issue of timing (how did Asland manage to be resurrected, travel across Narnia to the White Witch's castle, breathe on all the frozen soldiers, and then get that army to the fields, all while the battle was taking place?) it is quite effective. The big battle at the end feels a bit too ""LOTR"", but the minotaurs make a scary opponent and Swinton really pours gas on the fire in that scene. The early scenes with Lucy in the forest with the fawn are perfect. You get that sense of menace from the fawn without any of the ugly implications that might have come with it.<br/><br/>Only minor complaints -- I thought the badger couple had a bit too much of the ""shrek"" cheeziness in them, and it was inappropriate for mr. badger to call the kid a ""blighter"". I also thought the ""Father Christmas"" segment was a bit on the cheezy side. But it does serve its function in the story.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film which should be commented on is the perfect balance it achieves between allegory and pure fantasy. The film-makers could have chosen to emphasize the religious allegory more, or they could have done some changes in the story to make it even less apparent, but I think they chose wisely to more or less adapt the story exactly how Lewis had done it, which is to leave the allegory in the open but not to push it in anyone's face. That is a harder balance to reach than it might seem and the film-makers should be praised for succeeding."
"Spuzzlightyear","7","1","1","9 July 2006"," Narnia: Big Gay movie?
","Let me say up front. Narnia was a great movie. Full of cool special effects, great performances (I especially like Tilda Swinton in anything she does) and just the overall feeling one gets from the movie. But then, just dissecting it, and figuring out what it all means, was my next step. I mean, the biblical connections were obvious. But then I started thinking about the closet (well, the wardrobe) and then I wondered..<br/><br/>Is Narnia one big gay film? The kids go into the closet, close it, and are instantly transformed where everything is magical (and excuse the expression fairy-like) where everything is wonderful, just as long as you keep everything closeted. Oh yes, there will be people like the ice queen (read neo-conservatives) that will try to put a stop to the magic, so we'll have to band together to fight the bigotry!"

","I liked the acting in this movie, and I liked the action, and I liked the story.<br/><br/>Never having read CS Lewis, I was able to enjoy this movie for what was actually in it, not what it ""should have been"".<br/><br/>I knocked two points off: 1/2 point for Deus Ex Machina and 1/2 point for the Christian undertones, which, as in daily life, if Christians would just keep their hate and nonsense to themselves, I'd never even know they existed. I also took 1 point off because the story... lacked a certain sense.<br/><br/>I dug Jadis, but I didn't understand exactly what she was doing as Queen of Narnia. The entire Queen of Narnia bit makes no sense any way you hash it. Aslan was the quasi-founder godhead of Narnia. I've read in numerous places that Aslan was ""all powerful"". How does an all-powerful entity allow itself to be killed? Why does an all-powerful entity not deal with lesser powerful entities that want to muck up it's creation. If Aslan could have killed Jadis at any time, why didn't he? If he couldn't have, how did he at the end? That's something that I dislike about these messianic children's stories; they make NO sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>So, I made up a kind of backstory that if it was accurate, would make the story make sense to me. Then I got into the movie.<br/><br/>On to Deus Ex Machina. ""Oh, and btw, it turns out that that pot-metal sword you found in the garbage is really the Silver Sword of Narnia Ruling +5 against White Witches"". ""Oh, by the way 007, This note is to inform you that there was a late addition to your utility belt. Conveniently placed anti laser of death remote control which will also cause the shark tank door to open exactly when the bad guy is over it"" The time to explain some magical effect which causes death to turn backwards and completely ruin the badguy's plans is not after it's happened. ""Oh, girls, you, like the white witch, didn't know this; but, if you kill an innocent on the stone table with a dirk instead of a butcher knife after 11:37pm but before 3:12 am, after cutting off all it's hair, you automatically turn death backwards."" Obviously CS Lewis was a lawyer working in product liability.<br/><br/>And last but not least, on to the whole Jesus risen nonsense. If it hadnt been touted as a ""Christian"" Story, I never would have noticed.<br/><br/>All in all, good music, good fight scenes, pretty young actors and a fairly good time for all. Except kids and Xtians."
"epressel","7","1","1","29 June 2006"," Narnia good but not great
","I will try to be succinct. The Chronicles of Narnia as stories are good, especially for younger viewers/readers who are more sensitive to violence. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good watch, if you can get through the very slow beginning. It should be noted that those of you who have seen the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and loved them, will not necessarily like the Narnia stories. The Narnia stories as a whole are more fantastical and wholesome whereas the LOTR stories are more dark and gruesome. It should also be noted that the Narnia stories rely heavily on biblical and Christian themes, which may be a turn off to some viewers. If you choose to watch this movie really commit yourself because it is easy to lose interest during the set-up of the story. I was reading all of these books as a child and I have seen every version of this story both made for TV as well as the animated version and I still began to doubt myself half-way through. I guess the best way to end this critique is that the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's books (LOTR) won Oscars, The Narnia stories will not.<br/><br/>Just an extra sidebar for my fellow ranters. The tigers that are seen fighting alongside the Witch are depicted as just so-so enemies when in fact large tigers are on average, one to two hundred pounds larger than the largest lions. I know that Aslan is the savior of the story but this is not portraying an accurate depiction of the hierarchy of the great cats. Lions are not the kings of the jungle. Newsflash, Lions do not even live in the jungle, they live in the grasslands. Tigers live in jungles and are larger and stronger than lions. Just for arguments sake, the largest wild tiger ever documented weighed 858 lbs. Te largest wild lion ever documented weighed 688 lbs."
"gloshpit","6","1","1","25 June 2006"," Very much a children's movie.
","While technically impressive, this film struck me as slightly soulless - although the acting was overall fairly good (Swinton stood out as a very effective Jadis), it appeared content to dazzle younger viewers with almost cartoon-like visuals rather than engage the audience's attention.<br/><br/>It is not without its positive points: Tumnus is also played well by James McAvoy, and the climactic battle scene was at time very impressive. However, the reliance on CGI is a major problem. Although it has been used in the past to great effect to give a realistic feel to proceedings, such as the several thousands of effects in the Lord of the Rings films, in Narnia the effects are very overtly animated, giving some scenes the feel of a Pixar movie rather than a live-action fantasy. To children this would be entertaining, but to older viewers it just seems to be a distraction. Possibly the most egregious case of this is in the rendering of the fox, whose overall effect is quite disturbing, akin to some deformity.<br/><br/>Although the look of Jadis, the minotaur and the overall aesthetic of the final battlefield is well executed, there seems to be very little that stands out other than the main characters. Soldiers are faceless and without personality; even the centaur captain Oreius is devoid of characterisation. The makeup effects on a good deal of the evil creatures are again tending towards simplistically rubbery, in the case of the jail monster to the point of being a basic mass. The effects on creating Aslan are technically good, but are wasted on a design that is simply a large lion instead of the glowing, breathtaking spectacle that it should by rights be, and the ensuing reaction from the assembled army that should be present. Rather than this, the film depicts him as nothing more than a kindly general who happens to be a lion.<br/><br/>And this seems to be the problem with Narnia - it is content to tread through the story in a very workmanlike manner. It feels slightly forced and on rails, moving from one scene to another as if it were checking the 'fantasy epic' boxes one by one - there is no disbelief from the children when they arrive in Narnia, just acceptance and proceeding to the next area (in the case of Lucy, the acceptance is just a large grin and exhalations for several minutes). There is very little subtlety in the film, instead it just boils down C.S. Lewis's story down to the basic elements and pads them out not with characterisation but distractions. Whilst some critics have cited the religious parallels as a reason to give it incredibly high ratings, taken as a purely cinematic experience it is one thing: A children's film, not a family film.<br/><br/>I can't help but wonder how it would have turned out under Peter Jackson..."

","9 stars out 10 <br/><br/>This film contains quite a lot of violence and dark scenes that are very threatening in nature. I would not recommend a very young child viewing this. I think it is too frightening and intense. A mature eight year old might could handle it, ten would be better.<br/><br/>There were things I most definitely liked about this story/film, and a few things I didn't.<br/><br/>They seemed to have a little problem with the way the wolves walked/moved, but over all, the special effects were brilliant.<br/><br/>I enjoy films that feature mystical creatures and beasts such as the minotaur, centaurs, fauns, unicorns and the like, as well as all the animals talking.<br/><br/>The story revolves around 4 English siblings during WWII, who accidentally discover the wonderful world of Narnia.<br/><br/>Narnia is in deep trouble, however, and therein lies both the source of an interesting tale and some clichés that we really need to move past.<br/><br/>I was pleased that a little girl (it's always a little boy) is the first to discover Narnia, even though the actress who played her was mud ugly, poor thing.<br/><br/>And I was completely delighted with the faun who comes into the picture early, along with the magnificent lion and all the other creatures.<br/><br/>However, I noted Mr. Beaver could have been a little nicer to his wife, there are some put-downs by him I could have done without.<br/><br/>We also have the old tired cliché of the wolves being the vicious bad guys, and the only powerful adult female in the film is, as so frequently happens, depicted as mean and evil. The fact two girls (sisters) are in the film, as well as their brothers, does off-set this some, I will admit.<br/><br/>Another gripe I have is the old cliché of the outsiders come to this troubled world and they are, of course, the only ones who can fix the problem. Then after they fix the problem, they are promptly fawned over as heroes by the entire population and raised to a very high social level.<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD: <br/><br/>While I assume Edmund learned his lesson, it would have been nice to have actually heard him apologize to the lion and to his siblings.<br/><br/>The lion sacrificing himself for worthless Edmund set very poorly with me, even though it turns out all right for the lion. I just didn't like that it happened at all.<br/><br/>I also felt the lion should have been the king of Narnia not a bunch of outside kids, and if there needed to be more than one throne occupied then make them be the lion, the faun, and the two beavers. Maybe they should make that five thrones, and include the brave fox. <br/><br/>Although the fox is killed I would assume he could be brought back since everybody else good that got killed or frozen could."

","While the dark recesses of many wardrobes are a mystery containing untold treasures and/or horrors, there is a particular wardrobe in a spare room that leads to the magical land of Narnia. A land where the White Witch (evil) has reigned for 100 years, but Aslan the Lion (good) is on the move. This is such a vast and beautiful world that an epic clash between good and evil is inevitable.<br/><br/>Set during World War II, the four Pevensie children are sent away from blitz-bombed London to the safety of Professor Kirke's country mansion. Peter and Susan are the elder children and stoically sensible and responsible. The youngest child, Lucy, is sunny and engaging. It is Edmund, desperately missing his father and smarting against the assumed authority of his older siblings, who has some hard lessons to learn about temptation and treachery.<br/><br/>Isolated and bored in the sprawling house, the children resort to playing hide and seek. Lucy hides in a wardrobe and stumbles into Narnia, a land frozen in the grip of winter and the evil Witch. This seemingly random event begins the fulfillment of a prophecy of biblical proportions. And the biblical themes that run through these Chronicles are undeniable.<br/><br/>The essence of Narnia is Deep Magic. Mythical creatures such as unicorns and griffins, mermaids and centaurs and even Santa Claus mingle with more modest birds, beavers, badgers and wolves. All these animals can talk and even the trees are listening. So who can be trusted? Definitely not the White Witch, with her guilty gifts of Turkish Delight. She is the epitome of evil, breathtakingly icy and chillingly ruthless. As for her followers, fortunately it does seem to be true that evil disfigures and deforms as they are the foulest collection of genetic mishaps we have ever seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Aslan the Lion is molten gold goodness, with a lion's courage and a true heart. His voice resonates with warmth and it can only be summer in his presence. His followers are a host of the most dazzling beings in Narnia, as well as a myriad of sharp-witted forest animals.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia incorporate CGI at its most seamless. Though for all the awesome scale, its beauty is in the details. Only four of the heroes are human and it is set in a vast, magical land, but this fantasy is warmly familiar. Following his first meeting with Lucy, Mr Tumnus the Faun says that she ""made me feel warmer than I've felt in 100 years"". This is how we felt about our first trip to Narnia and we can't wait to return."

After seeing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I realized they left a lot out of stuff. But this movie fetures almost every last detail. The make-up artists did a fantastic job bringing C.S.

","My initial reaction when I first heard that the director of the Shrek films would be directing/writing ""The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe"" was, ""What?! That won't work!"" I am not an avid book fan that curses at the screen at every add-in or change. I find the Chronicles a bit dry & hurried, but my expectations of the transfer from book to movie rose. Until I heard the director's name. However, despite my recurring fears that in it's stead, a horrid mutant of the the original story would appear, the rumors that I began to hear shortly after the film's release were all favorable. I started to think that perhaps this adaptation of the novels would be better than BBC's whole-hearted, but cheap, attempt at the series many years ago. So, I accompanied my family to the theater, & was sucked into Narnia instantly. The scenery was amazing; the children looked exactly how my mind had imagined them when it received absolutely no prompt from the book. The acting was believable; all the missing components of the book were, amazingly, in the movie. We own the special-edition DVD & watch it over & over, highly anticipating the release of ""Prince Caspian."" Andrew Adamson pleasantly surprised me, bringing a quality family film to the screen, & leaving me begging for more."
"abrady8103","10","1","1","27 May 2006"," Awesome Movie.
","This is the best version of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" I have ever seen. The cast is great; the special effects are amazing, and the scenery is beautiful. It's no wonder that Andrew Adamson did a very good job of directing the movie since he did Shrek and Shrek 2. The other versions of this story are not as good. Peter was my favorite character. He reminded me of Harry Potter because of his courage and Ron Weasley because of his sense of humor. They probably shouldn't have made Susan a little stuck up because she wasn't like the that in the books. In the last book, they say she stops believing in Narnia. They made that to obvious. The girl who played Lucy did a great job, and the boy who played Edmund portrayed his character very well. The BBC version wasn't good because it had poor special effects and scenery. The animated movie was all right, but it wasn't really exciting."
"SlackerRus2000","6","1","1","20 May 2006"," Better Than Harry Potter, Worse Than LOTR
","I feel this movie gets a bad wrap. I mean, if you read the books you would realize the pacing of the books is so fast and isn't paced evenly throughout the book. I thought Lucy did an amazing job, her scenes with Mr. Tumnus were amazing, Edwin had his moments, but the other too gave very weak performances. To be fair though, they had the least dialogue to work with and what they did have wasn't very good, they weren't well-developed characters and it shows. The two most memorable sequences were the sequences between Lucy and Mr. Tumnus and the sacrifical sequences. If the rest of the film had been treated with such care it would have been a spectacular film, perhaps rivaling the LOTR films. The much touted CGI characters also shine, the voices perfectly match the character and their animation in terms of emotion is great. Unfortunately, the film is marred by pacing issues, some uneven CGI effects, some poor dialogue, and some uneventful action sequences. On the whole, I thought this was a step in the right direction and am looking forward to future films in the series. Definitely a film your kids will enjoy."

","When I rented this movie I had already heard so much about the movie and was skeptical as I generally don't end up enjoying movies with to much hype.Also I had missed the movie in the theaters and was really excited when i got this DVD almost the next day after it released.<br/><br/>This movie will be one of the rare movies where you expect the world and end up getting it. Everything about the movie is great and save for a one or 2 I cannot see any flaws in it.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent and I'm not to sure whether the plastic expressions of Edmund were intentional or because he is a bad actor but the fit perfectly with the mood he should have been throughout the film.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is in fantasy and even though some scenes reek of LOTR and New Zealand the fantasy world of Narnia has been masterfully created.<br/><br/>A special winner is the background score of the film which was brilliant and was further enhanced with some great mixing on the home-theater enhanced sound on the DVD.<br/><br/>The old fashioned values that are taught in this film (sacrifice, family bonding, hope) are endearing to people of all ages and are far better than the stupid cartoons that are being dished out today(spongebob , squarepants ).<br/><br/>The only thing that annoyed me was the quality of the action towards the end of the film which could have been much better considering the pg-13 certificate (i can never understand why they freak out in fight scenes when whats really disturbs the children are the sexual themes in movies even with pg-13, i mean we watched cartoons where people fought and killed every time and were no homicidal maniacs).<br/><br/>Save for that this film is a perfect family potboiler with loads of hope, scary scenes, funny scenes , inspiring scenes etc etc etc.<br/><br/>A must watch for all ages and a far better film for children then say a Harry Potter.<br/><br/>You have to watch this film."

","Growing up, my favorite films tended to involve ordinary people thrust into unordinary situations. Part of the fun was the hope that someday, somehow I would become one of those people and explore places that were deemed impossible to exist. As I got older and became an adult, I accepted the harsh realities of the real world and that I would never end up like the heroes that I cheered on screen. The innocence and the warm feelings of my youth became extinct. <br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe brought those feelings back, if just for the two and a half hours of the film's running time. This is the best fantasy film released since 1984's The Neverending Story. Any relation to the real world and the logic we have all become accustomed to should be discarded upon viewing, because that's not what the film is about. The audience is in the shoes of the four main heroes of the film as they explore and discover all the wonders of this new world and its strange mysteries for themselves.<br/><br/>The story is often hailed as a representation of the Christian belief and is well-acclaimed by its followers. However, there is no reason for Atheists to discard this film, by any means. It is not a retelling or adaptation of the story of the life of Jesus Christ. It merely makes references and borrows ideas from the bible to help develop their own characters. And it all works. By the time the film ends, the audience will care deeply for the heroes and cheer for them all the way through the many exciting turns and situations they encounter.<br/><br/>Terrific film. Highly recommended."

","I grew up reading the Narnia books since second grade. I've remembered my teachers reading to me ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" I'll have to admit, that book was pretty darn good, and I ended up reading most from the series except for book 1. Now this movie came along for the winter, probably the nicest treat a child can get.<br/><br/>Narnia was simply a classical tale full of knights, magic, and animals. Hell, it was almost ALMOST like the kid's version of Lord of the Rings. (I mean, the two authors were good friends) This movie had everything coming as expected, unlike how other movies are these days. I don't understand, all the kid's flick these days include some of the most awful films ever. Now here was a classic tale that a kid would enjoy, despite his age and size.<br/><br/>I was actually amazed at how much I underrated this film. The actors and actresses all pounded their roles, but I have to admit, Tilda Swanton as the White Witch stole it all. She was amazing as the White Witch. Changing faces from that kind, generous queen to that cruel, arrogant witch made me realize how much of a powerful actress she was. Maybe it was all that makeup she probably had, but the White Witch clearly depicted the villain I had expected her to be. Liam Neeson's powerful voice also matched that of how I would imagine Aslan would be. The clear beauty of the landscape and the epic battle that takes place in a wide terrain made Narnia ever so beautiful and bold. The simple children's story that I held and read came vividly and alive. The special effects had it all, as well.<br/><br/>I have to admit, Narnia was one of the best kid's movie I have seen in years. Convincing performances, stylish landscapes, and the beautiful dialogue made this film the most classical experience I have ever felt."
"gradyharp","8","1","1","14 April 2006"," A Fantasy Well Grounded in Reality
","CS Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia may very well have been a book intended for children but it was also the result of a life through the Great Wars and the effects those wars had one the individual. Gratefully in Andrew Adamson's directorial hands that part of the story that lends the need for the fantasy is preserved.<br/><br/>The concept of separating children from their parents during the Blitz in London in WW II is now showing up in many novels. Lewis was one of the first to address the trauma these separations had on children. Adamson opens his film with some fine footage of the aerial German blitz and the terror of the Londoners running for bomb shelters. The family in focus is the Pevensie family - Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley), and Susan (Anna Popplewell) - and these four children are sent off to a safe mansion owned by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). The mansion has a wardrobe that begins the fantasy, Lucy being the first to enter the kingdom of Narnia through the back of the wardrobe. Soon the four children are all together in the snowy place and encounter first a faun, then the Queen of Narnia/White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and there begins the struggle for domination and secrets that gradually resolve the mystery of Narnia, that mystery carefully paralleling Christianity through the forces of the kind Lion Aslan (Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>The children are wonderful, especially Georgie Henley, and while the story deals with human creatures it is strong. As the various CGI animals enter (fine though they may be as creations) the tale for this viewer weakens a bit, but that is a personal response. In general with work like that from Tilda Swinton and Jim Broadbent along with the children, the movie form of Narnia is convincing and enchanting. Quibbles aside, it is a charming film. Grady Harp"

","The thing that I didn't like about the movie is that its a long story which they tried to put in a short movie - This movie was supposed to be like "" Lord of the ring "" - Two or three movies at least . Its seems that everything is happening too fast in this movie . Like for example Peter who just ten minutes ago was playing hide and seek with his brother and sisters is now given a sword and after killing one miserable wolf he is granted the title of "" Knight of narnia "" - Give me a break - What did he do to deserve it ? In lord of the ring you get to know the character , they are fighting ten great wars before you come to respect them as true warriors . And then on top of that after being a knight , not a day goes by and Peter is forced to go to war to save Narnia and all the country comes for the aid of the kid who half hour ago didn't even know what Narnia is . So , for conclusion , it could have been a much better film . Give it to Peter Jackson and I bet it will look a lot different ."
"david-nobes","6","1","1","18 December 2005"," Where is the magic?
","First up, I know the Narnia stories. I read them first in primary school, and I read them to my children when they were young. I have also read much of Lewis' other writings, as well as Tolkien's and know about their gentle rivalry. The upshot is that Peter Jackson did a better job with Lord of the Rings than Adamson has done with the first of the Narnia chronicle, and I think it's because Lewis' writings were simpler - naive even - whereas Tolkien created an entire world, languages included.<br/><br/>But the lack of spark transcends Lewis' material. There is no magic. Everything seems to proceed in an almost nonchalant way. I went with my daughters, and we were all a little underwhelmed. It didn't excite us, it didn't get our pulses racing, and we shed not a tear at the scenes that were clearly intended to do so. Yes we know the stories well, but we knew the LoTR story even better, and it grabbed us.<br/><br/>Finally, some of the scenes may not be appropriate for the intended younger audience.<br/><br/>All in all, an OK adaptation, but as one daughter commented, the BBC adaptation was less technically sophisticated but ultimately better."
"Kryzak","7","1","1","16 December 2005"," Magical Fun!
","Narnia can be summarized by two words: magical fun! As a kids movie, it was nearly perfect (if I were a decade or two younger ), but as a complete movie that stirs the soul, I can only give it an 8 (which is a very good score in my book!). Before I say anything, Tilda Swinton was simply BREATHTAKING (no pun intended) as the Witch in this movie! Her every move, every look, every gesture was pure art, grace, and *evil*! She literally stole the show and carried the movie, both at the same time.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the story was fun if you watch it from a child's point of view. The special effects were done quite well (except for maybe a couple scenes here and there where you can tell it's a blue/green screen), and the child actors weren't too bad either. The little girl was definitely my favorite out of the 4 kids. Of course, there are many comparisons to Lord of the Rings, and I find myself thinking ""Gandalf!"" when I saw Santa Claus, or ""Galadriel"" when seeing the witch... Also, for fellow RPG geeks out there, my friend and I thought that Peter must have walked around in the same place to ""level up"" so that he went from not knowing how to use a sword to killing minotaurs...<br/><br/>There were some concerns about heavy handed religious overtones in the movie, but that wasn't a problem at all. It was handled quite well and fit the story.<br/><br/>All in all, great movie! Allow yourself to live your childhood again and you'll be immersed in the wonderful world of Narnia."

About the film: The story is very good implemented and the scenes are without useless addings. Oh..., and we must note the good animal-characters animations. At the battle scene was place for better performings. Also, this scene is without any kind of nonsense actions, like we are seeing in many movies. I won't give examples here. The sound ambiance is nice but not very good.

","Based on reviews I read in advance, didn't expect much from this movie at all. In fact, I was expecting to sleep through part of the movie. But boy, was I wrong! There are these kind of movies, where after the first few shots you know you are going to love the rest of it. This was precisely the case. The parting of children from their mother in London was shot just beautiful, full of rich emotion, yet steering clear of being pathetic.<br/><br/>This remains the case for the rest of the film. Were it set into different background, I would probably sneeze at it, calling it pathetic and emotionally overcharged. But in conjunction with the beautiful tender story of small children living out their fantasies, it just all seems to work.<br/><br/>Performances by the child actors are very satisfactory with some and exceptional with others. While I didn't like both of the boy's acting as much, I found the young girls brilliant. Lucy in particular, being the youngest child, is basically driving the whole atmosphere of the movie and should have been maybe given even bigger space.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie left a very warm and cosy feeling in me, it made me sit at the edge of the seat and feel like a small child again. Very, very recommended."

It is said that Ms. Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West left such a mark upon young viewers that when they saw her in real life they would get quite frightened. Tilda brought that depth of believability to this role.<br/><br/>The reason I give this magnificent film an 8: I am deducting 2 points for the over-wrought final battle sequence - too long and too involved - it didn't match the pace and balance of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>That said I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone about 8 years old and up."

","I was very pleased with the Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Since the technology now exists to bring C.S. Lewis' creation to life on the big screen I was really pleased with the efforts made by the filmmakers to draw you in to Narnia. There aren't too many special effects like you will see in some more recent movies (sorry George Lucas!). Although the scene with the 4 children and the Beavers at the waterfall wasn't in the book, one can see where Peter is forced to make a decision and isn't ready to make it yet, which is in the book. If you see this movie in the theatre be prepared to hear Aslans roar as it was intended to be heard in the book. The only parts my 3 year old was scared slightly by were the ones with the wolves, other than that even she enjoyed it. My husband, my 13 year old son who also had read the book enjoyed it.<br/><br/>My son especially appreciated the scene where the Phoenix bird lays down a strip of Napalm (SP?) type effect with the aid of a lit arrow from Edmonds archers. The white witch definitely gets her share in the end in a brilliant scene of Aslan flying to the rescue in all his roaring lionly glory to save King Peter.<br/><br/>When I had read the books as a child I never knew that C.S. Lewis was writing an analogy of the life of Jesus in his stories but now that I know it does make sense. For Christians and non-Christians alike, I think this is a Theatre must see!"
"dearth-eigenvector","8","1","1","10 December 2005"," Good Movie. (period/full stop) Not Harry Potter. (period/full stop) No comparisons, please.
","I beg to differ with Ms. Catherine Jones but this is not a ""better movie than Harry Potter"" - it is a DIFFERENT movie than Harry Potter. (It's also different than LOTR but there are some similarities.) Obviously, as the 6th or 7th sequel to Narnia comes out the lines will be less firmly drawn but this is simply a different movie about a different book. All three (HP, Narnia, and LOTR) are adaptations of VERY popular book series and, as such, must remain as faithful as possible to the original story to retain fans of the books. But they are distinctly different movies (books) which happen to touch on overlapping themes at times.<br/><br/>I have read all of the HP books at least once and the same for LOTR. This is not true about Narnia. However, I have read other C.S. Lewis and, perhaps most importantly, a primordial version of Narnia (not called that but many of the ideas came from there) which Clive wrote with his brother when he was 8 or 9 years old. What IS similar about the three authors, and hence the three movies to some extent, is the ability to build a fantasy world peopled with very real characters who exhibit some very real human traits and situations (in spite of the fact of their fantastic or non-human form).<br/><br/>I would not/did not/could not judge this movie in comparison to HP or LOTR because I would have to find it lacking. I would recommend judging it on it's own merits. It is a good move. The series may some day become a great series. But Peter Jackson's LOTR was a feat like none other and stands on it's own. The same is true of the HP series but in a different vein - this is a collection of film adaptations made by a number of different directors yet hearkens to and keeps us connected to the series of books which is still evolving within our lifetime - there is a connectedness between the evolution of the books, the characters, and the films that has it's own appeal - not unlike the serializations of Charles Dickens or Arthur Conan Doyle. But enough of those other series - I said that I dost not compare this movie to they.<br/><br/>This first of the Narnia stories was a good movie. By comparison to all lesser movies (common Hollywood drek) it may even be a very, very good movie. But comparing it to HP or LOTR can only reduce it's appeal. <br/><br/>The CG was a little less perfect than it could have been. The child actors were outstanding and the adults did not get in the way. (I do think that I will go back and watch some of Ms. Swindon's earlier films such as ""Female Perversions"" ...)<br/><br/>I do recommend it and, especially for the holidays, it is an excellent family movie."

I was constantly checking my watch and making cynical remarks. The movie was a blockbuster disappointment. Sadly, at certain serious points, I was left laughing. I do not recommend seeing this movie, the children in the movie gave it their best but it was a cinematic disaster.

Narnia is full of Christian mythology, and that is appalling on many levels, but the reason for why it is awful is the poorly told story. The best part of the movie is truly the beginning. The reference to WWII was suspenseful and eye catching. In those scenes you could see the harsh reality of the children's daily life and pity them. The rest of the movie is boring and badly told and frankly pointless. Where does Aslan come from and why would he return because those four kids had walked into Narnia?? How did the white witch come into power and how come she could make the world cold and harsh? What is her motif? What is the point of this movie?? I left being upset that for once I hadn't believed the reviewers saying that the use of special effects was overdone, but they are right.

No backstory, no depth, this movie does not even deserve to mentioned in the same breath as LOTR, although it is obvious that the director sat through Peter Jackson 101 and thought that was enough.

Some Americans told me, it was something like Lord of the Rings, so my expectations were way too high.... It uses partially the story of Hans Christian Andersen's Snow Queen (little boy falls for the bad snow queen, little sister saves him), but then turns into a very weird mixture of all kinds of fantasy stuff...

But if you watch this movie with that in mind, you'll surely leave the theater as disappointed as I left. Actually that's a childish flick where even Santa Claus shows up. But I think Narnia sucks by its own mistakes anyway. A funny thing is that despite of that prophecy that the ""two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve"" would kick the witch's ass, the four kids didn't do anything of relevant to beat her. I guess the only effect they had in the war (oh gosh, I miss LOTR so much...) at all was a placebo: the queen of Narnia got so preoccupied with their arrival that her fear made her lose. About Aslam's resurrection, he offered his blood to pay for Ed's (I'm not quite sure his name in the original version is Ed, in Brazilian version the boy was called Edmundo) betrayal, but when he comes to life again he says that if an innocent was killed in the holy table he would resurrect.

","I was really surprised at how seriously awful this movie is. The early scenes are fine enough, and Lucy's entry into Narnia is nice. But ultimately ""Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"" seems to exist to transport audiences back to a time 30 years ago, when grotesque, over-produced, over-extended children's fare was the norm, because understanding children was a very low priority. <br/><br/>Where to begin...? If your story culminates in a protracted, climactic war, you've made a war movie; this isn't exactly a genre kids are screaming for. That, and it takes the form of a long, lifeless sermon... another format that doesn't make children stampede to theaters. Every single moment of the movie is unengaging. The script sucks and lazy, hierarchical thinking insures that every moment has been scrutinized for maximum staleness; everything is done the way someone did it before. The film-makers find a sluggish way to mount every scene, and continually find ways to bring the movie to a complete standstill with characters spouting yet another boring pronouncement. It moves at the pace of a funeral dirge, and after maybe half an hour it has all the excitement of a diagram. Specificity vanishes to make room for more setpieces. Both Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton give performances that some committee of drones approved. <br/><br/>If your kid likes this, you've got yourselves a dud. Only pasty, anemic indoors-oriented Brit brats pining for a lordship could tolerate even twenty minutes of this. Sadly it's over two hours long. This movie is D.O.A.."

","Technically speaking, this was an excellent film. Up until very recently, doing a competent live-action version of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was really impossible because the special effects were technically impossible to do and still make them look real. Now, thanks to computers and incredible software, it is possible to get the look right of the book and Disney did a great job. And, having read the books, I was impressed that they got the story right. The problem for me, though, was that although everything seemed to fit just fine, the story itself didn't fully engage me. Perhaps I'm just getting old, but after this eye-candy was over, I just felt a great sense of ""is that all there is?"". The biggest problem related to this were that the LORD OF THE RING movies were so great, so grand and so wonderful that this left this film in the category of ""also ran"". You just can't help but compare the films and when this occurs, the depth and complexity of the Peter Jackson films is apparent."

It would been perfect to show this movie at the HALLMARK CHANNEL over the Christmas, I've would have turned on the Television and not expected a well done movie, but a movie filled with computer animated effects that didn't really look real, but fun! Instead I had to dress up, go out and sit beside a stranger, staring angry at the screen trying and wanting to join the stranger playing with his popcorn! In one scene, where the little girl Lucy, (Georgie Henley) saw here friend turned into stone, she just stood there smiling, but then start's sounding like she's crying and I got confused! We also had these ""Peter Jackson, over the hill, camera flying move"" but we had it to many times, four times if I remember it right! They should had hired a good makeup artist instead of a bed costume designer!

","When I went into the theater, I had very high expectations- especially after reading the books- but when I came out of the theater, I was shaking my head and regretting spending 7 bucks on this movie. By far one of the worst I've seen. It seemed the only thing interesting in the theater was my popcorn that I was eating.<br/><br/>I thought that the special effects were fine, but there was a matter of the storyline and actually bringing the heart of the story to the big screen. It didn't catch my interest as the books did. The actors also did an OK job, but I thought the movie was quite horrible compared to what reviews I'd read."

","First off - like many others who have rated this film - I really wanted to like it. I loved the books as a child and the trailer looked very entertaining.<br/><br/>Perhaps whoever edited the trailer should have done the same for the movie. It was poorly put together. An amazing potential for a film that probably will make enough money to propagate a second installment - hopefully that one won't disappoint.<br/><br/>If you're worried about them straying from the book too far - don't be. The director didn't take any artistic license what-so-ever. I wish he had. The pace is slow, the actions scenes don't have action and it just isn't ""Fun"". After all, that's what movies are supposed to be.<br/><br/>I've read many other comments and I feel that there are probably 2 types of reviewers - those who watch movies and those who only watch movies that they are told it's OK to watch. The latter will enjoy this film, the former knows good from bad.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this film it's probably because you have nothing better to compare it to.<br/><br/>If you're group won't allow you to watch Harry Potter, please break away and see what you're missing.

"zinc-5","5","3","6","18 December 2005"," Missing the magic
","I was rather underwhelmed by my experience of seeing Narnia for a few reasons. Some of the main problems arise from miscasting of the characters:<br/><br/>Mr Tumnus: he somehow manages to come across looking like some guy you would meet at a fancy-dress party, or in a bar, albeit in an excessively elaborate costume.<br/><br/>Jadis: this character is the most important of the movie and should have been played by a stunningly beautiful actress with a much more powerful screen presence, both in terms of her compelling and admirable (yes) intellect, and her sheer size. She is described in 'The Magician's Nephew' as one of the most beautiful women in the entire world. Tilda Swinton simply has no appeal, and comes across rather meek and albino/alien-esquire. As a result, it is very difficult to conceive the magnetic attraction that Edmund was supposed to have had to the White Witch. Andrew Adamson has said that he wanted to avoid the usual cliché of the ""evil stepmother and the cackling witch"" that has been seen too many times over the years. He said he wanted to ""create a more sophisticated type of evil"". While the usual stereotype has been avoided (which is good), its replacement fails to arouse much emotion at all. She could point her wand at me any day and I wouldn't bat an eyelid.<br/><br/>The children: Peter's actor seems the least likable. His strong leadership from the book comes across as joyless sanctimoniousness and is off-putting. Susan seems to suffer the worst from the CGI, especially scenes involving wind which doesn't seem to move hair very much. The actress playing Lucy tries desperately to be cute and show wonderment at the unbelievable world around her. Any scenes involving extreme emotion (for example, crying) were the most disappointing. Edmund was actually pretty good.<br/><br/>The beavers, and Aslan: The voices, provided by celebrities, did not blend into their scenes. They were simply too loud and too clear. The beavers were the best part of the movie and their lines were met with approving murmurs from the audience around me. Liam Neeson's Irish accent, while slightly modified, seemed odd.<br/><br/>Regarding the rest of the movie, I just have a few remarks: The most crucial part of the plot from the book that is left out is the fact that the Turkish Delight given to Edmund is in fact enchanted! The book says ""anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they had killed themselves."" There are many instances in the movie where either critical information required for the story (such as above), or descriptive narrative, is left out, and the movie loses a huge amount of texture as a result. My solution would have been to include a narrator, making sure that they did not speak in a patronizingly slow manner. Father Christmas is depicted in the movie without his usual, hackneyed red outfit. I considered this to be rather refreshing. However, what Susan says a few scenes later doesn't really fit in as a result - ""just because some fellow in a red coat gives you a sword doesn't make you a hero"". I noticed that while leopards are featured in the book, the rosetted felines starring in the movie appeared to have cheetah heads, with prominent black 'tear' marks that leopards do not have. The bodies were clearly those of leopards. CS Lewis wrote in a letter: ""Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare -- at least with photography."" This unfortunately rang true. I found myself many times thinking how clever the WETA graphics team was, and other times thinking that more work should have been put into the project. My objection to this is that I really don't think I should have been thinking about the WETA team at all."
"after-hour_dvd_collector","4","3","6","17 December 2005"," I'm getting too old for that...
","OK, so i've sat through the movie. And the end credits. I was definitely impressed by the work that went into the effects, the sets, the animation, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Other than that, i'm feeling rather empty after two hours and twenty minutes. It seems like the film doesn't really know what to do with the story. Sure, we have that battle at the end. Sure, some of the creatures (and their movements) are really impressive. Would you just look at that incredible fur animation? Woah. And we see a lot of people (and animals) fight each other, because, well, it's good vs. evil, and of course, it's a long hard fight, and good wins because it's able to hit evil where it hurts, etc. etc. but in the end, i really didn't care for any of the characters, no matter how often the camera returns to the dramatic face close-ups of kids staring into the lens with possibly important meaning. The more the SFX become believable (talking animals, fantasy creatures etc.), the less believable the whole world they're supposed to create becomes. Narnia (in the movie) is the most detached environment possible: on one hand, all the weapons look like they're going to really, *really* hurt if applied, on the other hand, they must have non-sticky coating or all these creatures are just filled with straw... at least for me, the realistic violence and its obvious non-consequential nature in the movie just don't mix. Give me the cheap background projections, the wires, the unbelievable boss-fighting move or stop-motion trick, any kind of honest fake that says ""hey, we're telling you an original story, so just imagine/believe us that this isn't the cardboard the leading character's wig came in, but imagine it IS the shrine of the sword of weird-sounding-name"" over that polished fake of this Disney Narnia any time...<br/><br/>The whole film conjures so many other memorable moments in film history that it was more like a two-and-a-half hour collection of ""whoa, just like Lord of the Rings"" or ""my, doesn't she just look like Andersen's Snow Queen? Just not really that evil..."" or, worst, ""yeah, who didn't see that coming from a mile away / now who wrote that dialog?""<br/><br/>If it's supposed to be a kid's movie, then it's far too ""pseudoreal"" in its scenes of violence - and for grown-ups it's even less real, it's utterly fake. Aslan biting the evil queen's head off (off-screen, we're doing family-friendly Christmas entertainment after all...) and then turning around without even a single stain? I know cats are cleanly, but c'mon... on the other hand, maybe witches don't bleed. Don't know, don't really care, too... though she had some nice swordplay a few scenes earlier, i'll give her that. Now *that* was really cool... :)<br/><br/>And seeing analogies to the bible in this film, in my opinion, tells more about yourself than it does of the story. Feel free to disagree with me, but remember that in about every other fantasy novel, someone's back from the dead on a regular basis. Mighty popular these days, keeping the leading character around because he/she/it knows how to have the local magic/technology/midichlorians at hand... but, sorry to break this to you, that does not make them Jesus, or a symbol for him. Could as well be Atréju of the Neverending Story, or Gandalf the Grey/White, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Oh well, i'll catch the other parts on cable TV some year or other just for the awesome scenery and CGI animation, but this won't lure me into the cinema come next Christmas...<br/><br/>P.S.: No, i've not yet read the book, and after that film, i doubt that i will..."
"WilsonLau","2","3","6","16 December 2005"," Yawn
","Yeah i just came out of the theater after watching this one and i had to get on here to warn people. Unless you're 10 years old or younger, avoid this movie and save your money. This movie can be best described as a made for TV movie with a bigger budget. Or perhaps it could be seen as a watered down kid's version of Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The first 3/4 of the movie was a total yawn. Character development is non existent as we are not given any insight about the personalities of the children at all, all we know is that they're children running away from the Nazis. Furthermore, what we do realize about these children are that they are quite the little runts. With exception to the the youngest child, Lucy, the rest are a bunch of malcontent, annoying, complaining, unworthy rodents. Edmond in particular is an obvious pain and i would not be misty eyed at all to see this little brat's existence come to thankful end. The older sister is annoying as well and there are several times during the movie where she was so annoying that you wished you could reach into the movie screen to ring her neck. I was not made to feel any sympathy for these two. The oldest boy, Peter was a bit easier to tolerate however still not worth a care. How could the viewer enjoy this movie if they didn't care for the main character's well beings? A very good question...<br/><br/>The story is seriously flawed and also share painful parallels to the triumphant Lord of the Rings movies. For example the death of their leader, who later is resurrected by questionable, and head scratching means. The big battle that seemed to be lost, suddenly saved by a last minute addition of troops. A character that does not wish to take their role as leader but afterwards taking up his sword and marching into battle... Please give me some credit... please give viewers credit... we are not morons, don't treat us like we are.<br/><br/>The inhabitants in Narnia also do no make much sense as they do not seem to be able to follow footprints. The White Witch (aka female Saruman) is all powerful, able to freeze anyone with a motion of her staff however fails to be able to dispose of a child who just picked up a sword 2 days ago for the first time. She forgets about all her powers and tries to swat him with swords. Which brings me to another point... how could children who were given weapons by Santa Claus and have had not previous training be able to battle in a war, be better able to lead an army into battle better then any soldier already in the army? Overall this movie was a real disappointment and falls short on many many levels.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"

","You can sum up this movie as children escaping one war only to find themselves in another and then striving to do their duty in the face of evil hordes who prefer winter to warmth.<br/><br/>As a movie it has its flaws - not least is a little too much chasing and event-skipping plus a feeling some of it was shot in a studio - but overall it is a delight mostly because of talking beavers, Tilda Swinton, Tumnus the faun and little Lucy Pevensie.<br/><br/>Don't worry too much about allegations of Christian undercurrents: the symbolism is there for those who want to see it but for anyone else, it's a good old unlikely-heroes-fighting-for-good epic."
"yadda_yadda_yoda","10","3","6","10 December 2005"," Exceeded my best hopes
","Let's face it, we all have hopes and expectations about books that we read as children and young adults. A lot of times, you might feel disappointed and let down by such, or, in the case of ""Starship Troopers"" you might even feel betrayed by its translation. This is not going to be one of those movies! I watched it last night and I am still in awe of the magic that they pulled off.<br/><br/>For it was truly magical. I felt young again as I watched the interaction between the Pevensie children, especially in their games and politics. I felt that the casting was perfect, especially for Lucy. The teasing and betrayal of Lucy by her older brother Edmund seemed very realistic. The dismissal of Lucy's ""fantasy"" of finding Narnia within the wardrobe was played well by her older ""boring"" sister Susan. But when they all find their way into Narnia together, it is a magical moment. Another such moment is when they first lay their eyes upon Aslan the lion, played by the voice of Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>The development of the characters was well done as well, from Peter's lack of self-confidence to his early development as a leader of the army, to Edmund's growth from a bratty, betraying boy into his role as a noble prince and hero.<br/><br/>The special effects were wonderful. At first you are awed by the talking animals and incredible scenery, but as time goes on you forget that they are special effects and just accept them as characters in the movie. This is one of the first special-effects-laden movies that I have seen in the last couple of years, in which the producers and director understand that lots of special effects do not take the place of a good plot or good acting.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie for the first time strongly pointed out to me a lot of the Christian parallels that CS Lewis wrote in, that perhaps were not as easily seen on the surface of the story as written in the book. The simple view is that Aslan, an innocent, decides to sacrifice himself to save a person who is not innocent. But Aslan's interaction with the children, particularly when Lucy and Susan (paralleling Mary and Martha) accompany him on his journey towards his death, Aslan's treatment (being beaten, humiliated, and shorn of his mane) before his death, Lucy and Susan's actions after his death, and his resurrection were more clearly spelled out in the movie than in the book. The only thing that was different was that they didn't go into much depth as to *why* he was resurrected (deeper magic, the Emperor Over The Sea, etc.) I felt that that could have been explored and explained in more depth.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that they decide to make all of the ""Narnia"" series into movies. Quite frankly, even though TLTWaTW is the most important book in the series, it is not my favorite by far. I look forward to seeing ""The Magician's Nephew"", ""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" and ""The Last Battle""! But if they release them one movie per year, it will be 2012 before the series is complete.<br/><br/>It's not as though he is a *tame* lion, after all."
"rostropovich2000","10","3","6","10 December 2005"," Excellent Movie
","It is rare that I enjoy a movie so thoroughly. CS Lewis' writings were a staple of my childhood. Any time the original BBC productions would come on PBS, I would be very much glued to the TV screen.<br/><br/>I am also an avid fan of Tolkien's works. I found that I was disappointed after going to see Jackson's movies. I did not feel the same way at all after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The movie retained much of the emotional weight that I think the LOTR's was lacking in. All of the moral lessons that were core to the book were also present in the movie without being preachy. The fact that the movie has ""a point"" other than just trying to tell a story makes it better than the great majority of movies released in Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>The story and the acting were excellent. I look at some of the Harry Potter movies (even the most recent ones) and I can't understand why those kids can't live up to the standard of acting set in Narnia.<br/><br/>There are few obvious faults to be found. The compression of the books' story line did not have a detrimental impact at all. The progression was natural and smooth and there were few changes that felt abrupt.<br/><br/>I look forward to reading through the papers on Monday to see the box-office earnings to try and discern if the other books will be made into movies (I hope so)."
"Geoffreylebowski","10","3","6","10 December 2005"," Perfectly done!
","I remember first reading the Narnia books when I was 7 and I have been waiting for Decades to see a live action film adaptation. I was hoping against hope that this film would do it right and all I can say is thank God for Andrew Adamnson and his team! I know art is all subjective and what one person likes another may hate but from a personal level I have not found a film quite this engaging for a very long time.<br/><br/>It can't be an easy book to adapt to film; It's full of talking animals, the main characters are children and half the cast aren't human. It must have seemed so daunting to try and do it right, but thankfully they have achieved just that.<br/><br/>The children playing the four leads were convincing and emotive; child actors should not be so talented. I really felt like I was watching four completely unique characters rather than four children. Tilda Swinton's White Witch has gone into my list of greatest cinematic villains of all time. A perfect balance between the beautiful and the evil. So menacing and scarily sinister. Aslan felt authentic (even though he was predominantly CGI) and I was moved to tears by some of the more emotional scenes.<br/><br/>Visually it was breathtaking, both in terms of the way it was filmed & edited and in the production design. It was immersing, engaging and wholly magical.<br/><br/>I have even more respect for Adamson and co. for daring to do this after the world of the fantasy epic has been over-shadowed by LOTR. How brave of them to tackle fantasy and battle sequences and how impressive to pull them off so magnificently. Also hats off for finally making a film that uses CGI responsibly (the way it used to be done five years ago) rather than in every shot.<br/><br/>I felt the film was rich in character and ideas but at the same time completely faithful to the book by C.S. Lewis. Although I don't generally like to compare book to film I know many do and rest assured this is a meticulous adaptation.<br/><br/>Ultimately it was everything I wanted it to be and more. It was an ideal bit of escapism that made me laugh and cry. Maybe I was just in with a very responsive audience but they were laughing along with me and cheering throughout the battle as well as giving the film a lengthy applause at the end (this is in a chain cinema remember). So feel free to disagree with me but I thought it was a 10/10 five star film and if it's the same team doing the other six films then I can rest assured they shall be just as magnificent."
"susansmk","10","3","6","10 December 2005"," This incredible film brought the book to life in a way I couldn't have imagined!
","I admit I was torn before seeing this film. LWW was my favorite book as a young girl, and I was thrilled to share the book with my son, who loved it too. When I saw that a film version was in the works, I was excited but nervous...how could anyone do this book justice? I was afraid that the film would never be able to capture the essence of the book, and I thought it was impossible for the images on the big screen to compare to the book's life created in my imagination. These fears coupled with the immense amount of media attention made me leery - usually movies can't life up to this kind of hype.<br/><br/>I'm happy to say I was wrong to worry. The film was pure magic - every moment of it. Just the right amount of emotion and humor combined to send me back to my childhood when first I visited Narnia. To experience this with my son was truly special - his excitement eclipsed my own. As we lived these adventures right along with the Pevensies, my son would reach over and grab my hand or tap my arm and smile as though we were experiencing a secret world that no one else in the theater could possibly understand. (Here comes a little spoiler for those who don't know the story...) What struck me most about the power of this film was the scene at the Stone Table and Aslan's death. I knew it was coming, I knew what happened afterwards, but still I found tears running down my cheeks as it played out. Incredible.<br/><br/>In two and a half hours, this film captured the essence of Lewis' Narnia without taking very much away from the original story. The additions made by the filmmakers enhanced the story without giving that obvious ""that's not what happened"" feeling that usually comes with adaptations. Go see this film...it's the first in a long time I can say is worth the price of admission."
"xdor","5","3","6","10 December 2005"," Shock and Awful
","It doesn't cease to amaze me how Walden continues to bring down great directors.<br/><br/>Holes, while I had never read the books, had the same stilted hollowness that they managed to infuse into the Narnia tales (and that's WITH Disney helping) and that film was directed by the same director as the Fugitive! (Around the World in 80 Days was a travesty against the original work, but it kind of worked since Jackie Chan became the main character) How does Walden do it? How do they manage to wreck such great material? Despite having Mr. Gresham on board, the writer/director/maybe even some of the actors miss the feel of the book. Maybe it's not possible to replicate that on-screen: ever. But they should have at least tried for a more serious treatment. This was way too kiddish: like it was made for the Chicken Little crowd. I was hoping for something much better, much more sobering.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Georgia Henley is the best. She was the life of the movie. But as a result, everyone else (especially Susan) came off looking a little stiff. It never seems that the characters get to change much. They start off as one might expect, but by the end it doesn't seem like they're much different except for those crown things on their heads.<br/><br/>The music was terrible. Pop-ballads done with a symphony sounds cheap. Where was the theme music?<br/><br/>The editing was terrible: unless you're just advertising to sell an extended version of the DVD. (Hey audience: if you feel unsatisfied, buy the real movie next year!)<br/><br/>The children should have gotten lost like they did in the book so we didn't have to waste time having Peter and Susan whining about going home the entire film (oh bother, we have to rescue Edmund first...) <br/><br/>Very little build up to Aslan. No build up to the war. Trying to be Lord of the Rings, but Narnia isn't Middle Earth and they should never have tried to make it that way.<br/><br/>The witch's wolves have American accents: why?<br/><br/>The worst thing was the loss of the intangible feeling of discovery and wonder of a world within a world. I don't know how hard it would be to create it (in some respects the BBC version still had this feeling), but if you're going to spend $120 million, you sure shouldn't leave it behind.<br/><br/>I think this comes down to bad writing and too many corporate milk-toast spines having influence. All you needed was a real screenplay (one that they apparently weren't willing to pay for since they went with the cheap just of school writer) and someone who was passionate about the story and the BE ALLOWED to tell it. With only three or four lines of dialog being from the original book, I almost doubted whether Walden had actually optioned the material from the CS Lewis Estate! Watching the film did give me hope for one thing: it may still be possible for me to remake it some day. True, I'm American and I'm overly critical, and it will be 30 years before anyone will even care to see it again: but after seeing this film: I want to try. I think that's what having British people write/direct this British work does. They can't feel the book, because the book is nearly everyday English life and they can't see how that's interesting. (Remember the book didn't do that well in England, the US is where Lewis got his child readers) But there's a whole feeling that as an American I get from the book that is essentially idealised English family life, something that many Brits can't stand anymore. There's nothing for them to do than try to update and ""modernize"" it away: but when, as an American, that's a large part of what I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Solution: have an American write and direct the movie, and don't let a single American have a voice on screen!"

The material has become more nuanced and compelling in it's transition from book to film, the action is very good, and Narnia is perfectly realized. The film, while enormously entertaining, is not perfect.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with the film is the spotty direction of the child actors. Georgie Henley is magnificent as Lucy, and Skandar Keynes brings some depth to Edmund (watch his face harden when he tells the others, ""I've seen what the Witch can do.""). Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell), alas, do not fare as well; they are stiff, awkward, and wooden compared to their siblings. Fortunately, this is only a minor problem.<br/><br/>What I'm really impressed by are the inhabitants of Narnia. Aslan (voiced terrifically by Liam Neeson) looks great, as do the Beavers, the Fox (Rupert Everett), and the assorted animals and fantasy creature. But especially the Beavers. They add greatly to the enjoyment of the film, and Ray Winstone and Dawn French are clearly having fun as the voices. Tilda Swinton is awesome as the White Witch, and she relishes getting a chance to play a figure of pure evil.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Adamson (both the 'Shrek' films) handles all this material nicely, even if the kids get a little annoying once in a while. 'Narnia' is no 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'; it's clearly intended for family audiences. This doesn't hurt the film, though, and it's a highly enjoyable fantasy adventure."

I think this film was able to capture the brilliance of Lewis' masterpiece better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was able to capture the brilliance of Tolkien's masterpiece. They are both highly deserving of great films made from them. I was highly impressed with LOTR when I saw them...but now that I have seen The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, I only wished that Peter Jackson could have done a little bit better...even if each movie had to be 4 or 5 hours long instead of 3. All of the elements of the story were there (and I mean just about EVERY element), the acting was wonderful, the cinematography was excellent, the special effects were superb and the music topped it all off. Up until this film, Walk The Line had my vote for the best film of 2005, but there is no way I can deny Narnia of that title now."
"co1997_3","10","3","6","9 December 2005"," The Best Film in Disney History
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe has been highly reviewed by top critics and especially by Christians alike. Walt Disney and Walden Media has depicted how a Christian should and should not live through the entire movie. The Wardrobe represents the door to each of our lives, The Lion (Aslan) represents Christ reigning in our lives, and The Witch represents everything the world (Satan) wants us to be, and Narnia represents the Kingdom that we will live in with Christ. These comments are not for the faint-hearted. These comments are for those who wish to read them and accept them. If Walt and Roy Disney were alive today, they would praise these comments and praise this movie as being the best and most inspiring movie of all time. Siskel and Ebert may give it two thumbs up, but Christians around the world that watched this movie today, give it roaring applause because it is within our own hearts that our Lord does reign within us. We may live in perilous times now but wait until we actually see the Narnia that we will go to. It is beyond comparison and beautiful. Andrew Adamson depicts in the movie of what that is at the end of the movie. It is beyond words and it is beyond comprehension. The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe will go down in Disney and Bible History as one of the GREATEST STORIES EVER TOLD."
"geebeegb1","10","3","6","9 December 2005"," Everything I hoped and waited for since I first read the series.
","I first read the Chronicles of Narnia when I was around 11. Since that time (many, many years ago), I have hoped for a big-budget version of this wonderful story. I am sure this great achievement couldn't have happened much sooner as the quality of the special effects needed to do the story justice simply didn't exist until recently.<br/><br/>The movie was well worth the wait. I was captivated from minute one and was so excited to see some of the scenes that I actually found tears in my eyes. Reliving the story, watching the characters, meeting the creatures, it was all like coming home.<br/><br/>The casting was great and was done by someone who obviously had read the books and knew the characters as well as serious fans know them. Tilda Swinton was fabulous as the White Witch and made the transition from the nice ""queen"" who ""snowed"" Edmund to the terrifying war waging witch perfectly. The children played their roles flawlessly, going from scared war ""orphans"" to mature royals saving their kingdom. I was amazed to see them at their coronation, seeming so grown up and seeming so wise.<br/><br/>The special effects were just amazing. The variety of creatures in the book were shown in such a real manner. I particularly enjoyed the method used to portray the tree spirits. None of the mythical beings were unbelievable and Aslan was simply magnificent, although I pictured him a bit larger. I did not pick up on Aslan's voice being Liam Neeson's, I merely knew the voice was familiar and his was a perfect voice for Aslan.<br/><br/>The battle scenes and some of the ""dark"" creatures may be too intense for younger children but this is a children's movie based on a children's story. However, most adults should find it enjoyable. It may be helpful for adults to be familiar with the series to really appreciate the movie. I recommend this movie for everyone with an open mind to fantasy and the age-old, good winning out over evil tale.<br/><br/>P.S. Do not leave the theater when the credits start rolling."
"sumday","5","3","6","8 December 2005"," Highly flawed.
","The good parts: <br/><br/>The character of Lucy was likable, and well acted(mostly). Dawn french is always a pleasure to hear.<br/><br/>The bad parts: The rest of the kids were a bit rubbish, truth be told. Most of the acting in this film was sub-par. I even thought Liam Neeson's voice acting was a tad forced.<br/><br/>Maybe it wasn't bad acting, maybe the actors were just given the worst dialogue in the history of the world. Yeah, that was probably it.<br/><br/>OK, it wasn't the worst dialogue in the world, but it was the worst dialogue of any film that i've ever seen. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should rethink their career. it sounded like something an illiterate teenager would rite(sic).<br/><br/>The cinematography was appalling... all the time. It even tried (unsuccessfully) to copy Lord of The Rings in places. Especially a bit when the kids and the two beavers are hiding under a big rock. The way this was filmed mimics the scene in The Fellowship of the Ring where the hobbits are hiding under the big tree root from the ringwraith. It is almost shameful to watch. thankfully, poor acting and a total lack of intelligent cinematography makes the scene devoid of tension.<br/><br/>Visually, the entire film (the bit in narnia, anyway) reeks of LOTR. But this is probably due to the similar themes that the two books shared. Yet, even when taking their inspiration from such great works, the people responsible for the style of the film miserably failed. It sometimes felt like this film had an extremely low budget.<br/><br/>The sets were poor. Watching LOTR, i barely ever thought to myself ""that scenery doesn't look real"", but in pretty much every shot of this film(again, while the kids were in narnia), i noticed how blatant it was that they were on a film set.<br/><br/>The cgi is mostly pants. Aslan was pretty damn impressive, but the beavers, the fox, the wolves... all the other creatures were unbelievable(in a bad way).<br/><br/>Speaking of the wolves, as the main antagonists for part of the film, they weren't scary at all. Even the ice queen wasn't scary. Mostly due to her inane dialogue.<br/><br/>The ""funny"" moments were about as funny as the rest of the moments in the film(meaning they weren't funny). <br/><br/>Children will no doubt enjoy the film regardless of (and oblivious to) the above observations. And that's fine. But if you are looking for something that will captivate and immerse the viewer like the LOTR trilogy did, keep looking. I've heard that new harry potter movie is quite good."
"Glandros","9","3","6","8 December 2005"," Enough to Pull In Old and New Fans Alike, of All Age Groups
","'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is a truly outstanding fantasy adventure. Based on the beloved children's book written by C.S. Lewis in 1950, it has enough to pull in old and new fans alike, of all age groups. While the film has been kept to a PG rating in the U.S. to remain children friendly, it is by no means meant to be purely for children. The book has seen three other adaptations: a television series, an animated film and a live-action made-for-television movie; this is the first adaptation to be released in theaters.<br/><br/>For anyone who may not know the story of 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,' here is a brief overview: Peter, Susan, Edmure and Lucy Pevensie are sent away from London during World War II, and come to live at the house of Professor Digory. Lucy, the youngest, finds a mystical wardrobe which leads her to another world, which the others don't believe her about at first. But soon all four come to the land called Narnia, and find that it is being ruled by an evil White Witch, Jadis, who has declared it shall be forever winter but never Christmas. To defeat her, they must join forces with Aslan the lion, true King of Narnia, and lead an army in a great battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson, who co-directed the first two 'Shrek' films, steps up for his first feature-length film and does not disappoint. The start of the movie is dark and moody, much like the attitudes the four children have. It isn't until Lucy's first visit into Narnia that coloring truly starts to lighten, helping Narnia to truly seem like another world. Adamson creates scenes that are beautiful and sweeping, and scenes that are disturbing and dark. And while he used enough action to make the film slightly more appealing to audiences, he never strays too far from the heart of the novel.<br/><br/>The acting is also superb in this film. Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch is a wonderful villain. She has proved before that she is a great actress, but she is truly at the top of her game here. She becomes the role, and makes Jadis so evil that you can not help but hate her. The four children, three of whom have never made feature-length films before this, are all outstanding in their roles as well. They make the characters believable, and display their faults just as well as their virtues. And the voice acting, especially Liam Neeson as Aslan, is very well done, making you believe these animals can truly speak.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very nicely done for the film. While some animals, such as the Beavers, are obviously done with computer animation, they still come off believable within their landscape. The work done for Aslan is especially astounding, having combined shots of a live lion with computer animation to create a truly magnificent talking lion. Richard Taylor's work, featured in 'The Lord of the Rings' as well, is obvious throughout the film with beasts hideous and beautiful, and magnificent armor and weapons. The score for the film is wonderfully composed and utilized especially well in the battle sequences.<br/><br/>There is one point I should address. The film is not obvious Christian propaganda, as some would paint it to be. Yes, it's true that the story has ties to Christian beliefs. But those story points are never pointed out as being Christian in origin. The religious context is no more than other epic fantasies like 'Star Wars' and 'The Lord of the Rings' contain, it just has slightly more bearing on the main focus of the story. Yes, you're bound to see Christian themes in the film, but they are themes that run in many stories, some predating the Christian belief system. Please do not let talk of religious themes affect whether you would see this film.<br/><br/>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is one of the first films to have an obvious influence from Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. While the idea of making an updated film version of the book has been floating around for several years, it was the popularity of Jackson's films that prompted this movie to be made. After Tolkien's books-turned-movies hit theaters, Walden Media opted to adapt all seven of C.S. Lewis' 'Narnia Chronicles' in feature-length film version. While 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is the only book optioned so far, it seems likely that Disney will at least make a trilogy of movies, if not adapting all seven books.<br/><br/>I look forward to see what else they do with the series. This film, while perhaps not quite reaching the epic status of 'The Lord of the Rings,' is a great movie to see. Beautifully done, with great action, adventure and drama, it truly is a fantasy film for all ages. While it may not be the best fantasy adventure to date, I can't imagine it possibly being better adapted than it is. For that, I gladly give the film 9 stars, and recommend it as a must-see this holiday season."
"soulheart86","9","3","6","7 December 2005"," A Superb Film!
","I just put this film together for the Friday opening and what a treat it was to watch. Almost right away, you will be whisked into this incredible fantasy world with some of the best scenery and graphics sense ""Lord of the Rings"". The soundtrack accompanies the film well adding a great depth to this magical land. The acting and voice talents of many characters were also done exceptionally well in my opinion. With all those elements added together you get a wonderful film you will be engrossed in from start to finish. However, It maybe a little too much for really young kids to follow. The screenplay seemed to follow C.S. Lewis's masterpiece nicely. A very moral and uplifting story about good triumphing over evil with a biblical twist. So if you're between 8 and 108 check it out; I don't think you will be disappointed!"

","First lets get one thing across. 'Epic' movies are not created by great effects alone. It takes a great story and flow to create a good movie. This had neither, considering what it had to work with.<br/><br/>Now, I've seen the BBC version of this movie, and if you can stomach the effects of the time (and budget) you'll understand why it's a way better movie. They took the time to go through and develop the story properly, the 2005 edition is nothing more than a jazzed up movie trailer; you get the point, but for the most part its not a full story.<br/><br/>The movie jumps around from action scene to action scene, the way i'd expect bad boys II to do, but no flow to it whatsoever. I mean, how can you take a teenage boy who can barely wield a sword and accidentally kills a wolf to being commander of an army of 5,000 or so going up against an army of 50,000 and still not die? It wasn't believable in the slightest and I say BURN IT!"
"didi-5","9","5","13","11 December 2005"," very good realisation of a splendid book
","17 years after the first attempt to translate The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe into a live action film comes this big screen treat from Andrew Adamson, previously best known for Shrek.<br/><br/>CS Lewis' book deals with four children, evacuated during WWII to the home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), who find a magical world inside a wardrobe in a stately home. This new world is populated by mythical creatures (fauns, centaurs, satyrs, and dwarfs) and talking animals, and is ruled by Aslan, a Christ-like figure in the person of a talking lion.<br/><br/>Narnia is in the grip of the White Witch, the self-styled Queen Jadis (played by Tilda Swinton). Curiously if all 7 books are to be filmed the story of how Jadis came to be in Narnia has been missed out (this is told in book 1, The Magician's Nephew, although The Lion... was written first). It is always winter and never Christmas, and there is a mysterious prophecy that states that the White Witch will lose her power when two boys and two girls sit on the thrones of Cair Pavarel.<br/><br/>Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the quartet who find themselves placed to fulfil this prophecy. As such they have to carry the film, and are not bad in doing so. Little Georgie Henley as Lucy and William Moseley as Peter are very good indeed; Anna Popplewell as Susan and Skander Keynes as Edmund less so - but watching four children could easily tire the patience of an adult viewer and they were pleasing enough to watch.<br/><br/>CGI is employed to produce the battle sequences and the talking animals. Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson, is an impressive creation, but others - the beavers and the fox - are obviously fake. None of the other animals or creatures (save the centaurs) are sufficiently magical in the way characters in the Lord of the Rings series were; although the film more or less keeps to the story Lewis wrote, and James McAvoy puts in an appearance as an impressive Mr Tumnus.<br/><br/>The screenplay does contain some howlers ('Gee up horsey' 'My name is Philip') but is basically very good. The soundtrack is largely modern, save an Andrews Sisters number early on (just to remind us we are in wartime no doubt). Thankfully someone resisted the temptation to follow the lead of the stage show which turned the book into a musical! What Adamson does well is to show us how the children develop to their new lives in a strange land. They meet the demands of battle and learn to cope with new friends and new dangers - the police are vicious wolves, Father Christmas stops to give them weapons of war, the Wicked Witch turns her enemies into statues; and there is the ritual sacrifice on the Table of Stone.<br/><br/>A promising start then. I look forward to seeing other instalments in the series and hope this film is a success."
"danaljefferson","1","6","17","16 January 2006"," Horrible Storyline and Film
","Unlike many of the people who have reviewed this movie, I have not read the book. In fact I was unaware of the book. So I'm speaking from an average movie goer perspective. I thought this movie was horrible and long. The storyline was basically a rip-off of several scenes depicted in the bible. How people say that it isn't a Christian allegory is beyond me. Very simple. Edmund is the Judas of the family. The White Witch Jantis the Devil. Aslan was supposed to be Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>According to the bible, as I know it, when Jesus is crucified, he was first humiliated (i.e. crown of thorns), then stabbed by a spear. Afterwhich the ground broke in two and a momentous storm took place. (i.e. God showing his displeasure). This is paralleled in the movie when Aslan sacrifices himself to Jantis to save the life of Edmund. Before she sacrifices him on an alter, she humiliates him by cutting his mane. (i.e. The lions crown, showing his right as king). Then she and her demons laugh as they throw the mane around for the fun of it. She then kills him w/her dagger.<br/><br/>This scene is then followed by the two girls crying over Aslan (i.e. Mary and Miriam I believe, crying over Jesus). He resurrects himself in front of them first. (same as bible) then proceeds to resurrect the dead that Jantis kills. He then has the final kill on her.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but this story doesn't impress me....its a ripoff of the bible over and over again.<br/><br/>Besides that the movie is slow and boring. I had to catch my self from nodding off numerous times. The cinematography is horrible. Like the scene where the kids are riding on the horse or something (cant remember) and you can tell they shot the scene in front of some kind of background. The lighting on the kids hair didn't match the scene they were in.<br/><br/>I also found it amusing that the faun is a ""friend"" in this movie. Kind of a twisted joke for normally the faun represents the Devil.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is very dark. And is a clear ripoff of LOTR. The Orks are everywhere under Jantis crew. The battle scenes boring and monotonous.<br/><br/>The storyline didn't make sense. It just seemed to jump around a lot to me. Not to mention this is not a kids movie. I took an 8 year old with me and I'm just hoping she doesn't have nightmares after this one.<br/><br/>You've demonic characters flying around and ritualistic sacrifices taking place. How this was not at least PG13 is beyond me.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money!"
"yevonwm","1","6","17","15 December 2005"," Shockingly Bad
","This is the worse movie I've seen in a while. I was hyped up to see it and really looking forward to it but it was just so bad i had to walk out and this is the first movie I've ever walked out on. Things that were wrong with this movie :- *Shockingly bad child actors that are precocious beyond humour *Ridiculous over-emphasis on the boring elements of the plot - everyone knows that they walk through a wardrobe, why did it take 60 minutes for them to do so? *Completely transparent special effects - you can quite blatantly see that the first horse-man was just a man with brown trousers on. *Enormous portions of the movie where there was no music and the kids were just talking crap.<br/><br/>Where's Peter Jackson when you need him? :( I cant put into words how bad this movie is compared to what it could have been.<br/><br/>Hats off to Tilda Swinton (White Witch) - she was up to scratch and had a go at saving this farce but it just wasn't enough. Unfortunately Liam Neeson (Aslam) just sounded like a wise nanny.<br/><br/>Expect to be bored stiff & expect young children to cry with boredom."
"knutsenusa","5","4","10","10 December 2005"," Where to start?
","This movie is probably better suited for someone who did not see the original TV series or read the books, or someone who is simply far younger than myself.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the young actors playing the leading roles (maybe with the exception of the youngest one), seem stringent in their performances and are unable to deliver the dialog in anything close to a believable manner. It all really feels like you're watching an elementary school play that happens to be better than the average school play, but it just doesn't cut for a film. In the case of ""Peter"" and ""Susan"", I believe it's a downright case of bad casting. There are plenty of kids out there that can act better, and certainly fit these roles better in terms of looks and demeanor. The fact that the whole movie theater broke into laughter when ""older Peter"" showed up at the end of the film looking like Ted McGinley in the 80s, may give you an idea of casting problems.<br/><br/>Then there is the director. Where to start? First of all; he doesn't take his time. He just doesn't let the story develop in a natural pace throughout the piece. He lets it breathe for a good half-hour to forty five minutes, and from there it's a race to the end. The characters develop skills and attitudes at such an incredible pace that the story implodes on itself. You're left with questions and confusion. You never see ""Peter"" grow to the task of becoming a king. It is mentioned to him at one point, and suddenly he is a king and a warrior!? And by this point you are bombarded with over-sentimental moments when you in fact have not been able to develop any kind of feel for the characters. The director, whoever he is, has a couple of things to learn about story-telling.<br/><br/>And of course there are the endless effects and CGI created characters. And I have to say I'm impressed by some of the characters. I only wish there was a little more time spent of attention to detail. There's a ridiculous amount of shots of the characters talking in front of a green-screen (with some grand landscape inserted), and it just doesn't look convincing at all. Why haven't directors figured this out yet. DON'T shoot close-ups on a green-screen with a landscape backing. And while I'm at it, what is with these constant close-ups and generally awkward shooting. Use your close-ups sparsely! And where is the darkness? Where is the fright and contrast between good and evil? Where is the excitement? And where is the enchantment that the book and the TV series leaves you with? God help us if Shrek-man is to direct the follow-up....<br/><br/>I could go on for hours, but let me summarize: For the greater second half of this movie I had one thought in my head: Why didn't Peter Jackson direct this? He would have made it what it should have been. It's a fantastic story that I have a great deal of affection for and Jackson should have been the one to tell it."

","I had the misfortune of being able to see this film yesterday and not knowing anything about this film going in, I walked out wondering if I had just came from a church play of some sort. Wow, and after I researched a bit online it became clear that my instincts were accurate in that 'churchy' feeling that I had felt coming from the screening. This is definitely the religious worlds attempted counter of 'Harry Potter'. I heard they are wanting to make 7 of these Sunday morning church plays. I can only hope that is untrue. Please, by all means may this have ill fortune at the box office so we won't have to endure a 7 year brain washing escapade. <br/><br/>The special effects were decent in this film, however the character design is severely lacking any creativity. I mean.....never-mind I won't go on, but let me say it almost embarrassed me. The direction and editing of this film were also average, nothing to praise. They did their job as the director of a soap opera or or lifetime show does, by the book. The children's acting....well, it is children's acting so no valid complaints there.<br/><br/>If you want to numb your child's brain for a couple hours then by all means take them to this. I am sure they will enjoy seeing the MGM lion prance around, or a Buffalo looking Minotaur stumble about in front of children acting in front of a blue-screen. However, if you want to enhance your child's mind with any sort of creativity, then take some time out with them and read a book."
"iain_mossman2","4","5","14","8 December 2005"," Sadly Disappointed
","I went into this film as an avid fan of the book and having read some very promising reviews, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, these expectations were dashed by the film which pushed the biblical allegory a little hard in your face and fell short of providing visuals equal to the Lord of The Rings trilogy, to which so many comparisons could be made. <br/><br/>Character-wise Tilda Swinton was absolutely fantastic as the white witch. She came across so intensely and so mysteriously that you couldn't help but get drawn to her, and her eyes were so deep and hypnotic! For me, she swept the floor with the Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) who throughout never really convinced me that his was necessarily the right side to fight for... <br/><br/>The children in the 4 main roles all performed better than I had expected them too: The pick of the bunch was undoubtedly Georgie Henley, who's eyes captured Narnia's magic and it's fascination for children. I was a little disappointed with William Moseley as Peter, who didn't have as much physicality about him as i had imagined him to have, and at times seemed a little weak.<br/><br/>For me the films main failing was that for it's budget some things seemed to be rather strapped for cash. Costumes for example, there were several occasions where i cringed at the awfulness of what the children were wearing. And another example was that sitting side by side with some fantastic special effects, were some shoddy bits of costume and make up: This was most obvious amidst the white witch's army towards the end, who seemed to be more a bunch of misshapen plastic headed humans than mythical beasts. <br/><br/>And despite of some subtle and classy moments of humour, that pleasantly surprised me, although i should have known better seeing as Adamson was the director of Shrek (!) Adamson failed to deliver the scenic grandeur of Narnia that was so impressive in Peter Jackson's vision of Middle Earth and which set the benchmark of what to expect from a fantasy epic. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly I'm sure most people will love it, it's faithful to the book, the characters are in the most part believable and amiable, and children will love the sheer magic and imagination, and the talking animals; but for me it lacked some of the style and panache of Lord of The Rings, and it lacked the atmosphere I had imagined Narnia to have..."

"bmck-1","4","3","7","9 December 2005"," Disappointing
","I suppose that loving the books at 7 years of age does not mean you are going to like the film as an adult.<br/><br/>There are a lot of aspects of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe that I found very disappointing, not the least being Aslan. From his first appearance the computer generated aspects seem obvious - something odd about the way he moves. Also, they did not manage to solve the problem of how to make him speak and his mouth was quite distorted. I did not like the voice either, myself, though others may love it. Was the film made on the cheap, or was it simply made 20 years too soon? <br/><br/>A number of ""enhancements"" hindered rather than helped the story. When the children emerge from the Wardrobe, the expressions on their faces and the photography suggest that they have come out into some kind of wintry wonderland, which is overdoing it a bit, as the winter is supposed to be associated with evil. It is not obvious who the old man in the sledge is, as, unlike in the book, he is not wearing a red coat. The crowning at the end owed more to Star Wars than C.S. Lewis. And why did they decide to have Susan moaning about going home all the way through? <br/><br/>Putting in the air raid at the beginning gave some useful background, although the several reminders of the war back home were another innovation, presumably intended to draw a parallel in terms of the fight against evil. Maybe it was also intended to draw a parallel with the fight for oil in Iraq (the airplanes attacking the good guys, the ugly faces of the enemy, who deserve no quarter ...). Hmm, don't go there.<br/><br/>Dawn French gave an excellent voice to Mrs Badger.<br/><br/>I am reviewing this as an adult. I would recommend the film for children under 10 (though I am suddenly a bit worried about its propaganda intentions) but certainly not for grownups."

","Who wants this film to satisfy? For parents the story is far too naive, but even children won't take the lies and false editing. Every single drop of blood was cut out, even in the huge battles. I mean, o.k. its a movie for children, and I admit that Potter 4 was far too cruel for children under 12, but come on, every child did already hurt itself once and do know that people bleed. What do they want to make the kids believe, that even if you get a sword rammed inside your body, you just hold it, as if you have bellyache. And, warning spoiler, the Santa Claus gives the children weapons on Christmas for war!!! Great! But the best was still the image of the unicorn used as a horse for battle. This movie was from beginning filled with such idiotic images, which I hope even kids will see through. I still give three points for the amazing landscapes in winter and some exciting and funny moments with the speaking animals. Some are very well animated. But for the rest, it's hard to bear."

","Apart from many things I could mention (bad acting, no action, no development of the characters), it's the music that really killed it. It's simply too modern and midi-like. In the first scene everything goes smoothly, but right from the moment Lucy goes into the world of Narnia... everything fails. The characters, the story, even the world itself are unbelievable and completely artificial. And it's no even about the CGI (which is quite OK). It's about the believability of the story.<br/><br/>What struck me the most was the artificiality of behaviour of the kids - Lucy tapping the faun like she was what? 30? 40? Completely unbelievable for me, sorry.<br/><br/>So don't waste your money on this one - go check on BBC's series instead: maybe the FX is silly in comparison, but at least there's what I call MAGIC."

","I saw this movie and let me just say, I am stunned. Stunned that ANYONE, let alone so many people, could possibly ever give this movie a good review. Lacking in any form of subtlety, grace, or anything resembling acting, I literally found myself watching the film through my fingers at times in sheer disgust and disbelief. The theater broke out in laughter often, although not at any point where the film attempted to be funny. I am truly amazed that this low-rent, thinly-veiled bible regurgitation made it into theaters. I can't believe I didn't walk out. Every single actor was awful, and as for the special effects being good in any way--that is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. The blue screens were so bad at times as to provoke aforementioned theater laughter. A complete piece of garbage that should only have been shown late night on the Disney channel. My hate of this film occupied my conversations for days."
"JPfanatic93","5","2","4","23 September 2013"," How to convert kids to Christianity
","Obvious attempt by Disney to cash in on the sudden popularity of the fantasy genre in the wake of the fantastic Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. The trick seemed simple: take a book from a well known fantasy series and adapt it into a sweeping epic of a film, and build an easily exploitable franchise around it. Granted, this first Narnia film did pretty well at the box office, but remains maligned by critics the world over and is an altogether feeble movie based on the classic book by C.S. Lewis. During WW II, the four Pevensie children are sent to live at a big mansion on the English countryside, where they discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a doorway to the fantasy world of Narnia. However, this realm is in the grip of a severe ice age because the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton doing a good job at playing a ruthless villain) rules the land. The coming of four human children means the dawn of a return to peace and prosperity under the benign rule of the lion god Aslan (voice by Liam Neeson), but the White Witch doesn't surrender her regime so easily and a grand battle for the freedom of Narnia erupts, with the Pevensies at the heart of it (fortunately Father Christmas equips them with the necessary deadly tools to kill their opponents: good job, giving weapons to kids!). Laced with extremely obnoxious Christian overtones (including the annoying parallels between a certain carpenter/magician and Aslan, who dies for the sins of another but is resurrected), this movie at many turns feels like it means to convert us to Christianity, while it's also a poorly acted - especially those pesky kids and a vast array of irritating digital talking animals - and humorless piece of work that takes its fantasy concepts a little too serious, which seems an odd move for director Adamson, who previously delivered two superb Shrek films. The audience, apart from Christian fanatics who obviously loved it, quickly grew tired of it as they demonstrated by making the sequel Prince Caspian do quite poorly at the box office, after which Disney swiftly abandoned the franchise, selling the rights to Fox, where its right wing religious overtones were more at home. Still, general interest in the franchise remains low."
"tsheridan94","2","2","4","27 February 2010"," This was really pretty bad
","As a general rule of thumb, it's best not to try to take a timeless classic novel and try to convert it to the big screen (unless you happen to be named Peter Jackson.) Last time I checked, Andrew Adamson wasn't Peter Jackson. I liked Shrek and all, but the book that, admittedly, really funny movie was based on was by no means a timeless beloved classic. While I do not believe that Narnia books are nearly as brilliant as they commonly made out to be, I still have to give C.S. Lewis credit for making books as a segue into fantasy for the children too young to read the actual classic fantasy series The Lord of the Rings. So while I do feel that Narnia books are very over-rated, I can still see their worth in introducing 4 and 5 year olds to the genre (and seriously, 4-5 is about the age level these books seem to be written for.)<br/><br/>However, the movie adaptation takes the books' unengaging, repetitive nature, and then goes on to disregard all the values that made the books at least worth the paper they're printed on. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe adaptation attempts to be a poor man's Lord of the Ring. It keeps true to the books for the most part, but Adamson interprets what is not specifically specified in the book and tries to recreate the epic battle sequences found in both the Tolkien and the Jackson ""Rings"" trilogies. For example, in the novel version of ""The Lion, etc."" the final battle lasts somewhere around a page and a half. Along came the movie, and WHAM! 25 minute battle scene, anyone?<br/><br/>The fact the book was made into a movie at all was also a bad decision. The book is very slow, and takes it's sweet time in causing anything to happen. With only the two Shrek movies under his belt (and stuff was continuously occurring in those. Shrek is the definition of never a dull moment) Adamson has no real experience making anything with long slow bits of dialog that seems written by George Lucas (and no, that's not a compliment.)<br/><br/>The acting in the film wasn't horrible. It was a darned sight better than in that cinematic piece of crap called Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Now there's a film that makes a Uwe Boll movie look like manna from Heaven. Comparatively, simply because the acting was completely atrocious, this film seems about on par with one of his. I'm not saying the acting was genius or deserves any special awards. On the contrary, it was quite forgettable. But therein lies the key. Bad performances, as well as brilliant ones, can be remembered for long periods of time. I guarantee that whatever you've heard about this movie, good OR bad, the conversation probably did not revolve around William Mosely or Georgie Henley, or any of the other actors. They are not memorable in the slightest.<br/><br/>So on the plus side, this movie didn't have me debating the merits of destroying a movie with nuclear weapons simply so future audiences don't have to sit through it and current audiences are put out of their misery. However, this came about as close as you can get to the point. Actually, Im being unfair. This movie is the perfect sleep aid. If you know any insomniacs, and Lunesta doesn't work, they may have found their perfect sleep aid. I know I did. And then, unfortunately, after the good night's sleep I was granted, I had to watch ""This film that involves something to do with a gigantic carnivorous cat, a warlock, and a big closet"" again. I did not fall asleep this team, and I was able to come to terms with how much of a cinematic turd this really is. It's just not the worst turd in existence. And that's a back-handed compliment if ever I saw one."
"chrsaldrid","2","2","4","25 January 2008"," Too much contradiction
","The fighting and overall theme was good, but the plot was bad, I think. ""I can't think of any way to give these kids any kind of power, so I'm just gonna have Santa Clause come along and give them a bow and arrow and a sword that's not even magical and that they hardly ever use. Oh, and all the creatures are going to be from either Greek or Roman mythology, nothing is going to be of my own creation except for this big field with a few mountains called NARNIA."" Yeah, I thought it was kinda lame. CS Lewis could have been more creative. The book is only like 80 pages long. Clearly, CS Lewis wanted to write it as fast as he could and not take his time to make it great. The loop-holes in the plot are as big as the solar system. He gives absolutely no reason for all that's happening other than a prophecy being fulfilled. Okay. But, as far as the battles go, I liked it."
"wheeeeyay","3","2","4","15 July 2006"," Terrible.
","If you read the book when you were a child and loved it, I suggest you avoid this film. (Especially if you are British, as it will annoy you intensely.) It's nice-looking, and the animals are fabulously done; if you like to marvel at how good CGI is these days, it might be worth seeing some clips. But as a rendition of the story, it's just soulless and not very much fun. As far as I can see, the only reason to watch this would be to poke fun at it afterwards, and even that's not massively entertaining. Ten reasons to avoid it:<br/><br/>*(minor spoilers)*<br/><br/>1) The music, which sounds like it came from a cheap library disc of the school of bad sub-Clannad pseudo-Celtica. I see many bargain bins in its future. <br/><br/>2) The tragically wooden child actors, with the exception of Skandar Keyes, who did a fairly good job with Edmund. Hate to say it of someone so young, but the actress playing Lucy had only two facial expressions - a grimace which supplied both happiness and tearfulness, and a sort of smirk for practically everything else. Susan appeared to have come out of the cupboard in which Hollywood keeps a constant supply of zombie child actors with huge, overly lipglossed mouths, and was infinitely forgettable. Peter was slightly less generic but snoresomely bland, and why on earth was he holding his sword like a gun? <br/><br/>3) The tacked-on opening scene, which was yawnsomely clichÃ©d and probably responsible for killing the music budget. It also caused me several minutes of stress while I thought we'd paid for the wrong film.<br/><br/>4) The tacked-on window-breaking scene - which sorry, soooo wouldn't have happened. These are nice, well-brought-up, polite, honourable 1940s children. They would have stood their ground and owned up immediately. Lucy and Peter, especially. <br/><br/>5) The American WOLF. Argh, argh, argh, there just aren't enough arghs in the world for this one. It pretty much killed the whole thing for me, and has probably caused small tornados in the vicinity of poor Lewis's grave. <br/><br/>6) The tacked-on waterfall scene. Utterly pointless and annoying. Bored now. <br/><br/>7) Father Christmas. Not dressed as Father Christmas. If you hadn't read the book, you'd probably have had no idea who he was; he appeared to be some random old bloke who liked giving out presents. <br/><br/>8) Liam Neeson: why?!! Star Wars buffs in the casting department? Only big name available at the time? Who knows. Aslan spoke, and everyone in the room immediately said 'Oh, that's Liam Neeson.' Spellbound by the majesty of the great Lion, not. There are probably hordes of unemployed Shakespearean actors who would have done a far better job for half the price. And if they really felt a desperate need to make Aslan Irish, they should have gone the whole hog and used Ardal O'Hanlon in full Father Ted mode. At least I'd have got a giggle out of it. <br/><br/>9) Tilda's hair. Oh dear. Jadis, Empress of the Western Lands, as New Age crusty? I think not. Can't decide whether wardrobe had been watching the Matrix sequel, or old Slits videos. As for the battle-scene hair, which appeared to be reconditioned from Jareth's in Labyrinth; it actually looked quite awesome, but I was really disappointed when the expected blast of death metal never happened. I like Tilda, but alas, only her hair was scary. And Jadis, you know: meant to be scary.<br/><br/>10) In short: it's basically before-the-watershed-MTV Narnia. Might make nice wallpaper if you turn the sound down. :)"

","During the height of the London blitz, four young children are sent off to an estate in the countryside to wait out the war in safety. Ironically, they soon find themselves caught up in a quite different war, one that takes place in a world not their own. For while staying at the house of an eccentric professor, the youngsters discover a magic wardrobe that leads them to a mystical land of centaurs, fauns and a whole host of anthropomorphic creatures - a snow-covered land called Narnia. The kingdom is ruled over by a wicked witch who declared herself queen after she usurped the throne from a benevolent lion king named Aslan, who is amassing a rebel army to help him reclaim it. The children become a part of this epic battle since it has been prophesied that four young humans will arrive some day to bring about the liberation of this benighted kingdom.<br/><br/>Based, of course, on the beloved C. S. Lewis novel of the same name, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" does pretty well in its setting-up stage as the youngest of the four discovers the strange land inside the wardrobe and tries to convince the others of its existence, but once the children become firmly entrenched in the Narnian action, the movie begins to feel too much like a warmed-over ""Lord of the Rings"" with a lot less action and far less interesting characters. Aslan, in particular, is so drippy and sappy, so full of bromides and platitudes, that we have a hard time getting misty-eyed even when he's heading up the stairs to perform his act of ultimate sacrifice. Speaking of which, the Christian allegory at this point is so heavy-handed and obvious that it ceases to function as allegory and just becomes slavish imitation. And the scene with Santa Claus passing out weaponry and ammunition to barely pubescent children - how is that an acceptable image in a movie meant for youngsters? The film has a beautiful look and design, although some of the special effects shots look surprisingly amateurish and unconvincing for a film of this size and budget. The acting by the children is passable at best, although Georgie Henley, as the youngest child, and James McAvoy as the faun, Mr. Tumnus, do establish something of a rapport in their scenes together. Tilda Swinton as the Big Bad Witch does little but harrumph around the countryside, glaring and snarling.<br/><br/>I realize that both the book and the movie have legions of devoted followers and any attack on either is bound to elicit cries of ""sacrilege"" and ""blasphemy"" from the faithful. But, the truth be told, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is a pretty mediocre movie, pleasant to look at but boring to sit through."
"chris101258","6","2","4","8 April 2006"," Not what i was hoping for.
","I have just finished watching this film and i have to say i am somewhat bemused by some of the comments i have read. I found the film entertaining but only just, it was slow starting and never really picked up any kind of tempo, the battle scene was disappointing, special effects were OK but nothing special and at one point, a scene were the queen is seen sledding across a frozen lake, this was quite false looking. It is in my opinion poorly directed, the scene with Aslam dying on the sacrificial slab with Susan and Lucy looking on was a prime example of this, more should have been put into this scene and the two girls would have been far more traumatised to see what was happening. This is not comparable to the Lord Of the Rings trilogy in any way. Peter Jackson would have made a far better job of directing this classic tale, lets hope for better on the next instalment, although i do not hold out any hopes.<br/><br/>6/10 and i feel i am being generous."

","I typically do not prefer to watch fantasy or sci-fi films, but out of respect for C.S. Lewis, I saw this one right when it came out. It was above my expectations. A movie can never be as good as the book because of the limitations on a movie that our human mind does not have. Nonetheless, it captured my attention while telling me a positive story that is enjoyable for nearly all ages.<br/><br/>The 1,000+ people who rated this film as awful (1 out of 10) probably cannot accept such a powerfully positive message considering the majority of today's films are so dark and negative.

Personally, I could not disagree with this notion more staunchly, if I wanted to. I strongly disagree.<br/><br/>It's not that the religious tones are overbearing, or that they are not kept well enough out of the limelight...It's that, if you are not reading them into the story, then you are left with the sense that there should be more there...that the story should be better fleshed out, than it is.<br/><br/>...and, this is a good lead in to the flow of the movie...which was great, during the first half or so of the movie, but, then degenerates into this experience, where you are simply having ill explained scenes hurled in front of you.<br/><br/>If you know the basic story from the book (I do), then it may not be such an issue to you...but, if you are walking into the theater thinking, ""I'm leaving any preconceptions at the door...I simply want to be treated to a good story"", then this simply does not work well.<br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is badly uneven, and it suffers for this.<br/><br/>The acting is passable. Nobody will win an Oscar, I'm sure, but, nobody was abysmal to watch, either. The two younger children, are quite cute, and delightful to watch.<br/><br/>As to the general viewing experience, I found myself genuinely sucked in, and enjoying it...but, I was constantly enjoying it by, ""in the moment"", bits and pieces...not so much so, as a larger, connected story.<br/><br/>...In fact, it is the ""connected"" aspect, that is such an issue to me...This movie feels disjointed, from one scene to the next, in a fair amount of it. I feel like I connected with some of the scenes, remembering and anticipating what was about to happen, but once the scene ended, it was like being plucked out of one world, and plopped down into another world...to enjoy that scene for what it was, and plucked away again.<br/><br/>It just did not work, as an over all story...Something is missing, and you can tell.<br/><br/>The movie feels epic, in some regards, but fails to fully flesh out an epic tale.<br/><br/>Children of all ages may quite enjoy this movie, regardless...It's a matter of taste, preference and forgivability.<br/><br/>Personally, being someone who has experienced this story from both the religious and the atheist perspective, in both book and movie form, I find myself in the awkward position of knowing and understanding the religion influence, accepting that it is there, yet still wishing it were different, and seeing this is an ultimate downfall of the movie.<br/><br/>...and the awkward thing, is that I still enjoyed it, and would likely recommend it to others, who are fans of the books. The movie has good nostalgia value, in my opinion."

","Growing up, I loved reading the Chronicles of Narnia series, and I was worried that Disney would ruin the central religious allegory aspect of the book. However, I didn't know that C.S. Lewis'stepson was one of the producers, and he ensured that this movie stays true to the book. Tilda Swinton is the perfect White Witch, the scenery is stunning, Liam Neeson is great as Aslan's voice, and the children are just as I imagined they would be. I thought Mr. Tumnus would be older than what he is portrayed to be in the movie, but other than that, the movie was great. The opening scene with the bombers attacking London almost made me cry, and that only happens when I see a great movie. You can hardly even tell that the animals are digitally animated! The special effects add a dimension of fantasy to the movie that I haven't seen since ""The Neverending Story"" came out in the mid-1980's. Overall, ""Narnia"" is a motion picture masterpiece that will entertain and enthrall both children and adults alike. However,I would recommend that children under the age of 10 be accompanied by a parent, because some scenes may be a little mature for them. In addition, I recommend reading C.S. Lewis' novel before you see the movie, because otherwise you may not completely understand the story."

In the two hours of the movie we get everything from the actual book including a couple of areas of ""fleshing out,"" like a little bit of back story of the Pevencies and some reasoning for Edward's bratty behaviors. Aslan is truly realistic in the way the CG teams make his features emote, just as he would in our minds' eye when we read the book. His roar is, fierce, his sensitivity is touching. In his face the audience knows what he is trying to convey. All in all the movie brings to life a story so full of adventure and beauty, only before seen in our imaginations.

The other star of the show is Tilda Swinton as the white witch. I can't remember seeing a better bad guy/gal on the silver screen recently. Sometimes the obvious Christian undertones bothered me but you have to remember when the books were written. Otherwise the story is pure class.

While the digital lion, beavers etc are fabulous creations, they're no more believable than the (very sophisticated) puppetry and costuming used in the earlier films.<br/><br/>It looks too much like ""The Lord of the Rings"" and some elements are just ludicrous (Gandalf the extraordinary wizard riding a horse at speed without saddle or bridle is believable; a London schoolboy doing it in full armour is just silly).<br/><br/>I don't want to include any spoilers, so won't say any more.

","I never read the Narnia books as a child. Maybe that would have helped. I respect author C. S. Lewis as an imaginative Christian writer - his slim volume The Great Divorce is a tour-de-force of theological speculation. But this movie - yuk. Most of our UK atheist reviewers of the film tore into it for daring to slip a Christian message into the cinema. As a Catholic Christian, I would have welcomed that but in fact, it wasn't there. Instead there is a strangely mawkish, sickly-sweet analogy for the Redemption that made me feel quite uncomfortable. To me - the Christ Event of the Gospel is challenging enough without these layers of colouring-book story-weaving. I hope children will enjoy it though. I've gotta remind myself it's for them."

The problem with this movie is it seems VERY, VERY, VERY Rushed, where as LOTR spent years trying to recapture Tolkiens world of Middle earth, Narnia seems to have taken the blurb you get on the back of the book and created the film off that! The story is told at a frenetic pace and at 140 minutes long that's quite a feat, but even if they had made the movie longer and told the story better with these pathetic child actors in charge little could have been done to save this film. Peter the eldest and supposedly smartest of the bunch is totally unconvincing and his fight scenes are almost comedic, Little Lucy is just plain annoying rather then endearing & cute, Susan is very pompous more so then her character in the book and the one person who has the most material and characterization to play with fails miserably as a weedy unconvincing troubled young boy, Edmund, but at least he plays the cowardly part right. Liam Neeson provides the voice for Aslan and does his wise old man routine seen so successfully in Star Wars & more recently Batman, Mr. Tumnus played by James McAvoy from ""Shameless"" fame does well but the relationship between him & Lucy seems a bit too false, where as in the book it was well written. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch the ""bad guy"" so to speak in this movie, and she does OK, but I think anyone could play this character as she has to look quite monotone & emotionless, almost wooden in her performance to pull it off, so stick a wig on Keanu Reeves and you'd get the right effect! The Beavers are by far the most entertaining characters along with the wolves but don't get nearly enough screen time, instead we're left looking at Peter holding a sword in an attack position looking like a complete donut for half the movie. My biggest gripe with this movie isn't how he hasn't made a good interpretation of the book, its the poor makeup & costume of some of the characters, the visual effects are excellent, CGI and all is good, but some of the creatures like the half horse half men, the Minotaur's (bull heads) and other creatures look like they are straight out of a TV serial that got cut after the first episode, just imagine watching the making of LOTR and seeing all the Orcs, Goblins, Uru-Kai's, Dwarfs & Elves masks made up by the crew that went horribly wrong and were thrown into the scrap heap, its almost like the Narnia crew snuck into this scrap heap and took what they could !<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the books, save yourself the torture, and read it again, or watch the old cartoon or old BBC TV series, this is so bad how Disney hopes to have started off a Lord of The Rings or Star Wars legacy is beyond me, this is more the start of something like Police Academy then anything else!"
"Baldrick44","6","2","4","2 January 2006"," OK, but that's all.
","Narnia is a OK movie and it will entertain children from ages of about 10-15.<br/><br/>However what must be remembered is CS Lewis was a good friend of Tolkien, the man whose books were recreated masterfully by Peter Jackson. One gets the nagging feeling that Lewis wanted a different interpretation than the syrupy tripe that Disney manages to offer.<br/><br/>Firstly, the two eldest children are not even endearing for 2/3 of the movie and it makes the idea of empathy and being brought along this world with them all the more difficult. The character development is thin, with the idea of Peter suddenly becoming the hero that he is, isn't really explored.<br/><br/>Secondly there is the idea of casting. Tilda Swinton doesn't seem all there as the White Witch and doesn't seem as menacing or masterful as Voldermort, nor as drunk with power as Saruman, and it is somewhat difficult to see how she got the power in the first place. However, the animals are good and Jim Broadbent though underused, is good as the Professor.<br/><br/>Finally there is the Americanised tripe that Disney seemed to plow in just to please. This comes in the form of Santa Claus, who turns up to give the children presents ( in the form of weapons ). There are more scenes like this one and it truly takes away from what could have been a great film, but instead seems to trip over itself.<br/><br/>This is no Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, and nor should it have been seen as such, but while these two movie franchises had intricate plots, great casts and memorable dialogue as well as Spectacular, but not OTT effects Narnia drowns the audience in syrup and it only half comes off as it at the expense of characters and plot. A shame , as this could have so much more..."
"hdervic","4","2","4","2 January 2006"," Disney Cashing in and Then Some.
","Peter Jackson's Masterful Lord of the Rings trilogy opened a flood gate of fantasy ripoffs and wannabes. Disney's Narnia is no exception. When the storyline is not paralleling a biblical narrative it glosses over any attempt at fleshing out any of the characters, who are two-dimensional at best. The only exception is Tilda Swinton's White Witch character. One of the best scenes is the Pagan sacrifice ritual, where I was able to feel something other than the movie's sugarcoating on my teeth. The movie is beautiful to watch. And given a chance, the remaining cast seem capable of creating memorable characters. I like the beavers, too; the female beaver's voice is none other than the enjoyable and funny Dawn French from the Vicar of Dibley and French and Saunders. Otherwise this film's main achievement is to help boost Disney's revenue at the end of a lackluster year for the film industry. I dread to think that there will be six more of these Disney interpretations of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Series."
"maestrojon","6","2","4","1 January 2006"," Great for kids, but not for a serious film buff.
","First of all, I was amazed at the number of reviews that praise this film as one of the greatest of the year, and even though I am highly outnumbered, and my opinions may not be popular, I feel they must be stated as a contrary to what everyone else is saying.<br/><br/>This movie is not a literal interpretation of the beloved C.S. Lewis book, and while he was a devout Christian, C.S. Lewis denied that the similarities to the story of Jesus in the Chronicles were intentional. Douglas Gresham, artistic and creative director of the C.S. Lewis Co, and C.S. Lewis' stepson has said ""If you want to, you can find Christian symbolism in a McDonald's hamburger,"" (http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/1105narnia1105.html).<br/><br/>This movie takes advantage of the subtle Christian symbolism the book offered, and has brought it to the forefront, often adding in its own twists, such as the visual of the ""Footprints in the Sand"" poem at the end of the film. There is no problem with this, and Walden Media can do as they wish, as they have the rights to the film adaption, but I felt this is something that is often ignored in peoples reviews of this film.<br/><br/>Here are some quotes from other reviewers.<br/><br/>""The acting was excellent and the special effects set a new standard for Hollywood"" The acting is decent, but in no way excellent. It appeared to me to have been over direction of the children on the part of the director. Perhaps, he is not comfortable working with children. They did a decent job mind you, but every action, and emotion they conveyed seemed forced. It just seemed obvious to me that they were being walked through each scene by the director. I was also disturbed by the lack of worry for their brother ""Edmund the Afterthought"" throughout the movie, but especially when they are told of his, and their potential fate.<br/><br/>With the advancements in CGI over the past couple of years, this movie was a huge letdown. The glaringly obvious moments were during the standoff with the wolves. Watch as they jump down the hill. They seem to have forgotten to shade the characters all together. Azlan was the exception to this for obvious reasons, he was very well done. It also would have been nice if they added some cold air effects coming from the mouths of the children when they're in the snowy winter of Narnia. Due to the acting inconsistencies, I just never believed that it was actually cold outside.<br/><br/>""The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody."" I am a fan of Harry Gregson-Williams, but felt the music was inappropriate, and out of place. If I listened to this on its own, I think I would really like it, but I felt it just didn't fit. The song at the beginning of the movie was WAY out of place, and almost laughable. You can always count on Disney to try and add a pop-culture touch to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie for families and for kids. Children, who typically could care less about special effects flaws, and bad direction, will be in awe of this film. It is worthwhile to check out this movie, but it would probably be more enjoyable if you brought some kids along."
"nosaintjerome","6","2","4","30 December 2005"," Lavish adaptation---ALMOST great.
","Here you have just more than HALF of what it takes to make a great and enduring fantasy film. Great look and sound--but an unfortunately lacking script, and dull acting. Great children's entertainment, but without the adult element that would deepen it. (Only Tilda Swinton plays her role at an engagingly adult level that also works for the kids.) Lewis's original books worked, as Roald Dahl's books work, because they don't talk down to the kids, who recognize B.S. better than anyone.<br/><br/>Quality of script and acting are more important than lavish sets and effects--films like Neverending Story and Princess Bride proved this. When the most intriguing screen presence is the villain (Tilda Swinton's toned-down but unnervingly creepy White Witch), the balance of the story is in trouble. Just think how much you could root for emotionally engaging heroes like Atreyu, or the eccentric gang from Princess Bride, or that motley gang of kids with real personalities in Spielberg's The Goonies.<br/><br/>So, they got half of it right. Really right. Unfortunately, it's the less important half.<br/><br/>* * * <br/><br/>Script problems include leaving out crucial details that give the plot events meaning, a general dumbing down (in the book, for example, Lucy protests reasonably enough that they have to stay in Narnia because ""it's on my account that Mr. Tumnus is in trouble""; the film dumbs it down to a four-year-old wide-eyed ""But we HAVE to help MR. TUMNUS,"" without explanation; et cetera). The Father Christmas episode, which has rightly been called off-putting in the film version, was less awkward in the book because Santa provided a merry meal as well as murderous weapons, plus a sewing machine for Mrs. Beaver, and it all seemed less abrupt.<br/><br/>Pacing problems include dialogue that stretches out with hypnotic languor even while leaving out helpful details; you'll be left begging for another implausible action sequence. <br/><br/>Acting problems include the general blandness of the main characters, despite the sweet screen presence of Lucy, (you'd think even well-bred British children would exhibit some astonishment at entering another dimension; their indifference works in the book, but not on film), and a general failure of actors to inhabit their roles. Even James McAvoy, one of the better actors as Mr. Tumnus, could have avoided the uneasy ""molestor"" dynamic by playing the faun as eccentric and slightly blithering, as in the book, as opposed to the quiet, wry intensity he brings to the role here.<br/><br/>And on and on. The main problem is a lack of characters we really identify with or care about.<br/><br/>Unlike many viewers, I enjoyed the build-up to the Wardrobe; the air-raid sequences and the leaving of home were emotionally engaging (Mrs. Macready was an entertainingly sharp presence), and the sarcastic dynamic between the bored children actually made for some believable interaction and characterization."
"b2z2","3","2","4","28 December 2005"," am I missing something? ""minor spoilers""
","There must be something I am missing about the movie. It makes very little sense to me and maybe things are explained better in the book. I have no problem accepting a magical world through a doorway, a noble lion that rules a kingdom and such, but please don't tell me a evil witch/queen who knows of a prophecy of her demise involving 4 ""children of Adam and eve"" does not have the sense to kill one as soon as she had the opportunity. And the ""idiot Queen"" had multiple chances to save herself by killing one of the children. This so called Queen then proceeds to miss read some fine print on an old law and can't even do a proper killing. Not to mention under her employment is the most useless pack of wolves in existence. They couldn't even injure two defenseless girls in what seems like 30 minutes of time?! The leader of the pack then falls on a sword and kills himself?! And about these ""kids"", they falls in a frozen river and shakes it off like it was a dip in a tub? they'd turn into ice cubes,and not the rapper/fake actor either. Then with what seems like an afternoon of sword training, these ""kids"" are out and hacking about on a battlefield?! Are you kidding me?! at least give me the ""he ate the battle skill apple"" or something. The list go on and on with these stupid happenings that make no sense to me. I know this is a children's story, I know it is fantasy. But please have some basic logic and realism. I am sure the ice is still cold in Narnia, I am sure the Queen dosen't want to die. Then please act like it. That my rant on this so called epic movie. I hope the book was better.<br/><br/>so turn your brain off and prepare to get retarded when entering this picture."
"Andreas_N","7","2","4","22 December 2005"," Wonderful fantasy adventure, yet there are some flaws
","I have never read the original artwork by C.S. Lewis, so my review can by no means assess how true the movie actually is to the original.<br/><br/>The movie itself does have some weaknesses, fair enough. I am used to rating movies due to their logical coherence and substantial quality, and both is to be criticized here. Yet the actual transformation is only one aspect. I approve of the underlying themes and the messages that are conveyed, and this makes me award Narnia with a solid 7.<br/><br/>The story is simply outstanding and inspirational by all means. This is of course due to the books and not something that can be credited to the movie's producers. The fantasy and the power of magic that pervades the story might make any child's eyes gleam in admiration and amazement. This needs to be appreciated and makes Narnia a nice Christmas movie.<br/><br/>The characters are somewhat indifferent, save for little Lucy played by Georgie Henley. The two male actors in particular seem a bit overcharged with the movie's scope. They act decently in a way that would definitely suffice for a movie of lesser dimension, but they lack to vitalize their characters with the emotional depth and convincing authenticity that would be absolutely necessary for the audience to establish some sort of relationship to them as characters. This is probably due to a lack of sophistication in terms of the kids' acting skills. Maybe the casting department should have chosen more experienced actors instead of utter newcomers.<br/><br/>Okay, having criticized this aspect I have to say some good things about the visual accomplishments. The movie is an eye-catcher in terms of wonderful visualizations. I think it is fair to say that the visual outfit does justice to Lewis' perception of Narnia. The creatures are wonderfully designed and seem so vivid as they could have possibly been.<br/><br/>The real reproach of my review is the coherence of the storyline though. I do concede that it is a challenge to process something as huge as Lewis' Narnia, but the story lacked considerable logic sometimes and was sort of elusive. It seems to me that the producers wanted to jam as much input into the story as possible, which hampered the natural development of the plot. How can you expect the two boys being good at fighting with their swords in a huge battle? Why are the main characters rejuvenated when they re-enter the wardrobe? In addition some scenes were indeed very corny and too stereotyped for my taste - even young kids can expect a bit more. The deep emotions were not really convincingly conveyed, which brings me back to the unexperienced actors.<br/><br/>The reason for giving Narnia a 7 is the magic of the whole movie. Talking animals, magnificent landscapes, funny dialogs, themes of redemption and courage - this is something to be appreciated, as it might inspire children and adults alike. The whole movie might have been a bit too childish, okay, but it is not that bad as a whole.<br/><br/>Still, there would have been many ways to make Narnia better. It is a pity that both the cast and the producers were not really able to live up to the scope and the possibilities this unique story provides."
"scottlukaswilliams","8","2","4","13 December 2005"," Always a King
","First, Tilda Swinton was extraordinary as Jadis. She was terrifying yet gorgeous in a way that reminded me a bit of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. She is an actor with magnificent screen presence which was well-exploited by Adamson. The young talents were all quite good too. Georgie Henley (Lucy) was adorable and William Moseley (Peter) was very strong too.<br/><br/>The photography is terrific. I had to look up Donald McAlpine but I wasn't surprised to find that he also shot Peter Pan and Moulin Rouge which both looked amazing to me. It was just mythic, epic and magical enough to be perfect for the subject matter. I'd very much like to review the BBC's 1988 version because I have a vague idea that Adamson and McAlpine borrowed a couple of shots directly from it which is kind of cool.<br/><br/>I think C.S. Lewis would have been happy with the creature designs and the CG animal characters. They certainly capture the spirit of the words he wrote. It's all about the titanic struggle between the forces of good and evil and in good Christian-fashion, most of what's evil is ugly. Though it's rather obvious what is CG and what isn't they did a good job at making the creatures fit into the world with the actors. Hair and fur are one of the most difficult things to replicate and they had tonnes of it to do here. I think it turned out rather well. A few of the CG shots could have been replaced by puppets or animatronics to give a more realistic look but overall, I was happy with the balance.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia inspire me. They are collectively one of the greatest volumes ever written in English or any other language and I am thrilled that they are being brought to the silver screen in such a grand fashion. For Andrew Adamson's first live action film this is an incredible achievement. I can't say I loved Shrek but Adamson was clearly as inspired as I by Lewis' writing. It shows in the filmic tribute he has created. Well done.<br/><br/>One final note, the music in the film is wonderful. There seem to have been a few composers involved and they all deserve congratulations. Also, the credits feature a couple of beautiful songs by Imogen Heap and Alanis Morrisette. In a time when I've more or less stopped buying CDs, I can't wait to get my hands on this one."
"barnabyrudge","8","2","4","12 December 2005"," Good attempt to give a much-loved Narnia story the ""epic"" treatment.
","The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe had already been filmed twice prior to this 2005 version, once as a rather mediocre cartoon in 1979 and once as a modest-budget BBC mini-series in 1988. It had never been done on a grand cinematic scale though, possibly because of the phenomenal expense and technology needed to bring it to life in a manner true to the essence of C.S Lewis' book. The catalyst for this latest attempt to tell the story was probably Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy. Having seen in Jackson's films what could be done - what monsters could be put on screen, how epic battles could be realised, how fantastical worlds could be visualised, and so forth - the folks at Disney decided that the time was right to have another go at this Narnia favourite, only this time they've thrown a mega amount of money at it, as well as every type of visual trickery under the sun. The result is certainly a stirring and well-made piece of entertainment, and easily the strongest adaptation of the story thusfar.<br/><br/>During WWII, four children are evacuated from bombed-out London to an old mansion in the countryside. They are Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgia Hanley). The mansion belongs to an old professor, and the children are warned by his crusty maid that they must behave perfectly whilst in the house. Pretty soon boredom sets in, and the children decide to play hid-and-seek to pass the time. Young Lucy chooses to hide in a wardrobe, but she gets quite a surprise when she finds that the wardrobe is actually a magical entrance to a fantasy kingdom called Narnia. One by one, all the children find their way into Narnia via the wardrobe, and they discover it to be a kingdom locked in a permanent state of winter by the evil magic of a powerful witch (Tilda Swinton). The witch has long ruled over Narnia, turning all who oppose her to stone. However, she has always feared the words of an age-old prophecy that states her reign of terror will come to an end with the arrival of four humans in her kingdom. Afraid that the children are the four humans of the prophecy, the witch deceitfully lures one of them - Edmund - onto her side and tries to turn him against the others. Meanwhile, Peter, Susan and Lucy travel across Narnia, evading the witch's wolves every step of the way, and eventually meet the mythical lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) who prepares them for the final battle against the witch and her monstrous army.<br/><br/>At 2.5 hours, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a well-rounded and well-developed film, though perhaps a bit too long for very young audiences. The special effects work is pretty impressive on the whole, with a convincing gallery of beasts and some magical sets that really capture the child-like wonder of Lewis' stories. Some of the CGI effects in the battle scenes are a little obvious and detract slightly from the spectacle. The performances are good on the whole, particularly the four young actors and Swinton as the despicable witch, plus James McAvoy as the faun Mr Tumnus. One thing, however, that I found really unconvincing was the way that novice swordsmen like Peter and Edmund managed to cope so well on the battlefield.... surely the witch's army would have despatched with the pair of them quite comfortably if they'd fought so inexpertly?? It is an enchanting tale which has stood the test of time, and thankfully the scripters have stuck to the story faithfully in most aspects. On the whole, The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a good, solid family film and a long overdue effort to do a version that is worthy of the source novel."

","Leave it to Disney to ruin a great book/ story/ movie. C.S Lewis' genius was reduced to a barney movie. Instead of all the expensive cheesy effects, green screen and bad animation they should have paid for a better director and script. All the meaningful moments were glossed over and none of the characters were believable. The fight/ action scenes were like a bad video game, none of it seemed important. In the book you see the characters evolve and you believe these kids when they transform over time into kings and queens, fighting minitars and such. Leave it to Disney to not have faith in the kids in the audience and us and dumb everything down. When did our society completely loose faith in the intelligence and depth of our kids? Seeing children's movies like these makes me want to vomit because of the trash we are feeding our kids minds. What happened to the jungle books, lord of the flies, the Narnias, the wrinkle in times, and lord of the rings Etc.? Stories and productions meant for kids but not dumbed down for 2 year olds. The book is so incredibly better than this film; it's embarrassing. Lord of the Rings hit it on the nail, this missed it by a football field. to bad Warner Bros didn't do it. the director should be shot and the mouse should be hanged. i was very much hoping this would be great and unfortunately it was a huge disappointment. this was more of a Disney TV movie of the week instead of a major motion picture. i wanted an Oscar movie i got a movie that wouldn't even get nominated for an emmy."

","I just saw the cut down version (age 6, cut down from age 12) and was somewhat disappointed. Thats mostly because from the trailers I expected a fantasy movie and not a movie for children with fantasy elements.<br/><br/>It is said the movie is true to the books, which are intended for a younger audience. So thats it. But being true to a book should never be a factor in judging a movie. If one wants a true adaption, thats like having an audio book with pictures - better read the book in the first place.<br/><br/>So I will only rate the movie, and not being a kid (or a fan), the movie could not quite live up to my expectations of an entertaining evening.<br/><br/>I am sure if I had seen this as a 7 year old I would have been swooped into the story, but as an adult I just see a lengthy non fantasy prelude with character development of the 4 young and unwilling heroes, a well made first contact scene between fantasy creature and normal girl, again some lengthy zig-zag till the story seems to get a direction which turns out to be a not-to-bad-for-a-kids-movie battle scene. Not to forget the obligatory reward scene and the return to normality scene.<br/><br/>For (young) kids this should be a great fantasy film to begin with. For older audience it's a little more difficult. Just because you liked other kids movies this does not mean Narnia is the right kind of movie for you."

I actually was expecting it to be just another simple fantasy movie for kids. Yesterday I watched it and I had a big surprise. It's just a wonderful movie !!! I see many people will be comparing it with LOTR, mainly because the same company was responsible for all visual effects in both movies, but while LOTR exceeds a bit over Narnia, it has its own original charm and mood. Many people may dismiss this movie due its obvious Christian references, moved by their prejudice against Christian values and culture. The movie may get some bad reviews due to this particular feature, but it's a big mistake. Apart of that, this is a beautifully-told, engaging and interesting fairytale history, with amazing visual effects and good characterization. I was pleased to see this movie, it totally beats my expectations. No one should miss it."

","I went to this movie very worried that I would be given a lot of P.C. Hollywood junk, especially since this is a Walt Disney Movie. However, I came out of the theater over joyed with how they stuck to the books original messages and themes. Aslan still lays down his own life and is resurrected, not healed or magically fixed as I feared would happen. Anyone who has read the books will also be happy to know that a lot of the dialog comes directly from the books. All of the actors are tremendous, and fit what I have always pictured them to look like. The only character I found flawed was Mr. Tumnus, the actor was very good but I fear he just looked to young and should have had a more grandfatherly feel. I saw distinct similarities in the war scenes of this movie and the LOTR Trilogy which seems logical as WETA Workshop did both. I did feel however that too much emphasis was placed on the war, and not enough maybe on Aslan's salvation of Edmund and all of Narnia. Overall I would recommend this movie to everyone, just know children under seven might find some scenes rather disturbing."

I really think that would have summed the movie up a lot better. I also liked the Minotaurs (although the talking horse just went too far). I also liked the war a lot better than in the book (in the book it took up like a page and a half). The wolves were also cool, but they talked too much making them seem over animated...

","I went to see this movie with some trepidation, having seen the damage done by some number of screen adaptations of my favorite literary works. I left truly impressed. The movie is extremely faithful to C.S. Lewis' book, and has included all significant portions of it. The children's characters are reasonably developed in the acting and display the range of responses appropriate to the roles. Lucy at first seemed too young to me, but as the movie developed, I realized that my mental image from the books was probably less accurate than that which guided the casting of the movie. Special effects were quite competent, and even the cameo roles were very well done. I particularly liked the Professor. If you are a fan of the books, be sure to stay through the credits to see the last cameo exchange between the professor and Lucy. I hope that this movie is sufficiently successful that they will be encouraged to bring some of the other books to the screen. Highly recommended."

My hopes were one of the highest and without a simple shred of doubt they were met and them some. The movie added new and exciting features that without, might have lead to a ""I know what's going to happen"". The white witch was stunning! All the costumes and special effects brought any child's imagination alive. At the end of the movie I was surprised- the whole audience started to clap and cheer.

"wanderer26","9","2","4","10 December 2005"," Wonderful adaptation and well worth seeing
","Quite simply, I thought The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a brilliant movie. I would give it 8.5/10, but since you can't give halves here I've given it the benefit of the doubt. I'll explain my rating: <br/><br/>1. Unfortunately, as much as I've tried to resist, Hollywood has ""gotten"" to me, and I found the first 1/3 of the movie a big lagging--I'm afraid I've been brainwashed into wanting action, as much as my heart desires non-action. 2. Apart from that, I wasn't very happy with some of the plot discrepancies (ie wolves with the fox, river/ice scene, and Edmund meets Tumnus in ""prison""), although of course it could've been a lot worse. 3. Although in general the acting was fine, at times it did seem rather stilted to me, but for four children I thought they did remarkably. 4. The last thing that bothered me very slightly was (which comes with plot discrepancies I suppose) the omission and addition of certain lines. These were nothing major, however.<br/><br/>As to things I liked: 1. At first I was afraid that they were severely watering down the religious message too, which would really have bothered me, but it turned out that they didn't, and keeping in mind this is first and foremost an adventure story, and shouldn't be pushing the message in anyone's face, the slight toning down I felt worked well. 2. Surprisingly, the soundtrack--it seemed out of place at first, but I realized within a short while that I really liked the contrast (from jazz-hide and seek scene- to Enyaesque to epic, it all worked for me). 3. The fear that they would go for the epic ""look"" (in the vein of LotR, Gladiator, etc.) was my biggest concern, and based on the trailers I was afraid they would go with that. I was very pleasantly surprised that they didn't, and it remained beautiful in its simplicity. 4. The CGI--what can I say? In the trailers, I thought some of it looked a bit fake, but on seeing the movie in its entirety I was blown away by the realism of all the animals, and in particular the beavers. 5. Surprisingly, LWW turned out to be fairly ""artistic"" too, yet it wasn't so artistic that it could in any way be put in that genre alongside movies such as Garden State for instance, and I felt the balance of the ""artistic"" element with down-to-earth simplicity was handled excellently.<br/><br/>I suppose I would've given it a slightly higher rating if it had met the standards I outlined above, but overall I was delighted, and it certainly surpassed everything I expected of it. Having said all this, I'm not a film critic, so I'm in no position to judge it based on its ""artistic"" or filming/directing/producing merits--I'm simply basing this opinion on my own enjoyment of the film. Highly recommended."
"annie421","10","2","4","10 December 2005"," Best movie of the Year.
","I LOVE this movie. I mean I love the books so I was a little hesitant when I heard the reports of the film makers having changed it so much. I was very surprised that the changes actually made me like the movie even more! I mean they stuck true to what CS Lewis originally thought up. Only adding to the story to help with the baseline. Even cooler is the fact that this stands alone as a great movie and people can stop comparing it to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It can stand alone in movie History as another great addition to the fantasy genre. And regarding the fear that it might be too ""Christian"" as a lover of the series and A Christian I was also pleasantly surprised that the film makers didn't detract from the original allegory without stressing too much on the fact that its not a Christian movie. The story is an allegory. I saw the context but that doesn't mean that it should only be seen for that. It's a wonderful story and and a wonderful movie that every one should watch. I just hope the filmmakers are smart enough to make all seven."
"daughter_of_the_egyptian","10","2","4","9 December 2005"," Childhood fantasy comes to life!
","Words along do not justify this movie but I will do my best. First off, if you are a parent and thinking about bringing a small child under six there are a few scenes that might frighten the child or may not be suitable. There are a few frightening moments as well as intense battle scenes. Still it is a film that is very enjoyable and in the theater I was in there were several small children. (One parent behind me was explaining to the child the battle scenes to make sure the child didn't get scared.) For those never before introduced to The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe the movie does a wonderful job at explaining the story line so you can keep up with fans of the books and BBC versions of the film. For those who are fans of the books, this movie will not let you down! The special effects in this film are simply amazing as well as the costumes and makeup. Mr. Tumnus is charmingly handsome and Aslan is amazingly real. The actors, both real and animals/animated alike reach out to you and really make you feel like you are in Narnia. The acting was brilliant. Georgie Henley (Lucy)was adorable and the perfect Lucy while William Moseley (Peter)was more than astonishing.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for everyone. For once you can forget about the worries of our own world and live in the magical world of Narnia."
"jaredmanly","10","2","4","9 December 2005"," Grand Movie.
","When I first read the books I knew that neither Narnia nor Middle Earth could be done on film. Happily...computers make things easy now. Pretty true to the book...which means its better than good. Can't wait until the next one. Its quite a ride...without being as unwieldy or outlandish as Lord of the Rings. Lets face it...Tolkien created a story that is a bit hard for people to watch if they don't already know whats going on. This on the other hand...crystal clear, and simple with out being stupid. More subtle than Lord of the Rings...and the authentic article when compared to Rowling's rip off. People will complain about its religious overtones...but I seriously doubt they will go to it anyway. And if they do...they likely will enjoy it if they allow themselves to sit back and watch the movie. Oh well...their loss."
"smadude","10","2","4","9 December 2005"," Magnificent overall, left me waiting for the next movie.
","This movie is excellent. The acting was perfect all around, even (and especially) from the young Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley). Tilda Swinton does an excellent job portraying the merciless witch and her passion for power. The scenery was very realistic and enthralling, as was the battle scene that was fast paced and exciting. The only thing about the scenery I found to be a little distracting was that the vast majority of the snow in the film was very obviously fake, but it is not as if they could have used real snow. The special effects and battle scenes were magnificent, very visual and satisfying. There were a few liberties taken throughout the movie, but they always worked out to be better than those scenes in the book (for instance, instead of the four children being chased into the wardrobe room by a Mrs. Macready who is giving a tour, they are running from a Mrs. Macready who is tracking them down to reprimand them for destroying a suit of armor with a stray Cricket ball). There were also liberties taken in the plot line (which I shall not give away) but they made for a smoother run of the plot as a whole, and did not stray far from the book. Actually, the movie was faithful to the storyline almost to the ""T"". There are a few scenes that could use a bit of introduction (such as the Hunting of the White Stag scene, where we suddenly discover the four children as kings and queens many years later, left to assume much, or the fact that they never say ""Father Christmas""'s name, so one who has never read the book is hesitant to believe that he is Santa Claus), but the transitions overall were very good. All in all the movie came out strong and held to the plot very well, utilizing a perfect cast and excellent designers and direction. It left me waiting for the next movie.<br/><br/>Before you leave, make sure to wait about a minute for a short clip of the Professor discussing the wardrobe with Lucy."
"MovieZoo","8","2","4","9 December 2005"," Chronicles of Narnia; one for the books and the movies!
","The only thing that kept me from giving this a 10/10 was acting by the 4 siblings. I thought, for the most part, they did a good job but too often I found myself squirming in my seat because they irritated me due to their lack of acting skill. They were still lovable though.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie is better than Harry Potter movies when it comes to fantasy. I found the movie more pleasing and fascinating than HP - less dark and disturbing. The story itself is dark and so goes the movie, but because it was easier to follow, I was more interested and less bothered by the darkness.<br/><br/>I loved Tilda Swinton's performance as the White Witch. She was evil and believable. While it may not happen, she deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it for everyone who doesn't require the site of sex and/or violence to get enjoyment from a movie. Those who remember when movies had moral messages should also enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>BTW, the CGI was fantastic! Very well done, and I do not believe I have seen a CGI lion look so real. All the other fantastic creatures looked as good as my imagination's version when I read the book as a child.<br/><br/>Loved it and give it an 8/10"
"guikrazy","10","2","4","9 December 2005"," This is one older Catholic woman who LOVED this movie!
","Now, I first read the books some 30 years ago when I was around 9 years old. The books drew me closer to Jesus than any religious class did! I was anxiously awaiting the release of this movie. I was somewhat apprehensive because I was worried that the movie would deviate drastically from the book and also how Aslan was going to be portrayed. There is still a childish part of me that hopes that if I am blessed enough to go to Heaven, Aslan will be the first person I see and I would be able to run my hands through his mane. Well, my apprehensions were for naught! THIS MOVIE IS EXCELLENT!!! I TOTALLY BELIEVED that the ASLAN on the screen was the ASLAN from my childhood. Plus the casting of all the children, but Lucy in particular, was SUPERB!!!<br/><br/>I really hope that people don't get too caught up in the religious theme of this movie. If you are Christian and it appeals to you on a religious plane (like me), then fine. If you are another faith and you like the movie for the adventurous plot, then fine. To have arguments of faith that I have seen here (the name calling on the message boards), has nothing to do with the spirit of the movie or the books. If one has read The Last Battle, one must remember that Aslan explained that he was taking a Calormene into the Eternal Narnia because the Calormene was truer to his version of God, then some Narnians' were to Aslan. <br/><br/>THE ONE THING I MUST SAY TO PARENTS: I was actually surprised how violent this movie actually was. It had its place, but I don't know if little kids will be able to handle it.<br/><br/>Bring on The Magician's Nephew or Prince Caspian!!!"

","This was and is the best movie of 2005. I cried almost all the way through it. Andrew Adamson has done an amazing job creating a Narnia that would probably exceed C.S. Lewis' imagination. I was immediately drawn into it. William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Georgie Henley, Skandar Kynes, and Tilda Swinton all did an amazing job performing their character's actions, attitudes, and even looking like them. I have to say that Aslan was the most convincing ""person"" in the film. I hope this film is nominated for an Academy Award, because it deserves several. This film will become a classic, and will last as long as film lasts. It was one of the most heartwarming movies that I have seen in a while. Since I have read all seven Chronicles of Narnia, I was particularly excited about the movie. It exceeded even what I had imagined would be in the film. I love The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, and I give it 10 stars!"

","I'm not at all religious, but have always loved the Christian allegorical aspect of the stories...they say a lot about the time in which they were written and about Lewis.

Wonderful story, very true to the book, fabulous special effects, incredible performances by the children.<br/><br/>I do feel this movie bordered on PG-13, and there were a LOT of howling scared 3 to 6 year olds in the theatre.

The scenery is amazing and best of all is faithful to CS Lewis' work. The few scenes that were added only added to the story. <br/><br/>As for those worried about the Christian allegory you will only find it if you are looking for it. I personally took an interest in that subject and felt it added to the movie for me personally. However, if you do not wish to find it you will still enjoy the adventure of the Pevensie children.

","Well I have returned from a midnight showing and I think there is an actual contender to dethrone Mr Potter this weekend. It has been stated before that this is a family film because it appeals to all ages and I could not agree more. The movie has a certain charming magic that makes it more than bearable in the ""kiddy"" parts and when the action occurs, it is very entertaining. I know there are a lot of comparisons to Lord of the Rings, well I won't bother. They are two separate movies and are good in their own rights (Well...ok...LOTR was vastly better). Stil the soundtrack was nice and beautiful, the acting-all around (from the witch, to the children, to Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan) although the best performance goes to the Wardrobe (haha-indeed!). It's a fun movie, perfect to watch anytime of year, but definitely should succeed during this Christmas season."

","The acting was fairly dead-on for the children. (Seriously, how would YOU react at 12-14 years old if someone started addressing you as ""Your majesty."" and expecting you to fight a battle?) <br/><br/>While some of the creature animation early on is shaky (almost enough to jar you out of the movie), most of the later scenes appear to be spot on, save for some close-ups of Aslan on the Stone Table. At that point, the effect of the magnificent animation was broken, and it looked as though they were using a pile of gold felt. <br/><br/>Though a repeated viewing will tell more, by the end of the film, I was in stimulus saturation.<br/><br/>All in all, I liked the film.

"actorguy213","9","2","4","9 December 2005"," Beautiful! Fans of the book will be thrilled!
","I just saw the film and I am thrilled! If you are a fan of the book you will not at all be disappointed. I've noticed some criticism of the Harry Potter Films because of changes to the story. We mustn't forget that for a film like The Goblet of Fire, a 734 page book had to be compressed into a screenplay with slightly over 100 pages. Give them a break! Luckily for the screenwriters of Narnia, this book is infinitely shorter. As a result, hardly a moment from the book is missed. A few adjustments in the timing of events adds to the drama and shapes the film, otherwise, there are few things to be missed from the book. If you are not familiar with the book, don't worry. Everything that you need to know is there and that which you aren't meant to know until reading or seeing the other books is not there. Just enjoy the movie and stop asking your friends who've read the books about the lamp post. They know why it's there. Go pick up ""The Magician's Nephew"" if you REALLY want to know! The cast is spectacular. First, WETA Digital has triumphed again! I won't say they outdid themselves, because topping their amazing work for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy would be incredible. However, they have created a world of creatures that are believable and wonderful. Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) is powerful and beautiful simultaneously. The four children are well-cast and bring life, energy and a ""realness to their characters that is rare in young performers. Tilda Swinton is simply fierce in every meaning of the word. Her portrayal of the White Witch is powerful, beautiful, and terrifying all the same. Watch for her fighting style. Every attack is a killing blow. She doesn't attempt to disarm, she means to kill with every stroke...a very interesting, and scary detail. Another stand-out performance is James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. He's as lovable as you could ever hope for.<br/><br/>That's all I can say for now...enjoy the rest for yourself! It is sure to become a classic film."

","This is flawed, but deserves to be a blockbuster. It will appeal to both kids and adults alike, and especially anyone who has read the book.<br/><br/>Stylistically this borrows heavily from LOTR. This gives the movie an epic quality, but also increases the running time, with lots of sweeping landscape shots and shots which drift over the characters from above. <br/><br/>The script is good. It injected humor at the right times, and was quite faithful to the book. I liked the score, but felt that it was a little bit over the top at times. The cinematography was excellent, and looked gorgeous, except for the occasional scene where the actors where slightly out of focus.<br/><br/>The movie was well cast, the actors all suited their roles quite well. The standard of acting was good, but not amazing. The CGI was mixed - Aslan was excellent, the wolves were good, the rest was very mediocre. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't quite flow properly, especially in the second half. There are several instances where the jump between scenes gives the impression that an intermediate scene has been cut out.<br/><br/>But the film is forgiven for any of these flaws - simply because it was a lot of fun to watch. Definitely a cut above most of the pap produced by Hollywood nowadays."
"clorhidrico","8","2","4","9 December 2005"," A good movie for Christmas time
","This is actually a movie that you should not miss at all, specially at this stage of the year (Christmas time). When you see the movie you remember your past time reading tales and also playing Role Player Games. Sometimes, the movie becomes a bit childish, but it is quite suitable for all ages. At the beginning of the movie you would not believe you are watching a Science-Fiction movie as you see some children with their mother frightened because it is War time. But, the way the author and also the director pass from the reality to the fiction is wonderful. He uses the dream of children, i.e. just enter a wardrobe full of winter coats and suddenly you appear in a Magic place called Narnia, where Winter and Summer are both wonderful, very tale-like fashion."
"asiangirl93","9","2","4","9 December 2005"," I have seen this
","This movie was really good. The director was really good at following the book correctly, not like some stupid director for other movies such as Harry Potter director. No offence though, I love the books and the whole cast but well, sometimes, they just don't follow the book. Aslan was believable. i was really terrified when he roared out loud. I congratulate the special effects team on Aslan and the other CGI characters but some scenes could have been better. I congratulate Tilda Swinton too on a job well done. You can very scared when the White Witch screams. Shes really good at becoming the bad guy in a movie. She was really good in Constantine as Gabriel too. The props and set for Narnia was awesome and should receive a nomination for the Academy Awards. Its kind of like another Lord of the Rings. For the younger cast, my favourites were Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie and Skandar Heynes as Edmund Pevensie. Lucy, because her acts were believable and she had more dialogues than Susan (Anna Popplewell) put together. When she cries, it seems more believable then when Susan cries. Skandar has really come to his character as the hard headed Edmund and I thought his performance was the best among the kids. He beats William Moseley who acts as Peter Pevensie in this movie. William Moseley, I'm sorry but I would have to rate you three stars over five. All and all, the movie was really great, you guys should watch it and have fun at the cinemas Yours truly,asian_girl93"
"dmg826","6","2","4","9 December 2005"," Imagery succeeds; screenplay fails.
","Visually, it is stunning. Technology has finally allowed film to approach, if not equal, the images we form in our heads while reading fantasy novels. Unfortunately, what is gained by the spectacular imagery is lost by the screenplay. Though the film occasionally falls victim to the hyperbolic theatrics that Hollywood so loves, the most disappointing factor is the failure of the adaptation to integrate fluidly Lewis' theology. C.S. Lewis' greatest accomplishment in the book series is his adroit and nuanced amalgamation of theology into the story. In the film, it seems like a secular story with Christian theology awkwardly (and overtly) wedged in between plot points. Standing alone, the imagery is magnificent, and the story is engaging; compared to the book, the film adds nothing and takes quite a bit."

","I had just finished reading the book 2 days before I went to go see the premiere showing of the film. I was somewhat disappointed that they had to add certain things to such a great classic, but this being Hollywood and a Disney movie I could forgive them. Georgie Henley stole the show with quite possibly the best performance by a child actor i have ever seen (I rank her up there with Anna Paquin in The Piano). While the world seemed small the visuals were amazing. With a few very small exceptions all of the CGI looked absolutely real. I was disappointed because a few of my favorite lines from the book were left out. I was pleasantly surprised with the presentation of the Stone Table scene which was very reminiscent of The Passion of the Christ. I really enjoyed this as it drove home Lewis' point of the novels being an allegory of the Christian life.Being A Christian myself, I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that there is finally an excellent mainstream entertainment film that expresses my values. Overall a great film but I would not deem it award worthy except for the aforementioned performance of Georgie Henley."
"johnleemk","8","2","4","8 December 2005"," Excellent filmography makes up for pedestrian plot
","I was actually quite surprised to see this movie open in Malaysia before the US, but anyway, I went to see the film today after its premiere here. I hadn't really intended to go, because I'm not into fantasy fiction (I had trouble finishing the LoTR books, and have never seen any of the movies), but my friends invited me along. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but from what I knew, I was sure I could expect a lot of references to Christian theology and probably a predictable plot.<br/><br/>Well, I wasn't wrong on either of those counts. The plot is loaded with references to things from the Bible, and considering how predictable *that* book was... (Don't get me wrong. I'm a Christian.) Fortunately, once you put aside this necessarily mediocre plot, you get a pretty darn good movie.<br/><br/>The acting might actually turn out to be worth something, and most of the kid actors actually look like they might be people caught up in something they want no part of. The directing and filmography are the best part of the movie, however. I'm not big on fight scenes, so I can't say how well-choreographed they were, but I certainly can't complain. And there's no doubt that you'll be transported into Narnia thanks to the efforts of those funny New Zealanders behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, if you have a family, go. There's no blood, the violence is rather tame, and the plot definitely won't turn your kids into baby-eating liberals/conservatives. If you don't have one, tough. If you have a little cash to spare and don't have much else to do, definitely see this movie. If you think your two and a half hours can be better spent, however, you won't be missing that much. Just wait for the DVD."

While there is a very very very clear Christian theme to the film, that is icing on the cake for those of us who share in Christ.<br/><br/>Looking at it from a purely film aspect, it is very enjoyable, as demonstrated by the fact that my Mom, who dislikes LOTR and similar films found this one wonderful.<br/><br/>It is visually stunning, not simply from the special effects (which are great) but from the sweeping vistas. Whoever did cinematography deserves a serious look at an Oscar.<br/><br/>The script is pretty tight. There are some points where the story drags a little, but that is partly attributable to this being the first in a series. As a result they need to spend time setting up the backstory before they can start.<br/><br/>The score is a good compliment to the film, sweeping and uplifting where needed but nicely understated for the rest of the time. It's one of those scores that you don't notice right off but the film would suffer without it.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch for the most part. The Queen was a little less imposing than I might have liked, but she's pretty good. The children were good overall, and I am sure that they will grow into the roles just as the Harry Potter kids have.<br/><br/>One caveat, there are a number of dark scenes, loud battles, etc and I would not suggest taking any young kids. Save them for DVD rental when you can pause the action to soothe upset nerves.<br/><br/>I will be posting a more detailed commentary later, but this will do it for now.<br/><br/>So in case I have not been clear.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS MOVIE"
"Arolas","7","2","4","8 December 2005"," Magically sublime; a watchable adaption of a magnificent book
","Although I've had little time to digest the movie in full, 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe' - on my first viewing - left me standing outside the cinema realising that Christmas is, once again, here.<br/><br/>One of the greatest mistakes to make when walking in to watch this film - despite the similarities between the books - is to compare this film with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien's trilogy dealt with much more complex emotions, and the characters endured many hardships. This is not to say, however, that The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is at fault because it does not include these characteristics. C.S Lewis' masterpiece was different on many underlying levels, and was ultimately much more of an 'all-ages' book than The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The film adaption reflects this very well, and the world Adamson has brought to the screen is rich, colourful and vibrant. The characters have been cast well - I found it difficult to imagine Aslan's voice outside my own head, but Liam Neeson was an inspired choice (if you squint, it almost looks a little like him) - especially Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes specifically create a very believable performance. I couldn't help feel however, that Tilda Swinton was cast very much as a cheaper version of Cate Blanchette. Her performance is watchable, but lacks the edge and conviction of some of the other main characters.<br/><br/>Although an odd choice, Harry Gregson-Williams creates a fitting composition to compliment the movie well, but the use of the more electronic instruments may be difficult to digest if you were walking into the cinema with preconceptions of a more natural - forward of a better word - Howard Shore-esquire score.<br/><br/>The film does appear to move at quite a pace, and some scenes between characters that barely knew each other and then suddenly seem to have developed an incredibly close relationship within the space of several scenes can leave you feeling that maybe a little more time should have been spent on character development.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a magical winter film; a beautifully crafted (partly thanks to the amazing work of WETA) world that lives and breathes, and reminds you that the 'all ages' genre is not synonymous with 'just for children'."

","Great things about the movie:
1. Beautiful introduction to Narnia, the story is interesting.
2. The practical effects and make-up for centaurs, minotaurs, fauns and dwarfs are realistic and detailed.
3. The production design and locations are perfect.
4. The scenes where Narnians fight Jadis' army (third act) are epic.
5. Pevensies' armor and Jadis' 3 costumes (white ice, black sacrifice, hunting armor) are very cool.
6. Perfect cast, good acting and voice acting: William Moseley as Peter Pevensie, Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie, Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, Ray Winstone as the voice of Mr. Beaver, and Dawn French as the voice of Mrs. Beaver.
7. Liam Neeson as Aslan is perfect; Tilda Swinton is unforgettable as the cold witch.
8. Great lessons: sincere sacrifice; completing, helping and believing in each other as family; loyalty and hope.
9. Beautiful score and music.<br/><br/>The animations for beavers, wolves, fox, griffins and giants need to be improved.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1. When the wolves were looking for the Pevensies and interrogating the fox, they should have been able to discover them from their smell, because they were just a few metres above.
2. The other wolves should have been able to attack Peter and friends from behind during the waterfall scene. Maugrim was not brave nor confident enough to attack Peter (twice), although he was the Captain of Jadis' police force and Peter barely knew how to hold a sword.
3. When Aslan was going to sacrifice himself, there should have been guards around his camp.
4. The time for Aslan's additional army to go from Jadis' castle to the battlefield was too short, considering that it was pretty far.
5. In the final battle scene, Oreius was frozen by White Witch and broken into pieces. However, during coronation scene, he could be seen."

","An entrancing journey into a surprisingly child friendly, medieval world that all ages can pull enjoyment from. Everything oozed with profoundness which crafted characters and a world that attained existent beyond a call to the plot. Acting from the four main stars felt immensely forced yet their characters were enthralling and each achieved contrasting personalities. Contrarily, although amazingly acted by Tilda Swinton whom drove fear and intimidation into viewers from every line that added to her unprecicatablness; her character was cliche, ticking all boxes of a typical villain, tremendously ambitious in their goal, yet exceedingly lacklustre in effort to attain said goal. Her rival, Aslan, despite the beautiful voice acting of Liam Neeson, wasn't much different. While being opposite in disposition, he was untouchable, deriving him of any danger. However, this could be dismissed due to the Christian aspect the movie presents with Aslan being God and The Witch being Satan, the classic hero and villain that every protagonist and antagonist was first based off of. The CGI wasn't astounding but was impressive and didn't derive from the movie. In spite of this, green screen scenes at times felt flat and offered a separation between characters and the world which was hard to dismiss. Nevertheless, this didn't stop Narnia from feeling vast and enchanting and in pair with Harry Gregson-Williams grand score, this magical world couldn't have been portrayed better. In regards to how this movie holds together from a film-making stance, the script, direction and theme were marvelous, however colour grading, lighting and cinematography were mediocre Overall, a very entertaining and meaningful movie if minor plot holes are dismissed."

Once they get there, the housekeeper ""Mrs. Macready"" (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. ""Lucy"" takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets ""Mr. Tumnus"" (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of ""Narnia"" meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the ""Pevensie"" children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous ""White Witch"" (Tilda Swinton). They align with ""Aslan"" the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great.

"a-99671","9","0","0","22 January 2020"," A fascinating movie!
","The film ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is an adventurous story about children that fled to a professor's house, during the war, and find a mysterious wardrobe that leads them to a different world. Originally written by C.S. Lewis, I was quite satisfied that this movie played out similarly to the literary work, just like I imagined it. I give this film a positive review because it really captured my attention. The settings, costumes, and dialogue are some of the elements that give support to my review.
The setting of the film really brings together the whole story. From the beginning the setting is at the children's home but there are bombings going on and it's night. It gives that scene a frightening and dark atmosphere telling the viewers it's war. The setting gets really interesting when the children enter the fantasy world from the wardrobe. The settings, in the scenes, give out the atmosphere and the feeling to that scene of the movie. From the cold and frosty palace of the evil queen to the sunny and green spring that came. The settings in the movie were important and it gave a good understanding of the feelings that came to it.
The costumes in that movie also gave the sense of the setting in that movie. By the costumes it was easy to tell what time and place it was. In the beginning the children wore simple clothes. By the way they were dressed, you could tell around what era it was and also that it had to be somewhere in Europe (and of course it was in England). The beginning gives it that simple British lives of children around 1940s. But when they enter the wardrobe it feels as if they traveled back in time but also it was a fantasy world. There were no human beings there. Some half human, half goat appears and you think ""woah it's definitely some weird stuff"". Through the costumes it shows that it was about the medieval times because they fought battles in the metal plated armor and had the symbolic flags and swords and weapons. The costumes give the description of the time, the place, and the environment of the movie.
Lastly, the dialogue, or the script, give a good description of the characters and the plot of the story. Using the dialogue in the film it portrays the personality of each character. For example, Edmund, the youngest boy of the four, is really the mean and self-centered boy. He always contradicts with everyone. I also love that this movie, even though in a time of war, gives a bit of humor through the dialogue the siblings have. It shows that though it's a frightening and hard time, when the siblings stick together, they still act like siblings and joke around and bicker with each other. Through the script the development of the characters was shown really well.
Overall, I enjoyed this film and even though it might have a few minor drawbacks to it. The settings, costumes, and dialogue are just some of the elements that give examples of the positives in the film."

The Chronicles of Narnia is an excellent fantasy series, and this adaptation, while not completely faithful, does a pretty decent job of bringing the story to life. It faithfully recreates the most important parts of the book, from tea with Mr. Tumnus to Aslan's triumphant return. It's not ""Harry Potter"", it's not ""Percy Jackson"", and thankfully, it's not tasteless schlock like ""His Dark Materials"". The acting, score, visuals, story, and morals all make this a very worthwhile way to spend an evening. It's a unique classic, and if you can't watch it because it triggers you, then you are missing out."

","11 December 2005. One of the best, if not the best children' fantasy film I've experienced. This lavish fantasy begins and ends with realism in a fantasy world. Each of the children are real, their interactions with each other are real. The performances and the relationships are not softened by major studio glossy acting, but engender a heart-felt, emotional gut feeling. There aren't any kiddy scenes, but good juvenile experiences awash from the movie screen. The White Witch is a superbly cold figure in the movie providing it with a great backdrop for children to experience a sincere picture of evil, iciness. This movie even though enveloped in white snow is no whitewash. It treats the rapidly maturing children of our age with a valuable dose of ethical insight, with hope, and inspiration as role-models.<br/><br/>The cinematic approach reminiscent of ""The Secret Garden"" (1993), and ""In America"" (2002), The Chronicles of Naria (2005) plays it straight even though its set mostly in a fantasy land, much to its credit. This is a fabulous, personal epic, that is both majestic and intimate. With the exception with how death is ultimately played out in this movie, this movie feels like a classic.

"csbob447","6","0","0","17 September 2018"," Ehhh it holds up alright I guess
","Okay so this explains a bit of a backstory as to why I re-watched this in like 10 years. I took a class for my junior year of college about the writing of C.S. Lewis. This included essays, autobiographies, books, and one of Narnia books, Voyage of the Dawn Treader. When I took that class I never read any of the Narnia books until then, but I was hooked in reading them afterwards. However it took me a while until officially reading them. Then after one long road trip to and from Oklahoma I decided to read the first two Narnia books (chronologically speaking). And while it is written in a way for a more younger audience and some extremely on the nose Christian imagery, the books are pretty dang good, so far. So it was after I finished the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe I was curious as to see how well the film adapted the book, as well as re-watching a movie I had somewhat fond memories of.<br/><br/>Needless to say...they hold up about as well as I expected. Not exactly great but not terrible as well. Certainly not as bad as some people made the films out to be.<br/><br/>So let's get the first thing out of the way first, the child acting, with one exception, is not very good. Even with bumping Peter and Susan's ages up in the books (both are about preteen age), William Moseley as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan are just not very good. None of the line delivery is believable and they have super dull expressions with the world around them, although to be fair on them director Andrew Adamson can be blamed for this too. William is the worst out of the four as so many of his super serious lines he is given comes off as super laughable. The only one out of the four that is the most tolerable is Georgie Henley as Lucy, but even then she does give a mixed performance. At worst she is wooden and over enunciating, but at best she does capture book Lucy very well, and at least she does feel like she's trying more than the other three. Skandar Keynes does an alright job at times as Edmund, but there are times where his delivery is just not good. Most of the other live action actors do a good job here, like Tilda Swinton, who does a great job at capturing the White Witch, James McAvoy and Jim Broadbent. The voice acting is also decent too, Ray Winstone and Dawn French are pretty great here. But Liam Neeson makes a disappointing Aslan, feeling rather cold and under performing as the voice.<br/><br/>The production is pretty great, as it does feel a lot like what Narnia is described in the book. I felt like I was transported in another world. The costumes were excellent, and even most of the visual effects hold up fairly well too for the animals, although there are a ton of bad green-screen composites here. As far as an adaptation goes, it's actually pretty good. While the movie never recaptures the way Lewis describes and narrates in the book, there is an attempt here that is worth praising. There are a few changes here and there, Peter and Susan do get more development than in the book as well as adding more family drama in here that's alright, they explained a lot better why Aslan sacrificed himself to the White Witch, a lot of the Christian imagery is made less ham-fisted like in the book. Although they did manage to beefen up the story with more action scenes and they never made it clear that Edmund was under an enchantment, which is why he betrayed his siblings. But overall it's not terrible of an adaptation. It's loyal and the concessions they did make to fit the screen.<br/><br/>The big problem with this movie besides the child acting is that it is VERY clear that the movie wants to be the next Lord of the Rings. So much of the movie dramatizes events from the books or add more stakes in translation, which isn't necessarily bad, but it is clear the intent of Disney wanting a franchise on their hands to compete with the Harry Potter films. And honestly Andrew Adamson, who most people know for co-directing the first two Shrek films (yes...really), he is no Peter Jackson. Which goes double especially for the action scenes that feel incredibly derivative (although having a PG action film certainly doesn't help that matter). I do feel that in terms of fantasy adaptations being released in the 2000s after Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia does hold up far better compared to the likes of Eragon and the Golden Compass, far worse films. But I think that the movie would have been far better if they didn't try to copy another formula and just had a distinct voice for the film.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's not exactly a bad movie, but it is held back from far greatness. Still it was a trip watching this movie for the first time in years, so for a nostalgic trip to hold up fairly well, I couldn't ask for anything more."

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an adaption of C.S. Lewis' novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The film is set in World War II. During the German raids of London, four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Luce Pevensie) are sent into the countryside to Professor Kirke, to be taken care of during the Blitz.
While there, they discover a magical wardrobe that transports them into another world - the world of Narnia! It is an enchanted word with fauns, dwarfs, talking beasts, and the like. However, it is held under the evil spell of Queen Jadis, otherwise known as the White Witch, who as put Narnia under an eternal winter - with no Christmas!
The four children must team up with the great lion Aslan to defeat the Witch and restore peace to Narnia.
The film is brilliantly executed with a good plot that flows smoothly and excellent actors - and voice actors. Liam Neeson provides a fantastic voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch equally well. The actors for the four children - and all the other characters - do their jobs very well. 
The films special effects are brilliant and add quite a bit to the movie. The film is quite enjoyable to watch, and easily beats most - if not all - other fantasy movies I have seen. One of my favourite movies."

I never would have guessed the movie was from 2005 considering that the special effects were so exceptional. The casting I believe was just as good. Tilda Swinton made a great White Witch and Liam Neeson nailed his role as Aslan capturing the selfless beast he was meant to be. Though the movie was fairly long, certain scenes did move rather quickly. Select portions of the story line passed by too quickly in the film like the ending fight scene between the White Witch's army and that of Aslan's. Also, more time could have been put into the training of Peter becoming a warrior instead of him hardly knowing how to use a sword against a wolf in one scene and being able to slay many of the witch's experienced army himself the next.

"davispittman","9","0","0","15 March 2017"," Very well constructed film adaptation
","Narnia is a book a series that I admittedly have not read, not a single one, but I have seen the film adaptations of those best selling books. This first installment is the best of all of them in my humble opinion. First of all, let's start with the sets. The film's sets are so on point for the time period this is set in, its very historically accurate and they all have great visual attraction to them. The Narnia scenery is beautiful, breathtaking views of snowy mountains, then of all a sudden, the season suddenly turns to a wonderful spring day, complete with trickling rivers, budding flowers, and a huge battlefield, which is where the big final battle takes place. The actors really handle their characters very well, all the teens are great actors/actresses and they all show great potential, especially Peter. Tilda Swinton is absolutely incredible as the White Queen, there couldn't have been a better choice to play the wicked antagonistic role. Tilda brings a certain cold, distant, and effortlessly evil presence to the role, which works very well. The writing is very good, it adds a good bit of character depth, which is pretty rare with movies starring teenagers. The effects, makeup (Oscar nomination), and the action sequences are all so intricate and well done. Especially the makeup, that is a very important factor for some characters in here. I suggest kids, teens and adults all see this if you haven't already had the pleasure. 9/10."
"nzswanny","4","0","0","5 February 2017"," Not good enough.
","Sure, the special effects are pretty good, but you expect that, considering the massive budget. But, most of the rest of the film is not. The tone of this movie completely ruins the style of the book, and instead uses the tone of an average blockbuster action movie. One big problem that changes the tone is the soundtrack. We get an unmemorable soundtrack that is over the top, clichéd, loud, blaring and simply annoying. They also overuse the soundtrack. There is basically an unmemorable, over the top, clichéd, loud blaring, annoying song every two minutes. It also affects the flow of the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that this movie fails at is character development. This film has close to none, and you don't really care for the characters because of that. In fact, I wanted Peter, Edmund and Lucy to get killed off by the White Witch, just to finish the tortuous movie.<br/><br/>This movie also tries too hard to be dark and scary, but fails miserably. You do not understand the pain and suffering of Narnia in this film, because the filmmakers do not care to put in enough depth and character development for us to care. So, the director says, ""Don't worry, we'll get great reviews! We'll just add a bit of awesome special effects here and there!""<br/><br/>But...I thought the White Witch in this film was quite good. The acting from her was decent, and the makeup and costume was up to standard. I didn't mind most of the casting, but I didn't like the casting of Lucy, as I thought her acting skills were a bit off. But it wasn't too bad. <br/><br/>Overall, if you don't mind a badly paced, clichéd, loud action packed movie, you may like this. But if you're looking for a good film, I suggest you stay away. The metascore is a joke, however. 4.3/10."

","I just re-watched this movie. I loved it when I was a kid and I love it now. It is a wonderful movie to watch, especially around Christmas time. The movie is a bit cheesy at times, but you have to remember that this movie is targeted at kids, so I don't hold that against it. The music is fantastic as well. I bought the sound track because I enjoyed it so thoroughly. I enjoyed reading the books when I was younger and seeing the books come to life in a well done manner is great. I look forward to sharing this with my kids one day. Also, it helps that Liam Neeson is in this film because I generally enjoy his movies. Finally, who doesn't love a movie that has talking animals?"

","This movie is about a parallel world called Narnia, its inhabitants and human kids who have found a portal to this land. In accordance with New Age ""gurus"", there are 7 parallel worlds around our Earth, each of them full of various creatures. Those creatures have different appearances such as, goblins, boggarts, etc., but also other dissimilar capabilities from our world. For example, animals - inhabitants in Narnia are able to talk, other creatures, like the witch, are capable of transforming a living person into a frozen statue.<br/><br/>Normally, the inhabitants in the parallel worlds do not interact with each other, except in specific circumstances.<br/><br/>The entry happens through certain portals on Earth. One of the most famous portals on Earth is Bermuda Triangle. In the Chronicles of Narnia, the portal is the wardrobe. In accordance to prophecy, Narnia will be freed from the power of the White Witch by the hand of a human. <br/><br/>Prophecy as a spiritual awakening element is a very mysterious concept, which normally charms or/and scares people. From a spiritual point of view, prophecy is a destiny (= scenario), written for a land, person or even a civilization. Some predictions, as in this movie, give a hope and some induce a fear because humankind doesn't know how to deal with that. <br/><br/>One more exiting spiritual element in the story is time. Time in the parallel world runs in a different way to our world. Kids are returning back home as the same age they had when they started their journey to Narnia.<br/><br/>This positive movie with several spiritual-awakening elements is recommended for the whole family."
"thundyrwaves","8","0","0","3 November 2016"," Great movie, but a few disappointments
","The movie was amazing. Absolutely astonishing. It gives me chills every time! But I didn't rate it 10/10 for a reason: the little minor details they missed in the movie. The movie stuck to the book pretty well for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The plot is definitely the same. In both the movie and the book, Lucy was the first one to go into the Wardrobe; Edmund was a jerk and teased Lucy; Edmund betrayed the others to the Witch, for Turkish Delights; and the rest is very much the same. Really, for this comparison, it'll be easier to note the differences rather than the similarities. There weren't many differences; however, they were mostly subtle differences, but there were some major differences. Like when Mr. Tumnus was in the prison with Edmund, in the movie. In the book, Mr. Tumnus had been turned into stone before Edmund had even gotten to Jadis' house. Also, in the book, the fox never helped the Pevensie children like he did in the movie; in fact, in the book, they never even really met. The fox had a cameo role in the book: he was there when Jadis had found a group of woodland creatures feasting on food that was given to them by Father Christmas; however, in the movie, this was never mentioned. The fox was, however, turned to stone in both the movie and the book. In addition: in the movie, Lucy Pevensie first went into the Wardrobe when the Pevensie children were all playing hide-and-seek. In the book, however, she first went into it when they were exploring the house. Also, in the movie, all four Pevensie children went into Narnia when they had smashed a ball into a window and they were trying to hide from the Professor's maid. In the book, they were still trying to hide from the maid, but it was because they thought she had guests over, not because they were in trouble. Also, in the movie, Jadis came with a procession of her minions to Aslan to negotiate the release of Edmund. In the book, she came alone. I did enjoy, however, that the movie paid attention to the little details: the fact that the Pevensie children never fully closed the wardrobe door, ""Because it is foolish to lock oneself in a wardrobe."" And the fact that Digory Kirke did say, in the movie and the book, ""What do they teach in school these days?"" Overall, a great movie."
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","0","14 May 2016"," A rushed and breathless adaptation
","My main problem with this film is that I saw the BBC miniseries when I was a kid – and it made a BIG impression on me. These days, I look back on the schlocky effects and the overdone acting with a kind of nostalgia. I half want to see it again, to see how it holds up, and half want to leave it in the past, where it's probably better.<br/><br/>This film tells the same story, for the modern generation. It's made in the mould of LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER, and targets the same demographic. Intricacies of plot and character are done away with in favour of a chase plot that lasts the entire movie. Actually, that's not entirely true. The first half hour (the best) is a great set up – wonderful acting from the kids, good costumes, cool effects. The last half hour is a massive CGI animated battle sequence a la RETURN OF THE KING, and I loved it a lot – fast-paced action through and through, with minotaurs, griffins, monsters and dwarfs all fighting it out to the death. The middle hour isn't so good – we're stuck with cheesy talking beavers and some poorly animated wolf villains in a chase-capture-chase-capture sequence that seems almost interminable. We don't know much more about the kids by the end than we do by the beginning, except that Edmund is spoilt, Peter is kingly, Lucy cute and Susan is plain annoying! <br/><br/>On the plus side, overall the effects are great, and there are some good voice actors in the cast – Liam Neeson makes a fine Aslan. Others, too are surprisingly great – old timer James Cosmo as Father Christmas, James McAvoy as Mr Tumnus, Jim Broadbent as the Professor, and of course creepy Tilda Swinton as the Ice Queen. If it hadn't been all so rushed and breathless, I would have enjoyed this a lot more, but it still makes for amiable viewing."
"filipemanuelneto","6","0","0","12 April 2016"," A good movie, but a bad adaptation of a book.
","This movie is the film adaptation of one of the most famous books of C.S. Lewis, who wrote a series of novels called ""Chronicles of Narnia"". In this film, four brothers enter a magical world of talking animals and find that their coming was prophesied and should defeat a terrible witch who enslaved the country in a long winter.<br/><br/>Directed by Andrew Adamson (who directed Shrek), has a script by Ann Peacock, Andrew Adamson, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The cast was headed by Georgie Henley (Lucy), Skandar Keynes (Edmund), William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan) and Tilda Swinton (The Witch), also relying on the voices of James McAvoy (Tumnus), Liam Neeson (Aslan) and Ray Winstone (Mr. Beaver). It won the Oscar for best characterization in 2006.<br/><br/>I've always been of the opinion that if we want to tell a story correctly, we must start at the beginning. That's not what this movie did. In fact, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", despite the fame, is not the book where the chronicle begins. The story begins before this events, in the novel ""The Magician's Nephew"". But okay, we have seen prequels before (Star Wars, for example). What I never saw was a successful film where the events are not properly explained to the public. Throughout the film, we understanding that we know very little about Narnia (like the four protagonists), but it might be good to know more, understand how that witch has earned its position and what happened in that world before the arrival of the four humans. This kind of mysteries didn't work in this kind of films, unless they are exploited in a very skillful way in the script, which was far from the reduced ability of the team that wrote it. I also believe that Lewis's book could have been better explored and understood. Apparently, the staff and the director were afraid to exploit the book and end up filling the film with Christian allegories (yes, he's full of it and this film also, even if it wasn't the intention). Despite these flaws, the film works well enough to delight the audience because we all have a little child inside us, and all children have dreamed of something like this. The special effects and characterization are irreproachable, the costumes too, and the scenery is straight out of a true fairy tale. This movie is all that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is not: it's a fairy tale, not a war epic in a strange world. For all this, it's a film that deserves to be seen often, although those who have particular taste in C.S. Lewis books might not like so much."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","0","0","8 March 2016"," Phenomenal adaptation
","C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is a dazzling, indisputable success, as both a standalone film and when viewed next to its literary counterpart. It stands as a milestone for me, in the sense that it's pretty much the only film adaptation of book that was very special to me growing up to not only do the story justice, but to come out a winner as the best cinematic vision of it possible. It's a feast for the eyes, ears and spirit, and remarkably, a lot of it plays out exactly how my cherished memories of the book do. No having said that, I would advise avoidance of the sequels, one of which I've seen which put me off going for the next one. Prince Caspian felt lazy, rushed and cheap, not to mention that they fudged up the progression of the series and completely skipped The Horse And His Boy, one of of my favourites. Gahh writing this makes me want to go read them all again!!! Anyways let's stay on track. From the opening frame, a rattling POV shot of bombs descending on a WWII ravaged London, the film assures us that it means business, and isn't going to slip into the pandering, glossy, watered over Young Adult world of adaptations. The Pevensie children, four precocious English youngsters, are sent away from the conflict to live with a distant relative in the country. There, they find a desolate old mansion, populated only by a staunch housekeeper, and the eccentric owner, Professor Kirke (Charming Jim Broadbent). They also stumble upon a magical wardrobe which leads to a vast kingdom called Narnia, filled with talking beasts, castles, forests and more legendary creatures than you can shake a stick at. Lucy (Georgie Henley is the perfect, darling Lucy I imagined), the youngest and most intuitive of the four, is first to venture through, meeting a kindly fawn named Mr. Tumnus (James Macavoy) who tells her that Narnia has fallen on hard, wintry times. Her sibling back in our world don't believe her, until they too are whisked through into the land, unknowingly thrust into an adventure to save Narnia, which will well likely put them in more danger than anything WWII has to offer. The four are uncannily well cast: William Moseley brings the humbled nobility and budding leader in Peter magnificently, Anna Popplewell shows the compassionate warrior's heart in Susan, and Skandar Keyes expertly handles the arc of Edmund, the black sheep of the group with lessons to learn, both bitter and sweet. They are pit against Narnia's resident villain and warlord, the malicious White Witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton will freeze your heart), with the help of many a talking animal, including friendly Mr. Beaver (Ray Winstone), and the godly lion and pseudo savior Aslan (Liam Neeson, because who else would you cast?). Michael Madsen provides his raspy growl to the voice of Maugrim, the Witch's top wolf lieutenant in her lupine secret police force. There's other hidden Easter eggs of voice-over work from Dawn French as Mrs. Beaver and Rupert Everett as a Fox. The scope and spectacle is paramount in bringing the world of Narnia to life, and the filmmakers spare no expanse here: The children delve into chases, battles, betrayals, icy encounters with the witch, sword fights and and all sorts of wonder, including a surprise visit from Father Christmas himself, warmly intoned by James Cosmo. Equally important as the dazzle dazzle, however, are the quiet, contemplative conversations that flourish into important character beats and lessons for all involved. The four are at a crux of human development, and vulnerable to stimuli both internal and external. Even though the story takes place in a magical, seemingly unreal world of fantasy, the interactions and human behaviour couldn't feel more real. It's all flawlessly carried over from the book, born on the gilded wings of a stirring musical score from Harry Gregson Williams that swells to near transcendent heights when we reach the climactic battle. Like I said, quite simply the finest adaptation we could ever hope for. It's just too bed they slacked off with threat few. On the bright side, we'll always have this on."

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005): Dir: Andrew Adamson / Cast: Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley / Voices: Liam Neeson: Fascinating Christian allegory based on the C.S. Lewis classic where the lion Aslan symbolizes Jesus Christ, the witch symbolizes Satan, and the wardrobe symbolizes choice or perhaps change. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor during the heat of World War 2 but during a game of hide and seek a wardrobe is discovered and inside secrets the magical land of Narnia cursed by the White Witch to remain in a winter state. Directed by Andrew Adamson who brings the magic into reality with exquisite visual effects. He previously made the Shrek films, which were also fairy tale based. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch dominates with her icy seductive tone. James McAvoy is terrific as a half human half fawn who befriends Lucy thus inviting the wrath of the witch. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund whose curiosity and attitude become tools for the witch. Georgie Henley as Lucy becomes an instant source of communication when she relates to the bewilderment around her. Liam Neeson provides the voice of lion Aslan, the authority figure of Narnia. Strong Christian themes highlight this visual wonder that results in a wardrobe that is worth opening. Score: 10 / 10"

The movie was faithful to the book bit there was one massive change. The book (and the BBC series) felt more like a fairy tale but they made the movie so epic! Some people may call it overlong but I loved it and honestly, I think it wouldn't be as epic if it was 90-120 min. CGI is incredible and everything looks so realistic! And young actors were great as the Pevensie children. Liam Neeson gives a powerful voice performance as Aslan and Tilda Swinton was pure evil as The White Witch.Jim Broadbent didn't have much scenes in the movie but he was really likable and his character will be better introduced in the rest of the franchise. Book readers will know. The beginning of the movie throws as straight in the action while introducing the Pevensies running into shelter during the World War II. The movie may be a little depressing at the beginning until they go to Narnia. Narnia is really beautiful and while it's the cold winter in the first half it still feels beautiful and the second half is spring and that's way this movie is the best to watch around Christmas and Easter.

Now for the actors: I enjoyed all of the side characters (Mr. Tumnus, The White Witch, The Beaver's, The Professor, and especially Aslan), the actors really did well there. As for the Pevensies; Skandar Keyes did excellent as Edmund, he really portrayed him greatly, Georgie Henley did get slightly tedious but she did well as Lucy, William Moseley wasn't so great as Peter, he was overly cocky, and was reworded when he din't seem fit for rewards, Anna Popplewell was really annoying as Susan, though that is her character somewhat, she still over did it.<br/><br/>The movie really is amazing and jaw-dropping, definitely see it!"

I cannot describe with words how much little Lucy reminded me of my childhood hoping that there would be somewhere another world filled with these extraordinary fantasy creatures. The day she discovered the wardrobe as portal to Narnia made me fell in love with this story. Although it has a few battle scenes it never focuses on them just like in Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings was good too but in that series you tend to forget the story because of the many battles. I liked that they put more emphasis on the plot here which I liked. If you would want to give the Narnia movies a try than I recommend you watching this one first. If you don't want to bother with too much violence I would say watch this one and not the sequel. The 4 child actors/actresses playing the Pevensie children did a really good job here coming across as believable brothers and sisters. You might not like Edmund at first but it will all come good. Too bad with growing up the story became darker too. Splendid role also by Tilda Swinton as the white witch.

"Lejink","7","0","0","10 March 2011"," Four Go To Narnia...
","I enjoy classic children's literature almost as much as the grown-up stuff and have read C S Lewis' full Chronicles of Narnia, although not for many years. Still, did this latest blockbuster adaptation thrill me as the book did...certainly it did.<br/><br/>The story is initially quite slow-paced, obviously laying out the children's characters and attempting to individualise their traits for the viewer until Lucy accidentally backs into Narnia and things as would expect pick up from there. It's a pity that the movie was made in the wake of the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord Of The Rings"" series, where little people / children also encounter magic, talking animals and have to face up and face down the forces of evil in a foreign land, so that some of the scenes and situations seem a little second-hand to viewers, like me, of the others.<br/><br/>So maybe, with their lack of familiarity, that's why the four children here seem a little stiff an strange in their attitudes, whilst remembering all the time that kids were very different and had different outlooks 70 odd years ago. The acting of the children is perfectly acceptable but I just didn't feel they any of them made a lasting impression in at least this viewer's memory, with the possible exception of the young girl playing Lucy.<br/><br/>As you would expect, the anonymity of the children in the leads is compensated, like in Potter, by having big-name British character actors in the more substantial supporting roles. These include a quite scrawny looking Tilda Swinton as the wicked witch, the dependable Jim Broadbent as the aged, knowing owner of the house which contains the magic wardrobe and, rather oddly, young hot-shot James McAvoy as the impish faun Mr Tumnus who darts in and out of the story.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good on the whole in the scenic depiction of Narnia and its inhabitants bar one or two obvious matte background shots and the C-Gen grand battle at the end is convincingly done if perhaps not up to Peter Jackson standards. That's a great weapon old Tilda has, by the way! All the talking animals are well rendered too both in movement and of course speech synchronisation.<br/><br/>As I said above, it's a shame that the Narnia adaptation didn't get green-lighted before Potter as I think there's better story-telling afoot here but this big-budget feature has managed to spawn, if belatedly, to date two successors. Let's hope all seven get made, none of the books certainly are long enough, if memory serves, to be split into two, or three come to that."

","I recently re-watched this old favorite of mine and decided it was time to review it.<br/><br/>The Story: The four Pevensie children have been evacuated from London to protect them from the bombing raids of WWII. While staying in the country with a distant relative, they stumble upon a magical wardrobe which takes them to the land of Narnia, which at first glance appears to be a snow-covered paradise inhabited by mythical creatures and talking animals.<br/><br/>But all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>For the last one hundred years Narnia has been ruled by a cruel witch who has frozen the land in a perpetual winter without Christmas. The children find that an old prophecy indicates that they will save the land from enchantment and sit as kings and queens over the land in a glorious reign of peace.<br/><br/>The witch also knows of this prophecy and will do all she can to stop it.<br/><br/>The Good: This film has many admirable themes. Themes of friendship, loyalty, and self-sacrifice, to name just a few. Aslan sacrifices himself to save the lives of others. While the relationships between the children are rather poor at the beginning of the film, their journey through Narnia brings them closer together by the end.<br/><br/>I was also pleased by the way the film handles magic. The witch is portrayed as bad and she is the only character to use magic throughout the film. While Aslan does reference the ""deep magic"" put into Narnia at the beginning of time, it is implied that this 'magic' is used by the creator of Narnia.<br/><br/>Violence, while certainly present, is also handled quite well. Most of the violence is implied rather than shown. Even the large battle at the end is well done. It is almost completely blood-free and most of the killing happens off-screen.<br/><br/>The Bad: While this isn't necessarily bad, it is worth noting. There are several scenes in this movie that would not be appropriate for young children. Some scenes show some of the evil creatures in the witch's army, and the scene depicting Aslan's death is quite disturbing. While these scenes are not evil in and of themselves, and while I believe they where actually quite well-done, I don't believe they should be shown to young children.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, the relationship between the four children is not great. However, as I mentioned before, their relationships strengthen throughout the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of slight instances of immodesty.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Over all this is a pretty good film. While there are some things that make it inappropriate for younger audiences, I believe that this is a film that older children and their parents will be able to enjoy for years to come."

And pretty much every mythical creature shows up. There are centaurs, elves, all sorts of talking animals, unicorns, fauns, gryphons, witches, and even Santa Clause appears. But the fauns, none of that creatures ""explained"" in any way, they simply exist. The whole movie felt a bit like Smarties*: Colorful, cheerful, but a bit too sweet.

","This movie does one of the best jobs of following a book I have ever read. The best character in there was Edmund, played by Skandar Keynes. He portrayed the character exactly as I pictured him being in the book. His development was right on the mark. The other kids were great as well and I hope all four end up with wonderful acting careers. His dynamics with Tilda Swinton were commendable, especially coming from such a young actor. I would love to see Skandar Keynes and Tilda Swinton in a project together. Tilda Swinton was another wonderful actress in this movie. She gave the White Witch more dimensions than what appeared in the book. The scene where she gives Edmund the Turkinsh delight was one of the best in the movie. Tilda Swinton steals that scene when she welcomes Edmund onto the sleigh and really makes him believe she will make him king. Her scene in the castle throne room where she looses her temper with him makes us see her true wickedness in a startling way, as does the scene where she slaps him. Like previous posters have said, her icy stare is such a good touch. James McAvoy is another standout in this movie. He demonstrates his versatility as an actor. To see him perform as a faun in this and then watch him in ""The Last King of Scotland"" in one of the most powerful roles I've ever seen is amazing. He is another one I hope to see more often. The changes made to the were great for the movie. The subplot with Maugrim and his pack of wolves was a wonderful addition, especially with the dynamics between him and Peter. Changing the character of Susan into a much stronger young woman was also appreciated. In the book she was a much weaker character."

","In recent years I have not been impressed with the efforts of Disney. It seems that their work has been void of new ideas and true quality (see the vast number of direct to video sequels). This film is a huge exception. This time Disney shines with all the potential the mega- company is capable of. It is often difficult to find a good film adaptation of a treasured novel. Regardless of how detailed an author's work, we all form different mental pictures of what it ""should"" look like. This film not only brought the characters and action to life but did so in a way that did not disappoint. This is the only time that I can honestly say that the movie was better than the original book. My only hope is that C.S. Lewis would have been proud."

","There's an epic quality of grandeur about the wintry landscape of Narnia, the land ruled by The White Witch (TILDA SWINTON), existing beyond the handsome wardrobe chest in a stately home in the country where four British children are assigned temporary shelter during the war.<br/><br/>The youngest girl, played by GEORGIE HENLEY with great charm and humor, is the first child to hide in the wardrobe and to discover the land beyond. The others soon join her, accidentally, and the tale takes on a darker turn as they learn the rules of the kingdom ruled by The White Witch and her cohorts.<br/><br/>Performances are all first rate, the CGI is incredibly convincing in making all the creatures look and behave in humanized ways, and the story is compelling from the start. Once you start watching, you won't be able to turn away. But the last third of the movie tends to overdo the huge battle scene that rivals ""Lord of the Rings"" for blood-thirsty excitement. Very young children may be disturbed by the realistic special effects that make the violence so real.<br/><br/>Overall, it succeeds in being a fantasy that weaves a spell of enchantment thanks to the superb craftsmanship of costuming and settings.<br/><br/>TILDA SWINTON does a remarkable job as The White Witch, looking like a pale ghost in her all white attire and playing the role with not a shred of sympathy for her viciously cruel character. Among the children, WILLIAM MOSELY stands out as Peter, the oldest child, who reaches maturity as a leader.<br/><br/>Summing up: Delightful fantasy from the C.S. Lewis book."

","In this movie there were four main characters named Susan, Lucy, Peter, and Edmund- they were all brothers and sisters. In the beginning their mother sent them to live with a professor and his wife so that when the war was going on in their original town, they wouldn't get hurt and would all be safe. The setting of this movie took place in the professor's house until Lucy went through a wardrobe and ended up in a whole different world. I thought that this was a good movie, because it kept you really interested. In some parts you just didn't know what was going to happen next. The characters were played well, and it was a very easy movie to keep up with; at all parts you knew what was going on. In some parts of the movie you could easily predict what was going to happen next, but there was only a few that were like that. I think that the book was good also, but if I had a choice of reading the book or watching the movie, I would probably read the book. This is because the book kind of gives you a lot more detail, and there are more parts that where said or done that wasn't said or done in the movie. The book was good, because in the book you couldn't really predict what was going to happen; in the movie you could predict. So in the end I would probably choose the book over the movie."

","This movie got me reading the whole 7 books of the Chronicles of Narnia! I never paid much attention to the great movie until I saw The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe on DVD (watching it a million times now). Every scene excels this movie flawlessly. I love it how C.L. Lewis is a Christian writer and much of TCON relates to The Bible. Director Andrew Adamson is a great Director. I was watching the special features of the movie and Adamson really puts his heart into it. Every scene he uses in the movie has to be an exact match to his imagination, and HIS IMAGINATION works for me. Before shooting, he will work with Georgie (Lucy) before the camera rolls. He will read the lines of Aslan to make it more comfortable for Georgie.<br/><br/>My main concept of the movie (and book) is even though evil dominates this world, with faith, you can draw closer to GOD and win. For example, the White Witch has been ruling all these years until 2 sons of Adam and 2 daughters of Eve enter Narnia. Which in reality, only we -as human beings, that chooses to do what is right can make things better.<br/><br/>Love this movie!"

","""THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE"" is a glorious example of exceptional production design, excellent cinematography, wonderful special effects and CGI-created characters, incredible fight choreography, swordplay, stunts, great music, dazzling costumes, fantastic characterizations, and, most important of all, the film (for the most part) stays close to the book written by C.S. Lewis. The film is set during World War II. It is the epic story of the four Pevensie children - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). They enter the land of Narnia through a mysterious wardrobe. There they do battle with the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), become friends with a faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), and have dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French). To the fans of the books, such as my own humble self, the movie will leave you in complete awe and amazement. To the ones who have not yet read the books, it may confuse you, but it will soon transfix you to the seat. All the acting is magnificent, especially with Georgie Henley, James McAvoy, Tilda Swinton, and the voice talent of Liam Neeson. Each of their characters resonate with such power and personality that it is impossible for you not to be amazed. Henley plays Lucy with a great sense of innocence and courage, having the best performance in the entire film. To me, having read all the books, Lucy is the central character. In my opinion, she is really the only character the audience can totally identify with throughout the series. Director Andrew Adamson seems to notice this, and being one of the script-writers, he uses the other characters, dialogue, and situations to be mainly formed around her role in the film. Maybe that is why Henley is perfect for the part. Let's hope everything stays this way (with her character at least) through the remaining films. McAvoy portrays Mr. Tumnus as a true patriot, fighting for his Narnia. He is ordered to turn in Lucy to the Witch, but Lucy is probably his only friend, and he has high hopes for a peaceful and just Narnia. His character's feelings and beliefs are just a few examples of those of every Narnian exhibited in the film. McAvoy's performance is amazing in its brilliance. Tilda Swinton is magnificently evil, a trait that can only be found in the White Witch, like something chiseled out of ice (pun intended). Her performance is simply perfect. Neeson's voice as Aslan fills the theater with booming presence and deep resonance, yet its own calm and quiet assurance. I never knew that just a voice from such an accomplished actor could inhabit a CGI-created character so well, not to mention the superior animation of the character itself. However, the entire cast is sensational. Keynes, Popplewell, Moseley, Winstone, French, and others are almost as incredible as the film's best performances. The kids are not confused or disoriented about what they must do, they just do it because they know it's inevitable. The Witch just oozes with so much evil that even the words I am using in this review cannot describe it. Another cast member that I must mention specifically is Jim Broadbent as Professor Digory Kirke. He is the only character on this side of the wardrobe (besides the kids) that has truly great acting talent. I see the Professor as their Earthly guidance, while Aslan is the perfect counterpart as their Narnian guidance. Both of the characters are the symbol of strength for the children - what binds them together and keeps them true to each other. It is really Peter and Susan's discussion with Professor Kirke that shows them that you do not have to do anything but believe. Listen for Rupert Everett in a small but heroic role as the Fox, watch for James Cosmo as Father Christmas. One last comment on the acting - I am always floored by how well the mannerisms, dialogue, and characters of the four main cast members matches up with their older counterparts. Also surprising is how fantastic the acting talents of the actors and actresses that played the older versions of the children are, even though they do not have much screen time. Definitely one of the greatest sequences in the film is the battle between the Narnians and the forces of the Witch. I adore the action sequences, especially the ones in this final confrontation. And, if you believe in the allegories between the Chronicles of Narnia and the Holy Word of God (like myself), the scene where Aslan is one-on-one with the Witch will have particular meaning for you. A wonderful film.<br/><br/>Also Recommended: STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002), LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING (2003), PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)<br/><br/>THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE PAST, PRESENT, OR FUTURE ""CHRONICLES OF NARNIA"" UNIVERSE."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","30 March 2009"," A CGI Adaptation
","Adapting a fantasy novel on screen is no easy task. Some succeed while others fail. I doubt this movie will be remembered in the coming decades mostly because it falls short in execution. 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was one of my favourite books as a child and thus seeing it this way on screen did not exactly please me but the film is far from awful.<br/><br/>The pacing seems a little uneven. At times it looks rushed and at times it moves at a lethargic speed. Many of the characters lack the charm they had in the book. The Santa Claus character was very irritating. Edmund was portrayed as plain dumb. It is sometimes doubtful whether the lack of charm is mainly due to the poor acting. Of the four young protagonists, I was only impressed by Georgie Henley who played Lucy Pevensie. Jim Broadbent and James McAvoy shine in small roles. I had my reservations about Tilda Swinton as the witch but after seeing the movie I can agree that she was rightfully cast. She looks quite yummy too.<br/><br/>Now one of the major issues is the poor special effects. The characters are designed with detail but the stop motion, blue screen filter and the setting of them against the backdrop is painfully visible and takes away largely from the authenticity. It's nothing like the enchanting world in 'King Kong', 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Stardust' where the viewer feels involved.<br/><br/>Those who haven't read the novel beforehand might enjoy the film more than us. In spite of my criticism, it's not a terrible movie. It's passable entertainment if you have 2 and a half hours to spare."

The Harry Potter movies are infinitely better and more enjoyable. They release numerous movies very similar to these and they just aren't interesting or exciting. I'm not sure what the film makers were trying to achieve with this movie, but its pretty obvious that they didn't have high goals for the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether it is just due to a bad plot (then you have to blame the book) or whether it was just made poorly. Either way (or both) the movie is still a very boring and uninteresting try-hard kids movie.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people have enjoyed this movie - but I still don't see what is good about it. As i said - its not horrible - but its even remotely good either - so why should you watch it? And the stupid - cliché happy ending, really annoyed me. I don't mind a happy ending (the Da Vinci Code for instance), but a stupid childish boring happy ending which you can think up in two seconds really annoyed me.<br/><br/>To sum it up: its a movie that is not funny, not interesting, not exciting, not anything good.

","The fantasy genre provides us with a way of viewing the universal conditions of the world, the environment, governments, and other large-scope subjects with an objective eye. Somehow, all we seem to get out of it nonetheless is the spectacle of these stories, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Northern Lights series, the Narnia series. There is a lot more that could be done with The Chronicles of Narnia. I am not sure of whether or not I'm talking about the original work by C.S. Lewis as well as this film version or just the latter, because I have never read the books. From what I've seen here, and thus from what the new generation of children are seeing, is innocent abandon. There is no real import in the concept of a wardrobe that arbitrarily leads into an alternate world without humans full of mythological creatures and talking wolves and beavers.<br/><br/>I feel as if the concept should've been put in the hands of Neil Gaiman, who once wrote a novel told from the point of view of a bus. I am thrilled by the idea of a humanless world, but not by populating it with humans. I enjoyed the non-human characters, and I enjoyed the audacity of the filmmakers who allowed Tilda Swinton's witch to be a truly vicious villain, an icy, power-hungry and completely ruthless baddie. I was affected by a scene between her and Aslan, a wise and idealistically good lion, and I can imagine how much children would be bothered by it. But for what? Is this the three English siblings' fortunate escape from the harrowing WWII from which they've been sent away by their mother?<br/><br/>Everything about the story seems entirely unsystematic and with no real underpinnings, except that Aslan seemingly represents Christ for devout Christian C.S. Lewis. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch as if to represent Satan. Why does time go on in Narnia and when the siblings return to the reality of the British manor home they have only spent a few seconds of reality? Why is the alternate reality called Narnia? It is all a haphazard succession of building blocks leading to what to which all of the fantasy adventures lead: the big battle between these creatures and those creatures. Pure good and pure evil. Black and white. Love and hate. More diverting scapegoating and jingoism for the kids who recently lost their father and are only left to bicker with themselves till they stumble upon a parallel world, which to them is an emotional distraction more than anything else. They could make their goals to retreat back into the wardrobe, but they would rather consume themselves with drama that is far removed from their own. Is there anything wrong with that? No, it's natural. But why would fantasy settle on such common human weaknesses when it supposedly transcends every other everyday convention?<br/><br/>It's a kids' movie where you're not supposed to think and you're not supposed to do anything but escape for two hours and return to your life afterward. That is not the way we are supposed to look at things. We cannot turn our minds off, no matter how hard we try. Children absorb everything. They absorb histrionics and dramatics. One appeal of the story could be that its magic and myth are determined not by the arbitrary world-building technicalities that many fantasy writers pull from their sleeves, though that certainly still occurs here as much as in Tolkien or Rowling's stories, but by the markedly English tenacity of the human kids. I do love that this film, like countless other kids' movies, humanizes and familiarizes animals of all kinds. But the story offers not much in the way of acceptance or moral dichotomies."

","Slightly better than i though it would be, but still rather forgettable. I think this film works really well as long as it doesn't try to be epic. The relationship between Lucy and Mr. Tumbus. (and isn't that a cozy home he has, quite like imagined) also pproved. The relationship between the kids has its moments, approved too, especially as long as they are in England (the two younger kids being much more likable then Susan and Peter). And Narnia as longs as its swept with snow. Badgers. White Witch. Definitely approved. Now, the second half doesn't suck or anything. But it doesn't really sparkle with creativity. Where is that special realionship between Asland and the girls? And Where is the lions sense of humour? Does everything have to be so squeaky clean in a Disney film and wasn't that battle corny? It works. But not much more."

","""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" Movie Review;<br/><br/>The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis is about four children who get sent away to live with a professor because of the war. One day when they are bored they decide to play hide and go seek. Lucy discovers the magical forest of Narnia inside of the wardrobe where she is hiding. In Narnia she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus and has tea with him. When she gets back into the normal world her brothers and sister do not believe her, and she has to prove to them that Narnia is a real. And that is where the children's adventures begin in the land of Narnia. <br/><br/>In my opinion I thought the movie was very entertaining. This movie did a very good job at representing Lewis' book. I enjoyed the fighting scenes and all of the mythological creatures. Also the graphics and costumes were well done. The music and dramatization of the events made this movie even better than the book.

The landscape and everything was overdone, and it looked fake.<br/><br/>2. The end battle was overdone.<br/><br/>3. At least one of the children looked different to how they looked before (for example, in the book, Lucy had black hair, not brown).<br/><br/>However, some of the things that happened in the film worked very well. All the main actors and actresses were good, the CGI worked well and was very effective, the people who voiced the CGI characters did well and the way the story was shortened worked as it should have done, although some of the film seemed a bit rushed at points, but the whole film would have seemed even longer if they had lengthened scenes.<br/><br/>You probably know the story, four children are evacuated to the country in the time of WWII, they find a wardrobe that leads to another world, they meet a lion called Aslan and they meet an evil witch.

","Being a fan of this book, I found ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" to be a great film version. It stuck to the story and events in the novel very well. A story like this deserves to have big-budget companies like Disney and Walden Media to make it into a great movie. The filmmakers obviously went to great lengths to find child actors that actually seemed like real children, unlike many of the young performances in films and on TV today. Liam Neeson is also the perfect voice for Aslan, the king and hero of the story (the lion of the title). Tilda Swinton is also well-cast as the White Witch; it takes a good actress to pull off an evil character like her's. Being a Christian, I love the spiritual allegory of Jesus Christ portrayed as Aslan in this film, showing the saving power and redemption He brings. It's a great film that accurately follows the original C.S. Lewis book. Some of the battle scenes at the end are a bit too long, and some of the attempts at humor in the film are too lame and annoying, both of which prevent this from being a perfect movie. Nevertheless, this is a very exciting, touching, and happy film, with a great spiritual message as well. I'm not a big fan of fantasy films, and I still enjoy it.

It is too long to be a kids movie, and too cheesy and corny to be a grown up movie. There are way too many tears in this movie, and sobby music, which really gets to you eventually. Some of the lines are so cliché that you will already know how a whole conversation will go the second it is started. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton does a pretty good job acting, and James McAvoy for the short time he's in the movie, and thats as far as it goes for good acting on the part of actors in the movie; the rest of the acting is accomplished by the voice actors like Liam Neeson and Ray Winstone. <br/><br/>The only actual good part of the movie was the end. It did have some pretty cool action scenes and graphics, as well as a little twist in the last minute.<br/><br/>Overall I didn't regret watching this movie, but if you're into fairytale type fantasy movies, some better alternatives are The Golden Compass, obviously Lord of the Rings and obviously Harry Potter."

","It needs better music, and the character's personalities are twisted up too much for my taste my taste. It had good effects, but seeing that it's based on a book, I don't believe they should carry the weight of a movie. Aslan needed to be much greater. The book refers to him as ""good and terrible."" The children would ""catch a glimpse of the golden mane, and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn't look at him and went all trembly."" The Aslan in this movie looks like a realistic, sad little Lion. This movie needed more imagination.

Everything else is great though. The four children are very well cast, but they did not achieve the huge amount of popularity as with the kids from Harry Potter. Aslan is amazing, the special effects and Liam Neeson's great voice brought him to life in a momentous way. The costumes, makeup and settings are amazing. They create a whole new world, just like LOTR did. The last battle is one of my favourite moments in film ever.

And failed spectacularly.<br/><br/>The story (after the novel suffered the usual hack n slash for time constraints) is lukewarm and the actors (all but Tilda Swinton) are at best deficient at worst they are not actors at all.<br/><br/>The children are especially unconvincing (if you compare them with the actors in the Harry Potter movies, you shall spot the difference immediately) Direction is neither bad nor good the director fails to visualise the fairy tale land in Lewis' novels (and in the BBC series), there is nothing in scenes which screams NARNIA.<br/><br/>A combination of both bad acting and so-so direction, there are scenes where you should hold your breath as adrenalin gushes into your veins, but their movie adaptation simply bores you to sleep.<br/><br/>Musicwise, there isn't a proper music-score, nothing which this movie can be identified by, as is the case with Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The only reason I am giving it 3 is for a good performance by Swinton (a good Shakespearean actress), and for some good choices (again for Swinton as Jadis) made by the vestiary.

But I'm also an actress and ever since I've moved from stage to film I've found a greater respect for the art. It's not fair at all to expect the film makers to make a movie exactly like the book. It gives them no room to breathe or use their imagination. Which is why we're all in this business: so we can be the creative people we are. I'm perfectly fine, especially with this movie, if the overall feeling that the book gives when all is done stays the same. And it did. It's perfect. I still have that same rush and happiness that I feel every time I finish the books.<br/><br/>And to another very rude comment about the Stone Table scene. Hello!!! Of course it's going to seem like The Passion!! It's a symbol of the death of Christ.<br/><br/>Now onto the actual film. I thought it was incredible. The acting was very impressive, especially the children. I really felt like I entered a magical land. Everything was just amazing. That's all I can say. I am definitely looking forward to seeing more in years to come."

","Tried watching this film on Vongo (downloaded to PC) and a great deal of the movie is shot in such low light that the screen is literally black with some vague gray shapes (for long periods of time}. I'm not sure a television format would be an improvement. While this is otherwise a fine movie, the unrelenting darkness is downright annoying. I am not sure what all this realism is in aid of - if we were there in the flesh, rather than watching a movie, our eyes would adjust to the darkness and we'd see much more. One or two short scenes of such dark moments would be acceptable, but watching the movie with one's ears for 10 and 15 minute hauls again and again seems excessive."
"stuffkikker","3","0","0","10 October 2006"," Wonderful animations, pathetic acting.
","I must admit in advance that I am not too big a fan of Disney. I enjoy most of their cartoons, and especially their collaborations with Pixar (Finding Nemo, the Incredibles) are among my favorite movies, though as soon as real actors get involved, I have always felt Disney was playing outside it's league.<br/><br/>This movie is a prime example of it.<br/><br/>The animations are superb. As are the outfits worn by the colorful creatures that inhabit Narnia. Visually, I'd give this movie 9/10.<br/><br/>However, the story was utter crap. I am not familiar with the original story by C.S. Lewis, and I'm sure it's a fun read, but what is presented in this movie is but a series of hollow cliché's, worn out adventure-movie sequences tied together with a very meager excuse for some background legend about some king who vanished for a hundred years (why?), the occasional referral to 'ancient magic' to excuse for unnecessary twists in the plot (without this 'ancient magic' actually giving body to the atmosphere. It's only used as a sort of 'deus ex magina' to justify stupid plot lines), and totally over-the-top relational issues between the siblings. The movie just overflows with melodrama, every character is a cliché to the point where it is just obnoxious, and especially the main characters made me feel sick. please! I cannot even begin to describe how poor these characters where written, which is only surpassed by how poorly they were executed! The casting was horrible (except for the little girl and some of the narnia-inhabitants), the acting utter disgrace. Not only do over half of all their actions (by whatever human actor that is) make no sense (there is simply no motivation for them other than the melodramatic effect.. especially the ice-queen is just .. dumb!), and all the acting that is in place lacks any conviction. The older boy supposedly growing from hesitation to bold courage, yet neither of these states come across, nor is the transition catalyzed properly (he just accidentally kills a bad guy, and all of a sudden is a fearless slayer of animated creates, even though there is not the least bit of warrior aura about this guy). The only thing convincing was the abundance of tears by the youngest girl, but than again, Disney specializes in that. Although again, over half of those were totally uncalled for.<br/><br/>This movie is good for kids. Wonderful even. Were I a 6-12 year old boy, I would have watched this movie 4 times a day for a week if I could. But for adults who actually prefer fantasy movies to be inspiring and have a captivating story, intriguing characters, all brought with proper pace and passion, skip this one. Seriously. They should have just made this an all animated feature.<br/><br/>3/10"

I wasn't as excited about seeing it as I was with other movies, but now I am glad that I hadn't missed this in the theaters. <br/><br/>It started out with the air-raids... and this particular scene told me this film was going to be interesting, so my bored expectations were only shattered by a quarter. I was fully watching the movie after this scene. After the air-raids, the Pevensies are getting ready to leave their mother and when the train starts leaving the station, hauntingly beautiful music plays, and the rest of my bored expectations were shattered. I was transfixed!! <br/><br/>From then on I was given a beautiful rendition of the book in this surround-sound theater. You would expect that right after the second scene I would think the rest of the movie was horrible, but on the contrary... I dared not blink for I was afraid I would miss anymore of this beauty. This movie kept me watching until the end, and caused me to find myself sitting in my seat in shock. I was THAT surprised. <br/><br/>The music is beautiful. The make-up, the CG effects, the animals were so realistic... I didn't once find them fake. The acting is superb and this movie is such an awesome replica of the book. There is some creative aspects that weren't exactly also in the book, which made it that much better. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this to big fantasy fans (and even SLIGHT fantasy fans) and children.

"mendy66","3","0","0","27 September 2006"," Limp, Flabby and not much fun
","Narnia is a paint-by-number Disney children's movie, and not a very interesting one at that. The characters are uniformly dull and lifeless, except for the little girl, who was a real charmer. I was particular put off by the Liam Neeson's flat, ponderous voice of the lion. In a better movie, the lion would have roared, and the wicked witch would have hammed it up a bit an at least looked like she was having fun doing all those dastardly deeds. Tilda Swinson, always a staid, drab and colorless actress, was her usual drab, staid and colorless self. The special effects were routine. How many times are we supposed to be in awe of seeing animals' mouths move as they speak? The story was nonexistent. There is no explanation given for why the witch does the dastardly deeds or how thing came to be as they were. You would at least expect that in a children's movie, the children would learn some basic lesson about life, about growing up, etc. Here, there is nothing but pure child fantasy. The boys get to vicariously lead and army and fight with a sword and the girls get to vicariously become queen of the realm. There no learning, no awe, no magic, no nothing."
"wtjw","10","0","0","26 September 2006"," Nice to see an accurate movie.
","After the BBC and PBS put out a nice, but woefully non-technical, theatrical edition of the chronicles, this movie is a breath of fresh air. If Clive Staples were alive today I think he would applaud the movie. Though there were two divergences from the original book, everything else seems to be covered. In a day and age when flow is more important than accuracy, Disney has surprised me. Still reading this book set to your children, I feel, is as essential as The Hobbit, and The Ring Trilogy by JRR Tolkien. I sincerely hope that Disney decides to make a movie on the rest of the 6 books in the Chronicles of Narnia. My daughter really enjoyed the movie too, but as a parent I would definitely wait until the child is over 6 to see the movie as there are some scary parts for anyone younger and some of it is rather difficult to understand for a younger child. All in all though a thoroughly enjoyable movie."
"Nicol_Bolas","8","0","0","25 September 2006"," Not a Perfect Adaptation, but Good Enough
","Chalk up another one for quality book-to-movie adaptations (if only video game-to-movie ones had similar success).<br/><br/>Unlike the fairly realistic Lord of the Rings, the Chronicles of Narnia have always been on the light side of fantasy. Indeed, LWW reads as much like a fairytale than anything else.<br/><br/>This live-action adaptation strays from its light-hearted roots, but only slightly and occasionally. If you're looking for a literal adaptation, with every cherished scene and bit of narration in place, look elsewhere. LotR fans had to give up Tom Bombadil, and what they got was nothing short of a masterwork of cinema.<br/><br/>LWW isn't quite that, but it is a very enjoyable film. I'm fairly accepting of changes with regards to the adaptation process, so I don't have problems with most of the changes. A couple of them, however...<br/><br/>One major plot point that was somehow scrubbed out was the issue surrounding the Turkish Delight. It's never said, nor really intimated, that this is enchanted food, that it creates an addiction that Jadis uses to control Edmund with. It really damages Edmund's motivation for his betrayal. And the worst part is that all they needed was about 5 seconds of dialog from Mr. Beaver explaining his suspicions about having eaten of her food. That alone would get the audience thinking that there was something up with the food that was giving Jadis some control over Edmund. Granted, I've read the book, so I could understand his motivation, but I could also understand why someone else wouldn't.<br/><br/>Then we come to the wolves, particularly Fenris Ulf, or as they pointlessly renamed him for the film, Maugrim. The scene where he gets killed in the book is very fast, very sudden. In the movie, it's much slower paced, and not entirely convincing that he would just throw himself at Peter, who has his sword drawn and aimed straight at him. Maugrim basically committed suicide, with Peter holding the blade.<br/><br/>The other small issue I have is with the Professor. In the movie, he seemed very much like he knew that the wardrobe held powers, that there was something about it. However, in the book, he seemed more like the kind of guy who, while not knowing much about the house, would nevertheless not be surprised in the least if a portal to a magical land were somewhere around. This seems like a rather needless change to me.<br/><br/>Not all of the changes were bad. Indeed, I would say that most of the changes were improvements, even on some things that I hadn't considered back 15 years ago when I read the book.<br/><br/>Susan, for example, wasn't really a character in the book. Oh, she was there. But she didn't really do anything. Indeed, I can imagine CS Lewis looking at a draft of LWW and wondering how to get rid of Susan without screwing up the poetry of ""Two Sons of Adam and Two Daughters of Eve."" But, of course, he couldn't, so she had to hang around.<br/><br/>In the film, she gets at least some character. Since they had to follow the book, they couldn't give her too much to do, but she has a character at least. She's ""logical"" (and says it more times than Spock, without being annoying about it) and rational. She's the one who keeps telling them to leave.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, all of them, save Lucy, have a general reluctance to take part in defending Narnia. Which makes lots of sense; in the book, they just seem to go along with it. In the movie, once they get Edmund back, they start deciding to simply leave.<br/><br/>Which gives Edmund to show off his character growth as he says that they have to stay. That he's seen what Jadis can do, that he's helped her do it. A great moment in the film, as shades of King Edmund the Just emerge.<br/><br/>And I am thankful that they were able to find a way to ditch Father Christmas's awful line, ""Battles are ugly when women fight,"" while still retaining the character. A line so bad that I shuddered at it when I read it 15 years ago.<br/><br/>Which at last brings us to Jadis, Queen of Narnia. Everything about her, from design to acting, is perfect. The dresses she wears, her hairstyle, Tilda Swanson's brilliant acting, everything is designed to evoke a certain sense of the character, and they work brilliantly.<br/><br/>Two things of note in this regard. One is her wand. I always imagined something along the lines of a short stick. You know, a Harry Potter-style wand, as depicted in all kinds of old fairy tales and Disney movies. That's not Jadis's wand anymore.<br/><br/>No, this is a short staff, designed to evoke her powers. It's more of a think scepter, but who cares what it's called; it looks great on film. It looks like an icicle with metal wrapped around it. It is a great device, wielded magnificently by Tilda Swanson.<br/><br/>The other thing about Jadis is her fighting. After her wand is broken (and she stabs the remains into Edmund who broke it. Excellent idea), she starts dual-wielding swords. In the book, she's supposed to fight Peter with some knife. I agree with the filmmakers on this point. The grace and elegance of her movements is just astonishing to watch. This isn't some pseudo-wuxia-style fight, nor is it something out of Jackson's LotR. No, this is a style all its own, and it works magnificently.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of LWW, watch this movie if you're the least bit open-minded about adaptational changes. If you're not a fan, watch it anyway; it works well as a movie."

","Chronicles of Narnia, a movie that will stay with me forever and ever. Why do I say that? Well it gave me back a memory that I had all but forgotten. The memory of seeing the cartoon with my grandmother when I was a little girl.<br/><br/>Starting off in the United Kingdom, four children named Peter (William Moseley), Lucy (Georgie Henley) Susan (Anna Popplewell), and Edmund Pevensie (Skandar Keynes) are in the crossfire of a war between Americans and the Nazi troops of Hitler. They are shuffled out of their home in London to a country home of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent).<br/><br/>Once there they find that life there is very dull and bleak. Until the youngest child, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that takes her to an enchanted forest ruled by an evil witch. Right from the start she makes a friend of Mr. Tumnus,(James McAvoy)the Faun. She goes back and tells the tale, but her siblings don't believe her.<br/><br/>That is until the second youngest child, Edmund, follows his sister to the forest. Once there he meets the evil white witch (Tilda Swinton) and her coachman Ginarrbrik (Kiran Shah). The witch gives Edmund something to eat and drink and then allows him to leave.<br/><br/>One day later all four children go to the forest, thanks to Edmund and a fly away racket ball that flew into the window and broke an armor suit. Once there they go and find out that Lucy's friend, Mr. Tumnus, was taken by the white witch, for treachery. They then meet up with Mr. Beaver (Ray Winstone) and his wife Mrs. Beaver (Dawn French).<br/><br/>Edmund goes to the white witch's castle, only to be disappointed and captured by her. You see, she wants to make the prophecy which tells of two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam coming to Narnia to stop evil and make peace happen again not happen. Edmund meets Mr. Tumnus and then he is whisked away to find his family.<br/><br/>The beavers take Peter, Susan, and Lucy to see Alsan (Liam Neeson), the great lion. He will help them in getting back their brother. The white witch kills Aslan, only Aslan doesn't die, he is brought back, because he wasn't a traitor.<br/><br/>The climax of the film shows Peter, Edmund, Aslan, Susan and Lucy fighting the White Witch (with a wide assortment of creatures called Hags, Red and Balck dwarfs, Centaurs, Fauns, Satyrs, Cheetahs, foxes and wolves.) and winning back the peace of Narnia. Fifteen years later they are riding threw the woods, looking for a white stag. Lucy finds the way back to the wardrobe and they return to their young selves. The ending shows the Professor telling Lucy that she cannot get back into Narnia. That he already tried that and it didn't work.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be a good memory for both young and old audiences. It doesn't only give memories, but it brings back old ones. It is fun for the entire family, old and young. I had to give this film an 8 out of 10. Can't wait for the second one to come out."

","As an adult, I found this feature pretty boring. But as I watched it, I had to remember something I forgot - and that was - what it was like to be young. The movies I found intriguing like ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" didn't do a thing for my parents, but they love me loving it. This is the perfect film for young people as well movie - full of fantasy, wonder and good special effects.<br/><br/>This is a film about children who find another world in their a wardrobe closet. This world, is fraught with problems, similar to the 'real world' the children come from. BUt in this world, they are the ones that can control the destiny. Huge wardrobe closets were abundant in my neighborhood and as a child, they seemed so big and had clothes that went on forever in them. Having siblings, it did present the perfect place to play or to get lost. I could have imagined that on the other side of this closet is a whole new world that to survive, needs my brothers and sisters help and as a family we'd have the power to save it. And we'd be the Kings and Queens of it. First, we'd have to be a tighter knit family to get it done, and that message is pretty clear in this film. Nice.<br/><br/>Beyond that, there's nothing more of this film. Yes, there are references to ""the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve"" as in reference to Adam and Eve from the Christian Bible - but that was really of no consequence to me. With all the things that were running around, you could have named the children ""of anything"" and it would have worked. I found no Christian religious beating over the head in this film. To be honest, this film is similar to the ""Harry Potter"" series to me, without a lot of the magic references, but with the same talking and human qualities given to wild animals and good vs. evil themes.<br/><br/>The White Witch was as mean as a witch would be from your childhood and the children and tweens responded to several instances in this film like...children and tweens would have in those situations. As an adult watching, I would have handled many of those things differently - tougher, more mature - but again, you have to keep in mind, these were children. And they did just fine for the material.<br/><br/>A nice film for older children and young tweens who like adventure and fantasy."

I really liked those two movies. After hearing he was going to direct a movie in person, I thought I should may as well check it out. The guy has great talent. I really liked the voices too. Michael Madsen does the voice of Maurgimn the Wolf. Why his name isn't credited in the credits, i'll never know. Michael Madsen does excellent as Maugrim. Really suited his voice. Liam Neeson does the voice of Aslan. Let me tell you, there couldn't of been a better person to do his voice. Brian Cox was recently going to do Aslan's voice. I'm glad they stopped that. I also really like Tilda Swinton who plays the White Witch. She was ugly (no offense) and very wicked looking. She suited the White Witch too. The battle scenes are also excellent. I recommend this to anyone who's a fan on the C.S. Lewis book or the actors. Also recommendable if you like Andrew Adamson's work.

The huge success of The Lord Of The Rings only made my fears bigger. But then the film came out and that was a real smash! Everything is excellent here - young children, beautiful British nature, absolutely excellent role of Tilda Swinton as The White Witch (she is so terrible and beautiful at the same time that you feel that the Evil really may be disguised as an angel of light), the impeccable video effects.

","I never saw this movie in theaters. I expected it to be a cheap, children's version of Lord of the Rings, but when it showed up at the local rental store I figured I'd give it a shot.<br/><br/>Narnia has got heart, that's the first thing I'll give it. This shows through in the interaction from the four kids, who IMO give realistic performances as really being brothers and sisters.<br/><br/>The acting is also quite good. Edmund was probably the best; he starts out as selfish and rude, and during the course of the film he becomes brave and responsible. Also, Lucy is about the cutest, most adorable kid on screen that I've seen in a while, and she is quite believable. Susan and Peter were good, but they fall short when compared to Edmund and Lucy. I believe this is because they didn't get to flesh out their characters as much as the younger two.<br/><br/>The visuals in the film are spectacular. There are a few minor points where you can tell its CGI, but these are extremely minor details and I'm being nit-picky. Everything looks brilliant though, the locales in which the movie was filmed were well thought-out. The world of Narnia is a bright, colorful and interactive place.<br/><br/>As for all this talk about Narnia VS. LOTR, they are two very different films, with Narnia perhaps geared more in the children's direction. I'd have to say that I prefer Narnia, but maybe it's because I'm worn-out on LOTR.<br/><br/>Narnia is a great film that will probably appeal to children of all ages, and I think that any teenager or adult with any bit of childhood still left in their heart will enjoy this movie too.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars."

I am always picky when it comes to movies being made into books though, yet when I saw the Chronicles of Narnia the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, I really liked it. Yes, they did change some parts in the movie, some scenes from the book that they put in the movie were changed around a bit, but they only cut out parts from the book that were only really minor and not that necessary. Otherwise the whole story and the characters (their personalities and how they looked) were very true to the book. I especially thought the actors who played the four children and the actress who played the white witch did a really good job, the way they acted was pretty close to how I imagined them in the book. The visual effects and the whole set design of the movie was absolutely gorgeous and well done, WETA digital once again did job, though I still think their best was with Lord of the Rings (in my opinion). The costumes were alright; they weren't the best medieval clothes I've seen, though I liked the royal clothing the four children wore. Anyway, I think those who are fans of the Chronicles of Narnia or who have read the books and like the stories will like this movie as well. I wonder if they'll make movies out of the rest of the series."

But when I saw this I just found the ambiance and feel way different from the book. First off it was made by Disney and made as an 'action adventure movie'and it was Just really unfaithful to the book for instance In the novel peter stabs and attacking wolf guard with his sword and this this is a sign of him growing up and becoming a man but in the Disney version to escape the wolf guards Peter stabs his sword into a frozen waterfall unleashing a torrent of water, washing the wolves away whilst he escapes clinging on to a floating block of ice.

","I haven't read the Narnia books so I didn't know what to expect about the movie. Surprisingly, The Witch, The Lion and The Wardrobe was an enjoyable and lovely picture. It was not the best fantasy film I have seen but I liked it very much.<br/><br/>The story was very typical but well-made and compelling. There were some very impressive and touching scenes although some of them were too scary for kids. It's same with Potter movies: they're meant for children but sometimes, at their scariest moments, you start to think if they're really suitable for kids. Or maybe I just overreact. Anyway, this movie really made a huge impact to me.<br/><br/>Especially I liked the warmth of the story. It was visually stunning and good-looking but it also had a heart and a soul. I really cared the characters and felt sadness and joy when they felt it too. That's something that you don't find the Potter movies. Also the world of Narnia was charming and full of the sense of wonder. It was very easy to me to be wrapped up in this magical land of miracles.<br/><br/>Kids were good in their roles. Also Tilda Swinton was excellent as the White Witch. I liked the way she played the role: no shouting or exaggerating looks but unassuming and well-balanced performance which made her character very scary. Instead, Jim Broadbent was just the annoying professor.<br/><br/>However, the movie was not perfect. I think it was quite over-long. Especially in the middle of the movie story didn't seem to move on. Also some of the funny lines were unnecessary and even stupid. I was not satisfied the ending. It was too over the top. (Okay, this is the fantasy movie but still it was too silly, even for fantasy!)<br/><br/>Some of viewers have criticized The Witch,etc. because its Christianity. Well, I'm not a devout Christian and I don't like too religious movies. Still, I didn't feel Narnia's Christianity irritating or too preaching. I think it was well integrated to the story and filmmakers didn't underline it too much. Besides, the movie can be watched even without thinking its Christian message.<br/><br/>Conclusion: The Witch, The Lion and The Wardrobe is better than most of Potter movies but cannot match the LOTR -trilogy."

","I was eagerly awaiting this film. Sadly, it disappointed me. The special effects were wishy-washy. Sometimes they would epic(Aslan, the battle) sometimes they were less than believable(The fox and the beavers mostly). The acting was good,Edmund and Lucy were phenomenal(I still don't believe that Georgie Henly had never acted a day in her life before this). Peter was good, but you can only act so good to a sub-par script. Susan annoyed me, she wasn't that annoying until later books. The witch was a good actress, but the way they made her look is ridiculous. Tumnus reminded me of a child molester, the way he looked at Lucy creeped me out. Aslan was wonderfully voiced by Liam Neeson, he lifted the entire movie. Oreius was a good addition to cast as well. The costumes were like the special effects, Great(The entire Narnian army)and terrible(The Witch's dresses, enough said.). Overall, Narnia is a hard movie to judge. With signs of being great, and signs of being terrible. The battle at the end was a good action scene, it lifted the movie along with Aslan. Crossing my fingers for Prince Caspian."
"Neviar","3","0","0","1 June 2006"," A Complete Trainwreck
","This movie is a real disappointment. It is boring, lackluster, and missing something. Every moment is a moment of agony, as the movie never delivers that special element that captivates you like masterpieces such as Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings deliver. The movie overall pleases the simple-minded. For those of you who cannot think for yourselves, this is the movie for you. Generally, throughout the whole story, the movie tells you how to think and what to feel about each situation. This overall hold-your-hand approach to the story line leaves intelligent viewers bored and pleading for that something that will redeem this abysmal flick. Not only does it walk you through everything, but it tries to shove epic sequences down your throat every other minute of the movie. These frequent catastrophes just don't work at all. Each of these just leaves you with a more bitter taste than before and a growing opinion that Chronicles of Narnia is a movie that tries to be something it's not. It's no epic and it's nothing to stand up and cheer on any army for. In addition, the character development is so erratic that it never feels like any character are actually evolving, but instead assuming roles. I have to admit I only paid one dollar for the movie but I wish I had spent the money on four gumballs. I would have gotten tenfold more enjoyment out of those four gumballs than I got from this disaster of a movie."

","The movie was absolutely amazing, it was truly moving, with a wonderful score and true essence. I was rather disappointed of the comments people have made on this movie here at IMDb, since many missed the whole Biblical Symbolism that the movie wanted to represent. C.S. Lewis was a Christian Author, and the symbolism is very present in the movie, for example Christ Crucifixion, Death, Resurrection and Assention by Aslam being killed, then he was resurrected, and left at the end of the movie with the promise we will see him again. Also the stone table being cracked, same as in the Bible but it was not a stone table. Jesus is also represented in the Bilbe as a Lion from the Tribe of Judah. Or how about a girl out of curiosity opening up the wardrobe, which has a tree on it, and opening up another world (same in the Bible, Eve eating from the tree of good and evil and opening up this world to a new one, a sinful world). There are many more as well, but for now this will do. The whole point of the movie or the novel is to teach an important lesson, and I hate it that it is always compared to LOTR or Harry Potter, which have absolutely nothing good for our kids to teach morally except to entertain them to death.<br/><br/>The movie I give 10/10, it is truly remarkable and can't wait till the next Narnia movie will come out in 2007.<br/><br/>God bless."

","I haven't read the books, and my only relationship with Narnia is from the old BBC series. And upon viewing the movie, I had fair expectations for it. Sadly, Naria comes as a disappointment. First off, Naria is long. It drags in many places, and IMO it could easily be edited down half a hour or so without loosing any value. I'm not usually for trimming down the running time in favor for action and pace. But here I thought the running time ruined the experience for me. Secondly, the cast. I didn't care much for the four siblings. OK, Lucy was adoring, but that was about it. Aside from poor performances, I was never convinced that the fate of Narnia rested upon two skimpy boys and their sisters. Perhaps I'm missing the point, but the movie never gave me a good explanation of it either. It just seems hollow, like it cues up events from the books without proper care or meaning. And story aside, the movie is not that much of an excitement. Its visual, even with its impressive cgi characters and make up is too saturated and bright for my taste. Overall Narnia comes as an disappointment, with its running time as its biggest flaw"

","I heard a lot of praise about this movie and I'm into special effects and movies like this such as King Kong. I didn't think to see this in theaters because i thought it was a childish movie. To some extent it is a movie really built for a younger age group and one thing i wished to see was some more realism when some soldiers got killed but at the same time i didn't mind too much since the action had me hooked. I went into this movie expecting to be mildly entertained and i didn't think it could compare to King Kong or Harry Potter. Well I'll be the first to admit how wrong i was. The movie was just stunning in every aspect. The Visual effects were second only to King Kong but this movie didn't really stress Visual effects as much as King Kong did. The music i thought fit right into the Movie and especially in the scene before the big battle. The Action was good and every character was interesting and vital to making this movie the success that it is, from the Beavers to the children. The one character that stood out was Aslin the lion because he stole every scene he was in. C.S. Lewis made a great choice when he chose the lion because it signifies a majestic and honorable animal and by the end of the movie you won't see him as an animal but as a character just like the children. In the end, not every one will like this movie, not if your all into blood and gore or if you don't like a little childhood aspects to your movie, but at the same time if you like movies like this you would only hurt yourself by missing it. This was one of the best movies of last year. 9/10"

","Watching the Lord of the Rings movies, the problem I always had was I could never tell who anyone was exactly or what was happening exactly  all I knew is that there were hordes of demon baddies trying to bust down the castle door to get to some women and babies, so I rooted for the guys trying to stop that. With Narnia I had the opposite problem  everything that was happening was made obviously clear, but what was revealed was a story and world so fraught with logic questions, I was left as baffled as I was leaving Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>And what fundamental questions they are, like what is Narnia exactly and who lives in it  without knowing that, what's at stake when it's threatened? We never see any towns or ""normal"" inhabitants, only mythic-styled warriors who never do any real talking. What was it like before the White Witch arrived (other than not frozen)? Who is the White Witch and where did she come from  was she good before and turned bad? Who is Aslan the Lion? Was he a king or something before? I get that the White Witch is evil, because she sneers, and I get that Aslan is good because he has Liam Neeson's slow Scottish brogue and talks elliptically, but come on. There is a prophecy of course  as there always has to be in these movies, from Mannequin Skywalker (sorry, but Hayden Christiansen's performance reminded me of the ""Life of Brian"" catchphrase ""He's not the messiah - he's just a very naughty boy"") to KeaNeo Reeves in Da Matrix  but here in Narnia you have four children stumbling into a huge war-like situation they (and therefore we) have no understanding of whatsoever, and all the battle hardened warriors allow these untrained, unmotivated and confused CHILDREN to lead them into ACTUAL battle? With swords where they actually fight hand-to-hand and people actually die? Because of a prophecy? I dunno while maybe there's an Iraq allegory in there somewhere, with a major Christian right spin perhaps, this movie had me totally lost  and bored.<br/><br/>And one final question - the most incongruous of all  what on earth is Santa Claus doing in this Narnia world, and why is he handing out WEAPONS to children? I know this is a post 9-11 world, but since when does Santa give weapons? And while we're at it, why does the White Witch use the exact same sleigh/reindeer transport as Santa? None of this is explained. It's like why not toss in the Pillsbury dough boy, Bigfoot and the Easter bunny into the big battle? Honestly, why not?<br/><br/>I feel sorry for kids today, growing up watching sanctimonious ultra-violent junk like the Matrix trilogy, plot less I-own-a-visual-FX-company junk like the LOTR trilogy, numbing/dumbing action figure commercial junk like the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and now this.... Whew  okay, now I'll be good boy and go buy the Narnia toys and Taco Bell tie-ins and get really excited about Narnia II and III."

Although the costumes and creatures and such were good, everything always seemed to be much too shiny and colorful. If they were in such terrible times, why all the passionate colors and amazing sunlight on the days? Perhaps it's because The Chronicles of Narnia is much like The Lord of the Rings...for toddlers, that is. Not a very big fan of the acting, either.

Lewis' classic Christian fantasy about four British siblings who wander into an enchanted realm and of a boys' redemption through the sacrifice of a noble lion had been long contested prior to this film. Disney had always intended to produce this fantasy film but never did. Finally, in 2005 Walden Media Productions and director Andrew Adamson released this terrific and awe-inspiring movie, which, unlike many book-to-film adaptations, is faithful and stunning. Georgie Henley, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes and Anna Popplewell star as the Pevensie children Edmund, Lucy, Peter and Susan who during the 1940 Blitzkrieg over London are temporarily secluded in eccentric and affluent Professor Kirke's (Jim Broadbent) sprawling mansion. Lucy discovers a winter wonderland behind a closet/wardrobe and soon Peter discovers the same thing. But this enchanted world is under a dark spell..""It's always winter, but never Christmas"". The wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton) is contesting the right to rule the world and fighting a battle against the rightful king, the good lion Aslan. True to the novel in every aspect, this film is enjoyable as a fantasy for adults and for children. It is a long film and in fact December of '05 saw many long films including Harry Potter and King Kong. But you hardly feel the time go by as we journey into the heart of Narnia with the children. Peter learns a valuable lesson in love and sacrifice as Aslan offers to die in his place for his betrayal. Now, everyone who is deeply familiar with C.S. Lewis'works understand that this is a Christian allegory/fantasy. Lewis, a born-again Christian, created a Christ-like figure in Aslan, a sort of haphazard Judas in Peter, and a pagan Devil-Goddess in the WhiteWitch, though some would have it that he was attacking what we call the Goddess today. The children carry the film for the most part, despite the fact that this film relies heavily on computer-generated characters such as the Witch's wolves and the helpful beavers and other good-natured animals. The scenery is gorgeous. This film was shot in various location- the UK and New Zealand and studios. Some of what we see is pure computer animation, though by today's sophisticated standards, one hardly notices it and takes it for reality. The film wraps up nicely but mind you, the Narnia novels are a long series and there is already a sequel under way- Prince Caspian, said to be released in 2007."

Once meeting the creatures that live in Narnia the siblings soon discover that they are some kind of prophecy written heroes. The Kings and Queens of Narnia that are said to rid the Witch of her evil reign with the help of Aslan, the lion.<br/><br/>Narnia seemed like the perfect film of the year that had adventure, excitement, and fantasy all rolled into one entertaining film. Based on the books, which are loved by millions, Narnia had a huge step to overcome in pleasing it's devoted fans. It's too bad that in a world with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia is adventure-lite. It's scope seems bigger then what it's reality is. Even when judging it against another book turned film, Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia seems to be lagging behind in last place.<br/><br/>To begin with, the children are not likable at all. The little one who is suppose to be cute is annoying, the younger brother is a pain in the ass, the older sister has too little screen time to make any kind of connection, while the oldest is just too dumb. Not to mention that all the actors playing them were annoying to listen to. Other then the main characters, who we are stuck with no matter what. The supporting cast, the witch, the Faun and the deep and perfect voice of Aslan, Liam Neeson make up, a little bit, for what the children actors lack.<br/><br/>Nothing really exciting happen in the film. When you have a fantasy film such as this, that promises an adventure, you would expect something a little bit more then what the result is. It takes thirty some odd minutes for all the children to finally get into Narnia, after that they encounter a beaver and learn what the place is and who they supposedly are. After a quick run in with some wolves, and the younger brother in the hands of the witch, nothing else happens, save for the final battle. The kids are safe in their ""terrirtory"" where the heroes of the film train for the final battle. Then the final battle occurs, which is something right out of a card game Magic: The Gathering.<br/><br/>There's not too much of an emotional attachment to any of the characters, so when one is near death, we can't seem to care. This installment is a weak first entry to something that could be a successful series. Narnia does contain beautiful images, ranging from snowy mountain tops, to green valleys. It's a beautiful film, with great special effects, costume designs and set pieces. They have created a wonderful world where these creatures live in. Go into Narnia expecting a wild adventurous time, then you will be disappointed. Hoping to expect to see a massive battle scene, skip it, it can't hold a candle to anything that Jackson served us. See this, for beautiful images or if you're a fan of the material, whether you will be satisfied or not is up for debate, as I've never read the books."

That said, the acting of the humans was good, especially Georgie Henly as Lucy who really seemed to live the fantasy she was experiencing and the performance of Tilda Swinton as the Witch was memorable.

","As a parent, I deeply admire this film for adhering to a PG rating. It could have gone over the top in the battle scenes and with gore and completely ruined itself. Its jaw-dropping box office success was due to the fact that is was the best family film of 2005 and one of the better ones in many years.<br/><br/>Narnia's story is well known. Four young English children trying to escape World War II are sent to a large country home. There, they stumble upon an old wardrobe which leads them to the mythical land of Narnia, where strange and friendly creatures live. Narnia is cursed to a permanent winter while it is under the rule of the icy White Witch, devilishly played by Tilda Swinton. The four siblings soon find themselves in a battle for their own lives and for the very freedom of Narnia itself.<br/><br/>The parallels to LOTR are many, but Narnia comes across as LOTR-Lite. The battle scene at the end is exciting, not scary and Andrew Adamson has perfect sense in when to cut a scene and how far to take things. Yes, its frightening, but just enough.<br/><br/>And, as an allegory of the life of Jesus, it has a strong moral message that allows for some great conversation with your kids after the film.<br/><br/>Well made, wonderfully acted, good (but not great) FX, this is a film worth owning if you have kids, and maybe even if you don't. ***1/2 out of ****."

There had been previous cartoons and live action movies made, but with the new technology we have developed since then, I was anticipating this one being even better. I will admit that they changed certain scenes in comparison to the book and that was kind of a shame, but they did still do a pretty good job and the changes were not too bad.

","It could be that Narnia has had to follow up two fantasy hits such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, it could be that the book lacked in fire power, or it could be that the movie just wasn't done that well; but in any case Narnia fell short of expectations. Recently it seems to be en vogue to have children or teenagers playing the leads in fantasy movies (ala Frodo and Harry Potter), but what Narnia failed to do is make these children believable.<br/><br/>There was no transition from these kids' innocence and ignorance into courageous warriors and saviors. In Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam were never sure of themselves and they constantly exhibited inexperience throughout their goal to save middle earth. Harry Potter was always in need of help and he was not even the best magician in his class. But in the prophecy rich Narnia in which four humans were foretold to save the land, it seems all of the prognostication forced itself upon the somewhat unwilling heroes. First the siblings are bumbling around Narnia trying to stay alive as anyone would do in a foreign land, and then seemingly overnight the older brother is leading a major battle, the other brother is an integral part of that battle, while the two girls develop fearlessness of the foreign woods they are in.<br/><br/>The movie lacked intensity, there were never any white knuckle moments or hair raising events. The dialog was very generic and far from profound though one can infer that it was supposed to be, and the drama was mild even with the fate of an entire mythical land being in the hands of children. This was a kids movie dressed up as an adult one nothing more."

Watching them on the screen as an adult sadly disappoints I think, in part, because the sense of wonder is drowned by the heavy handedness of the material that a ten year old would likely not pick up (or ignore in favor of Lewis' wonderful sense of imagination). When Aslan said ""It is finished,"" I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. <br/><br/>The movie also suffers in comparison to the ""Lord of the Rings."" Once you've seen an army of Uruk-Hai and goblins, armies of minotaurs and tigers just look, well, silly.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Rent it.

","Well, what is there to say about this movie? It won an academy award for make up. It did better than Harry Potter in the box offices and in my opinion, it was better too. I loved all the characters and the special effects. My favorite character performances were Edmund (Skander Keynes) and Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). Even though they were all great. The voice was perfect for Aslan and they did a good job creating him. It was actually somewhat humorous too whenever the White Witches dwarf was in the scene. They did great with the animation. I actually thought the legs of Mr. Tumnus were real until I saw the bloopers and he was wearing those green pants. The setting was incredible too! I loved the snow scenes in the beginning but during the battle, that was a great location too. The stone table scene was frighting and it made you just want to take that knife and hurt the White Witch And the music was incredible! They did a really good job with that. I look forward to the next Chronicles of Narnia movie, but something tells me its not going to be as good as the original. So overall, this has to be my current favorite movie.

","I have many fond memories growing up of reading the seven books that make up the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series. So when I heard that they were making the first book into a film, I greatly anticipated its release. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the first of C.S Lewis's beloved books to be released on the big screen. With a great deal of reverence, and a very large budget, Disney and Walden Media magnificently bring the classic novel to life. The enchanting story opens with the four Pevensie siblings  Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy  being sent from London during the bombing raids by the Nazis during World War II, to a country estate to stay with an old professor, safe from the war. On a boring, rainy day they play a game of hide-and-seek in which Lucy (the youngest child) stumbles onto an old wardrobe she chooses to hide in. Backing deeper and deeper into it, much to her surprise, between the furry coats, she hits snow covered pine needles! Wandering out of the wardrobe, she discovers a lamp post aflame in the midst of these wintry woods. She meets there a faun, Mr. Tumnus, who explains to her a bit about this world called Narnia. Narnia is ruled by the cruel White Witch, and has been in a 100 year winter, with no Christmas. Eventually, all four children venture into the wardrobe doorway to Narnia, and Edmund is taken hostage by the self-entitled ""Queen of Narnia"", the White Witch. Her plan is to kill all four kids, because of the prophecy which tells that sons of Adam and daughters of Eve (humans) will arrive to challenge and end her reign. Pursued by her army, the children are aided by a couple of kindly beavers, who can talk of course. The four siblings are to take their rightful place on the throne to rule Narnia. So they go to meet the lion Aslan, the real King of Narnia, and assemble a large army to fight the White Witch and her grotesque minions. Great morals are in this film, such as courage, loyalty, and sacrifice. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was Oscar nominated three times this year, including Best Visual Effects. You will be excited to hear they are making the second book, Prince Caspian, into a full-length feature, due out in 2007. This perfect adventure movie for both adults and children is rated PG. *Note: read the books too!"

","When I first read the books as a child I thought, wow, no one will ever be able to make a movie from these books and be able to please me and keep Narnia alive. But Andrew Adamson and the entire cast and crew of Narnia have done exactly that. As soon as I saw the opening scene of the movie, chills literally ran down my spine. Never before have I been able to watch a movie over and over again and have the magic just as real as it was the first time. Like lots of people I was very nervous about people making a movie of this greatness but I was 100% pleased.

","I absolutely LOVED this movie- I have not been able to say that in a long while. As soon as it started, the environment, music- everything about it easily lulled me into a deep nostalgic peace. My favorite character was little Lucy. Georgie Henley acted absolutely brilliantly, and so did Skander Keynes (Edmund).<br/><br/>Sometimes the Christian undertones of the movie are a little more evident in some places than others, but to avoid spoilers in this review I will not expand on that thought. (though, griffins and phoenixes definitely wouldn't be Christian symbols- at least I doubt it) The only reason this movie escaped a 10, was because of what I considered some moments of cheesiness/choppiness within the main battle. It seemed to go slowly sometimes and it seemed there should've been more attack directed on the main characters (you would need to see the film to understand).<br/><br/>Aside from that, this movie is perfect, both for the young and the young at heart.<br/><br/>Having seen both the Lord of the Rings and Narnia, I'm going to say that LOTR is probably a more ""serious"" or ""mature"" film. Both, however, do have a central theme of the main character(s) having to take up a burden that at many times seems too heavy. The similarity, however, ends right there, and any comparisons to battles, plot, etc., are unfair to make."

","This is, simply put, a very entertaining movie (what I've always thought movies are supposed to be)! The story is intriguing, compelling, has its lighter moments and some darker ones, and is just a visual treat to watch.

"critical-escapist","8","0","0","8 April 2006"," One of those films that the majority can enjoy and not completely hate.
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an entertaining film for both kids and adults  something we rarely find in a world of either Brokeback Mountain or Daddy Day Care. In this lovely adaptation from the classic novel from C.S. Lewis, director Andrew Adamson takes the book into a new level if not better. Other than being a well-told story, some of the scenes look breathtaking and adds more eye candy to the solid-traditional novel. In other words, Adamson is able to do the impossible: Make the film better than the book.<br/><br/>Narnia is quite a popular story and I don't think there is any reason for me to really explain it in a coherent fashion. It is simply about four children (Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley) who lives in a time of WWII and moves to the home a professor  and they happen to discover the world of Narnia through a wardrobe in the professor's home when the youngest child Lucy (Henley) was trying to find a place to hide during a game of hide-and-seek. As beautiful Narnia seem to be with its snowflakes on the ground, we find out that it is not all it seems to be. Narnia has been having its winter for about 100 years when the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) took over. The Witch happens to be looking for four children who are going to arrive in Narnia and fight alongside Aslan, the ""lion king"" to make more sense (voiced by Liam Neeson). The Witch wants to trap the children, as the children tries to escape from her with help from the creatures in the woods.<br/><br/>The film has its sparks, with a good cast and nice entertaining bits here and there. The four children in the film actually seem like relatives so that is a huge plus right there. Tilda Swinton, whom I have never really seen in anything else before is absolutely fabulous here: She plays a villain that strikes with just a stare with her cold, blank eyes. There are also some good supporting players, including James McAvoy's Mr. Tumnus, the Faun that saves Lucy from harm of the White Witch. There is also Jim Broadbent as the professor that we actually come to love in the little scenes he is in.<br/><br/>There are a few problems I had with this film. Even though CGI isn't at tops right now, Aslan's fur looked so artificially fake to me that I thought I was going to prefer that dragon from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. There is also the corny dialogue that you won't notice unless you're older than the age of twelve  but that is another matter. There is also Edmund (Keynes), which I swear is the ""other"" version of Fredo in The Godfather: Part II, only nobody kills him and he turns out okay in the end.<br/><br/>Many knew Lewis was a Christian, and in a society where we have to say ""Happy Holidays"" in schools, I was glad to see that the film kept the Christian allegories that Lewis intended for his original novel. (You see, Aslan is Jesus.) I try to wonder if younger children in our society that are not raised in such a culture of religion (I have friends who don't even know what I'm referring to when I talk about a man putting bunch of animals in a ark) would really understand this story. There are a few scenes where some of the creatures in Narnia ask, ""Are you the son of Adam?"" ""Are you the daughter of Eve?"" But still, this tiny problem would not turn away audiences  I assure you that kids will still enjoy it because it still maintains its kid-friendly action-entertainment.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie  it was entertaining, it was nice, it was a film that I think I can watch with anyone in the world, it had nice performances (kudos to Swinton), and it was better than the book, something that is rarely achieved in cinema. This film also makes for really good eye-candy, with the lovely snow from Narnia, the sleigh of Santa Claus even made Santa to a knight in shiny armor, and everything from the makeup to the costumes  it was all really well done. Adamson surprised me with all the success of Narnia, considering the only films on his director resume are the Shrek franchise. Overall, this is a good film, despite the corniness of some of scenes, but after all, Narnia is aimed at children and people who absolutely loved the book. I am none of those, but I still recommend families check it out for family movie night  there is a huge chance you might enjoy it."

","I approached this film with an open mind. I had read the books as a kid and had seen the UK TV adaptation, but I was never what you would call a major fan. Narnia was never going to be sacred to me. After all, it's just stuff.<br/><br/>Even so, Disney's approach to this film grated. It starts of well enough, and I enjoyed some of the special effects in the exposition, but once we get to Narnia proper, it goes down hill rapidly.<br/><br/>In my view the film has poor pacing, relies too heavily on visual effects and has the kind of sickly sweet sentimentality that could give anyone diabetes. Frequently I was bored. Jim Broadbent did his stock eccentric professor performance. Ray Winston did his stock cockney sparrow performance. What was Tilda Swinton playing at? She is far more capable than her paint by number performance as the White Witch. And as for cute child performers <br/><br/>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' seems to veer wildly through its course; from trying to emulate all the better parts of Lord of the Rings in terms of scale and action, to desperately trying to distance itself in terms of plagiarised imagery. It fails on both counts. It kept reminding me of LOTR, and in doing so fails miserably as a comparison. <br/><br/>It was just so insipid and uninspired.<br/><br/>An overlong film with sloppy sentimentality, clumsily stitched to some big set pieces and liberally sprinkled with sugar. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the CGI lion was superb. Breath taking in fact! The scenery fantastic, and Judy McIntosh excels. Paramount fodder for young children, as it is intended I'm sure, but a real pain for accompanying parents."
"LyraAlluse","10","0","0","5 April 2006"," A Wonderful Film
","I thought that the Chronicles of Narnia was a great film. It was a bit shaky at times (you could tell that this was Andrew's first live action film), however I found this added to the story and made it more realistic. The music is wonderful and inspiring. The actors/ actresses were more or less how I pictured them in the book.<br/><br/>The only actress that seemed out of place was Tilda Swinton (the white witch), simply because I always pictured the character of Jadis as having dark brown hair and green eyes. This is kind of a stereotype, so I am kind of glad that they decided to give her dreads and blonde hair instead.<br/><br/>All of the weapons, costume designs, props and computer generated characters were on par with Lord of the Rings. The wardrobe was simply beautiful. A true Narnia fan (like me) could pick out all of the little details and be nerdy about it. For example; the wardrobe tells the story of the first book, through the images that are carved into it. Look for this the next time you watch the film. Also...all of the books shown in Mr. Tumnus' study were the exact ones mentioned in the book. Check for this too. Little details like this are scattered throughout the film. They are fun to look out for. It's good stuff. ^_- The Chronicles of Narnia did not quite live up to my expectations. I almost walked out on this film when I went to see it. But I gave it another chance. I rented it and watched it through with a cup of hot cocoa in my hands. I found that it warmed my heart and even emotionally touched me when I let go of my personal interpretation of the book and chose to view it with Andrew's ""realistic"" vision. After watching it a second time it became a favorite. I think Andrew took it in the right direction by making it more ""real."" Making it too magical might have made the story seem cheesy...and just another Disney Stereotype.<br/><br/>(Of course Disney is not on my ""nice"" list right now. It keeps making crappy sequels. One day, just for that, I shall buy out the Disney ""Empire"" and return it to its former glory. But that is beside the point.) I felt that the Chronicles of Narnia has more heart and spunk then the first Lord of the Rings movie. And Peter Jackson had prior experience with live action. This was Andrew's first. So give him a break. I bet the first time you made a drawing in art class the teacher had to keep themselves from laughing. Had I been Andrew's teacher I would have been staring at the screen with my mouth agape. This film was pretty damn good for a first time live action. So I give it ten stars.<br/><br/>OK...so they added a few scenes. I'll admit that they skimped a bit on the character development. And they did cut some things from the book. But if this is what you are all complaining about...take a look at the Fellowship. They didn't even add Tom!! Or Goldberry! Where was the ""magical"" element in that? So all these people who say it's a Lord of the Rings reject...heh. I suggest going back and watching the first movie again. The Chronicles of Narnia surpassed it by far. Even in music.<br/><br/>My advice to the hard core fan (like myself) is to give the movie another chance. Go back and watch it a couple times. Appreciate all of the extra things they put in the film (for the hard core fans to notice ^_-) and marvel in the fact that they actually took the time to make this movie. Then think of the future. If this is the way they started the series...then I bet it will finish with bang. Look at the Fellowship. It was long, didn't have much of a plot, and the characters were dull if anything else. But by the time the Return of the King rolled around, I was balling my eye out. The next two became quick favorites. I was the first person in line to buy copies of the ""two towers"" and ""return of the King"" midnight when they were both released. Jackson restored himself and became one of my favorite directions from then on.<br/><br/>Andrew just needs some time to warm up. Once he makes the next movie, people will take back all of the bad things they've said about the first one. Even me. So I am giving him the benefit of the doubt. At least he included all of the characters. And Aslan was great! I cried when they killed him on the stone table. It was a powerful and memorable scene. Overall, I give this movie ten stars. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough to rekindle the hope of Narnia fans everywhere that there beloved book series would be produced with the care they deserve. So because of this, the series had my support and Andrew has my complete faith. Well done Andrew. Can't wait to see the next one. Keep up the good work and thank you for restoring my hope in cinema.<br/><br/>P.S. If you think this version in bad, you ought to see the original BBC version. The beavers are people in furry suits...with painted faces. This is a MAJOR step up from that. So appreciate the artistic quality of this film and stop griping. If your fans, support the cause! And that's all I have to say."

It was really hard to tell what was going on at these times. This is unfortunate, as the rest of the movie was really good. The scenes, especially the battle scenes, were almost too clean. There was no dirt on anyone, even in the middle of battle. Also no blood. Of course, the movie is aimed at kids, so this is sorta expected.

Lovely was the little Girl, she brought a little life-spark with her acting into this perfect but cold fantasy-world. And the Christian Message? Okay, I could live with that because as much as Christianity was present, there was symbolism and thinking of ""the old pagan path"". I liked that ;-) Much said and then nothing with this review.

The film is attractive to young and old, those interested in good plot/drama or amazing special effects(fantastic battle sequences may I add)and for those just wondering what movie they'd like to see (or rent since it is coming on DVD tomorrow) this weekend. I loved the fact that I did not know any of the actors/actresses involved in the movie (except for Liam Neeson who is the voice of aslan). If I don't know the actor, it helps me concentrate on their performance given, and that it is something fresh to watch. The children who played the 4 Pevensie children did an outstanding job. Those who love the books wild have no complaints about the adaptation (if you do, i'm sorry). If you liked the 3 Lord of the Rings films (which I absolutely love) but dread sitting in your living room for three or more hours, NO Fear, this movie is only approximately 2 hours and goes by at a very good pace.

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe/2005/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes William Moseley Anna Popplewell Tilda Swinton Liam Neeson<br/><br/>Being a big budget film, the makers of the film sure put a lot of effort into this. I respect them for putting a lot of effort in and I loved the film! It was worth the money definitely! From the very beginning to the very end were non-stop, well-acted great thrills, some humor (love it), creepy moments, dramatic moments, great music, and perfect storyline! I respect C.S. Lewis's imagination for creating the wonderful fantasy world of Narnia consisting of a witch (Tilda Swinton), and a lion (Liam Neeson). Then there is Mr. Tumnus (being one of the mystical creatures), and a few beavers, wolves and other creatures/animals that can actually talk. The witch pretty much symbolizes Satan and the lion symbolizes Jesus Christ. This did seem to remind me of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy a bit (which I refuse to review) because of the battles of good versus evil (Gandalf versus Saruman from ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring""). Now, in this film, hide and seek is a main thing because that's what starts it all. When their mother sends them far away from home after a catastrophic bombing attack, the four kids are sent to an enormous home. The home houses the four of them, a professor (who owns the place), and a housekeeper of some sort. The four of them are extremely bored and decide to play hide and seek and that's what starts it all. The little one of the four, Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley), is a curious child and finds the world of Narnia by herself while searching for a hiding place. Her two brothers, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Peter (William Moseley), don't believe in her and her fussy, annoying, picky older sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) doesn't believe in her either. The three of them apologize to Lucy in an unconvincing way of course after they discover the wonderful world of Narnia too. There was one really well done battle scene in this film consisting of Aslan (the lion, voice by Liam Neeson) and the satanic witch. What was good about the battle was the music, special effects, and the acting. This battle was extremely long though but very, very entertaining! The whole movie was entertaining! Being all British actors (minus maybe a few), I could understand what they were saying for once. But I've seen many British films so I'm used to their foreign way of speaking. This film is a remake of a televised production called ""The Lion, the Witch, & the Wardrobe"" and had the same story based on C.S. Lewis's famous novel. I think they should continue the C.S. Lewis ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" series until they have turned all seven books into seven films but who knows if they'll keep making the series. It depends on if they get enough money (I don't doubt it) from this one. And if they do continue making the series, how long will it take? Movie directed by Andrew Adamson."

The visual effects look incredibly fake at times, but, all that aside, it is a movie you should take your kids to.<br/><br/>Mr. Tumnus' character is one of the few I think was depicted perfectly. He is the first Naninian Lucy sees, and they both shriek in fright when they see each other. Aslan, however, fails to emit the great amount of power which the character possesses. The lion looks like what he really is: computer generated.<br/><br/>The screenplay is well written and doesn't leave gaping holes in the plot, nor does it cut out small details to leave room for the big picture (unlike the enormous Harry Potter novels, C.S. Lewis' tales were only about 200 pages long). The movie does have a sense of reality mixed in with all of its fantasy, which makes the length of 2 and ½ hours easy to sit through for most.<br/><br/>When you are watching, a word of caution: do not stop as soon as the credits roll, the movie isn't over yet.

","'The Chronicles of Narnia' tells a rather straightforward fairy tale about a hidden magical land, where a group of children from war-ridden London experience a series of adventures. The story is very simple and should be very easy to follow for even smaller children. Older kids and adults might be easily bored by the overlong movie, however. Director Adamson, who previously made the rather entertaining Shrek movie, does a reasonable job making engaging CGI creatures, but does not really get adequate performances out of the child actors. He directs without much flair and his style is visually underwhelming. The editing also leaves a lot to be desired, pacing often slow and some scenes are awkwardly put together. The whole film has a rushed and unpolished feel to it as if made on a tight schedule. The CGI is not the best, but certainly adequate for this type of movie. Finally, the much talked about Christian aspects of 'Narnia' do feel a little clumsy, but they should not distract/offend people who do not like overtly religious topics in movies. I rate this film 3/10, the kids liked it slightly better but were also quite glad when it finally was over."

","CHRONICLES OF NARNIA : THE LION, THE WITCH, & THE WARDROBE <br/><br/>Back when NARNIA first came out at the beginning of the winter I saw it in the theater and was underwhelmed. I labeled it LOTR:LIGHT for a long time and was always bitter over the fact that NARNIA was beating my beloved KING KONG at the box office. If I remember correctly, I stated the film was good... but not remarkable... with slightly hollow special effects and performances (except for Tilda Swinton) and I gave the film an indifferent grade of B.<br/><br/>However, I put in a bootleg DVD yesterday to watch it with some friends who hadn't seen it and I realized I was unfairly rough on what is actually a very well produced children's epic.<br/><br/>On first viewing, I don't think I appreciated all the undertones featured in some of the performances, particularly James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. I found his performance to be empty but that's because I didn't realize the darker shadings of his character that McAvoy uses from the very start. I still find the child stars to be slightly underwhelming at parts... but it's unfair to expect such young children to carry a film of this size on their shoulders flawlessly. And Tilda Swinton is still incredible.<br/><br/>Upon second viewing, I realized the film seems slightly slower with less flashy special effects b/c in the end it doesn't need them in the same way KING KONG and LOTR did. The film emphasizes the tension of oncoming doom more so then actual confrontation and battle. I got a grander sense of the Pevensie children's destiny and found the film to be all the more engrossing because of that.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film to be highly entertaining and creatively brought to life... though still not remarkable (KING KONG and LOTR are still vastly superior films). This time around I didn't notice as many flaws in NARNIA. Instead I sat back and enjoyed it for what it was... a different movie aimed at an entirely different audience.<br/><br/>It is disappointing to me that my beloved KING KONG was defeated at the Box Office by this, but even so NARNIA is one of the better ""big-budget franchise films"" to come out in a long time... and so it shouldn't be faulted simply b/c it beat my favorite movie at the box office.

","Let me tell you some of the fears that I had concerning this movie before watching it. Firstly, it would undo all the great work that Lord of the Rings had done for the fantasy genre. I felt that this would be a hit and run attempt to cash in on the recent interest in fantasy based movies. Secondly, it would be too childish and lack interest for adults. Thirdly, having seen the children in trailers I was convinced that I was going to find the children annoying and would want to give them a good slap.<br/><br/>I can tell you that my fears were totally unjustified. The film took me back to my childhood,wishing for a magical adventure with an opportunity to show my valour and courage. This was no mere attempt to cash in on the work of the Lord of the Rings. This film was thoughtfully made and an extremely faithful adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>The film was enchanting and made excellent family viewing. Although the interest for children is obvious,I believe that the film had enough going for it to interest adults as well. Kids will marvel at the wonderful special effects and magical storyline. Older children and adults can find meaning in the allegory of various religious messages which were interspersed throughout the film. The final battle scene was big in scale and fantastic to watch.<br/><br/>The acting from the children was excellent. They were not in the least bit annoying and I regretted my earlier desire to give them the back of my hand. The White Queen put in an ice cold performance. She was elegant, commanding and ruthless all at the same time. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan put in a roaring performance and was in everyway majestic.<br/><br/>If there others out there who have not seen this film, who have similar fears to those that I had, I recommend that you give this film a chance to change your mind."

","The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe<br/><br/>C.S. Lewis along with J R R Tolkein are the two authors who influenced fantasy writing in the 20th century. Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of The Rings (LOTR) has now become the standard against which all such fantasy films will be measured in the near future. This first film in the Narnia series is in many ways more difficult to visualise than LOTR, especially because a large number of live action scenes have to be mixed with animation. Narnia was released by Disney amid a lot of hype about its allegorical content. But kids unaware of its sublime messages and intellectual baggage are most likely to enjoy the movie. I haven't read the book, but some of the background against which the kids' passage to Narnia is set is in more detail apparently in the film than in the book. Four children of the Pevensie family of London are packed off to the countryside when Germany begins the bombing of the city during World War II. Jim Broadbent appears early in the film in the role of the children's professor uncle into whose large mansion full of empty spaces the children move. Old, mellow and kind hearted, this is a role Broadbent can now perform with his eyes closed. And he seems the only one initially to believe in Narnia ironically when Susan and Peter - the two older kids - are disinclined to believe in Lucy's tale of the world hidden in the wardrobe. Edmund, meanwhile, is already caught up in the battle between good and evil. Lucy's passage into Narnia, the first of the memorable scenes in the movie, is captured in a series of breathtaking shots. A promise is made here to reveal a new land of wonder and magic, but then that is reneged. The children's search for Mr Tumnus and Edmund, both captured by the White Witch, especially the run through the tunnels and the snow-capped cliffs, is too much like LOTR. The children finally find Aslan, flowing mane, a deep voice (Liam Neeson) and all, just as he is trying to regain Narnia from the White Witch. His death, I thought came too quick, just a few scenes after we get to see him for the first time. Nevertheless, his sacrifice is superbly shot and performed in the scene that Tilda Swinton is really at her evil best and delivers probably the film's best lines. Compared to that, Aslan's lines, if I may call them that, are really lame. Georgie Henley portrayal of Lucy is riveting. She is not very pretty, but is cute. She tramples on the snow rather than walk on it. It's a restrained performance far better than any other on screen. The only who actually holds his own against Georgie is Skandar Keynes, partly because his conflict between the Witch's tempting offers and the good within him is so ingrained into the movie. His weakness for sweets, the gleam in his eye as he yearns for power, his bitterness in being separated from his father, Keynes really lands a plump role. Compared to the performances from the younger kids, the older ones played by Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are trite. The battle scenes are not much of an improvement from Braveheart. It's hard to explain what could have been done better though. I watched it in a theatre full of adults who seemed to be tremendously enjoying the movie and ultimately I believe this is the greatest success of the film: To make something which children see one way and the adults another."
"SuperNewb","9","0","0","27 February 2006"," Wonderful Movie
","If I were to sum this movie up in one world: Wonderful.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic, with the world created by C.S. Lewis almost perfectly depicted, from the personalities of the characters to each stick and stone in the land of Narnia. The animation was incredibly realistic and the actors were wonderful.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton played the White Witch with gusto and every word out of her mouth seemed to fit her character; Cruel and cold. The cold stare of her eyes and the loud, projective voice made it seem you were standing beside her. Then, Anna Popplewell did a tremendous job playing the lady-like, motherly Susan. She kept her voice calm and the expressions on her face made you believe she was really Susan. William Moseley did a fantastic job for his first major role in a movie. His facial expressions were knightly and strong, as well as his voice. Then, Skandar Keynes played Edmund wonderfully. When he tried to lead his family toward the White Witch, the tone of his voice sounded uneasy and fake, just as it would in real life if you tried to betray your own friends and/or family. And then there was little Georgie Henley, a little girl who can make anyone's heart melt. She's a wonderful actor, especially for this being her first movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is great, but there are things everyone should be warned about: 1. There is some violence near the end of the movie, so parents of young children should be alert of that. 2. Some of the dark creatures are frightening, so those who are scared somewhat easily should be aware. 3. The movie is a bit dark, and somewhat frightening at the beginning of the movie in a 'bombing' scene.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Chronicles of Narnia is a wonderful movie any fantasy lover would adore, but be aware of darker parts!"

Lewis' works, who has, while being steadfast to his faith, still managed to bring to everyone the essential quality of imagination.<br/><br/>Thanks to the director and the actors.<br/><br/>Did anyone not see the that in the course of this film, there was the coming round of Edmund ""Judas"" Pevensie? The boy who sold his family out for Turkish delights? Some might argue that he might've been racked with guilt - Aslan sacrificing himself at the altar to the White witch - that he threw himself to help Peter, the brother that he had previously resented, on the battlefield. But the way I saw it, and clichéd as it might sound, ""blood is thicker than water"" and when Peter finally dropped his aloof exterior to hug Edmund towards the end, it gave the audience a somewhat satisfying sigh, a reason to feel that there's still room for some love to go around in these cynical times we live in.<br/><br/>Interestingly, C.S. Lewis was also thought to be quite a stiff until he met his vivacious wife who encouraged him to express his emotions a little more outwardly. But I digress.<br/><br/>This film does have many precious a lesson to teach children and adults alike, with or without any religious doctrine. Then again, don't all faiths proclaim universal love and compassion, justice and integrity? The children learn the virtues of bravery and humility along the way from saving their brother to claiming Narnia for the righteous. More importantly they've also demonstrated the ability to rise above their ""supposed"" limitations.<br/><br/>Allow me to play God, and judge this flick as ""essential"" - as with LOTR - in the shaping of a future generation that will turn out to be fair, loving and with the guts enough to stand out to do and say the right things."

","The Chronicles of Narnia was a great flick. I had not read the book, and am not a Rings or fantasy fan. Rather, I like an occasional children's story and thought I'd like this one. In fact, most of the small audience was adult.<br/><br/>There were a lot of battle scenes and death, reminding me of Braveheart and also of the controversy over Mortal Kombat, released when my children were pre-teens, and at that time, there was a compromise of sorts when blood flying off of the injured/killed was shown as grey.<br/><br/>This movie was a little like that. If you are not against showing your children sanitized war and death as part of their entertainment, it is ""tasteful."" The violence is significant but couched in an honorable war between good and evil. To the extent that children living during wartime and children of another era encountered sickness and death more frequently than today, a parent might shrug off some of the violence, as well as the sad beginning where the children were evacuated from a war zone to the manor where their adventure took place, and simply characterize it as ""tranche de vie."" However, I would warn parents lulled into a belief that every film lacking sexual innuendo is suitable for their children. Know your child.<br/><br/>I had heard of the parallels between the story and some facets of religion. They were easy to spot, but neither distracting nor were any lessons being taught.

","This review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION.<br/><br/>I must say the beginning of this endeavor brought the Lemony Snicket series immediately to mind. I do realize, of course, that the SoUE was written much later than the CoN; however, the casting choices for the parts of the children is more to what I refer. Naturally, there are four children here in the LW&W, where in SoUE there were three, but I think anyone could see the similarities quite easily. Indeed, in the opening moments of LW&W, I more than half expected to hear Jude Law's voice smoothing through the speakers to caution us that this would not be a happy tale.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have (at this point) been quick to extol the striking similarities between the LW&W and the LotR, while others were more keen to demonstrate each detail of Christian symbolism Lewis found appropriately necessary to insert throughout his works, so I won't bore you with loads of those details. I have to point out a few, but that's only because the story is built around Christian myth and Tolkien's stolen ideas (reportedly alleged by Tolkien himself, not by this reviewer).<br/><br/>I will, instead, attempt a different route and see where it leads us.<br/><br/>*The introduction to our principal characters was an emotional one, setting up a small bit of character development, allowing you to ""know"" them as well as a few minutes' insight into their lives will allow. <br/><br/>*Edmond is the petulant one, Pete(r) is the responsible ""daddy-like"" older brother. <br/><br/>*Susan is ""just trying to be smart,"" and Lucy's duty to the cast is to be adorable; a task which she performs beautifully.<br/><br/>The comparison to the Baudelaire children is astounding. <br/><br/>*Susan is darker haired, pouty-lipped, wannabe braniac very much like Violet. The physical and characterizational similarities are astounding. <br/><br/>*Both Edmond and Pete(r) serve to give us Klaus. <br/><br/>*The two characters combine to constitute the depth of character given us by Liam Aiken which says a great deal about the quality of his acting abilities. <br/><br/>*And Lucy takes the place of the cutesy-kins, Sunny. Of course, Lucy is a bit older and therefore offers us a tad bit more than cute expressions, meaningless gurgles, and ""offered meanings"" to her indiscriminate noises.<br/><br/>*Their lives begin with startling parallel to the Baudelaires, in that their parents are absent from their lives, and they are sent to live with strangers. <br/><br/>From there, the only resemblance to the cinematic SoUE work is the personalities of the characters, themselves. There are striking similarities between Count Olaf and the White Witch (portrayed brilliantly by Tilda Swinton who also was more than adequate in her role as the Archangel Gabriel in Constantine). <br/><br/>As far as the Tolkien references/rip-offs/similarities, there are simply too many to detail, but to name a few...<br/><br/>* the entrance to Mr. Tumnus's lair looks remarkably similar to the entrance to Bagg's End<br/><br/>* the archetypal fiend was the ""White Witch,"" whereas the LotR bears Saruman the White<br/><br/>* beloved Gandalf sacrifices himself to save his friends, namely Frodo and dies at the hand of Magick used darkly and is ""reborn"" even more powerful because he was not dark, himself...just as Aslan dies at the hands of those who use Magick darkly, and is reborn through the means of a Magickal sacred stone altar which will crack and negate a sacrifice made erroneously (Aslan gave his life in Edmond's stead so Aslan was not the traitor, but was sacrificed as one which activated the spell on the sacred stone.).<br/><br/>* the battle scene build-up was very reminiscent of the larger, more involved Lord of the Rings battle at Helm's Deep, but not nearly as well done<br/><br/>* the gryphons served the part of the Elves in that they were airborne in their assault...shredding beaks and rending talons rather than archer's arrows, but in the air none the less<br/><br/>* ents<br/><br/>* the maps were extremely Tolkien<br/><br/>* Aslan returns from the grave like Gandalf, and for the same reason (the Laws of Magick)<br/><br/>* the traveling party all received gifts from Santa Claus (also known as King of Elves)<br/><br/>* right after Mr. Tumnus is released, the shot of the troupes marching across the rock bridge atop the mountains looked like it was straight out of LotR! Call it ""homage"" if you will, but to Me, that was blatant...<br/><br/>Now, I realize these Tolkien similarities (and there are more...many more) also involve the filming, direction, casting choices, location choices, DoP's choice of angles, etc. rather than what Tolkien and/or Lewis has written, hence My hesitation to sit here and go over any more of them. Those listed above are among the most obvious and blatant examples. There are more, to be sure.<br/><br/>All in all, I found this movie more Pagan through its use of Nature and Sympathetic Magicks than Christian. Aslan did rise from the dead, but due to a Law of High Magick, rather than ""divine intervention,"" thereby negating the Christian undertones completely. <br/><br/>Honestly? I loved it. It was wonderful. It was the children's version of the Lord of the Rings saga.<br/><br/>The CGI was decent, but Aslan was not as well done as he should have been, considering the staggering budget this movie was awarded, and the name ""Disney."" I always expect the very best from Disney. I am often disappointed. The CGI in no way failed. It just was not what it should have been. <br/><br/>This one nearly lived up to its potential. It should have been epically filmed. At any rate, I found ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" to be highly entertaining, heart-warming, and endearing.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.5/10."

The children are all quite handsome, too (and excellent actors).<br/><br/>I've not read any of the Chronicles. (Years ago, I'd read Lewis's Screwtape, Mere Xianity, Great Divorce, etc.) From reviews, I understood that Lewis intended the Chronicles to introduce children to some important concepts in Christianity -- Aslan stands for Jesus and His sacrifice (e.g., note the similarity of his death to that of Jesus, complete with the 2 mourning women); the witch stands for the devil, evil and the hurtful pride, selfishness, ambition, pettiness, etc., that turns people from the divine. The seduction of Edmond by the witch (appealing to his desire for power over his older sibs) very strongly reminded me of the tactics recommended to Screwtape by Wormwood in Lewis's ""The Screwtape Letters."" I found the battle scene overly long and very reminiscent of the final movie in the Lord of the Rings series complete with orcs. (I think it's a little too much for young children.) All the special effects were extremely well done -- e.g., Aslan speaking, expressions and postures expressing different moods, etc.<br/><br/>Most fans of Lewis, the Chronicles, and fairy tales will especially enjoy this movie."

","I've seen this movie a few weeks ago on my college campus because I've always wanted to see this Disney version of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" I've seen previews for this movie and I thought it looked good because it reminded me of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but toned down for family viewing. (Oh yeah, it is good!) When I was there, it was so exciting! I loved pretty much every minute of this movie! I won't give any of it away because I want you to find out for yourself! This was a good movie, but I thought the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies were more exciting.

","It was a visual masterpiece, but the story was horrible. For me it was like another lord of the rings movie. And the plot was so, used. I fell asleep around the middle, and had to watch it again. My guess, it tried to play to a younger audience, which it did. But i just can't get into it like some people. another porpbelm with the film is that it was the classic mainstream predictable. and that is one of the reasons that it didn't entertain me.<br/><br/>My cousin is my age, 17, and he loved it. But then again, he loved triple x and 8 mile, so if you liked those, maybe this is a movie for you."

","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE<br/><br/>An Andrew Adamsson blockbuster <br/><br/>World War II is raging and the four Pevensie children are sent away from their mother to live in the mansion of the eccentric professor Kirke (entertaining, if wasted, Jim Broadbent). During a game of hide-and-seek, little Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a wardrobe that leads to a different world. It's Narnia, a land which has been plagued by winter for hundreds of years, ruled with an iron fist by the evil witch queen Jadis (Tilda Swinton). The Pevensies must defeat the witch and take their places as kings and queens of Narnia.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how sick I am of movies with never-ending titles. If it isn't something as overlong as CON: TLTWTW, it's Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Fun With Dick and Jane, or The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl in 3-D. All I'm saying is, a movie title should have quality rather than quantity.<br/><br/>This is truly a film where acting almost comes last. An effects fest, NARNIA opens up with a mostly CGI sequence showing the German bombs falling over London. We are after that treated with talking CGI beavers, CGI wolves and foxes, CGI castles, entire CGI landscapes. WETA (previously worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy) has also done a great make-up work, starting out with a nervous James McAvoy as a faun, all the way up to a huge battle between everything from cheetahs to minotaurs in the finale. Fans of fantasy shouldn't be disappointed: There are few mythical creatures that you won't find somewhere in NARNIA.<br/><br/>Moving on to the acting, however, this is where the film almost falls apart. For all the talking CGI animals, NARNIA simply does not contain a single believable performance from the leads. Voice acting aside, it often feels like all we see is a bunch of amateurs trying to act. William Moseley is simply laughable as Peter ""the magnificent"". He handles the ""older brother"" act fairly well for a newbie, but when he's suddenly put in full body armour and in charge of an army, it just doesn't work. Much more believable is Georgie Henley as the youngest sister. Anna Popplewell's interpretation of Susan is pretty ho-hum, while Skandar Keyes is far below average as Edmund. Much younger actors than him have created believable characters (read: Hayley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense) and the casting is just horrible.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton's White Witch, supposedly the biggest main character in the movie (the CGI lion aside) is nothing special. She is definitely not awful, she just misses something to make her character memorable (although writing also should be blamed for this).<br/><br/>The biggest waste is probably Liam Neeson who shows up in the last 20 minutes to voice a computer generated lion, Aslan, the messiah of the film. Even he seems to have a hard time putting some emotion to his voice acting, and his voice seems out of place, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson has had no problem delivering the goods with his half-raunchy, hilarious comedies Shrek and Shrek 2, so why doesn't it work in NARNIA? Well, it's quite simple: While the Shrek movies were satirical parodies, Adamson wants to make NARNIA the next big epic in the vein of the recent Lord of the Rings films, something he is just not capable of, especially considering that the novel was a cute and cozy children's story. The Narnia novels are amazing in their own genre, but Adamson has got it all wrong: they are just not supposed to be epic adventures.<br/><br/>The final battle feels like a cheat; since this is supposed to be a Disney movie, there can be no real violence or gore except for some faint flashes. The witch's death takes place off-screen, which is just lame. As mentioned before, William Moseley is completely out of place as the hero-of-the-day and only manages to look silly.<br/><br/>Overall, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a complete waste of time. There are some really good effects, but if you're looking for anything memorable, forget it. NARNIA is a run-of-the-mill blockbuster which is very disappointing considering Adamson's previous work and the amazing novel. Except for a small cameo by Rupert Everett, resurrected from Shrek 2, there's just not much fun here. 6 out of 10."

","First of all i was quite looking forward to seeing this movie. I read the book as a child and once again not so long ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Watching the movie was a complete different experience. For the movie I was not expecting to see any kind of standard of what Lord Of The Rings offered but at least something that looked more convincing than what this movie actually offered.<br/><br/>The visual effects in my opinion were what really let the film down. I thought they were appalling for a film of this scale. I do not think any of the creature effects looked effective enough to make them believable, you could tell they were animated, likewise in many films these days. In this movie I thought i was watching a pixar animated film in certain scenes. I'm very surprised the effects were nominated for an academy award. I thought the outstanding visual effects for Star Wars - Revenge Of The Sith were strongly overlooked in this category.<br/><br/>Apart from that i did not feel that the characters of the movie were portrayed in a way in which you cared for them or not. Reading the book was a complete opposite. I just wasn't that bothered when watching the movie.<br/><br/>What i did like about the film was the art direction, the design of the queen's lair was impressive and the look of Narnia itself looked good but that was about it for me.<br/><br/>A lot of people may disagree with this review but i strongly feel that this movie could have been made a lot better considering the budget that was available. Lets see what happens with the next movie."
"beetle1042000","5","0","0","17 February 2006"," Disappointing
","I'd like the start by saying that Tilda Swinton did an excellent job as the White Witch in this remake, the other acting however was simply intermediate.<br/><br/>The graphics, for one thing, were awful. The backgrounds were tasteless and undetailed. It looked like the CG was rendered by a Playstation from a small boy's bedroom. Though, it is entertaining to see Beavers talk, it isn't entertaining to see eye-bleedingly bad sets in a movie as well anticipated as this one.<br/><br/>I know these are only a few young kids, but the acting wasn't very well done. Too much expression were put into these kid's head. Isn't the director supposed to fix things like that? Or better yet, wasn't that supposed to be sorted out when they chose these kids at the audition? Unless they were desperate, choosing these youngsters isn't a great call.<br/><br/>The screenplay was terribly written. Even I felt a little embarrassed to be in the theater when I saw it. It was far too over-dramatic.<br/><br/>I give Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe a five out of ten."
"BrohmaBull007","9","0","0","16 February 2006"," Great Interpretation of the Book
","I had a lot to consider when I went to see this movie this past weekend. I was hoping that they could get it as close to the book as possible......... you know....... to make CS Lewis happy. Now I haven't given up on movies based on books but they were starting to fail on me. After I saw this movie I now change that statement. This was perfectly like the book in almost every way. Watching this movie it was fun to cite some memorable scenes out of the book in this movie. The acting was great....... The White Witch was played out perfectly. The Lion was made and sounded like a god. The four children were each characterized differently to fit the book and make each character unique. I'm also glad the movie wasn't rushed. Having it 140 minutes for covering almost everything is better than them skipping big parts and making it only 90 minutes long. I'm also glad that they were able to really capture the land of Narnia the way it was meant to be seen. Also those fantasy characters..... like Mr. ""Thomnas"" were all well cast and played perfectly. I was gripped with this movie and once they entered Narnia..... I didn't want to miss a second. Overall if you are a fan of CS Lewis and and love his books..... you will love this movie. As a reader of the book I think they did a great job and I cant wait for Prince Caspian to get a movie as well as the Silver Chair.<br/><br/>9/10"
"kammaz","8","0","0","16 February 2006"," FANTASTIC .... quite literally
","My niece, who's a Post Doctoral Fellow in Warwick (UK), recommended the movie to me. She had already seen it and thought it was good ... though she felt that it didn't do justice to C.S. Lewis' book. <br/><br/>Since I have not read the book, I went to the hall with an open mind ... and was instantly transported into a world of fantasy! I was transformed into a small child as the movie progressed. <br/><br/>The story is essentially that of good triumphing over evil ... as is the case with all fairy tales. But in spite of this clichÃ©d theme ... there was something very novel about the approach and treatment of the storyline. For one thing, one can't truly identify with stories like ""Cinderella"" or ""Snow-white"". But ""Narnia"" was different. The children, who are essentially the protagonists of the movie, are very human ... with their strong points as well as their weaknesses. They are not mere ""picture-book"" characters ... not all ""white"" ... there are shades of gray in their characterization ... which makes them all the more appealing. Some of the scenes are quite dark ... a phenomenon that seems to be increasing ... with book like the ""Harry Potter"" series, etc. But children nowadays are better capable of handling these aspects than we were, as children. As a matter of fact, I think they appreciate these nuances. <br/><br/>I LOVED ASLAN!! Fantastic animation and characterization!! He's so superior, so majestic and regal in his bearing. I think it's extremely difficult to be able to portray a character like this, so very convincingly. The White Witch is terrible but it's not until she takes her revenge on Aslan, that she becomes a truly despicable character! <br/><br/>As an Indian, I had a serious regret even as I watched the film. Why can directors in this country not think of making movies like this one?! Why do films here always have to deal with rape, violence, eternal love stories with it's fair share of complications ... <br/><br/>""Narnia"" offers clean, wholesome entertainment for everyone. Unless one is seriously ""age-challenged"" (which means that the person is so inherently an adult that he/she has forgotten what it is to be a child ... for even a couple of hours!), I would suggest that people should go out and watch this film. It makes you feel really good. Forget the minor discrepancies and failings ... the movie rejuvenates you. It brings back memories and feelings that we, as adults, have, in most cases, chosen to leave behind us in the past, or at any rate, try to disavow.<br/><br/>I look forward to other movies like this one ... and if you want to know what I'm trying to say ... please GO OUT AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!"

It is reality till Lucy goes in to the wardrobe. The centaurs (half man half horse) look creepy. The Minitaur is supposed to have the body of a bull and the upper part of a man. Not the body of a man and the head of a bull! The theme is good and evil. It was written just after WWll and the bombings of London. Lewis had just witnessed the horrors of Hitler and the rise of Stalin. He had originally been an athiest and became a Christian. The Lion is supposed to be a Jesus figure. Many of the characters are computer generated. It looks very real. They had some good WWll era music in the movie."

One day, whilst playing they accidentally discover a wardrobe which is a portal to a fantasy land, the land of Narnia. There, they understand that a witch has been ruling for a 100 years and they are a part of a prophecy, which states that they will overthrow the witches' rule of Narnia. Against their will, they are caught up in the battle, and they fight bravely, finally killing the witch, and ending the rule.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","31 January 2006"," A commendable adaptation
","Quite within expectations, this adaptation stays very close to the book. These days, it's very difficult for spectacular photography and big battle scenes to impress, after LOTR, Star Wars, Troy, Alexander etc. This movie does deliver on the pure visual level, even not in a spectacular sort of way. While on battle scenes, it's interesting to note the parallel between the start of the movie with a fleet of German planes dropping bombs and the start of the battle in Narnia with a fleet of griffons dropping rocks.<br/><br/>C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories are for children, although they offer a little more than fairy tales such as Snow White or even The Wizard of Oz. There is full scale pitch of the forces of dark against the forces of light, the fundamental of all fantasies. The plot of dark forces causing catastrophic climatic changes has been widely used since Lewis, most noticeably in Guy Gaveril Kay's Fionavar stories, and probably also (here my memories is a little blurred) in Stephen Donaldson's The Land. The obvious allusion to Christianity in Aslan's resurrection does not even require debating and those who enjoy reading Lewis beautiful and imaginative writing on Christianity will no doubt find great pleasure in ""The great divorce"". For ""The lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" as a children's story, whether interpreting Aslan as Christ or not does not take anything away from or add anything to the story because logically (as Susan would say), whatever the reader chooses to believe automatically becomes an innate part of the story anyway.<br/><br/>What I find most interesting is watching the four children. For simplicity, permit me to use only their names in the story although I'm likely talking about both the character and the actor at the same time. Little Lucy particularly stands out, reminding me of Jodie Foster, in defiance of what she believes is wrong. Yet she still retains that sweet innocence that mercifully rescues her from looking like an undersized adult as some do in other movies. Edmond refrains well in not having too much of the dark side, as he is more of a victim of the circumstances, a young boy overwhelmed by temptation as well as forces far too strong for him to deal with. Also his treachery in absolutely necessary, to allow Aslan's sacrifice to develop. Susan has a strong character, as well as a penchant for logic, which everybody respects. Even her older brother Peter taking the coats from the wardrobe into Narnia humours her ""logically, we are not taking them outside the wardrobe"". By comparison, Peter is the weakest of the characters and falls short a little in convincing the audience that he can shoulder Aslan's responsibilities.<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten is of course Tilda Swinton, who is right up there with Cate Blanchette as ""an actress with a thousand faces"" (just consider the very different roles she plays in three recent movies - ""Young Adam"", ""Constantine"" and ""Broken flowers""). Without 3-D, she brings the White Witch right out of the screen, giving this otherwise somewhat standard character some additional dimensions."

"dfranzen70","7","0","0","30 January 2006"," Whimsical delight
","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a magnificent movie, a paradoxically quick epic that doesn't rely on the viewers' being familiar with the source material. It's about four young London siblings who are sent away from home after the Blitz to live with relatives in the country, and who stumble upon an amazing new world entered through the back of an old closet.<br/><br/>Anyone who's read C. S. Lewis's books will instantly fall for the elegant way this story is told, from the gorgeous scenery to the wide-eyed innocence and brilliant performances of its mostly young cast. Often with a group of young actors, there's little to distinguish one novice thespian from another, no quirks in personality other than the most rudimentary. But Narnia's Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are each their own person; and what's more, each grows in his and her own way throughout the movie, however subtly.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is riveting as the evil White Witch, dancing a mighty thin line between hammy and calculating. I believe her screen gravitas alone gave encouragement to the young foursome, headed by Georgie Henley as Lucy, the waif who first stumbles upon the then-frozen land of Narnia. But as I said, each of the Pevensie kids distinguishes themselves in the film, no small task when the indomitable Ms. Swinton is aboard.<br/><br/>The movie would be little more than a live-action cartoon, though, if not for the fantastic, realistic CGI used for the animals, particularly that of the enigmatic lion Aslan, voiced by the great Liam Neeson. Not to be outdone, Ray Winstone's Mr. Beaver was a true Cockney treat. All of the graphics, though, were quite believable with nary a moment's hesitation. Well done, indeed. The Chronicles of Narnia should garner a Academy Award nomination for visual effects or set design, I would think.<br/><br/>The movie is fairly rated PG for some frightening moments, but it's nothing your kids can't handle (probably). If you've read the books, you know there's one particular scene that might be a tad upsetting to the juniors, but rest assured all will be aright one way or another in the end."
"His_Dudeness74","7","0","0","19 January 2006"," Christ, what a story !
","This relatively linear children's tale may be seen as light fare compared to it's Big Brother, the Lord of the Rings, but knowing the story as I did I was really looking forward to seeing some 'fun fantasy' on the big screen that would clock in under 11 hours running time ...<br/><br/>Knowing that I already liked the actual *story*, I hoped the film of course would stay faithful to the source material and bring to life what had been written on the page ... Happily the film succeeds on both those counts, the fairly straight-forward story is presented in all it's detail (and without any uneccessary embellishment) and, like the LOTR trilogy, has a happy knack of achieving a look that goes hand-in-hand with one's own imagination (how *do they do that* ??) - my 10 year old son made numerous remarks about how much everything looked like he thought it would. Having a basis for comparison, this is a real achievement in my eyes, as C.S. Lewis doesn't go into *quite* the same detail as Tolkien did in the descriptions of their respective fantasy landscapes - although Lewis's world is in some ways more vivid than Tolkiens ... <br/><br/>The Mr. Tumnus/Lucy scene has been criticised for having a 'creepy' feel to it, but having just read the book I was struck by a real sense of 'stranger danger' that I didn't pick up on upon reading the book as a child - Lucy going off to tea with a Faun of indeterminable intentions ? Mr. Tumnus putting the young girl to sleep with a coma-inducing lullaby ? - It was already a touch dark in the book as far as I'm concerned, and I thought it was good that the director didn't shy away from the slightly sinister tone of that particular scene ... The CGI Aslan was incredibly impressive, I went with a company of 4, one of whom was convinced the Lion was real and only the 'talking mouth' had been animated ... I was also very satisfied with the acting performances, those that had a chance to shine did (Lucy, Edmund and the White Witch), whilst the others, who were written somewhat one-dimensionally in the source book, did o.k. with their limited roles ... Young Georgie Henley was as cute as a button without being too precocious and put in a great performance as the youngest sibling Lucy. Skandar Keynes (!!) was also great as the brooding Edmund, my favourite character in the books (he's said to be a metaphor for Man in this allegorical re-telling of the story of Christ ) <br/><br/>But by far the performance that appealed to the more cultured element of my taste was that of Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch. Damn she was good, if you had no love for the story or the kiddies, she'd still be highly watchable. She was insidiously charming during her first meeting with Edmund, emitting a vaguely maternal promise, yet her cold fury scared the sh*t outta me once or twice, particularly the first time she raised her voice at Edmund - she was bad assss ! Ms. Swinton was also surprisingly imperious with two swords in either hand during the battle scenes, which were largely mayhemic apart from her coolly choreographed fightin' moves - this usually dead-serious thespian (I said thespian !) seemed to relish the chance to play a baddie, and didn't go for the ol' trick of camping it up either, she was as cold as ice just like the White Witch should be ... her performance during Aslans sacrifice, and indeed the whole set-up of that particular scene, brought to mind ye olde Pagan rituals ... Anyway, Tilda Swinton definitely earnt the movie an extra star in my eyes, she was awesome and actually exceeded my expectations of what the White Queen should be all about. Like the LOTR, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was shot in New Zealand."

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the tale of 4 children in London who get sent to live with a professor in the London countryside to avoid the bombings of World War II. There the youngest, Lucy, finds a magical wardrobe that is the entrance to another world called Narnia, a vast landscape of eternal winter placed under a spell by the evil White Witch (who is portrayed marvelously by Tilda Swinton.) Her siblings, Peter, Edmund, and Susan all do not believe her, until one day they all find themselves tumbling through the wardrobe themselves. Once in Narnia, the White Witch, who is the self-proclaimed ruler, tempts Edmund to betray his siblings in exchange for goodies. As the other 3 try to find Edmund, they come to find that as children of Eve, they are the ones who will fulfill the prophecy of Narnia and bring end to the 100-year winter.<br/><br/>Narnia: tLtWatW, like many other series of books set to film, feels a lot like a demo to something much larger. Much like the Harry Potter series with The Sorcerers Stone, this film works more like something that is setting the solid foundation for the Narnia's yet to come. The film has a very surreal and intriguing feel, yet it lacks in a lot of critical areas, such as acting and development.<br/><br/>The cast of Narnia is almost entirely made up of unknowns and that works both for and against it. With the obvious sequels due out, we now have a lot more time to know and love the 4 Pevensie children. However, their time in tLtWatW is obviously spent getting a feel for what is expected of them, and that isn't to say that makes their performances bad per say, just curiously lacking. The character development of Nanria is hurt primarily by the hurried pace of the film itself.<br/><br/>From the very beginning the viewer doesn't care too much for the overly obnoxious Edmund, and the film never really gives Edmund time enough to make a second impression. Also, the advancement of courage displayed by Peter, while admirable and enjoyable to watch, unfolds in too short of a time without much reasoning. The roles of the children, with the exception of the always-lovable Lucy, just cant seem to keep up with the fast passed enchantment of Narnia.<br/><br/>While the look of Narnia itself, at first glance is stunning and quietly beautiful, a closer look shows a much more static environment that leaves a lot of room for capitalizing on in the next installment. For pure enjoyment sake, Narnia looks great, and has a lot of nice touches, but to achieve the level of the aforementioned Harry Potter sets (who was also lacking in its first attempt) there is a large amount of static to be removed from the sets and a higher level of set to actor interaction that must be achieved.<br/><br/>The good thing however, is that with the previously mentioned, none of them are particularly big enough details to take away too much from the overall look and feel of Narnia.<br/><br/>It might sound like I am I being a bit hard on Narnia: tLtWatW, and I really don't mean to be. This film is a lot of fun and has a lot of enjoyable aspects. The creatures the children come across; the beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the Nanria equivalent of Santa Clause, a centaur, the frightening and magical White Witch and of course the great lion Aslan, are all beautifully done and are what really make Narnia so much fun.<br/><br/>The special effects are another aspect of the film that deserve a lot of credit, they are done extremely well by sfx group WETA, and they are the backbone in bringing the world of Narnia to life. There is one particular scene where Edmund calls an archery air strike on the advancing enemy, an air strike that shows the magical transformation of arrows into phoenix, that is very much applause worthy.<br/><br/>The only fault that I hold Narnia: tLtWatW inexcusable on is the uneven bridge between the literature and the film. The film adaptation of Narnia leaves a lot to the minds of those who have not read C.S. Lewis's novel. When Lucy first enters Narnia she encounters Mr. Tumnus not 15 feet from the wardrobe entrance, which is in no way secretly hidden from the inhabitants of Narnia. If the land of Narnia is under the curse of eternal winter, why don't the Narnians just leave? Is it because they are forbidden to go through the wardrobe? It can't be because they don't know about it, with 4 children just passing through it and all. And why is there a war waging in Narnia, what happened there? It's the obvious questions like these that director's just cant chose not to answer on the assumption of everyone already knowing the story.<br/><br/>All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a film, if not taken too seriously, can be a lot of fun for everyone watching. While the film lacks in a few areas it has more than enough in its favour to make it worth your time. There are not many films today that can be honestly enjoyed by the whole family, and Narnia is one of those films. Narnia: tLtWatW left a lot of room for advancement, and with other obvious future Narnia films yet to come, we can expect fantastic things from this series."

","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE **** Acclaimed writer C.S Lewis's bestselling novel of the Narnia Chronicles spawned a satisfying motion picture remake. It follows the story of the four Pevensie children convening with their Uncle in his England mansion during the Second World War. Upon discovering the magical land of Narnia behind the wardrobe, they depart on a memorable journey with accompaniment by new-found friends and an evil Witch, who leads a fatal conspiracy. William Moseley, Anne Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley are perfectly cast as the adventurers. Incredible special effects compliments the film, making for visually rich entertainment, and periodic humor adds to the story's momentum till the final battle sequence. It's slow starting, but the result is pleasing."

","I loved The Chonicles of Narnia. It is beautify written and portrayed. It is all I imagined and more of what a feature film of ""Narnia"" would look like. The actors were especially talented and well chosen. The Story was very true to the book, as close as word to word you could get. And the music was so lovely. It brought me to tears in the first scene! The Movie is great, especially for those who have read the book. I recommend it for families, but some parts may be a little to instant for the little ones.

","I went to Narnia expecting it to be near or at the level of the Harry Potter and Ring movies. Not even close due to the weak scripting and\or casting of the four Pevensies. Lucy was great and the only believable one of the four. Peter was cardboard good, Susan was way to ""good"" and Edmund was not nearly ""bad"" enough. CS Lewis believed in Evil, not maladjusted children who suffer mainly from sibling rivalry. The Witch WAS believable because she lusted after power and would literally destroy herself to get it. This was NOT CS Lewis's idea of the struggle between good and evil; it was a Disney version of Christianity that Lewis would have rejected as simplistic and misguided - sort of a cartoon version of Screwtape Letters."

"mozartzbitch","9","0","0","21 January 2006"," A masterful adaption
","I do not have the attachment to the books which so many of their fans do. I have read LW&W and I have read Magician's Nephew. This film adaption of LW&W was virtually my picture perfect interpretation of it though, which made it so much more fulfilling to sit through. <br/><br/>As a piece of film-making, it is a product of its era. Where as this film has been inspired to day from the Lord of the Rings films and the Harry Potter films, LW&W captures the perfect medium between those two film series'; in that, it has a mildly dark, riveting use of directing (ala Lord of The Rings) but still maintains that wonderful childlike escapism the Harry Potter films have not quite so successfully fulfilled. MR. Timnus for instance, is really just a lovable, scared, little boy. He is a loyal and cheery fellow with brilliant chemistry toward Lucy. You truly feel sorry for him while the White Witch torments him. Meanwhile, the White Witch is truly awful. Tilda Swinton really makes you hate her the entire time, and she masters that evil so well. Even when she is winning over Peter, you can tell she is evil. It is creepy, but it works. Then when she shows her evil to Peter, you see her in the most rotten of form. <br/><br/>The visuals in this film are done perfectly. They are beautiful and not distracting. The animals sure look real, but this film will not make you think of Babe. The wolves terrify the audience when they move across the screen. Mr. Fox meanwhile, never looks phony. The interpretation of Narnia is as magical as any visual C.S. Lewis could have created. It is snowy and would seem like a marvelous paradise to someone who has never been there, but an evil and cold place to those who live there. <br/><br/>In all ways, this film is a must see for any lover of fantasy. It is both exciting, and heart-warming. The characters all play off each other perfectly, and then extra scenes not included in the book make this film flow perfectly. 9/10"

","I just read that Disney had somewhat of a hidden agenda in this very good film. It would seem that, for those who want to see it, that the kids and their friends are the Christians. The Ice Queen and her force are the Romans. Easy to see that her army was made up of much uglier creatures. The Christians were more fairytale like. The Queen is evil and cruel. The Christ character was of course the Lion. He was a king and yet could be lovable and kind. He deeply cared for his comrades and was fearless as Christ was. The most telling part is that he gave his life for his people or mankind and then came the Resurrection when he came back to life. His leaving at the end would signify his Accension. This information was on a forum for ""Brokeback Mountain"" and how one of those idiotic tabloid shows like Access Hollywood or The Insider totally ignored Brokeback and the reason was Disney owns the company that produced TLTWATW and did not want the Right Wing Fundies to start picketing Disney again."

","I disliked the opening scene very much, because I feel it doesn't match the overall atmosphere in the book. The rest of the film was great, though, being very true to the book. Having read the book before, some plot turns weren't nearly as great, compared to not having read the book beforehand.<br/><br/>But isn't it strange that the movie is rated for 12+, while the books are written for children under that age? I guess it is the fighting that makes it a 12+ movie. But hey, Harry Potter contains fighting too. :)<br/><br/>I would also recommend it for adults, as it is still a nice movie to watch, and I also recommend reading the book, because it gives more information. The book 'the magicians nephew' also gives a lot of backstory."

","Jack Lewis wrote the Narnia Chronicles intended as an inoffensive effort of proselytizing his readers; not just the children but the adults who read to the kids. Now that Disney has bought the franchise and scored big on the first of the installment, Lewis' dream will come to fruition with world-wide impact. The more agnostic reviewers want to diminish the ""religious"" component, but that is just unlearned spin. The film version of Lion, Witch & Wardrobe is a clear allegorical presentation of the Gospel of Christ.<br/><br/>The film is well done and a faithful adaptation from the book. What a joy it is to see this beautiful story done with the professionalism it deserves. This film is an all-time classic on par with the Star Wars and the Wizard of Oz. But better still, it proclaims God's Good News of the hope available to mankind in the finished work of Jesus Christ. Let's hope Disney produces the rest of the Narnia Chronicles with the same quality and integrity of message."

","I don't remember much from the book, except that I liked it when I was younger. The movie started very good. I liked the whole beginning with the children in the big house, then Lucy discovering Narnia. That was all beautifully done. I was afraid that the talking animals in Narnia would be annoying and unreal, but they weren't, that was also done really well. But then halfway in the movie, it changed. There is talk about a prophecy and then there is a great battle. But all the time I wondered: what are they fighting for anyway? You don't know anything about Narnia. Apparently there is at least one city, but you don't see it until the end. Where do all these creatures come from? Where do they live? And then the prophecy. Somehow I didn't really know why it had to be fulfilled. They had to defeat the white witch, but what had she done? You don't really get to see anybody suffering under her reign. <br/><br/>So my conclusion; The story is built up well, but then really hurries through the end without explaining who and why. It's a shame because it could have been so good."
"oneblip","5","0","0","20 January 2006"," Entertains but fails to make a modicum of sense.
","As a child I probably liked this book, so that's more than likely why I went to go see it in the first place, apart from the wonderful advertising for the movie. Some things bothered me about the movie. For instance, It's obvious from the very first time Peter picks up a sword that he has no idea how to use it. But by the end of the movie, 2 days or so later, he's an expert swordsman.<br/><br/>There could be lots of argument about how he's prophesized, so it's in his blood to know how to sword fight, but I don't buy it. If it were in his blood why wouldn't he be an expert sword fighter naturally instead of having to learn? After all, natural means you just seem to have a talent for it right from the get go. All we ever see is about 2 seconds of practice with his brother Edmund who also doesn't know how to sword fight.<br/><br/>I think we needed a montage somewhere in here (perhaps of him practicing with one of the creatures that already seemed to grasp sword fighting?). I also didn't like the fact that Narnia seems to worship Christ and Christmas despite the fact that it is a fantastical world. This part made the least sense to me of all. I don't have a problem believing that beavers and horses can talk in a fantastical world, but take a theme that is typically associated with Christianity (a religion that was introduced in this world) and it makes no sense.<br/><br/>You tell me, who would believe that Gandalf likes Christmas? You could cough up the fact that these children were imagining this world during playtime. That still wouldn't explain why the old man who sheltered them seems to believe in that world as well. It also wouldn't explain why there are 6 other books that revolve around the same world.<br/><br/>The special effects and the battle scenes are all well done, as they should be. I particularly like the art direction and the colors and tones that are used. Work needed to be done where the soundtrack is concerned, it doesn't seem to know where it belongs. One minute we hear what can only be described as a early 30's track, the next we hear orchestral music, and in yet another switch (in the main song I might add) we hear a lot of modern music.<br/><br/>The children do the best they possibly can with their respective characters, and a couple even come out likable. There is some humor in here as well. In the end the movie comes off a bit cruel as far as a children's film goes. Your kids will be crying because of the way they did the whole Aslan sacrifice scene.<br/><br/>I give this a 5 because it's not a total waste of money, but still doesn't blow LOTR out of the water like some claim."

","I don't have enough good things to say about ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". When it comes to movies adapted from books, I couldn't be any more satisfied. It's perfect. I'm eagerly anticipating sequels. Especially ""The Last Battle"". However, if it's decided to continue with the rest of the books, I'll be a little confused on how they're going to pull it off. It's going to take a while to make the other six, and ""The Last Battle,"" of course is the final book. By the time ""The Last Battle"" is to be made all the original actors playing the Pevensie children will be all grown up. It surprised me to find out that the actor playing Peter is about nineteen years old. I thought he was fourteen or fifteen! I thought the actress playing Lucy was seven, but I found out she's around eleven. I'm not quite sure how the film makers will manage it, but I have faith in them."
"Juni78ukr","9","0","0","19 January 2006"," A very rare treat that for two hours made me leave my criticism behind.
","I've read Clive Lewis's books and somehow almost liked except the crucial thing he has made in the end of the last book with his heroes that I couldn't neither accept nor understand. However except this one thing I found the books mostly pretty good written so I was quite interested in seeing this adaptation. Somehow the obstacles prevented me from seeing all previous weeks and only yesterday I was able to see it on one of the very last shows in my city and the fact is on the contrary to the majority of high-budgeted movies this year I quite liked it. <br/><br/>The key factor of the success Andrew Adamson's Chronicles of Narnia is that the director found and established a balance between clear Christian thematic elements of the books and values common and understandable to all people. The same thing is about the moral messages of the story, which are pretty clear, comprehensible and suitable for audience all over the world, no matter to what culture we belong to. The adaptation follows the book all the time and we have got all the reasons to call it a very close adaptation. Despite some flaws I believe it's a pretty good adaptation. The movie begins from a scene of German bombings on London and then four children are going to countryside to avoid the danger of the war. Soon the adventure begins and our heroes come into the magical world of Narnia. The winter landscapes were mostly quite convincing but there were some problems related with Edmund's character. The line of the poor boy who is acting that way just because he wants some candy seems not a perfect way to show the character of the hero. It is obvious also that the filmmakers sometimes were forced to make a compromise between a magic world of the book and common sense and cold logic. Some criticism about hypothermia and other things really has the point but I don't see any way for the filmmakers to completely avoid such problem moments. Going further we see in the world on Narnia new landscapes and new wondrous creatures, which are overwhelmingly well created and look quite believable. In the second part of the movie there are obviously a few references (or maybe even borrowing) to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy but overall Adamson's construction of the oncoming confrontation and the final battle is very impressive, emotional and truly moving. Very good cinematography excellently captured the beauty of the Narnia and successfully transmitted to us all emotions and feelings of the characters. <br/><br/>Another thing in the movie that really fascinated me it's the performances or four young actors, who were playing two brothers (William Moseley and Skandar Keynes as Peter and Edmund) and two sisters (Anna Popplewell and Georgie Henley as Susan and Lucy) Pevensie. Except the one above mentioned moment personalities of their characters are very good developed and all four actors were able to bring these characters perfectly to life with all their feelings, emotions and inner struggles. Tilda Swinton's White Witch is also a rather strong character and her performance glows with perceptible coldness and evil. The sound effects are quite good and the score is a nice supplement to a visual feast on screen while the special effects as already mentioned are also mostly pretty good and believable. Personally I've found some minor problems with minotaurs design but at least they were much more better than in any motion pictures before. But one more time I have to return to Adamson's directing. It's very important that in his first serious live acting movie he resisted the temptation of transforming the story into something adorable from the outside but inwardly shallow and sliding down into superficial and vulgar jokes. <br/><br/>With well-deserved incredible success of the first movie and with Adamson's approach the studio have perfect prospects for creation one of the best franchises in the story of cinema. The Lion, The Witch and Wardrobe is easily one of the very best high-budgeted movies of the year but I have to make the last note. The movie has some violence, which is too strong for PG rating and some frightening sequences so it's mostly suitable for kids over ten or eleven.<br/><br/>My grade 9 out of 10"

","Joyless, joyful, exiting, kindness, caring, being horrified Narnia is all about that and more. At a part in the movie it got exiting and at the other part extremely emotional. Narnia is an outstanding movie for all ages from children to adults. It makes you think and wonder. Also what's going to happen next? Think about it the money you spend is worth it believe me. So I recommend that you find a theatre close by and enjoy the Chronicles of Narnia. (Remember it's worth it) <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie because it had suspense and great graphics. I liked the characters they played there parts well. Aslan was different than he was in the novel. It was funny and sad. My class went December 9, 2005. At Cineplex Odeon. <br/><br/>I rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars. The land of Narnia was like a fantasy and the talking animals were so cool. There was a lot of action in the movie with many funny and scary parts. The fighting scenes were realistic and the white witch was snowy, cold and evil. My favorite part was a waterfall scene because it was exciting and scary at the same time. It also surprised me because it was not in the book. The movie was somewhat different from the book but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Extra! Extra! The Lion the, Witch, And the Wardrobe is an amazing movie you have to see it. I'll tell you some things about it. This is one of the things about it when Lucy the little girl meets the faun the faun is cool. He is half goat half human he looks weird. Or when Edmund the little boy meets the white she's scary she has dirty blond hair a white face and a ice crown she calls herself the queen of Narnia but she isn't. Narnia is the world they appear in after they go though the wardrobe. Another exiting part is when they meet Aslan the lion. He is the king of Narnia. He is a good lion, his fur is golden brown. The most exciting part is when Aslans army and the witches' army fight. Well folks that's all for today if you want more info go to a movie theater and watch it. <br/><br/>The lion, the witch and the wardrobe movie was pretty amazing. But it missed some of the wording and ideas as the novel. Although if you have read The Lion, The witch and the Wardrobe novel you would most likely enjoy this movie. This movie had outstanding costumes, stunts and special effects. The chronicles of Narnia movie represents good vs. evil, greed, family and friendship. I rate this movie 4/5. <br/><br/>Two thumbs up if I had any more thumbs I'd put them up I can't even tell you how amazing it was to go to the lion the witch and the wardrobe it left me breathless and stunned if someone asked me to describe it I would say it's the farthest thing away from a normal fairytale it's adventurous, sad, exiting, all rolled into one. It's an action movie for kids between the ages of 10 and up any younger and they may cry it's a very emotional movie it's cool because every thing seemed so real and actors were so great with there accent it was so real it made you feel like you could really go to Narnia.<br/><br/>This movie is a great one. You should go and see it. If you bring your children they will love it. Go see it while you still can. My favorite part is when the witch gets killed. <br/><br/>When I saw this movie, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, I was so thrilled. This movie is so exciting and awesome that anyone would want to see it. Children and adults should come and see this movie it will keep you guessing all the way through to the end. The scenery and the characters are very interesting and cool you would think that you are there with them. Overall this movie is awesome, interesting, exciting and pulls you in a lot. I would give this movie an A+. <br/><br/>This movie is the greatest!! You've got to see it or you are crazy. Although it isn't completely the same as the book, it's still awesome. There are some things that are different from the book which makes the movie a whole lot better. There is also a PS2 game that goes with it and it is extremely similar to the book and the movie. Everyone in the movie was very with there character, for example the White Witch didn't smile once and Edmund (the youngest boy) was a good lair. Either than that, the movie was fantastic! So if you haven't seen it you have to see it, unless you aren't into action and some fantasy, movies."

","I loved this movie. The Chronicles of Narnia have always been my favorite books, and my little brother got the whole series on CD for his birthday last year. We have always enjoyed sitting down and reading the books together, so watching the movie was so much fun! Again, my little brother asked long and hard to see the movie, and he finally saw it the day after Christmas, 2005. We all loved it, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something for all the family.<br/><br/>I personally was worried that the movies wouldn't hold true to the books and my imagination, but this was the best movie to go with an imagination! C.S. Lewis did a good job of describing things, and Andrew Adamson did a good job of portraying those descriptions. Awesome job, everyone!"

","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is based on the famed fantasy novel by C.S. Lewis. It's a story much in the vein of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. In this story, the four Pevensie children must leave wartime London as the Germans attack, for the safety of a country house. There, they encounter a magical wardrobe that leads them to a land inhabited by talking animals and legendary creatures. The good leader is the divine lion, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), who must battle Jadis, the White Witch (played by Tilda Swinton). The story is fascinating, even with the underlying Christian message. The visuals are amazing and eye-catching. In the end, you'll eagerly await more of Narnia's lore."
"shariqq","8","0","0","16 January 2006"," A very simple fantasy story made into a very simple movie with spectacular results
","The box office record of USA does make sense when comparing the Narnia movie to King Kong. Although the latter is a better movie in my book, there are a sizeable few who didn't like it. But Narnia is a movie that everyone can like & enjoy - from Kids to Parents, Guys & Girls.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with an introduction of the Pevensie children in the middle of an Air Raid during World War II. Promptly, their mom packs them away to the country house of an Elderly uncle where soon they discover a wardrobe that opens into the Magical Land of Narnia. A once peaceful and serene land of talking beasts is now taken over by the Evil Witch Jadis, plummeting the world into a perpetual winter. The children are there as a part of a prophecy that the witch would be defeated, and warmth will shine on Narnia again.<br/><br/>Adam Anderson successfully makes a movie that, unlike the Harry Potter series, never tries too hard to be grand. And for the same reason it becomes a wonderfully grand piece. Here is again a director who really knows his subject well, and you can sense his understanding of the world from the creative liberty he takes with the story. The extended opening scene, the prep & actual battle are not in the book at all. Yet he unfolds it like it were from the mind of C S Lewis himself. He also presents the movie from a beautiful eye, which more than helps to make this a lock for the home-video market. Although the CGI of the movie is at its best it is not unlike the best that we have already seen. That makes it less noticeable and more awe-worthy. This combined with good voice-work, the talking animals come across with all authenticity and no corniness. The children themselves do a good job of acting in the company of these imaginary creatures, with the best turn coming from the second youngest: Edmund, mainly because of the dilemma he faces.<br/><br/>At the end, it all works because it is a very simple fantasy story made into a very simple movie with spectacular results.<br/><br/>My Rating ---> 4/5"
"welshsteve","6","0","0","14 January 2006"," Entertaining and generally worth the watch
","Having not read the book, I cannot comment on how true to it this motion picture version is. Being that The Chronicles Of Narnia are regarded as literature classics much in the same esteem as The Lord Of The Rings and such like, I would estimate that there have been some changes to the narrative as it didn't grip me as much as The Lord Of The Rings did and thus as much as I was expecting.<br/><br/>With regards to this, I found how Edmund's initial betrayal of his brothers and sisters a little inconceivable. I was expecting it to transpire that he was brain washed or under some spell from the Witch. Alas in the film, this wasn't the case and the motives for his treachery weren't revealed, save from the fact that he was picked on by his brothers and sisters and the promise of Turkish Delights.<br/><br/>Many of the interactive dialogue sequences between the 4 children became noticeably unnatural on several occasions. Party aided by some slightly wooden acting, if I may be so bold as to suggest. If these lines are true to the book, it would seem that C.S. Lewis didn't have a knack for inventing natural interaction of siblings. But that is perhaps for me to find out should I ever read the book from which this film is based.<br/><br/>How 4 children can blossom into swash buckling heroes, willing to lay down their lives and become rulers of a land they know little about, disregarding their home world and origins in the space of a few days (as the time line is not established) was also a little difficult to comprehend, even in a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>But none the less, I am not going to harp on about the things that a feel were bad about this film as the vast majority of it was excellent. It is very entertaining boasting fantastic performances from Tilda Swinton portraying the Evil White Witch and Georgie Henley as a very adorable Lucy. The video and audio effects are incredible and the battle scene is very intense and reminiscent of the Pelennor fields battle from The Return Of The King though no way as gruesome.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much and recommend it for anyone that has a pallet for fantasy movies and stories."

","Having read the book, made a Mr Tumnus' house collage at school and watched the BBC series I was looking forward to this movie a lot. I must say, and I apologize if Sophie Wilcox reads this, that the Lucy in this film is a lot better looking than the girl in the BBC version - no buck teeth and bowl cut for a start. The whole movie was very beautiful, the effects, scenery and costumes were great. However, despite all of its great attributes, I didn't emotionally connect with this film as much as I thought I would. Aslan's death was rather scary, and sad, yet it did not cry. I am not sure if it was because, subconsciously I knew he would rise again or not. I'd like to think that is the case. The White Witch was a departure from the usual ""snow queen"" image. While she did have an icy crown of sorts she wasn't swathed in furs and, for once, did not have dark hair. She had blond dreadlocks and dead looking eyes. Very effective. Mr Tumnus was younger than I usually pictured him but still very cool. He wasn't as treacherous as I remembered either, though it has been more than 10 years since I read/saw Narnia last. Edmund was a little weasel and the boy who played him - Skyander Keynes (interesting name) did a great job. The beavers added some comedy and were very well animated. I thought through the whole movie that Aslan was voiced by Patrick ""And-I've-seen-everything"" Stewart, but it was Liam Neeson instead. I am not sure why I don't rate this film higher, I can't think of anything wrong with it, I just didn't come away thinking it was spectacular. A great film though, one that will no doubt spur on a revival of C.S Lewis' works."

","I've not read the Narnia books since early adulthood (over a quarter-century ago), but this adaptation has inspired me to do so. The young actors are superb, and the cinematography seamless and sound. I sincerely hope they continue to be faithful to Lewis' incomparable stories. Oh ... and LOTR fans should, of course, refuse to make comparisons. Lewis and Tolkein, though friends, wrote from very different points of view and with very different audiences and intentions. Other than the facts that both stories are fantasies, and both deal with (on some level or another) Christian themes, there is little to compare. Rather, the Narnia books and the LOTR stories are wondrous bookends to the vast field of allegorical fantasy. Enjoy each for what they are. I'm looking forward to the next installment of Narnia, and (hopefully) Peter Jackson will soon turn to making ""The Hobbit."""

","Although there is a particular draw to the Narnia adventures because of the long and extensive fan-base, it would be a lie to say that is the only reason why the film has done as well as it has. Non-readers will enjoy the film just as much as the loyal readers, if not more (simply for the lack of knowledge concerning the plot) because of the intense care that Disney took to stay loyal to Lewis' vision.<br/><br/>We begin in a time of war in England where siblings Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter take off to the country to live with a mysterious professor they have no past relationship with. With a small dose of curiosity from the youngest of the four, and a little faith from the rest, we are thrown into a well-interpreted, wonderfully-performed, adventure with a family of youngsters just trying to keep their family together.<br/><br/>The battle sequences were gripping and action-packed and the tender moments brought tears. The wonderful evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) makes us want to throw our popcorn at the screen in fury and the wise and mysterious Aslan brought the audience to tears and applause. Once again, Disney has shown they can make more than just kid movies with viewers anywhere from three to late sixties. The particularly charming Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) was a breath of fresh air and a beloved character audiences welcomed with open arms.<br/><br/>All in all, wonderfully interpreted and made.

","Looking for fantasy but not something too digitalized? Although Narnia does use a lot of special effects (I'd guess), they only add to the adventure.<br/><br/>If you go into the theater sort of skeptical, like I was, you'll probably get totally owned by this movie. Even for people who haven't read the books, or maybe haven't ever heard of it before, it's something to get excited about. For me, it was one of those movies you can't stop thinking about after you see it. The the set was done and how the actors were dressed really made this whole other world, and I spent most of the time in awe.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're pretty open-minded you'll most likely find something you love about this movie. It's fun to pretend for a couple hours that all these creatures and places could exist, to really get into the journey the kids go on. I thought this movie was going to be kind of childish, but it was so much more that I expected. From what I've heard, the books are just as great, or even better."
"stodruza","9","0","0","7 January 2006"," ...pretty good film....
","Chronicles of Narnia is pretty good film. It does seems to loosen up a bit in the second act, but overall the tale and its execution does manage, at times, to amaze. All the kids played their parts well, and I especially liked the performance that James McAvoy gave as the faun; one can tell that he is an exceptional stage actor immediately. <br/><br/>The only other faults that I found with the film were that the editing could have been more generous at times, holding on a shot or two for an extra beat here and there to further the effect of the image and the pacing. And the backgrounds, especially toward the end of the film, all have strange saturation with odd artificial hues. I don't know if this is usually done with the theory of making it more appealing to kids, but my eyes didn't like it. They were either over saturated with the wrong values, or were the wrong mixtures of reds, blues and greens. <br/><br/>In light of excellence, one has to consider a few other things. Like why didn't the battle climax scene, which was pretty good, elevate the film to the level of true spectacle? And as another reviewer wrote, as soon as the prophesy of the destiny of the children becomes known, they loose any sense of self-determination and events happen to them not because of them. There are answers to these questions, but perhaps they demand a larger forum than a capsule review. Suffice is to say, I think, that the film holds together despite these imperfections, and, as a third reviewer wrote, ""Bring on Prince Caspian."""

"abum190","8","0","0","7 January 2006"," Well worth it
","My sister and I have been waiting for a movie that could do this story justice for some time. As kids, we used to watch a cartoon version that was bland and pretty much boring. My mom taped a real life version off of TV that was a lot more entertaining than the cartoon and we watched that one instead for a while. We recently rewatched it, and I realized that most of the magical creatures (except Aslan, the fauns, and the centaurs) were added in with animation- really bad 2D animation- which pretty much ruined it for me. So I knew that any version that came out now would have to be convincing in its special effects or face my wrath on the IMDb voting polls.<br/><br/>Then this came out. And I knew I didn't have to worry.<br/><br/>Every creature looks real. Even if you can tell it's CGI, it's brilliant CGI and lets you sink into the world of Narnia without worrying about the fact that it's a movie. I was particularly worried about the Beavers, because in the TV version they were played by people in beaver costumes, and I don't care how young you are, you know they're people in beaver costumes. However, the beavers in this are wonderfully played by computer animation, made to look very real while still enabling them to talk, and given some of the best lines in the movie. Aslan, who I wasn't really worried about because they just HAD to get Aslan right, is a great piece of art and his eyes are as expressive as any human's. Liam Neeson is charming and soothing as his voice, completing the picture. The evil creatures are just as convincing as the good, if not as nice-looking. The landscapes are just as incredible as the magical animals, and it's no surprise that the same effects team that worked on Lord of the Rings did this movie too.<br/><br/>The movie's effects aren't the only good thing about it either, thankfully. The screenplay stays true to the book for the most part, throwing in a couple of extra scenes that seem unneeded but provide for some good action and a backstory for the Pevensie family. The movie starts out with an effective air raid scene that is not in the book, and at first I was kind of annoyed, but as the movie progressed I realized that it was necessary, in a way, not to the story but to the movie. In the scene, Mrs. Pevensie is ushering her children to the bomb shelter when Edmund (Skandar Keynes) suddenly runs back to save a picture of his father, who is fighting in World War II. Peter (William Moseley) tries to stop him and when he brings him back to the bomb shelter he yells, ""Why can't you just do what your told?"" Peter asks him the same thing again when Edmund is hurt trying to save Peter's life near the end.<br/><br/>The cast probably was the most risky part of this movie for its director, Andrew Adamson. Finding convincing child actors who are capable of doing a dramatic film like this one yet actually look their age is tough in this day and age where children are usually the stars of bad screwball comedies. However, the four leads are definitely capable, especially Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, and Keynes. Both of them are able to show a wide range of emotions, often in the same scene, and Keynes makes the transformation that Edmund goes through after being rescued from the queen perfectly evident through his wonderfully expressive face. Tilda Swinton was not the queen I was expecting after the TV version, but she grew on me, and by the end I had forgotten she was an actress and was riveted in the queen's evilness.<br/><br/>This movie is worth the money if only for the effects, but luckily, your money is spent on a good cast and worthy screenplay. I don't think this will be up for any Oscars other than Best Visual Effects, but if it's up for Best Picture, I'll certainly be cheering it on."

This part of the book had more suspense than any other, sneaking around in the dark, hoping they don't get caught. Why the director/script writer chose to mutilate this part of the story is beyond me.

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe By: Tanner Phillips<br/><br/>The Nazi Blitzkrieg rages over London and the Pevensie children  Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell)  like many, are being shipped to the country for safety. The kids arrive at the manor of solitary Professor Kirk (Jim Broadbent), an old bachelor under the attentive care of his housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne). Bad weather keeps the children inside, bored, and Lucy convinces her older brothers and sister to play a game of hide and seek. She finds a near empty room with an old wardrobe at one end and decides to hide there. This begins the magic of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""<br/><br/>I was excited to see this movie from the time I saw the preview about 4 months ago. I was literally giddy every time I thought about it. I had the ultimate expectations for this film and couldn't believe I had to wait such a long time to finally see it. I had seen the old cartoon about 100 times and remember loving it very much. I have never read the books but I figured the cartoon movie would suffice. <br/><br/>I think that might be why I was a bit let down as the end credits rolled past. I had expected so much and I felt as though I had been a little bit misled. The previews made the movie look fantastic, but the end product made the movie simply mediocre. I am not saying I didn't enjoy the movie at all. I enjoyed it very much. I thought it was cleverly done with some very good CGI, and some brilliantly mastered makeup/costume design. The same makeup artists that did Lord of the Rings were called in for this extravagant feature film. The hefty production cost just didn't seem to go that far for such a film. I thought to myself that they must have spent a lot less on this movie than they did on LOTR. However, I was surprised to find out that they in fact spent more on this production than they did on LOTR. I could be mistaken, and please feel free to correct me if that is not correct. It just didn't seem that way. As much time as they spent on building up to the story, I felt like they still didn't do an excellent job of actually building the character audience relationship. I wasn't connected to the characters as you usually can become with movies such as this. I think this is not the case however with all the characters. For example the beavers that help the Pevensies are an absolute hoot throughout the movie. You are instantly connected to them, and you love them from moment one. Mrs. Beaver is always concerned with how she looks, as her husband complains about her cooking while giving her compliments and expressions of love and affection. I think the beavers were excellently done, and a huge part in the enjoyment I felt while watching the movie. <br/><br/>Another one of my favorite parts of the movie were the Christian symbolisms that were so clearly included. I have always considered C.S. Lewis to be one of the greatest Christian authors that has ever lived. He was a brilliant man with a creative mind full of ideas and spirituality for all to partake of. It is not hard to catch the symbolisms all over the place in the movie, and I love that. It goes far beyond having Aslan the great Lion come back to life in an obvious symbolism of resurrection. It goes as far as small comments made throughout the entire movie. Such as, ""Why won't you just do as you're told?"" and ""What has happened is in the past."" I enjoyed this side of the movie very much and I wish there were more movies like it. I thought that the symbolisms in this movie were far more apparent than in Lord of The Rings. I'm glad that the director was true to the books of C.S. Lewis and was able to honor his symbolic idea's that lye within his own little world of Narnia. <br/><br/>All in all, I thought the movie was well worth my time and money. I am critical yes, only because that's my job to be. However, if you were to ask me if I liked Narnia, I would say ""Yes, I liked it."" I don't know that I can say I loved it though. Who says we have to love every movie anyway? I would even see this movie again. It was great, and I think everyone should see it, regardless of the shortcomings that it might have. Because all in all, they aren't large enough to draw away from the fact that if anything, it will entertain you for a few hours. It might even touch your spiritual senses a bit.

Does anyone know? Three cheers for the director who brought it all to life. He knows how to give animals personality in spades, something he did with Shrek's Puss in Boots. I am actually not a fan of most kids films because of the current trend in unendearing characters (Chicken Little) and have them be rude and smartarsed. While other people see comparisons with Lord of the Rings, for entertainment this is superior in my view. LOTR was overlong, over complicated, just like the book. I actually fell asleep during one installment.<br/><br/>The message from this film just as in the book was loud and clear and left me feeling great about the world. Note to children's authors and film makers: you should set the standard and guide children like the Narnia books do, not reflect the poor behaviour and attitudes of today."

","this movie was the best that i have seen in a long time, it captured the book to the word, even down to the fly on the window sill. It really gave me the shivers in the battle scene when the enemy is charging and the narnia army appears to not be moving and all of a sudden these flying creatures come over the hills dropping rocks on the enemy (remeber the scene at the beginning of the movie where the planes were flying overhead dropping bombs?...this is what it what it looked like) , while the rest of the narnia crew don't move a muscle. the movie was great and i'm a huge fan of c.s. lewis books...i hope that they make the other six books in the narnia series into movies. btw...i loved tumnus."
"jdkraus","8","0","0","29 December 2005"," Magnificentin its making and storyline, but disappointing in its acting by the kids
","For five years, since I've read this book, I've been waiting to see this film. Finally, after five eager years, it has arrived with an almost smashing success.<br/><br/>The story is unforgettable and childlike; the plot is simple, four kids are sent away to an old man's mansion, and shortly after arriving there, they find a wardrobe, and when they step into it, they enter a fantasy world called Narnia, filled with awesome locations and talking creatures, both the good and the bad. The story goes on about a wicked Witch who turns everything into winter and ice has ruled the world for the last hundred years. But hope arrives with Aslan, a giant and computerized, but fabulous looking, giant lion, with the aid of the talented and tame voice of Liam Neeson. Together, they must defeat the witch, before the world is destoryed by evil.<br/><br/>So, almost everything was great in this film, from the stunning visuals that are in a comparison of King Kong and Star Wars, the uplifting score from Harry Gregson-Willams (Kingdom of Heaven), the settings, costumes, make-up, and storyline. But the acting from the four kids almsot made me laugh.<br/><br/>Why? First of all, the girl who played Lucy reminded me of an annoying little sister that had the look of Chucky. Then, the teenage girl who played Susan, was dry, boring, and an overall pain throughout the film, and the kid who played Peter, was just as equally as dry as Susan. However, the kid who played Edmund was great, and seemed not rehearsed like the others (if they were). The actress who played Witch was probably the best cast member, because she was so evil, that she is good comparison to a female and fair version of Darth Vader. And ironically, her servant was an evil Humpa Lumpa with a beard.<br/><br/>My bottom line is that the good guys were grand, and the villains were very evil and wicked. I honestly have to say that this film should not have been PG, instead, it should have been a PG-13, due to its scary images. Anyway, it's hard to do good battle sequences with a PG rating, not that I mean the film should've been violent like Alexander or Gladiator, but needed, in my opinion to at least have some intensity like The Lord of the Rings films in terms of violence, to have more feling, and making them more intense and realistic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, that's the truth. About buying it? I probably won't because it's not an everyday movie, except for children. So, my rating is a ****1/2 out of ***** <br/><br/>Parents, if you wnat your kids to see it, watch the film first, for some material is a bit disturbing for young kids."

","This movie could have gone wrong, horribly wrong. It didn't. The only oddzo bit was Santa showing up handing out medieval weapons. I mean if Santa is going to show up in Narnia and start arming the natives like some covert CIA operative - he should have been handing out ak47s and semi-automatics. You would have sure needed them for Jadis and her army of most-wanted werewolves and beasty-thingeys. This was in the book so I guess it's entirely kosher - but it was a sequence where the movie seemed warped and hard to take. Wicked white witch - very good. Child actors - outstanding. Other than the already mentioned arms for children Santa-gate, this movie was very good all around. I hope they make more."
"siderite","7","0","0","5 January 2006"," I expected a childish story from C.S.Lewis
","OK, I didn't read the book and I didn't see the 1988 TV adaptation. Shame on me! However, I did watch this film and I was averagely impressed by it.<br/><br/>First of all, the special effects. There are not so many, but they are subtle. The movie has a lot of animals and they all look like animals (for the first time ever) and there are some clever computer light manipulation and actor physiognomy mapping to make it seem natural.<br/><br/>The story. It is a children's tale. Don't expect much from it. It doesn't explain things and it has a lot of ""lucky strikes"" typical of a story that is not meant to scare or excite, but to make a point. It has children that fate has put in a very important position and they are more or less forced to act it out, learning a lot about themselves, family and building character. It has a lot of inconsistencies and it fails to keep you into the tale. I found myself shouting ""Use the bloody bottle! Shoot the damn bow already!"", though, so I guess it all depends on how far you are willing to go.<br/><br/>The actors. Tilda Swinton again plays a powerful creature with mental issues. She does it well. Actually, the movie would have been bad without her. It does make sense in a movie with four or more main positive characters and only one villain. The children... are OK. The big sister is terribly annoying, but maybe that's just me. The others in the cast are either animals (like the beavers from the Milka commercials :) ) or have secondary parts.<br/><br/>The conclusion: a book intended to be a Christian allegory for little children is transformed into a movie. The audience is little Christian children. There isn't much else to be said. Maybe even old Arabs will enjoy it as long as they understand it is a simple tale with lots of inspirational music."

","My whole life I've always been a huge fan of the Chronicals of Narnia. I grew up reading the books and watching the original movie. In High School I adapted The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to the stage for our high school drama team. In doing this I became even more attached to the story. When I watched the movie I must say that I was a little disappointed in it. The plot was basically the same, but there were several aspects that the movie left out that I thought were very important. Several lines were cut that were my favorite. As a Christian I've always turned to the Narnia series as a source of inspiration, and I felt that this movie DRASTICALLY left out the Christian aspect. I felt that CS Lewis would have wanted the movie to stay true to his Christian parallels, and I felt that it really did not. I was very sad to find that. I thought everything else was good. The acting and costumes and such.But as for the Christian parallels I was very disappointed and irritated."

I would have much more enjoyed watching the Pevensies experience the thaw of Narnia than the river scene (and it would have cost them a lot less to do!). An obvious add-in for the game. I've played it; it's in there.<br/><br/>The Beavers meal. When you read the book you actually get hungry waiting for the children to eat. In the film, Lucy almost turns her nose up to what is offered her.<br/><br/>Aslan in the Witches Castle. This scene is very important as Aslan moves from statue to statue, breathing life into them. It becomes a celebration, a reunion, a joyous moment of rebirth for the Narnians and totally skipped in the film. A missed opportunity to give the viewers an opportunity to cheer for Aslan and Narnia. Oh, and where is Giant Rumblebuffin?<br/><br/>The Stone Table. Already mentioned in previous reviews, but where was the play after Aslan resurrects? Another crucial point, showing Aslan meeting the girls at their level by healing their mourning. Had that been included, the viewer would have been more drawn to Aslan.<br/><br/>In all, the movie was very, very good to great. Apart from Lewis excellent writing, it still stands strong as an entertaining film."

","The film is absolutely fabulous in pretty much every way! My four and five year-old kids really loved it, particularly my daughter, and they weren't at all scared.<br/><br/>The only problem with the film is that director Andrew Adamson didn't really do a great job of letting the viewer understand the power and majesty of Aslan before his death. Sure, he growls menacingly, but otherwise you don't really understand ""what the big deal is"" about this lion. (I don't think it was a conscious ""dumbing down"" of Aslan, as much as a simple failing of the director -- it's really his first major live-action film, and so one can't reasonably expect everything to be ""perfect."")<br/><br/>But that is a minor complaint, and I still rate the film a 10. Like Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films, I feel myself truly blessed to have seen such faithful adaptations of such beloved classics during my lifetime.

C.S.

And LOTR isn't not at all about the bible!

"andyetris","9","0","0","5 January 2006"," Fine, Enjoyable Film
","This is a very good family film, and I would say that it compares favorably with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, to which it is inevitably compared. The films are of course as different from each other as the novels are, and each takes certain inevitable liberties with their originals. Both films wind up a bit overblown in spots (too much emphasis on battle, particularly in LotR), and both have minor weaknesses, but provide satisfying entertainment.<br/><br/>Lewis' story is too well known to require more than a brief overview. Lucy, a young English girl, magically stumbles into a land where animals talk and magic is real. Her siblings disbelieve her and she is betrayed by her young brother Edmund: out of pride and greed he has succumbed to the blandishments of Narnia's evil tyrant, the White Witch. The Witch is on the lookout because of a prophecy that her reign will end when 2 pairs of humans appear in Narnia. Lucy's other brother and sister eventually discover Narnia and, evading the White Witch's wolf-henchmen, they meet Aslan, a mysterious lion who represents justice and freedom. Unfortunately Edmund's treason has given the Witch rights of him that only Aslan's sacrifice can redeem: without Edmund, the prophecy will not come true.<br/><br/>Lucy (Georgie Henley) is naturally the star of the story and so it is a delightful surprise to see the brilliance of scriptwriter Ann Peacock's enriched treatment of Edmund, superbly played by Skandar Keynes. Henley also does a fine job although William Moseley and Anna Popplewell have little to work with as the older siblings. The supporting characters are also wonderful, particularly James McAvoy as faun Mr. Tumnus. Frankly, I think Liam Neeson had a far more challenging role than Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, and he does a VERY creditable job.<br/><br/>The story carried me along too well to notice any problems with the CGI. I had uncomfortable memories of the BBC's TV version of the talking beavers  they are well-handled here as are all the animals (with an amused nod to the talking horse!)<br/><br/>The film's real weakness is that it tries too hard to be a children's adventure and fails to put the appropriate emphasis on the story's big themes: good and evil, destiny and free will, betrayal and redemption, sacrifice and reward. The book has a slightly stylized fairy-tale nature that makes it easy, for example, to accept the appearance of Santa Claus. Despite all its mythological elements, the film fails to capture this."

","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" follows the LotR Trillogy and the Harry Potter movies as another fantastic fantasy film. More family-friendly then the other franchises, the film stays true to C.S. Lewis' children's tale, and brings a believable yet equally fantastic world to life on screen. The acting is strong, the CG holds up well, and the design ""feel"" of the film is it's own; not just a LotR copy. The Queen and the waring armies deserve special mention. This obviously wasn't just another film with an overinflated budget and little depth: the filmmakers have created an entertaining and absorbing world to enjoy.<br/><br/>Family friendly but with more then enough to grab any audience, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" will be a favourite for years to come."

","I went to see it yesterday, and it is amazing!!! At first, I thought the acting was pretty poor. Then Tilda Swinton came along!!! If I was a Director, she my friends, would be auditioned immediately!!! If anybody says another actress could have done a better job, they need to watch the film more carefully. The character is evil, but what an actress! She should be damn rewarded!!! The others weren't bad, I just picked a favourite!! The film on a whole, did kind of drag, but it kept you watching. Action was in place the whole time, and worked immensely! IU did, however, at first, think that the start was a little rushed, and then I watched it until the end, realising the length. The director mush have been really good, I have never heard of him, but he is a pro! <br/><br/>I saw the older version, but can't really remember it, as I was about 6. But I want to see it again. I think the difference would be fantastic, actors wise. Again, the White Witch, I believe, should have been played by Tilda Swinton all along. <br/><br/>The skills in her acting came across when I realised she was evil. Because at first, when she spoke to Edmond, I thought she was a nice character, because I couldn't remember her in the old film. Then she killed the helpful fox!!!!!! Thank god he came back to life!!!! <br/><br/>Film overview:<br/><br/>Susan, the youngest child, hides in a wardrobe whilst playing hides in a wardrobe (THE wardrobe) whilst playing Hide and Seek with her brothers and sisters, and enters the magical land of Narnia. She meets the Faun, Mr. Tumnus, and leaves. Not realising that time stops whilst in Narnia.<br/><br/>None of her brothers, or sisters however, believe her. One night, she decides to visit Faun, whilst Edmond follows her. He loses track of her in Narnia, and comes across the Witch. Edmond drops Mr. Tumnus in it by telling the witch that his sister has been visiting him. This is not allowed. The witch captures Mr. Tumnus, when all 4 children, after being persuaded, on the run from the housekeeper of the house they are staying at, visit Narnia, and discover that Mr. Tumnus has been taken. They spend time with Beavers, searching for him, and on the run from the White Witch, whilst Edmond betrays them and goes up to the White Witch! She is angry that Edmond hasn't fetched all relatives (for her to kill, Edmond no knowing this), and decides to keep him with her. He realises the things she can do, in all evilness, and is extremely frightened! Whilst on the run from the White Witch, the other three children come across dangerous, and strange creatures, that can talk. They then meet Aslan, King of the nice part of Narnia. Edmond is returned to his brother and sisters (who are now known as the two son's of Adam, and the two daughters of Eve), and Aslan meets with the White Witch, both teams present. Aslan speaks with the White Witch in privacy, and realises that Edmond must be killed, as he committed a serious betrayal. Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmond, by being killed and all Narnia owned by the White Witch. The two sisters watch Aslan be shaved, and killed on the giant stone. All of the evil side of Narnia watches this. Later, when deserted Aslan lay alone, the two sisters appear at his side and sob over him whilst devastated of his death. They turn their backs, and the stone cracks, Aslan is back alive, and Aslan explains this whole thing. A giant battle is on the go, meanwhile.<br/><br/>Aslan runs to the rescue, carrying the two sisters. He kills the White Witch, and all Narnia is owned by Aslan. The two queens (the two sisters) and the two kings (the two brothers). The children then return out of the wardrobe, and the professor of the house walks in with the ball. The film ends. <br/><br/>One mistake I noticed was at the end. The children entered Narnia, whilst the Professor be downstairs, and the Housekeeper chasing them. Time is supposed to stop. When the children finally re-enter the house, the professor walks in and hands them the ball. Not in suitable time to walk upstairs, find the ball, and reach the children to return it, after all, time is supposed to stop. <br/><br/>Hope it helps, overall, a FANTASTIC film. 9/10."
"paul-servini2","7","0","0","4 January 2006"," Enjoyable and true to the original stories with a few exceptions
","I enjoyed the film a lot but for me there were two glaring weaknesses. The first was the way Aslan was portrayed. There was very little of the glory and majesty of the Aslan of C.S. Lewis' books. This is a major weakness, although perhaps one that never can be conquered on film. It was for this reason that Lewis himself was vehemently opposed to the stories being filmed. The second weakness was not so important but still disturbed me. The first time Lucy sees the wardrobe it stands out as being something special. Although this may be along the lines of other fantasy films, it is not in keeping with what Lewis wanted to portray. The wardrobe was a perfectly normal wardrobe with no magical qualities whatsoever."

I am pleased to say it did not disappoint as it certainly caught the flavour and spirit of childhood memories. The child actors were on the whole excellent and not irritating as I feared they may be. The animated/CGI animals were also very good and the casting of Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the beaver voices was inspired. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable film, and I can not wait for the next instalment of the Narnia chronicles. One point I would add is that at the showing I went to there were a number of young children as young as 5 or 6 in my opinion it is not really suitable for such young children."

The youth acting is above average and i think that the children suited all of their characters very well. Obviously the 'White Witch' affectively captures the cold impious character which she is renound for. The voice of the lion is also very affective.

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was amazingly accurate of the children's book by C.S. Lewis. Georgie Henley is perfectly adorable as Lucy Pevensie. Anna Popplewell, William Moseley, and Skandar Keynes are equally fit to play Susan, Peter, and Edmund respectively. Although it is fairly obvious that they do not have a lot of acting experience, they do well in spite of the fact. They portray siblings extremely realistically. You find yourself reminded of your own brothers and sisters as you watch them bicker and make up. One of the only problems I had with this movie, is that Liam Neeson does not have a deep enough voice. Therefore Aslan was not as commanding as he should have been.

One has to remember that when seeing the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was good and I definitely recommend it, however, I can't help but feel the movie was missing something...

","i read the book (and was obsessed with it for many months) when i was 5 years old and have to commend the director for staying true to the original story.<br/><br/>where adamson fails is in his attempt to create an epic film. you could tell that he tried - using cinematographic elements you'd see in true epics like the lord of the rings (sweeping vistas, dramatic music, etc). he unfortunately did not succeed in this attempt.<br/><br/>with so many characters and so little time one never really gets an opportunity to really know any of the protagonists which left me lacking a strong connection to any of the good guys. we spent a lot of time with the white witch, though, and she is by far my favourite character.<br/><br/>in a truly epic film most, if not all, of the actors need to do a stunning job. in narnia, quality varied from actor to actor. the performances of the actors playing the four sibling protagonists are mediocre at best. tilda swinton (the white witch) and james mcavoy (mr. tumnus) are notably good performances. then again, the fabulous tilda swinton gets to play an evil bitch...? what better role could there be for her? i've read many comments about the special effects/cgi and how great it is. and it is indeed so on all the main characters (the beavers, the lion). i found the work on some of the more fantastical creatures to be lacking, however. the best example of this is with the general of the white witch's army. a few times it looked like they were using live actors in second-rate costumes instead of high quality cgi.<br/><br/>finally, the book is loved by kids and grownups worldwide but, because of some violent content, the movie is most certainly not meant for young children. so you've got a movie that doesn't have the substance/depth to appease adults but isn't suitable for children either. while it's mainstream and religious appeal will likely make this movie a commercial success, from a creative/artistic perspective it's clearly stuck in a strange twilight zone."

","As a child, I liked the ""idea"" formed by the CS Lewis books more than the books themselves. This is a case where the movie has vastly improved on the original book. A big plus, is that the clunky, almost preachy Christianity of the books has been smoothed out and toned down. Aslan now ""could"" be a Christ figure as much as he ""could"" be an Osiris figure or any one of a number of mytho-religio figures who have triumphed over death. The pagan atmosphere has been ratcheted up a bit. This is just simply ""The Other World"".<br/><br/>I watched this on a gigantamoose. floor to ceiling screen with state of the art projection. The imagery and color schemes were so powerful that at times I was sure I had entered a Dream.<br/><br/>Strangely, as the film began with the London war scenes, as the faun played panpipes to the tea-sipping Lucy, as Father Christmas doled out his ""tools not toys"", and in many other places I wept inexplicably.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton's albino viper/Snow Queen of a White Witch struck terror into my heart at EVERY appearance. One's never sure where she'll strike (waaaay beyond the book's characterisation) And Aslan . . . was fur ever furrier? Didn't I want to run my hands through his marvelous mane and hug his leonine neck for protection?

No. A learned child will ""appreciate"" it but only a 50 year old child (like the author of this review) will know what it takes to ""love"" it: Passing Time's bittersweet loss and the cost extracted for passage through a magic wardrobe.<br/><br/>Kudos to all involved --- Ya' done Good!"

","I'm a big fan of the book series, and a Christian so this film appealed to me on many fronts. I loved this film adaption of C.S. Lewis classic, and I think older children unfamiliar with the original stories will find the allegorical exploration of the Atonement of Jesus Christ contained within it to be a very accessible and helpful vehicle for spawning conversations at home about what the sacrifice of the Savior means. But even if you're not Christian, I think you'll find the film to be great family entertainment and very moving. They were true to the story on all the key points and of course added in the requisite Lord-of-the- Rings-esquire battle sequences (hey, that's Hollywood folks). The cast was well selected and I am continually amazed at what they are able to accomplish with CGI technologies these days (Aslan was just as I pictured him from Lewis' description in the book, and they were able to convey all of the warmth of character and power in his countenance that Lewis intended). Don't miss this film! One aside: I would caution parents of younger children (say under 7 years old), that there are some scary moments and some emotionally tough moments that may be troubling for younger kids."

","This movie joins the legion of films based on books I was supposed to read as a younger kid, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a solid adaptation of the CS Lewis novel. For this uninitiated viewer, I found aspects of other fantasy movies sprinkled in the story, with some elements of greater theology thrown in there for good measure. Tilda Swinton plays the evil White Witch (though we never find out how she becomes so powerful or how she recruits her followers) who proclaims herself the ruler of Narnia. The kingdom resides in the back of a wardrobe in an English countryside home where four children flee to during World War II's Battle of Britain bombardment of London. While trying to hide from the housekeeper, the children enter Narnia where they become entangled in the war between the white witch and animals of Narnia, lead by a lion named Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). The kids, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are used by the Witch to proclaim war against Aslan's forces, setting up a battle sequence right out of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. The prodding by the White Witch reminded me of Darth Vader in the Star Wars movies, perhaps shedding light on the source material for George Lucas and his mythology. There is also an undeniable religious slant to the pivotal Aslan scenes, as the parallels between Aslan and Christ cannot be overlooked. It's not a bad thing, and critical viewing of this movie could be used to discuss stories of the Bible without overtly discussing potentially dicey topics. Overall, the movie is entertaining, though a tad long, I thought some scenes could have been trimmed, allowing the story to flow better. The beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French) are not only funny and bring some levity to an otherwise heavy movie, but the animation is top-notch, producing believable beaver tour guides for the characters and viewers. Lovers of the book will like this movie, while other viewers may be entertained in the levels of mythology featured in the movie and their relations to theology."

","The Chronicles of Narnia is a beloved fantasy series of novels for children and adults. I'm glad to see the first movie translation was done well. Although, there are several parts to this movie that are lacking, special effects not always the best, overall it is very enjoyable. I hope for better efforts for the subsequent novels, but the first outing is admirable. Coming from Disney, however, makes me question whether they can improve or even maintain the quality seen in the first film.<br/><br/>This is a great family film, although the action might be too intense for real small children. Some of the characters are simply delightful, and Georgie Henley, as Lucy, impressed me with her young acting chops. The cinematography is very stunning throughout. I was glad for the open, sunny feel of it that helped point this towards being a children and family film rather than a darker, young adult version.<br/><br/>I think Disney may have stumbled upon a winner series if it keeps those behind the creation of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I can only cross my fingers and hope for a continuation and improvement on this great start."

","The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best family movie offered in this Christmas season. Director Andrew Adamson really didn't leave any stones unturned. The special effects are extremely well done and the animals in the movie are as real as human beings in the movie. The final battle scene is well edited and it can be used to compare with the battle scene in Lord of the Rings movies. Of course, the battle scenes in Lord of the Rings movies are better than the battle scene in this movie, but this movie is for children and showing any bloody battle scenes would not be wise. And the special effects are not the main point of the movie that make me love this movie. The family and the emotions between Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter are the main points of this movie. The four main characters are well cast and they really make this movie works. Another area of the movie that really elevates this movie is the score. Harry Gregson-Williams is the composer of all the scores in this movie and they are not only appropriate for this movie, but they are actually increase the entertainment values of the movie. To me, I think the scores are even better done than Lord of the Rings movies. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is perfect for family to enjoy. Director Andrew Adamson and the casts have brought a classic story to the big screen with satisfying results."

","And I'm not kidding. There have been a number of movies I was interested in, and looking forward to this year. This really was not one of them, at first. Logic holds that it would be my absolute favourite.<br/><br/>I have rarely ever seen a book-to-movie adaptation that rivals this one. I say rarely, but possibly EVER. It was incredibly faithful to the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but that in and of itself doesn't make a great movie. This was faithful, and amazingly well done. It's almost hard to describe. The adaptation is quite possibly the best I have ever seen done. With exceptions, I think few people who have read and loved the first book of the series could be disappointed in this movie.<br/><br/>What else can I say? I love Disney for making this movie. That I can remember, the last Disney movie I really liked was Pirates of the Caribbean. I'm not a huge Disney fan, in general.<br/><br/>This film was beautiful, magical, childlike and yet adult. The most perfect children's story, come to life. The acting was great. I loved everyone... my favourite (of course) was little Lucy. I frickin' adored that little girl. But the whole cast was fabulous.<br/><br/>I've already seen it twice in the theatre, and I would see it again in a heartbeat. Of the several movies I've seen in the theatre this year, this is one of only two I've watched more than once.

"uptownrn","6","0","0","1 January 2006"," A disappointment, but an entertaining one
","I have been looking forward to seeing this film since I first found out it was being made. I'm a huge fan of fantasy literature and the Narnia books are some of my favorites. That being said I was hugely disappointed in this film. I felt that much of the CGI in the film looked forced and horrible fake. The performances of the young actors was one dimensional, and the ending, the four siblings as grown Narnian kings and queens hunting the white stag and then finding their way home to England, a beautiful and funny passage in the original novel, was clumsily handled and not well explained. It did not show that many years in Narnia passed and yet when the children returned to England they were still just that, children. The character of Aslan seemed to me not to be the central figure of this film, as he is in the novel. The film's focus is much more on the children, less on Aslan. Their relationship with the great lion is shown, although it is hard to show on film with the necessary detail the feeling the children are supposed to get from Aslan.<br/><br/>With these criticisms aside, I have to say that The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable film. Although badly animated the animal characters, especially a fox who lays down his life for the safety of the Pevnsie children, and the beavers who escort them to Aslan, are extremely likable and fun. Also I enjoyed the performance of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Early on in the film she sugar coats a sweetness to entice Edmund to her side, and you see why he is attracted to her, although we as an audience already know she is evil. When she becomes entirely evil I found myself getting chills. And although I felt that the three older children gave dull performances I did enjoy the youngest Georgie Henley, as Lucy Pevnsie. She was adorable and perfect as the innocent little girl who finds the magical land, and introduces her skeptical siblings to it.<br/><br/>This is far from a perfect adaptation of LWW, but it is enjoyable, and the story has so much heart and beauty in it, it is almost impossible to hate. I recommend seeing this film, but be warned of its pitfalls."

The movie has vision, wonderful actors - from the kids to the fascinating White Which, terrific battles, excellent visual effects and which is most important - it has the magic atmosphere of the books.

","This movie, by far, blows the rest out of the water. Being an individual who dissects movies, and one who compares movies to their written counterparts, this movie just awed me. There were only two scenes that were in the movie, that weren't in the book (the confrontation between Peter and the wolves on the river, and Edmund and Mr. Tummus talking in the Witch's Palace), but other than that, the book was followed almost exactly. I was especially pleased that they kept the part in the movie where the mice chew off the cords binding Aslan on the stone table.<br/><br/>The casting was suburb. Each of the Pevensie children matched their counterparts in the books, exactly as I imagined them. Peter as the one who is trying to be strong for his family, in light of the times trying to rip them apart; Susan as the forward individual, acting as the voice of reason, even when reason isn't warranted; Edmund as the selfish brat at first, transitioning to a chastised boy; and Lucy as the innocent, lovable little girl.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as Jadis added a level of cruelty and malice, combined with subtlety, that the movie needed. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was a perfect match-he portrays a regal, compassionate, yet strong, calm, and otherwise amazing level to Aslan.<br/><br/>The music added the mystical touch that Lewis' books portrayed throughout. The computer graphics were spectacular, especially considering the amount that was required, what with the multitude of mythical beasts, and special effects.<br/><br/>All in all, this was my favorite movie of the year-it parallels The Lord of the Rings, and various others. If you haven't seen it, I suggest that you do. It is well worth anything."

","I know that the movie (Narnia) made an impression on me when after seeing it I find myself still thinking about it the next day. In the 1960s, I felt that Lewis was just making his own version after reading his friend Tolkien's trilogy, but Narnia is very rich, and truly does stand on its own, admittedly interpreting Lewis' real life view of good and evil, Godlike and ungodly. While Tolkien's trilogy better remains read and not over-interpreted as a violent movie, Narnia works well as filmed, and I expect would be appealing to Lewis. Pacing is excellent, the mix of humor, fear, hope and emotion are fine, leaving one not wondering when the long picture will be over, but rather, with ""oh, what's next??!!?"""

","The movie was excellent form beginning to end. The beginning though where you watch their hometown get destroyed was unnecessary. Chrildren will find it fascinating and awesome. However the movie did have moments where you might think it would lose some of the audience. These include a scene with Santa,Skandar Keynes's(Edmund) acting capabilities, and the major scene where good and evil once again clash. The movie was produced by Disney who in desperate attempts to remain a titan in the film industry is grasping at any ideas that may hit big. Some include Cars and Casanova. Disney has such a small amount of films to be released that there are only two trailers before the film. It begins in Germany during World War two and you watch as a whole town is bombarded with explosives. The children are sent to live in a safer place with a mysterious ""Professor"" and Mrs.Macready. Lucy Pevensie the youngest hides in a wardrobe during a game of hide and seek and enters Narnia. She then meets a Faun named Mr. Tumnus. She proceeds to have tea with him until he reveals he is kidnapping her. She goes back in the wardrobe in her world to find time hasn't passed since she entered Narnia. She tells her siblings Edmund, Peter, and Susan. Naturally they don't believe her. She goes back though at night followed by Edmund who unknowingly tells the White Witch the whereabouts of his sister and who's been hiding her. When Edmund and Lucy leave he lies and tells the others there is no Narnia to the dismay of Lucy. Later when they break a window they end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe together. They find Mr.Tumnus's place destroyed and meet the badgers who lead them to Aslan the rightful ruler of Narnia. Meanwhile Edmund goes to the White Witch who finally reveals her true colors and send wolves to kill the others and locks Edmund in a prison. The White Witch holds Edmund hostage as they travel across Narnia to capture the others. When Edmund is saved Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmunds. A war between those who want freedom and those who want power ensues. Good vs. Evil. The acting in this movie is incredible (excluding Edmund) and the plot really catches your attention. The special affects dazzle you and the beauty of Narnia is astounding. However because its a Disney production at times the battles don't seem realistic and greatly appear similar to the original. The movie however does not have music that goes with the scenes and that gives you mixed ideas. However Narnia is much better than the latest Harry Potter movies and is enjoyable for those of all ages!"

They were able to instill the right feeling of wonder at the right places, as well as at other times indignation, anger, and great sorrow.<br/><br/>The animals in the film were the best seamless blend of, well, animals and other types of characters. I truly believed the gryphons could exist as they did in the film, as well as the cheetahs. There were some 'CG' moments, and the appearance of a rather well-known folk figure was the longest stretch. But even then the role that was there and how it was presented was masterfully done. Not leaning too hard either way.<br/><br/>The educated, serious film watcher will complain and nitpick about silly details (army tactics, inexperienced swordsmen against masters), but relent that the story is the main thing, and it is very very good.<br/><br/>Very much looking forward to more in the series, if they can keep up with the masterful screen writing."

And I have to say the film was a pleasant enough diversion for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>As one might expect, the movie is heavily dependent upon CGI effects for its realisation, but it would be a terrible inaccuracy to say that it depended on them for its entertainment. True, the animal inhabitants and fantastic beasts of Narnia are all the better for the CGI treatment, but its the actors (and voices) that really make the movie worthwhile. In particular, the young stars of the film playing the Pevensey children are outstanding and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them in the future.<br/><br/>It's rare also that I spot something particularly well done amongst the omnipresent CGI effects these days - usually its quite the reverse, but I did here. In the large final battle feline warriors of both sides charge and leap at each other. The way the cats meet each other and twist in the air will be immediately familiar to anyone who has owned cats, particularly kittens, and watched them fighting. These brief scenes are exceptionally well-done and hats off to the CGI artists for this.<br/><br/>The animals are not overtly anthropomorphised either, which is nice. They speak, and make head gestures rather nicely like a human might. But the features aren't too ""altered"", if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>As for the story, you are either familiar with it (having read the books) or ignorant of it (like me) but the basic plot is instantly familiar and recognisable.

","I was reading The Cronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe about 8 years ago (I'm now 18 years old), and I didn't read it to the end ever, because I didn't like the book. It was too confusing for me (and I was a bad reader) and that's why I considered pretty long whether I should even see this movie. Now I can only say that this movie was worth of paying.<br/><br/>Probably the best thing in the movie was the magnificent visualization and the great sound: the landscapes of Narnia are incredibly beautiful and the voice of Aslan is still shouting through my ears and it isn't caused by the speakers of the cinema. No, the great battle in the end is something I haven't seen since Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the mighty background music was about to blow me away.<br/><br/>One other thing that really surprised me was the animating, which is the most beautiful I've ever seen in any film. All the animals looks almost real and the dubbing couldn't have been done any better. Even the eye of Aslan have been done very well. Unbelievable!!!<br/><br/>Then why I gave only 8 to this movie? I think the only bad thing in this movie was the story: it isn't just my type. I prefer to more mature fantasy stories like The Lord of the Rings. Of course I know this is a movie for children and that is why it doesn't contain any blood or raw scenes, but I think fantasy movies aren't perfect without them. Even so, I can say that the movie was very exciting and that is one reason why I liked it.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie were kind of OK. Most of the main actors were in their perfect roles, but one actor didn't fit very well to her role: Tilda Swinton is in my opinion a good actor, but her appearance didn't fit very well to White Witch, whereas Lian Neeson's voice was just perfect to Aslan.<br/><br/>Anyway, after seeing this movie I've decided to read the whole Chronicles of Narnia series when I have enough time. I hope there will become more Narnia movies in future. This one is definitely worth of seeing for everybody."

","To me, this was an 'old-fashioned' story given the modern movie treatment - and what a triumph it turned out to be. Wonderful acting from the children involved, sumptuous cinematography and truly elegant characterisation all add up to a visual treat. Not being overly familiar with the books (read them too long ago!), the story came as something of a surprise but was beautifully handled and almost effortlessly moved along with its own pace and style. Cannot praise the young cast highly enough, but director Andrew Adamson also deserves special credit for helming a film that is captivating for adults without being childishly simplistic - a rare feat for a PG film. The ultimate accolade I can give it is that 'Narnia' creates the magnificent visual impression of much of 'Fellowship of the Ring,' which, to me, is the peak of modern film-making. Is there something in the New Zealand air.....?"

This movie hits the jackpot.<br/><br/>And I must admit, the movie is full of color and imaginativeness, all the magic and wonder of a fantasy world like Narnia. So, what's not to like about that? Sure, those people with keener sensitivities as to beauty and aesthetics may enjoy it more than most, but its a definite plus. It is truly amazing what technology can do these days.

","I went into this movie expecting it to be somewhat overdone and slave to special effects, but was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It wasn't quite how I imagined it when I read it as a child, for example, the professor's extravagant house has a life of its own in this movie (you would expect an eccentric British professor to live in something more modest or shabby).<br/><br/>Aslan doesn't let us down and his ""sacrifice"" for Edmund is just how I remembered it.<br/><br/>Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy do a superb job.

","Narnia was breathtaking! I think my husband and I have been waiting to see this movie since the first time we read the books as children  and this portrayal was everything we've waited for! The scenery was beautiful, and the children did an incredible job  especially since they don't have much prior acting experience (or any experience in Henley's case). Henley made an absolutely adorable Lucy! My children (age 4 & 7) also were spellbound the entire movie. It's only December and my 4 year old is already convinced she's going to be Queen Lucy for Halloween!<br/><br/>Our only real criticism was that the female characters didn't have roles that were as active as they were in the book. They seemed more peripheral in the movie than they were originally written, but Henley and Popplewell did a wonderful job of portraying Lucy and Susan anyway.<br/><br/>The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe has easily been added to our list of favorite movies. We hope Disney continues the rest of the Narnia series!"

","Harry Potter, LOTR, Harry Potter, LOTR, ... Well, those were the sentences I heard from people who watched this movie before me, so I decided to watch it myself. First of all movie is very interesting, reminds me on my childhood when I have started to create fantasy world, fantasy heroes, characters, etc. so it was kind of fun to watch it. Second, the story itself is amazing but it is based on clichés from other fantasy movies, so you can easily predict what will happen. But to put these two things aside, my grade for this remake shall be 7,5-8<br/><br/>So it all starts in GB during war and four kids from Pevensie family take trip to a safer place, country side. During one session of hide & seek game, from clear curiosity, Pevensies discover magical wardrobe that gives you enter to fantasy world of Narnia ruled by White Witch. Narnia is a world full of imaginary creatures, talking animals, and superpowers. By some prophecy these four kids, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, are meant to be new kings and queens of Narnia, but before that all good living in this world must face White Witch's army and destroy the dark side. As in every movie good always wins so this one is not exception, kids become honored new rulers of Narnia and live their lives happily, but... Did they forget how the Narnia is entered, well a kind of yes, by magical wardrobe, and so they come back to the real world to find themselves not the minute older and confused by magical things they experienced.

","I first saw previews for this movie, thinking ""Why is everyone making such a big fuss about it, it seemed very childish, and uninteresting to me."" So i decided nothing of it. Opening night my brother went and saw it, he said it was ""awesome"", and i've noticed his taste in movies is fairly decent, so I'm thinking ""Maybe it won't be that bad, I mean all my friends thought it was something special, and the box office is making a big deal with it and all, i might as well give it a try."" And am I happy that i did? Of course the movie was as my brother said ""awesome."" It was exciting, and I even had tears in my eyes quite a few times, but i guess i kind of am a wimp when I come to think of it, I've cried in a fair few movies. Well anyways this movie was extraordinary, and not a dull moment. Most of the characters were very likable, except for the White Witch, all of her followers, and at times I wasn't too fond of little Edmund, but Aslan, Tumnis, Lucy, Susan, Peter, and all of the centars, and such were very likable, even lovable (not sure about the spelling on all of the names, I guessed on most.)

","Overall I thought this movie adaptation was fantastic and it's only recently that the computer technology could catch up with the imagination of CS Lewis. I would heed the warning that young children might find some of the scenes dealing with death a bit disturbing but rest assure there is a happy ending.<br/><br/>Not having read the books, my main introduction to the world of Narnia was actually from the BBC TV series that I enjoyed watching as a kid. What I remembered from it was the gentle, majestic score at the beginning and end of each segment. The BBC did set the bar high for this and while for the most part the score in this Disney movie is competent I don't understand why in certain scene there were synthesised drum machines. It just gave those scenes as extremely cheap, tacky feel to it. The Lord of the Rings managed to avoid this, how hard could it have been.<br/><br/>The little girl who plays Lucy is just brilliant, I was absolutely enchanted by her. The older children's acting was slightly wooden in the beginning of the movie but as it progressed they manage to pull off a good effort.<br/><br/>I thought the casting of the white witch was great as well. It reminded me a lot of the demonic figure in Passion of the Chirst where evil has a tempting look. It's actually weird that as a kid watching the BBC TV series I never cottoned onto the fact the story had Christian overtones to it apart from the reference to the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve."

","I couldn't believe my eyes. Since when does a 42-year-old see a movie like this six times--twice in one day? The whole thing is outstanding. The only piece I could do without was the Santa Claus figure (I guess ""Father Christmas,"" since it's British through-and-through except for Oreius the centaur)--it was just too smarmy. Then again, they certainly needed the not-so-peaceable ""gifts"" he provided. But everything else was wonderful. And never mind Georgie Henley--for my money, Skandar Keynes can out-act anyone three times his age. I predict four Oscars: male lead (Keynes), music, costumes, and effects. Also, I was just a tad disappointed that Aslan just came back to life with little or no attempt at explanation other than ""Had the witch truly understood the meaning of sacrifice she might have interpreted the deep magic differently."" I did not once get the idea that the witch was an imbecile! And she CERTAINLY could handle swords--who the heck trained her? Two at once against a guy with a shield?? Oh, and her chariot pulled by two polar bears was a cute touch . . . Several viewings later, it just keeps getting better and better. I can't imagine how some people find it ""boring"" when it's so chock-full of thrilling chases and hairbreadth escapes. Make sure you see it with an evening crowd so that they'll laugh heartily at the wisecracking of the Cockney beaver and the interplay between Maugrim and the fox (""Greetings, gents: lost something, have we?"" ""Don't patronize me; I know where your allegiance lies. We're looking for some humans,"" and so forth). I didn't even mind the obvious inconsistencies, e.g., the witch slaps Edmund on the right cheek but he develops a black eye on the _left_ side of his face. But I'm sure you can find Web sites offering far more ""inconsistencies"" than this obvious one, if that's how people choose to devote their energies."
"RadioactiveZombieWerewolf","10","0","0","27 December 2005"," Narnia Reigns... film goes far beyond expectations...
","As Lewis intended the Biblical themes in this film are blatant but not overbearing for the non-Christian. In short, this film proves to be relevant to everyone. The only issue that I have with this film is that it could have been just a bit longer. While I was emotionally moved by Aslan's sacrifice for the betrayal committed by Edmond, it would have been nice to get to know Aslan better. Some of the complaints about Edmond and Lucy's pre-occupation with Tumnus are overplayed and usually brought up by those who didn't bother reading the books first. Disney does a freakishly good job of shaking it's own stereotype of being ""kiddy"". This film depicts evil almost on par with the Lord Of The Rings and the effects are nothing short of astounding. One of the films crowning achievements is the epic battle scene between the White Witch and Aslan's army which is by far the best battle sequence ever filmed. Never before have we seen realistic talking animals (polar bears, tigers, rhino's), matador's, griffins, giants etc. in all out war. After having just re-watched the Lord Of The Rings series one thing that stood out about Narnia was that the battle scenes all took place in the day. This challenge for director Andrew Adamson meant that there was not room for errors which could have been hidden in scenes shot against a darker set. Anna Popplewell who plays Susan is perfect for the part and William Moseley was very well cast as Peter who has to come to full maturity as a warrior to protect his family and help save Narnia. Aslan is everything we needed him to be and more carrying as much power as The Lion King and as much authority as Darth Vader, but in a good way. This is a must see film. For Christmas movie fans King Kong pales in comparison. Narnia is not only King at the box-office, it truly is one of the best films you will ever see. Smart people will stay away from pitting this film against Lord Of The Rings much because the films are both brilliant and carry a vital message a faith, hope, a messiah and perseverance which are cornerstones of the Christian faith. They are also proof, that Christianity is not only not boring, it gives creative freedom to depict good and evil with blurring lines and wondering about so called gray areas. I give this film a 7 out of 10. I can't wait to own this on DVD."

Details and events are described very well. One problem I have noticed with book to screen adaption is that if the novel is long[200pgs+ if 1 page = 1min of film] key events or elements get glossed over or cut out entirely. This film proves that if done correctly and with care everything that needs to be said can be said. The Actors/Actress performances portray the characters to a ""T"" Caring, sharp and dramatic.

","I saw the Chronicles of Narnia today with my 2 nephews and a couple of friends. Wow! It is as good as the hype makes it out to be. If you haven't seen it yet, I encourage you to do so. <br/><br/>When he wrote Chronicles of Narnia, C. S. Lewis wanted the story to get past the ""watchful dragons"" of young minds trained by an increasingly secular British culture to help the readers understand the good news of Jesus Christ. In this well told story, he does so. In a letter written to a child in March, 1961, C. S. Lewis said, <br/><br/>""The whole Narnian story is about Christ. That is to say, I asked myself 'Supposing that there really was a world like Narnia and supposing it had (like our world) gone wrong and supposing Christ wanted to go into that world and save it (as He did ours) what might have happened?' The stories are my answers. Since Narnia is a world of Talking Beasts, I thought He would become a Talking Beast there, as He became a man here.""<br/><br/>I had a great time talking with my junior high age nephews after the movie, slipping by the watchful dragons that often guard our hearts, protecting them from ""truth"". We chatted about the meaning of the movie and the symbolism of Aslan and the witch. Then came a harder question, whom did Edmund symbolize? Unless one can look in a mirror and say, I ... I am Edmund, one will never be able to grasp the true meaning of Narnia, Aslan, and His redemptive work on the stone table. Are the dragons still guarding your heart?"

My expectations of the animatronics and special effects were not only met, but surpassed. I don't think the story of Narnia could have been told on the screen until now.<br/><br/>You can enjoy this movie and walk out smiling (although I used a couple of tissues, too.) If you are a Christian, you can follow the parable for the story of Jesus. This movie brings a new meaning to ""something for everyone""."

","This movie is excellent. The acting is amazing. All four children are innocent and fun to watch, and each has a unique personality. Lucy is wide-eyed and imaginative, Edmund is endearingly conflicted, Susan is prim and intelligent, and Peter is brave. Lucy's facial expressions are particularly good. Jadis, the white witch, is appropriately evil, and Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, is dignified and majestic.<br/><br/>The special effects are also excellent. The animals, including Aslan, are realistic, and the battles are exciting. The music is beautiful, and the pacing is fine. Although the movie feels slightly rushed on very few occasions, I appreciate the fact that the beginning is not rushed. The scenery is beautiful, and the lighting works well in both the scenes that take place at night and those that take place during the day. Additionally, the cinematography perfectly captures the majesty of Narnia. The close-ups are particularly excellent, as they capture the actors' wonderful facial expressions. The costumes, both those of Narnia and of World War II-era England, are glorious and suit the characters well.<br/><br/>""The Chronicles of Narnia"" possesses an innocent, glorious beauty similar to that of ""The Polar Express"" and the first two Harry Potter movies. It surpasses ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" in acting, pacing, visual effects, cinematography, and costumes. Out of the thousands of movies that have been made throughout history, most are mediocre, and some possess true magic. ""Narnia"" is one of the latter."

","This movie was incredible!! Where do you start when just about everything in this movie was done perfectly! This entertaining movie really should get some points for making the audience actually feel the magic and be entertained, when the movie is based on a children's classic series. Each actor/actress played their part perfectly, and really brought their character to life. However, I must add that one of the actresses, Georgie Henley, played her role as the adorable Lucy Pevensie very, very well. She was able to show rare amounts of emotion for her part, and she didn't make her character wear out the audience with boredom. In this movie, each scene was put together so well, and went together so smoothly, it was quite amazing. The only flaw I think this movie had, was that it started getting boring in the middle. Later on in the movie though, the movie begins to get very interesting, emotional, and exciting. Narnia was an excellent movie, that will keep the most difficult audience to deal with to be asking for more."

It's a kind of magic, of a kind magic.<br/><br/>Having the book read before, I am quite satisfied with the movie, while I wasn't with the Peter Jackson's LOTR. May be because ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" was directed by a man who really loves that lovely book? The only thing that have disappointed me is that the Christian context has been nearly wholly removed, for it was the firmament of the Lewis' books. Aslan is Christ, his incarnation in the world of Narnia. Those who did never read the books will never make it from the movie, and this makes the film rather meaningless.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it's a great adventure for all big and small who has a bit of imagination: masterfully directed, without clichés, amazingly shot, with the great CGI and absolutely wonderfully acted (especially I liked James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and of course, Georgie Henley). Superb movie, though the spiritual context would be able to complete the gem."

And if you read the book, you should see the film. The special effects are done really well, they add to the enjoyment of the film, without being overdone. Some films are all about special effects.

"Acgibson","10","0","0","23 December 2005"," Wonderful!!!
","This movie is awesome!!! I love the books, and I was thrilled as to how accurate the movie was to the book. The scenes were just as I imagined them! My only complaint is that they didn't come out with the actual first book in the series: ""The Magician's Nephew."" ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" was the first book written, but ""The Magician's Nephew"" is the creation of Narnia, and it explains many things that are often understood in the other books, such as why there is a lamppost in the middle of the forest, why this particular wardrobe was the one through which they found Narnia, how the Professor knows so much about Narnia, and the list goes on. Anyway, back to the movie. It is the best movie I have ever seen. It is the only movie I think I could watch over and over again. I love it!!! Part of the reason I love it so much is because there are so many symbols of the story of Christ throughout the story. C.S. Lewis was a Christian writer, and he purposely put those symbols there. Aslan (Christ) created Narnia (the World) and serves the Emperer Beyond the Seas (God). The three ropes that Aslan is tied with represent the three nails that held Christ up on the cross. The Stone table represents the cross. Susan and Lucy are Aslan's disciples. They kept him company on the night before his death, just as the disciples of Christ kept him company in the Garden of Gethsemene. The earthquake after Aslan's death represents the earthquake after the death of Christ. The broken Stone Table represents the torn curtain of the temple. After the earthquake, Susan and Lucy represent the two Marys that return to the tomb of Christ after he is risen. The risen Aslan represents the risen Christ. The prophesy that Aslan will return represents the many prophesies in the Bible that Christ was to come. It is said that Aslan will one day return to his people, as Christ will one day return to us. The Battle at the end of the story represents the Battle of Good and Evil. There is so much more represented in the movie that I haven't mentioned here, but the point is that this is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait until it comes out on video! I love this movie!!!"

I really enjoyed the wolf character, as well as the fox. Warning though, this movie is a tear jerker so if you or your loved ones are sensitive to animal violence then stay away because some of this stuff gets pretty brutal, but it not like its over the top Kill Bill blood and guts flying everywhere kind'a thing, in fact there is only one scene I can remember seeing any blood, but that doesn't take away the fact that it still makes a great movie for both kids and adults.

Narnia is a wonderfully made movie with great acting from all angles. Lucy gives one of the best child performances I have seen in a movie. The story is outstanding and the action mixed with the storyline give us as an audience more than enough excitement to cover the entire movie. Narnia gives us a movie that is similar to the Lord of the Rings in the end.

There are two or three minor changes, but they really are so minor they do not affect the story or your viewing pleasure. The cast is very good, the FX are precisely there when they are needed - and only then. The dialog seems at times a little bit modernized, but not so much as to spoil the 1940's/1950's feel. Without spoilers, I cannot say much more. See for yourselves."

","I don't want to write any spoilers, so I'll keep this short. I read the whole series when I was younger and I've always loved all the books in it. I didn't really expect the movie to be as good as it was because until the last few years (with the making of movies like The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter series), movies based on books have largely been let-downs. But that was definitely not the case with this movie!! I was amazed that they fit so much from the book into the movie; it seems like almost nothing was left out, certainly nothing important. I am so happy to finally see one of my all-time favorite books visually rendered so well. I am very excited at the prospect of seeing the rest of the series come to life on screen as beautifully as this one has. This movie is absolutely worth full ticket price, hands down."

","This is a wonderful film for the entire family. The effects are staggering, and the story is faithful to the original story - The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.<br/><br/>Two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve C.S. Lewis was a great storyteller and a great theologian. He was able to weave together elements from fairly orthodox Christian belief into metaphoric stories that show a classic battle between good and evil in ways that transcend the purely Christian context. Elements such as the innocence and wonderment expressed by children, the power of nature and natural elements, the struggle between good and bad - these are things that have been shown in mythological and cultural stories from the most ancient of times up to the modern day television serials. They are brought to a strong pitch here in this film, hopefully the first of several installments of the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia.<br/><br/>One needn't be Christian to enjoy these tales, nor must one subscribe to any particular theology to find them accessible - this really isn't evangelism as it is known via 'televangelism' today.<br/><br/>The director Andrew Adamson and writers Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely worked with the estate of C.S. Lewis to strive to remain faithful to Lewis' original vision in terms of story and characters, but also to allow for the developments of technological expression that permit fuller visualisation than Lewis could give. This also occurs in the acting - the four leading roles of children are played by relative newcomers: Georgie Henley plays Lucy, Skandar Keynes plays Edmund, William Moseley plays Peter, and Anna Popplewell plays Susan - the four Pevensie children exiled from London during the war, thrust into an austere and severe household in the country that is full of real-life mystery apart from the wardrobe that holds the portal to Narnia. The film is very faithful to the spirit of Lewis' work, as well as much of the detail of the stories. This makes this a good companion to encourage reading.<br/><br/>Narnia is presented not as a fantasy or dream (a la Peter Pan or Wizard of Oz), but rather as a real place; comparisons will be made with the Lord of the Rings trilogy in many respects (including the incredible scenery from New Zealand mountainous regions), but one primary difference here is that the connection to the real world here is very real indeed. The White Witch, portrayed by Tilda Swinton, is played in a very realistic way - she represents what children fear the most, not as much bloody violence and evil as much as a cold detachment and lack of caring and compassion (something that children in all eras find frightening). Just as the place is real, the children are real, and the situations in the real world are just as harrowing as those in Narnia. However, in Narnia (unlike the real world) it is the children who have the real power.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are astounding, but the voices bring the real life to the characters. Actors such as Liam Neeson (Aslan), Rupert Everett (Fox) and Dawn French (Mrs. Beaver) add their unique personalities to the characterisations of the animal roles. Things are done in a truly wonderful way.<br/><br/>This is a film for all ages, and all sorts of people who love a good story."
"Normality","7","0","0","21 December 2005"," Good
","Though starting of at a very slow pace, Narnia gradually gets interesting. Defects are numerous, the music standard, and the acting is sometimes poor, but, on the other hand, the special effects were convincing, especially for the animated characters, such as the lion (which was surprisingly believable), some wolves, and other various beasts. Many scenes, throughout the film, are very ""clichÃ©"" and some have a slightly odd look, due to inadequate color balance between actors/landscape/effects. Costumes, Items, Weapons could have had better designs, or at least some cultural/esthetic signs. The monsters were also a touch uninventive, and looked more like toys rather than beasts. Anyway, the story remains a nice one, which makes this movie good and definitely entertaining."

","As someone who grew up with the C.S. Lewis Narnia books this version of 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is the one I have long waited for. Prior to this we had the 1978 animated movie and a rather low-budget BBC series, and while both were adequate neither really managed to truly capture the imagination as completely as the book has for generations of readers. Thankfully the success of the LOTR movies gave Buena Vista the courage to attempt this excursion into the fantasy realm and the result is a truly remarkable movie filled with wonder and spectacle. It really has to be seen to be believed and certainly on the big screen where all its majesty can be effectively conveyed."

","The movie The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best movie I've seen in two years. All of the things in the movie that were computer animized (like making the wolves talk) was really good i couldn't even tell. I love this move and am buying it as soon as it comes out on DVD. I have seen a lot of movies and this is one of the best. The plot of the movie goes almost exactly with the book which is good because a lot of movies that are based on books don't follow the plot, but this ones is very good at that. I am a big fan of this book and was hoping that the movie would be a lot like the book because it is good enough already and doesn't need to be changed.

","I've loved this allegorical series by C.S. Lewis since I was a small child, and have seen it performed in many styles from Broadway to cartoon. The BBS version sits beside Star Wars, Harry Potter and LOTR in my collection, though I must confess of these the Narnia series is my favorite. I looked forward to seeing the Disney magic (and money) put to making a version that included modern technological wizardry. I was not disappointed. The children selected for the movie did an admirable job and closely matched my mental image of the characters. The action was fast-paced, and the animated characters were believable and smooth. Fenris Olf will give you shivers, and Aslan is inspirational. The story was true to the book, and very few parts were skipped (which made for a long movie). If you are taking small children, consider previewing the piece because the battle scenes are quite realistic and the bad guys are truly scary. The attack on Aslan was vivid and the creatures as dark as depicted in the book."
"stealthmujik","9","0","0","21 December 2005"," Simply phenomenal...
","This movie was simply magical and wonderful.<br/><br/>The timeless classic story by C.S. Lewis has been faithfully and well adapted to the movie screen.<br/><br/>All the cast members were well cast with each of the Pevensie kids really filling their respective roles just how they were written in the books. Edmund and Lucy especially I think were the two challenging roles that Skander Keynes and Georgie Henley did an absolute wonderful job in. From the sibling jealousy and bitterness felt by Edmund in the beginning to his sincere feelings of remorse and guilt in the last half to Lucy's accurate and realistic portrayal of child-like joy and sorrow, the kids nailed their parts.<br/><br/>And who can forget the performance by Swinton as the White Witch? I honestly believe she deserves an Oscar nod. As a devout fan of the book I had real doubt in her ability to pull off the White Witch and even when she first appeared in the movie I thought she was miscast. But by the last half of the movie she sheds all doubts as she portrays Jadis the White Witch in all her icy, fierce, terrifying ways. When she first appears on the climactic battlefield with her cold eyes intently gazing as she's being drawn by her chariot I was blown away. Swinton was simply amazing.<br/><br/>There are two things about this movie I think that is leading to the negative reviews and opinions of this movie.<br/><br/>The first is the fact that this movie comes after the success of similar veined movies so that one cannot help drawing comparisons to others such as the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy. As a PG-rated movie, this movie shows no blood and the fighting is less violent (though certainly not disappointing). But while the Lord of the Rings series (both the movies and the books) were geared towards a more older audience, the Chronicles of Narnia was geared towards an audience of all ages. Hence the slower pace and more simple themes. The movie, like the book, is for an audience of all ages and demographics. The central theme of bravery, love, justice, forgiveness is not watered down and yet it is not too complex so that even a child can understand the messages behind it.<br/><br/>The second is the fact that this movie is so faithful to the book. While certain minor details (such as the witch having been said to be extremely tall in the book) may be different, no major act or scene is cut out. So for viewers of this movie who have not read the book before, they may find the movie drawn out or slow at times but if they had read the book, they would realize that the speed and sequence of events are for a reason. For example, they give a glimpse of the personality of the Pevensie children and some of the reasons why they are that way.<br/><br/>But bottom line, this movie will appeal to the kids, the kids in the adult's hearts, and anyone else in between. I've seen quite a few number of movies and I had goosebumps the entire last 30 minutes of the movie. But don't let my words hype it up for you. Go see for yourself and read the book if you have not yet. As wonderful as the movie is, the book is in a league of its own.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that they continue making movies of the rest of the series. Not to replace the books of course but to hopefully draw other viewers to the original magnificence of the books themselves."
"Lorax1994","9","0","0","20 December 2005"," The movie won over this skeptic
","I should start by saying that I LOVE the books. They are among my favorite books of all time and I still re-read them as an adult. I've worn out copies of some of them. So, when I say I was skeptical, it was not of the story, but of the ability to translate it onto film and do it justice. I was terrified that Aslan would end up being silly - and the story doesn't work if Aslan comes off as silly. I was worried that they would make so many story changes that I would no longer recognize it and would spend the entire movie comparing and contrasting the book and the movie. On the flip side, I was worried that it might just not work on film for people who didn't know the books. But, my doubts are cleared up.<br/><br/>This is truly a masterpiece. There are some flaws. And some differences between the movies and the books. But there is nothing that guts the characters or the story or the world of Narnia. Well, there is one thing. It is in some ways a minor thing. But, in C.S. Lewis's Narnia, NO ONE would EVER ride a Talking Horse except in an emergency (the battle would qualify, the later scene would not) and if they did, said horse would not be wearing a bridle. The Talking Beasts of Narnia are free creatures just like all of us - the implication that Phil becomes ""Edumund's"" horse is just flat out contrary to the rules Lewis established for the way Narnia works. It sounds like a small thing, but to those who really love the books, it is no small thing - it is a very big thing, actually. That said, big thing or not to the world of Narnia, it is a very small part of the movie, so I can overlook it. The rest of the movie was magnificent.<br/><br/>My only other nitpick is that they didn't give the White Witch blood red lips - the one descriptive piece Lewis gave about her - and he gave it several times. I also found it difficult to believe that Edmund would be deceived by her beauty and apparent kindness, as he was in the books, given the way they played her. But, that aside, the performance was outstanding.<br/><br/>The children were absolutely wonderful. I thought the effects were terrific. There were some logic inconsistencies - like why the White Witch doesn't just kill Edmund so there are no longer four to sit in the thrones ... but that's an inconsistency that is never explained in the books, either, so I must fault Mr. Lewis for that one.<br/><br/>Some of the changes are for the better. For example, Lewis's blatant sexism is gone, much to my relief (I always had to overlook that in my enjoyment of the books - rather like his blatant racism in the books that address Calormene). Some changes, I suspect, were for pacing reasons. Some were to explain plot points without a narrator (like showing the air raid and bomb shelter sequence). None of them cut the heart of the story or of any of the characters, however and almost none of them were inconsistent with the work of C.S. Lewis. And THAT is what I was really worried about.<br/><br/>I love the nods to book fans - the little details that people who hadn't read and re-read the books would miss - Lucy leaving the wardrobe door open, and Edumund shutting it ... ""he's not a tame lion"".<br/><br/>My only other comment, and it has nothing to do with the movie really, is that someone really needs to teach Alanis Morrisette (I think it was her) how to pronounce ""wunder kind"" - she butchered it repeatedly and it was distracting.<br/><br/>In the end, I walked out of the theater relieved - and planning to see it again, and buy the DVD and hoping that they would make the rest of them. So, yes, it was a big hit with me! And Alan Lee did another superb job designing a magnificent movie!"

I felt all these kids did incredibly well with their parts and interacted well with the CGA's that were in this movie. From what my wife says the story was pretty true to the book. Unlike the Harry Potter movies (I can fall asleep, and usually do, and wake up and feel like I didn't miss anything)this movie was well paced and kept my interest the entire time.

","This film perfectly realized the book ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (The Chronicles of Narnia: the first chronicle). Even though I know the book by heart and know the mythology, history, and philosophy on which it is based, the film grasped me from the first moment and never let me go. After some time, perhaps the first half-hour, the tears were streaming down my face continually. The book is, of course, an allegory of the Christian myth. All the details were allegorized perfectly. Passages from the sacred scriptures of the Christians, and moments from the entire history of the Christian faith and culture, came continually into my mind as I watched the film. Here is an instance. When Peter is given his shield, the armorial bearing blazoned thereon is an emblem of Aslan. The emblem is red. Immediately into my mind leapt ""In hoc signo vinces."" The accompaniment of Aslan by Lucy and Susan, until he must go on alone, resonates beautifully with the versions of the story of the Garden of Gethsemane. Aslan's progression to the altar of sacrifice, his progressive stripping and humiliation, and the Witch's triumphant shout, ""Behold the great cat,"" echoes perfectly ""Ecce homo."""

","--Only tiny spoilers through-out-- Yes, this is it! The Chronicles of Narnia is the next big fantasy hit, along with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. It is not only up there with them, but packs all the characters of Harry Potter and all the style of Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>I will start from the beginning. In the first scene, an English family is being bombed by Nazi planes. So, the family runs off, and the children are sent away on a train to go live with ""The Professor."" (I guess it is no coincidence that English children being sent away to live with relatives also happened in Harry Potter.) They think that it is going to be an exciting journey, but they were wrong. To entertain themselves, the four children play hide-and-seek. While trying to find a hiding spot, Lucy (one of the children) stumbles upon a covered wardrobe. Of course, we all know what this means. After seeing it happen before in many other stories and movies, we know that Lucy found a portal to another world. There, she meets Mr. Tumnus, a cheerful fantasy creature who actually plans to kidnap her. (I remember somebody like that in Harry Potter.) Of course, more adventures happen, and when the children finally all gather into Narnia (this scene does take a while to get to) they go on different adventures and meet different characters, such as talking animals (just like the talking books in Harry Potter) and even, (just in time) Santa Clause! (Keep in mind that Santa gives away weapons in this film.) <br/><br/>Okay, so far we have talked about the characters in Harry Potter. So, what about the style of Lord of the Rings? Well, the audience is treated to wonderful music (part of which creates the fantasy environment in Lord of the Rings) and some of the most wonderful detail. What am I talking about? I am talking about the amazing effects of the castle, the weapons, the creatures and the special effects. (especially when people turn to stone) Not to mention, the war scene isn't as breath-taking as the one in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, but it sure comes close! Plus, the camera angles of the griffins dropping rocks on the army resemble that of Legolas killing the elephants. They both show lots of detail of the war beneath them.<br/><br/>This was an excellent film! The world of Narnia is full of fun and creativity. It just didn't blow us away as much as Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Either way, it still ranks among them.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

The opening scenes are good and whilst they are not vital to the story they set up a running theme throughout the film which works well. This film is brilliant from a personal perspective due to the way in which it sticks closely to the books. The children are on the whole good, Lucy is very adorable, peter suitably unsure of how best to protect the others and Susan and Edmund are suitably sullen in places, whilst when they do open up they become charming characters. The voices are done well and on the whole the animation is well done. A few problems with to much CG and a lack of dialogue ruin some of the battle moments however the battle itself is well done and suitably different enough from Lord of the Rings not to have me sitting their looking for elves and the armies of Mordor. Generally well done and, considering the certificate, a very well done film."

The film began with a lot of info about time frame and setting as well as introducing the main characters, This was done very well as i did not get bored hearng the history of the situation. I even feel that this information part could have had more to it explaining more indepthly the relationships of the characters in the story. After this though, the movie jumped into even more intense explanations. The Characters of Narnia had to be explained as well what had happened in Narnia. This part moved too slowly and in fact caused me to be somewhat frustrated( when you see the movie you will see why). After this explanation the story begins to unfold showing the audience the realm of Narnia and its inhabitance. The one thing that I found to be done less than perfect was the animation. Some of the animation looked almost cartoon like when it was meant to be real life, and often the use of color was over played and almost looked corny.

I was swept away by how wonderfully it was made and performed, and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who has even the slightest interest in seeing it.<br/><br/>There were definite improvements to the book, however. First of all, I did not imagine Edmund to be as evil-looking as he did in the movie (this is a good thing). Skandar Keynes did a great job of portraying the greed and evilness of the character, then again with his apologetic and ""Crap. I really messed up."" looks. William Moseley did a fantastic job of playing Peter, and his acting was exceptional. He really showed at least me up at how believable his sword-fighting and charisma can be. Anna Popplewell was also great in being the motherly figure, and was very funny in some of her lines. Lastly, Georgie Henley was soo cute as Lucy, and did a great job playing her. Basically, congratulations to the WHOLE cast!!!<br/><br/>Overall, I give The Chronicles of Narnia 10 out of 10 stars, for every reason imaginable. TO NARNIA!!!"

","I just came back from my second viewing of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""--unlike the four Pevensie children, we lucky young-at-heart can use the wardrobe over and over! As so many have said before, Almost nothing is left out, and what little is added does not detract from CS Lewis' wonderful story. At first I wondered if I could accept different looks from my firmly entrenched views on the ""look"" of Narnia (i.e, the original illustrations by Pauline Baynes), but no fear--and Tilda Swinton's splendidly malevolent White Witch was the only character (here seen with blondish dreadlocks, heavy white gown and an icicle crown) who appeared different. Actually her performance was, I think, an improvement on the somewhat stilted original character, what with her icy (no pun intended) manner, drop-dead eyes and Samurai-like way with a wand.<br/><br/>The plot, once again, is a model of faithfulness to Lewis, with an added prologue reminding us WHY the children are being sent out of London. I suppose though, that it is a little jarring to suddenly see the four children matured into adulthood as rulers of Narnia--just one of those things you accept when reading a book, but find odd in a feature length film.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film were very well done--better than ""Lord of the Rings"", where I could tell differences between real actors and CG ""extras"". At one point, I actually stopped thinking of the friendly beavers (and Mr. Tumnus' hooves) as CGI. And anyway, shouldn't good film-making help you to suspend disbelief? The acting was wonderful too. In addition to the afore-mentioned Ms. Swinton, four exceptional youngsters more than hold their own--they make you believe in them as a family. I particularly liked the bond of affection between Peter & Lucy, well shown as she cajoles them into a game of hide-and-seek; with a perfect look of weary big-brother kindness, he starts counting ""one, two,three..."" and Lucy unexpectedly stumbles on the wondrous land of Narnia in her hiding-place.<br/><br/>This can (and should) be enjoyed by anybody regardless of their world view (The Narnia books' Christian symbolism was never a problem for me, it actually brought me closer to God). There is nothing to offend here and everything to delight and warm the heart. I'm off to investigate my walk-in closet....."

","I just read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe for the first time and I only had one regret. I wish I had discovered Narnina when I was still a child. It was a wonderful book, but I bet there is something magical in reading it as a child, but I was determined to read it before I saw the movie and I was determined to see the movie because there are so few movies with strong moral story lines being released today.<br/><br/>So, last night, I went to see the movie. I have never seen a better adaptation of a book into a movie. There were no significant changes to the basic plot. Those differences that existed were there to tell things that the narrator was able to explain in the book.<br/><br/>I was pleased with the job the young actors did in their parts. They were all able to carry the innocence and be endearing without being overbearingly cute (with the exception of Georgie Henley as Lucy, but I think that's just because she's at the age where her teeth are too big for her mouth). I think James McAvoy stole the show as the conflicted Mr. Tumnus. He said a lot with his facial expressions. I can't say as much about Tilda Swinton in the role of the White Witch. She was too mechanical in her role. The White Witch should have been much more passionate in her hatred. Swinton seemed robotic.<br/><br/>To touch on the deeper meaning of the story, the parallel with the Christian gospel, I was much more moved by Aslan's sacrifice than the entire movie ""The Passion of the Christ."" At the same time, I appreciated the cinematography involved in his sacrifice, though I do warn that there are a few scenes that might be difficult for small or sensitive children.<br/><br/>My only problem came with some of the CGI effects. Oh, I thought Aslan was well done and I was quite fascinated to watch the faun's legs move. The sloppy animation came when the humans were obviously against a blue screen. The backgrounds were not as seamless as similar movies.<br/><br/>Of course, to go back to my statement at the beginning that I wished I had discovered Narnina when I was a child, I was just as excited during the trailers when I saw the preview for the next Pirates of the Carribbean. Is it me, or does this one not look as good as the first? Whatever your age, discover Narnina today."

","As a movie it is a good. As a representation of the book it is mediocre. Most of the wonderful words and dialogue from the books are dumbed down in the movie. The beavers, wolves, and Ginarrbrik are especially awful (corny dialogue, badly animated, etc). It seemed like the people who made the movie were not huge fans of the book (they may have liked it, but you could tell that they did not love it).<br/><br/>Visually it was pretty nice (besides some of the animations), but basically, whoever wrote the script needs to be replaced before the next movie comes out. C.S Lewis would have never written some of the crap the actors were made to say in the movie.<br/><br/>Certain small details I enjoyed (never closing the wardrobe door, as is stressed several times in the book...the white stag...etc). The final battle was well done, but the fight between Peter and Maugrim was very anticlimactic. It was well cast...the children and the witch were very well done...though I thought the professor could have been better (he was a bit too goofy).<br/><br/>It definitely could have been better...hopefully in the next one they will get someone who can better interpret the book to a screenplay and ditch the corny dialogue...especially when the original dialogue from the book is so wonderful and strong! The average viewer will most probably like it. Lovers of the book, however, may find some bits lacking..."

","I went and saw Narnia on opening weekend and it was the coolest thing i had ever seen. I have been waiting rather impatiently to see this movie as I am a very big fan of the Chronicles of Narnia. The first half an hour was dead on to the actual book, Which I was thrilled about. From there however the story line suffered a few add ins which was a tad disappointing considering it was extremely accurate to begin with. But as we all know everything goes Hollywood at some point, but I was really hoping this would stay true. The special effects were not half bad. And all the actors and actresses did a wonderful job. Not to mention that Liam Neeson is a perfect pic for the voice of Aslan. Lets not forget Tilda Swinton. Good gracious. All in all I give it an 8. Way to go guys."

","This movie was good if your trying to go to a ""family"" film but i wasn't i wanted to lord of the rings type good vs evil battle for the world but this wasn't! The point where Aslan comes back to life was the MOST IMPORTANT part of the book and it was treated as nothing in the movie! Plus the white witch was obviously evil but Aslan was not obviously good. This was not a obvious good vs evil thing. This was not supposed to be a ""family"" film. This book was showing a Biblical metaphor for Jesus (Aslan)counqering death and saving the world. I think that the whole movie should be redone and raise the rating to pg-13 and show a battle between good and evil. Over all i wouldn't buy this movie but it was worth (barly) five dollars to see it"
"thirteen_lucky","10","0","0","17 December 2005"," Really Good Movie
","This movie was really good. It was very bright and heroic, and it really captured me. In my opinion, it is one of the best Disney movies. Some parts are a little violent, but you don't bring a five year old kid to a PG movie. The scenes were so well done, they looked really real. And it was funny at some points too. I also like how they picked no names for the characters, it really gave it a sense of realism, and it made the movie even more enjoyable. It also had a good story to it. And all the fighting scenes were more bright, which gave them a happier, heroic feeling. Movies like the lord of the rings are darker, but this is a great movie. I recommend it for the whole family, just don't bring really young children. A must see this Christmas."

","I just saw this movie, fearing of story changes, bad acting, and a push on Religion! I left feeling a feeling I haven't felt from a movie in quite some time! The whole story, in my opinion, is true to the book and then some. It has everything I could ask for and more. It's true that there is a religious tone given to us from C.S. Lewis, but while you watch the movie (unless you're looking for it) only enough to set the mood shines through and you are left with a compelling story.<br/><br/>Every actor, big and small, did absolutely fabulous! From Tilda Swinton (White Witch) to the four children, Georgie Henley (Lucy: cutest girl in creation) Skander Keynes (Edmund) Anna Popplewell (Susan) and William Moseley (Peter: very handsome I may say!) All did a magical job and Liam Neeson (Aslan) surprised me with a very mystical voice job! All in all, I have to say that if you don't agree with me, try it again and make sure you don't like it. And if you do like, go see it again too, because in my opinion it was just that good!"

","After seeing this movie I talked about it with my elementary school age children. We all agreed that the movie had everything that we had envisioned in our head while reading the first book of the Narnia series. Aslan was magnificent, Lucy was adorable, the Witch was frighteningly evil, the scene at the Stone Table was heartbreaking. I'm a grown man who has read this book seven or eight times, twice aloud to my children, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that my eyes welled with tears. I loved the scenes with the professor. I do think that more time should have been spent showing Edmund's temptation and the effect that the Turkish delight has on him. He seems to cave in to the Witch's promises too easily. His siblings at this point in the story have done nothing except the most normal sort of bickering that any brothers or sisters would have done, but Edmund readily supplies the Witch with information that severely harms the forces of good. This is a very good movie, I would recommend it to anyone."
"movie_girl11","9","0","0","16 December 2005"," Like the book?...then you'll like this movie!
","Just like any other recent movie that originated from a popular book (Harry Potter and LOTRs both instantly jump to mind faster then you can say ""the one ring"" seven times fast!) - it is very hard to critique fairly and with an open mind. Most viewers already have images of what Narnia should look like, what Aslan should sound like, and of course what parts of the book were missed and what they should have edited. As a reader of all seven C.S. Lewis classics, I am no different. However, as a movie goer looking for a new way to indulge my over abundant imagination, I was very pleased with this picture! The casting felt remarkable! I felt that if they did well with casting the Lucy character, it had a good strong chance of succeeding. Lucy carries the entire movie. The White Witch is also very interesting to watch. I'm not sure how they made her eyes look as icy as they did, or if it was natural, either way - great intensity! The other three children are believable too. I thought Peter was very good as the eldest child, while I pictured Edmund to look a little different. Also - as far as all four of them being related, Peter didn't really look much like the other three, but he still made the perfect Peter so I can live with the slight difference.<br/><br/>The movie itself was a little slow at times, but if you read the book, the movie is very much in order and in context. I felt that while I was watching it, I was actually re-reading the book whereas in movies like Harry Potter- I have to piece certain parts together to figure out what is missing because the books are longer then any movie should ever be! And in their own way, they also succeed, but Narnia is as is well scripted.<br/><br/>As for other things I strongly enjoyed - the fawn, Mr. Tumnous was great and fascinating to watch. Liam Neison as the voice of Aslan really was the only major downer of the entire movie. It just wasn't as mystical or powerful as I expected and hoped for. I feel as though a no name actor with an amazing voice might have been better - especially since Aslan is suppose to take on many different faces and represent a wide range of possibilities. Recognizing the voice kind of ruined it for me personally.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave it a 9 out of 10. P.s. stay through the credits for a few extra minutes. You get the Alanis M. song and a bonus!"

","The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is an AMAZING movie. So far it's the best this year. Ever scene kept you in a trance. This movie was exactly like the book. There were only 2 minor parts that weren't in the book, but everything that was in the book, was in the movie. It's the closest I think a movie can get to the book. The actors and actresses that starred in the movie were excellent. They had amazing graphics, and the scenes containing the war being fought were wonderful. The movie flowed well, and wasn't choppy. You didn't get lost and they explained everything that you needed to know. This film included humor, suspense, and sadness. Pretty much everything. You'll laugh, gasp, and cry all at the same time. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is an AMAZING film, made for everyone of all ages."

","Narnia has got to be one of the simplest movies that I have ever seen. And in saying this, I do not mean it in a derogatory way. Simple means it is clear cut...good versus evil...You know who the good and bad guys are. And so, you know who to cheer for in the theater. This is such a simple story...there is magic, creatures, and a proper villain...and as I have said before...the simplicity is a wonderful change from having to constantly sit and figure out who is really good and who is really bad. If I had wanted to think when I went to the movie I would have gone to see a drama. I believe that I loved Narnia most because of the pureness of the characters...they had real problems that they dealt with in just...real...old fashioned humility and courage. Narnia is a precious jewel that should be seen by all...adults and children alike. The story is fabulous and the characters are...well...simple to understand. So, walk through the wardrobe and maybe find a little magic in your life...I know that I certainly did."

","This rare movie entertains people of all ages and who can say that these days. It stands on its merits alone, and is not competing with Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The wonderful achievement of a movie follows the author's intent with only minor changes is awesome. The tale's strength lies in the plot, the characters and the changes in them. Instead of merely entertaining, it provokes reactions from the viewer. Would they respond to challenges the way these children did? Viewers will have to see for themselves.<br/><br/>The thrill of seeing such realistic animation with centaurs, the lion and even the ugly creatures put the movie right up there with the superstar movies.<br/><br/>My favorite part is also seeing Lucy's delight at the magical kingdom, but also her response to Aslan.<br/><br/>This is a must see movie, and if you look closely you'll see a story of redemption that has only one allegory--Jesus."

","I've seen the movie twice. The first time, I was anticipating each event and the second time, I just relaxed and enjoyed the movie. The movie was very faithful to the book. The changes were to better express what Lewis wanted his reader to experience. There were some flaws, but overall, the movie was excellent! I recommend this movie for families to see together, but there are some frightening images/scenes that might scare young children. I also recommend that before seeing the movie to read/reread the book. Especially if you haven't read the book. The goods: The acting was wonderful. The beavers were great with their humor. The special effects, especially for the battle scene was amazing. Lucy's emotional scenes were very touching. The emotional baggage of the movie was very strong. Flaws: The White Witch should not have known that Edmund was a Son of Adam so quickly but Tilda's acting was great. Aslan should have been a tad bit bigger. Some CGI weren't as good as they could have been. I feel that the sacrifice scene should have been a bit longer. The farewell scene where Lucy and Susan walk with Aslan was somewhat short. People will be comparing Narnia to Lord of the Rings, but they should know that without Lewis, there might have never been a Lord of the Rings for the world to enjoy!"

","This movie was strikingly good, as a lover of the book, i was amazed at how well they made everything seem real, especially Aslan. When books are made into movies like harry potter, i like them to follow the book as well as possible, and that is probably why this movie made me so happy, only little thing weren't the exact same, and they were good changes, I have nothing bad to say about the movie except that the Santa Claus should have looked a little more like Santa Claus, but you could still tell who it was. All of the actors did a great job in bringing their characters to life, and the witch was scary, she might have been a little scarier, but then parents might not have taken their little kids to it. The end battle was my favorite part, it was intense and the leopards and tigers tackling each other looked really cool, the fighting was well done, EVERYTHING was just so well done so everyone needs to see this movie and i don't understand why the rating is only a seven when it should be an eleven!"
"jeffthemartin","6","0","0","16 December 2005"," A decent start; I have high hopes!
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, is a decent start to the Chronicles of Narnia movie franchise. I was sufficiently entertained that I will watch it again when it comes out on DVD, and I am looking forward to the next Narnia movie! This movie falls short of excellent because it tries too hard, and the strain shows. The film-makers were in the unfortunate position of having to convince the studio execs at Disney and Walden Media that they could do a good job making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode. The problem is, I am not a studio exec. I want an excellent movie, regardless of how much money it might make.<br/><br/>There are only a few changes made from the book. They shortened up the timeframe a little, showed things that are only hinted at in the book, and increased the tension and drama in a few scenes. None of these changes were bad decisions, but many of them weren't integrated into the plot very well. Rather than feeling the added tension and drama, all I was thinking about was that the screenwriters had made these changes purely to try to make the story better. On a micro level, the movie delivered excellent individual scenes and characters, but the elements didn't quite connect together to make a great movie.<br/><br/>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode hits one of it's most emotional notes before it even gets to Narnia. The movie opens with warplanes bombing the city of London, England, terrorizing its inhabitants. Fearing for the safety of the children, the citizens of England have implemented a program whereby children are sent out of the city to live where they will be safer. This dramatic scene introduces us to the four Pevensie children, played by four superb young actors.<br/><br/>In spite of great source material and a very handsome budget, the quality of the acting is the main strength of this movie. The children's performances are so very sincere and whole-hearted that I didn't even think about what an excellent job they were doing until after the movie was over. Peter is the perfect older brother left in charge: not quite sure of himself as a leader because of his youth and inexperience, but absolutely determined to follow in his father's footsteps and do his best to keep his younger brother and sisters safe. Edmund is the surly younger brother, chafing under Peter's authority and trying desperately to validate his own worth. Susan is the older sister, mothering the two younger ones the best a 15-year-old can, and cute Lucy, so adorable, yet brave and adventurous, is the youngest, for whom any one of her brothers and sisters (except perhaps Edmund) would lay down their life in an instant.<br/><br/>Another excellent performance is put on by the actress playing the White Witch/Queen of Narnia. When I saw previews for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode, I wasn't sure if I would like the way the White Witch was played. I thought she looked too much like an actress in glamorous make-up. But the full realization of her character, in the context of the movie, was completely satisfied convincing.<br/><br/>The Witch's general, a minotaur, and her captain of police, a wolf, were developed into more complete and satisfying characters than in the book. There is an added scene between Peter and the wolf captain that makes their second, climactic meeting more meaningful because of the relationship the two enemies have developed.<br/><br/>There was a lot of talk on internet discussion boards to the effect of ""they'd better do a good job with Aslan's character."" As with the rest of the movie, Aslan is good, but not excellent. He looks like a real lion, he is majestic and interacts with live actors well, but he doesn't feel quite as alive as he should. If he were a human actor, I would say that his make-up and costume are excellent, and his voice is good, but he's just not that great an actor. I applaud the film-maker's efforts though, and with this experience, I am sure they will do a better job with Prince Caspian.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson and his fellow film-makers have showcased an impressive array of talent in making The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrode; now if they can learn to work together a little more fluidly, and the studios give them the opportunity, the big screen future is very bright for The Chronicles of Narnia."

Unlike previous live action versions the creatures are photo-realistic,not cartoons or ""stuffed"" animals. The special effects houses that worked on this including WETA and ILM out did themselves. This is the world I imagined it when I read the book.<br/><br/>The scene at the Stone Table is moving, you weep with the girls over Aslan and the battle scene is spectacular, you really fear for Peter and Edmund as they go one-on-one with the White Witch.<br/><br/>There are a few changes in the plot, as with any movie.

From the time Edmund defects until the other three arrive with the beavers at Aslan's camp, the film bears little resemblance to the book. Most of the rest of the movie is much closer.<br/><br/>The movie version made by BBC in the late 1980s (aired on PBS and available on video) lacked the impressive special effects, but was much closer to the book in storyline.

","Was slightly reticent about seeing this as had seen a few clips already and had not been very impressed. However it wasn't too bad. The opening sequence showing German bombers attacking London and the fear of the Pevensey family as they scrabble for the bomb shelter was for me the most powerful in the movie. Scary stuff.<br/><br/>The rest was fine but not outstanding. Peter Jackson has raised the bar so high that any fantasy film now is going to struggle. LWW is a very different fish form LotR: Narnia, even under the White Witch's rule is a polished clean and beautiful land not the magnificent, majestic and troubled Middle Earth. Even the battles happen on glorious sunny days! This is amazing as some of the locations seem to me to be identical.<br/><br/>The story itself is very chauvinistic (as was LotR). Girls don't fight (much) but instead look after the dead and heal wounds. Boys look after their sisters in a sturdily British way and good triumphs over evil. Totally. <br/><br/>Much has been made of the Christian allegory but to be honest it's only there if you look for it. It's not overwhelming so don't let the US religious right's enthusiasm for the movie put you off. They're just clutching at straws in a desperate attempt to bolster their sagging moral position and shaky faith. Perhaps. <br/><br/>In brief: CGI animals - very good. The Gryphon led air strike on the Ice Queens army is the stand-out for me Green screen - some dodgy moments. Wind effects - not enough hair blowing given the speed they were supposed to be going at (a perennial problem for film makers)<br/><br/>Performances: Tilda Swinton: excellent. Although her costumes just were not ""Ice Queen"" enough for me Georgie Henley (Lucy) - very good indeed. one to watch? Skandar Keynes (Edmund) - good. just the right level of slappable snottiness Anna Popplewell (Susan) - the standout of the juvenile cast. She has the best line in the movie (""We're not heroes. We're from Finchley"") but even aside from this obvious advantage she is, in every other aspect, way WAY better than... William Moseley (Peter) - Far too poshly camp to be anywhere near a convincing reluctant-hero boy-king. Can't hold a sword. Can't fight. Can't talk without lisping. Makes Daniel Radcliffe look accomplished. <br/><br/>Give it a shot by all means.

For those who don't know what the Chronicles of Narnia are: these are a collection of 7 children's books written by Lewis. Yes, children's books. And I'm 51 years old. And I love them. So what already ... ? ;- )<br/><br/>Anyway, I was already ""biased in favor"" when I saw the movie for the first time. But when I saw it I really had no idea how much it would pluck at my heart strings with so many themes like Desire, and Longing, Longing, and more Longing; for the Coming of Justice and Right. This movie was released during Advent Season: a few weeks before Christmas. Perfect timing given the themes.<br/><br/>The little girl who plays Lucy in this movie is just absolutely enchanting. And if you're like me and feel like you know Lucy ... and Peter and Susan and Edmund ... from the full Narnia series ... then you'll remember just how very, very special this little girl is in that series. This little girl Lucy in the movie really opens wide her child's eyes and my eyes looking at her eyes and her face. Her response and reaction to, well, everything, was so appealing that to me this little girl made every scene that she was in. And that's almost every scene of the movie.<br/><br/>All four of the children, though, were very well played by this young cast. Again, I almost feel I know these children from the books: and they come across with all the individuality and complementarity that they do in the books. <br/><br/>Character development is an interesting feature of this movie. Edmund's development is by far most profound; well acted, well scripted, satisfying. Peter has a strong character development as well. Susan has some character development. Lucy ... as far as I can see ... exhibits no character development at all ... and this is wholly welcome: one simply wants Lucy to change in no way at all!<br/><br/>Relationships ... among the four children; between the children and the Great Lion, Aslan; between the Children and the Narnians; were modulated in an ongoing appealing manner that was both complex and straightforward. <br/><br/>Speaking of the Narnians: McAvoy's Tumnus was perfect; Tilda Swinson's White Witch was simply perfect as well; the Beavers were wonderfully appealing and convincing. The Centaurs and Minotaurs and Wolves and Ogres were wonderful. The manner in which Dryads were depicted was quite imaginative and a successful adaptation from the books. <br/><br/>The scenery was beautiful, delightful ... and the music, which I thought at first I wouldn't like, actually turned out to be a wonderfully lush, well-integrated feature of the whole film.<br/><br/>Comparisons with The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter movies are inevitable. I very much have enjoyed these series as well. And frankly I think all three contributions to this common imaginative/fantastic genre have unique features to commend them to us. I think other than that I'll pass on comparisons for the moment except to say: if you liked one of the three, you may find that, like me, you'll like all three.<br/><br/>Just a delightful, wonderful movie ... And just as LOTR and Harry Potter have developed multiple movie installments, I very much hope that cinematic celebration of the Narnian Chronicles continue!"

","**A few spoilers but nothing new if you have read the book** I was disappointed with the CG in this movie, not nearly as good as Lord of the Rings. Almost looked like a made for TV movie in parts. Acting was just okay. The best performances were given by the white witch. She was my favorite character. For those of you who read the books, you may be a little disappointed. One of the most critical scenes in the movie is when Aslan heads up to the stone table to be sacrificed. There is supposed to be an emotion connection with the audience, but due to the fact that Aslan was only in the movie for a few scenes beforehand, you really don't' feel the impact. Then the children stay behind after Aslan's death and weep for a day or so. This again, after only meeting him a few minutes before in the film. Those were only some of the things that bothered my about the film.<br/><br/>Maybe Peter Jackson could have done better with the way the enviorments looked in the movie, they didn't seem to blend very well. The animals were actually done very well. <br/><br/>I give the movie a 7 in all, the book remains one of my favorites of all time. I liked it a lot more than LOTR although the LOTR movies are much better. I think maybe the lack of description compared to Tolkien in CS. Lewis's books came through on film. Who knows."

","During the movie, I was so taken by the fact, this movie was so real. It was as if, this movie read my mind when it came to the images from the book I had created in my mind. It was really freaky! It was as if I had met and knew the kids. The story which I have not read these books in over 25 years. I found this movie to be a grand way to bring the words of great books to life. My sister and I love this movie, but we wished it had been longer. It went by so fast, maybe cause we were so over taken by it. But it did seem to have covered so much so fast. Also I was even taken with by the idea of the Biblical view of this movie. It was a great movie Good vs. Evil. I just flat out LOVED IT !!!!"

","I was touched by this movie not because of its flash but because of its humanness which is ironic because of the decidedly 'non-human' aspect of most of its characters. I guess that's the idea and I know that's why Lewis wrote it. As a children's story it obviously serves as a beautiful moral tool. The Christian allusions and the use of the movie as a Christian allegory have been mentioned many times here and I won't re-state them. Suffice it to say, Andrew Adamson and the writers have been content with letting the STORY remain pre-eminent and not giving in to making Narnia a multi-billion-dollar CG extravaganza.<br/><br/>The acting of the kids was good enough for a kids movie and that's about as much as I can say regarding THEM. Tilda Swinton, as the only other major HUMAN-like actor in the film, however, was OUT STANDING. The utter amorality and cold, callous cruelty of the White Witch exuded from Swinton and I think it is fair to say that she dominated every scene she was in. The ecstasy of the Witch's triumph at the Stone Table was written on her face and you could FEEL the loss of hope for Narnia. Her final demise, including her awestruck whisper: 'Impossible' when seeing Aslan back from the dead, was stupendous. I understand it is shown in the Trivia section for this movie that Swinton had not read the book prior to filming. I find this absolutely astounding. She did not act the Witch, she became the Witch!<br/><br/>I should perhaps mention Aslan himself. CGI he was but he was a 'user-friendly' CGI to be sure. He wasn't intended to be a 'super' lion or have super-powers in a special effects kind of way. He was a remarkable lion for sure but he was real enough for Lucy to entwine her fingers in his mane as the girls walked with him for a short way on his journey to the Stone Table. He was real enough to talk to the children yet still scare the bejeepers out of the Witch.<br/><br/>Images that will remain with me: -the WWII Blitz set-up at the beginning -the first sighting by Lucy of the wardrobe itself and her slow-motion pulling off of its dust cover -the first entry by Lucy into Narnia -Tumnus' lulling her to sleep with his flute next to the fireplace - sheer magic! -the temptation of Edmund by the White Witch with her vial and the turning of its magically conjured objects of delight into powdery snow once used - vividly foreshadowing her empty promises! -the Beavers - just like the book in every way -the frozen waterfall that was slowly thawing -the final battle - the dropping by the eagles and griffins of rocks and boulders on the Witch's army in great symbolism of the Blitz in London in the 'real world' outside the wardrobe -the stabbing of Edmund by the Witch -Aslan knocking the Witch down and finishing her at the end<br/><br/>An excellent movie to take your own kids to. There is no starkly graphic images."

","I never heard of the Chronicles of Narnia before and I must admit, that my first thoughts were more than critical... Being a Disney movie, I thought it would be just another waste of time like the last ones. After I watched it, I realized that it's probably one of the best family/good vs. evil movies of the last years. The movie is using pretty much all of the stuff you need for a good classical Fairy tale: the good are surrounded by thousands of colors, nice creatures and above all the whatever-is-going-on, all understanding and wise king who always knows the right thing to do. On the other side is evil with it's cold and I'll kill-em-all ruler, all dark, ugly and bad creatures. And least but not last the kids who started as common boys and girls but grew up to save the world. As far as I remember I haven't seen a drop of blood throughout the whole movie. Way to go !!!"

","I'm still reeling from the shock! It must be nearly fifteen years since I read the Narnia stories, and the images I saw today were so like my memories of them! The film is simply superb, with stunning imagery, and compelling acting by all, not to mention a brilliant score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Adamson and Peacock have truly succeeded in recreating the gripping and fantastical world of Lewis. The images are breath-taking. Films like this remind us that many of us have never grown up in our fantasies.

"Cinema_Fan","6","0","0","14 December 2005"," A Childs Feast of Imagination.
","This wonderful movie will do for the Children of today what Star Wars did for a whole generation of kids back in the 70's. If you're an Adult, then Narnia could disappoint. <br/><br/>Primarily a Children's movie, this is not to be forgotten, that the story is based on the Children's classic: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, taken from the series of books The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis.<br/><br/>Transcending a storyline from a children's book into film doesn't seem that hard a task, concerning Narnia. Grown ups will love it all the same, but Children will be Astounded by it. The Magical Land that is Narnia will have them riveted to their seats in a Spellbound Wonder. Imaginations will be set lose and the desire of involvement shall be justifiably Magical. <br/><br/>On leaving the cinema, my wife and I, thought it a very good movie. The only negative criticism was that to the end of the movie, it was just a movie for Children, which we expected and knew. <br/><br/>This is no Lord of the Rings by any means. Standing proudly on it's own two feet, this very easy plot and what seems to be very simple character development is all to familiar with Children's adaptation's. For us, the movie started to wane a little after the crossing of the iced river. <br/><br/>The introduction of the characters, along with Lucy and her Kin was done very well, practically the humour of the Beavers, where have I seen ""that"" relationship before? Very funny, and will Children understand it, I wonder. They will, eventually. This is our point, after the snow had settled there was hardly any kind of stimulation, for us anyway. It continued onward on one level, even the battle scene was fair but harmless. I would not expect a bloody feast, as I have said before this is no Tolkien. This movie brings Children to the Fantasy and Magical Splendour that is C.S. Lewis. Both very Individual in their own right and both with exceptionally Intelligent writing Minds. <br/><br/>The young actress Georgie Henley was truly amazing, where did they find her? Please don't say Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England. It's a rhetorical question. Another Child star to look out for, as with other Child Actresses of her age, such as Shirley Temple, Dakota Fanning and the then young lady born in Jerusalem, Israel, Natalie Portman for example. <br/><br/>Well-done young Lady. <br/><br/>I hope that this movie will delight and entertain the young and the new generation of Cinema-goers, to be kick started by a movie that is visually captivating will be a memory to behold. You have to start somewhere, for me it was Star Wars. So lets hope that C.S. Lewis's work on the Big Screen will stir their growing imaginations, as his books will always do."

","Since this was one of my favorite books from my childhood, I was both worried and excited to hear that the film was being made. Fortunately, the concern turned out to be unwarranted. <br/><br/>The film-makers did an excellent job with the adaptation. It remains true to both the spirit and plot of the original story. The casting was also excellent. Tilda Swinton's performance as the white witch was really a treat. Liam Neeson as Aslan was a little jarring at first, largely because his voice is so familiar, but this did not last. The children, especially the two youngest, really shone.<br/><br/>The only real flaw that I noticed was that the CGI was a little dodgy - uneven. But for once, it didn't bother me.<br/><br/>There has been some concern out there about the religious content of this movie. As someone of a different faith that CS Lewis, it is my opinion that this to be an excellent movie for children and adults of all creeds."

","This movie was amazingly breathtaking! It was just as I had always imagined when I read the books as a child. All religious hoopla aside, this story has universal appeal. A classic good versus evil plot for all time. I read the books to my children before we went to see the movie and my 5 year old sat awestruck through the entire film! Afterward, she told me that she couldn't believe her eyes, she had dreamed of that very lion the night before! Very true to the story, amazing casting, awe-inspiring scenery, and a spirit-shaking score demand an Oscar! I only hope that the next films will be as incredible as this one. Shrek was the springboard for this outstanding director, and he spared no expertise on this film. Powerful and energetic, this film never lost my attention nor that of my children. (An impressive feat at any turn) I am waiting expectantly for The Silver Chair, Prince Caspian, and a Horse and His Boy. Perhaps Disney should consider immortalizing Madeleine L'Engle's magical series of books, they could certainly do justice to it's mystical wonder."

","I read all of these books very young. I have since reread LW&W a couple times since my teens. From reading them and the cartoon version that used to be shown on television every year before cable TV this story has always been a big thing with me. I saw the BBC version of this and I liked it because it really followed the story but it was like watching a play, with the silly costumes and the plywood sets.That version had two things going for it, a very neat and well sounded out Aslan and a wicked and convincing witch, this one over- acting to a perfection.So when I heard a long time back Disney was remaking this I thought, hmmm well have to see, I didn't think they would put out anything but cute fluff and I thought they would drown out Lewis' Christian allegory somehow. Well I was wrong.This movie is fantastic and a nearly perfect adaptation.The children were excellently directed and did not annoy me at all, which many child protagonists in film do.The little girl's expressions of wonder were actually believable.Edmund's treachery and the price he paid for it were right on, that kid that played him nailed some decent moments of complexity with the character.Peter and Susan were more shallow ,but those kids did them well, and I am sure we'll see more of both of those young actors as the grow. Aslan was a sight. The CGI made me think I was watching a real lion king.Neeson was totally perfect as his voice.Every time I've seen Liam in the last few years I've thought what a power he's become in acting, from silly crap in Next of Kin and Darkman to Rob Roy, Batman Begins, Kingdom of Heaven has been quite a career to watch.Now he has really nailed it for me, his voice giving the power and inflections that Aslan must have truly made the movie work.Only a few other actors could do the same and to have cast them would have almost seemed too cliché-ish,i.e James Earl Jones,Sean Connery. Now about Jadis.This woman that played her really gave her her own spin that as a whole did,in fact, work.The actress's stare alone was worthy of the white witch.In the BBC version the woman that played her over acted and was excellent in her attempts to cover her evil while trying to seduce Edmund.Well this Jadis was not over acted but was acted with a sinister style and a meanness that did give her over as the portrayal of evil to Aslan's good.Plus I liked her in her War Witch regalia. So In conclusion , well done Disney.This rivals LOTR in action and story if that what your looking for. Remember now, Tolkien's masterpiece was a thing in size and scope that is hard to comprehend, check out the Silmarillion for proof of this, he wrote Middle Earth's history from creation to LOTR, approx. 5000 years.Lewis work has no-where near the back story and history , I believe he meant to just get a out a good fantasy yarn with a Christ message.For deeper Lewis work read the Space Trilogy, the second book Perelandra could be made into a true horror film and it also is very Christian/Creationist based.Adam and Eve, Satan, and God are characters in this one.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is great viewing , see this now."

","This movie was awesome. I love the Chronicles of Narnia and this movie stayed very true to the book. I went to a private screening and this movie and it was awesome. All of the performances were awesome, especially Tilda Swinton, the White Witch. She deserves an Academy Award for her performance. Georgie Henley was an excellent choice for Lucy. She's an excellent actress for her age, especially in a film like this. The special effects and CGI were the best I have ever seen. I couldn't tell most of the time if it was CGI or a live actor or animal. The only problem I found was that Edmund was too bratty. I know that in the book, Edmund was spiteful when he was mad, but he just seemed too bratty. I give this move 9 out of 10 stars."
"kmarie-1","8","0","0","13 December 2005"," Great example of book adaptation
","I went into the movie excited, having read all the Chronicles of Narnia, but cautious, after being disappointed by some of the HP movies. Fortunately, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>For one, they stuck to their story. While I loved the LOTR movies and some of the improvements made, I felt the creative license was abused with some of the HP movies, so seeing how the filmmakers stayed true to C.S. Lewis was a relief. Some things need no improvement.<br/><br/>The first trip Lucy takes into Narnia is startling, awe inspiring and magical, recreating those feelings first felt while reading the book. I kept glancing at my children's faces to gauge their reactions, it was so cool! The four children were portrayed as I had imagined them, a hard feat to accomplish especially with such an established literary work, especially Lucy and Edmund. Edmund's character, which I believe to be the harder of the two could have been a little more fleshed out, a little more conveying of how he wasn't a mean or hateful brother, but just a kid looking for a way to be special in the ways he felt his brother and sisters were. His scenes of redemption seemed to lack the emotional weight I expected, but it's still a good portrayal.<br/><br/>The animal characters, which I feared would be cheesy, were excellent. The battle scenes were short of LOTR, but still intense and exciting. They definitely didn't sugarcoat the scary scenes with Aslan's death, the battle scenes or the stabbing of Edmund by the White Witch.<br/><br/>The visuals were impressive, the castles, the changing of the seasons, the scene at the stone tablet, all very vivid and enormous.<br/><br/>My favorite characters had to be Tumnus, the fawn and the White Witch. Superbly acted. Respectively, they both conveyed their characters as much with their body language and tone, not just relying on the dialog.<br/><br/>I was also pleased to see the scene, a brief break in the end credits where they set up more adventures with Lucy's scene with the Professor.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie, it exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to see it again. I think the second time around it will be much better for I'll allow myself to be swept up in the movie rather than analyzing it for defects."

","Being a student, I had plenty of time to see the new big film on it's day of release. Narnia was a bit of a mixed bag, in that the best opinion I had heard was ""Not Convincing"". Despite my best rose-tinted glasses, I could not get past the fact that the film never had the Wow factor of a modern epic, until the simply superb Battle scene and the impossibly stunning graphics of the fully CG animals, even if some where a little charicatured in the design. Charicatured, hollow and sporadically ropey are actually a very good criticisms of the whole film. There is never a sense of excitement, enchantment or scale in the movie. The acting is often wooden or very melodramatic, exasperated by a lack of any depth in the characters beyond the basics for telling the story. And, just to top it off, I think that the idea that it is a fantasy version of Crucifixion theory is over-hyped, with the scale of Aslan's sacrifice in saving the whole of Narnia withered by the fact that Neeson never gives off the power of Aslan, as if a few snarls and soothing comments will win our admiration, and, as the script picks up pace, focusing the role of Peter and the inevitable fall of the Ice Queen, seems to be still alive by some loophole in the possibly magical laws of Narnia. <br/><br/>In summation, Adamson fails where Jackson succeeded in not breaking down the most fascinating aspects of a beloved and heavyweight cultural tome to a story in it's own right in favour of retelling the best bits. An unnoticeable soundtrack adds to a hollow feeling of melodrama rather than the drama the ideas presented should deserve<br/><br/>Actual Good Points? Lucy (although not the other children) being neither annoying or wooden (difficult for most kids- Maybe a UK Dakota Fanning in the making), and Tilda Swinton, Ray Winston and James MacAvoy being beautifully otherwordly and intelligent in their acting, very much single-handedly making their scenes work , and of course the awesome Animals. I will watch all the inevitable sequels in the franchise, but will probably not need the DVD's."

","After having been to Warner cinema a few hours ago,i have to say that i think this is a really great,fun film. The plot: Peter,Susan,Edmund and Lucy are DE ported from London to the house of an eccentric professor in World War 2.One day when playing hide and seek,Lucy goes inside a wardrobe,and finds a strange,new world called Narnia.At first no one else believes her,but as they go into wardrobe,they change there minds.After finding out that animals can talk,and that there is a war going on between good and evil.They meet the leader of the force of god,a lion called Aslan (voiced by a great actor,who i will not give away plays him).The only thing some of them don't know is that one of them has betrayed them,and has joined forces with the evil White Queen,who wants to take over Narnia and kill Aslan. View on the film:<br/><br/>First for anyone wondering if any of the Christian images (two boys with the blood of Adam,two girls with the blood of Eve,a resurrection of someone who has died for our sins) ruin enjoy meant for the film.I have to say that i do not feel it hurts it at all.It mainly gives adults something to talk and think about after seeing the film(something most big films don't give you).The acting in the film is very good (with the White Which being a stand out).The voice acting in the film is really great (but why do some of the wolves sound American?). Anderson,for this being his non all-CGI film does a great job letting the story always stay as high as the FXs(by the great Lord Of The Rings Weta). Final view on the film: For anyone who wants to see the next Potter or Rings,you must see this.This is one of the best films i have seen this year."

","When this film was announced it was obvious that it would be compared to LOTR to no end. This review is not one to compare it to LOTR, because it is no Lord of the Rings. What is? In its own right, though, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is a fantastic film that should please both C.S. Lewis fans and fans of fantasy in general.<br/><br/>Let me start with the acting: WOW. I have never seen such an incredible cast of young actors. All of them are really amazing, especially the young boy who plays Edmond. His character is so complex, and it must have been really hard to develop. He did it flawlessly and really makes the transformation believable and dynamic. The little girl playing young Lucy also gives an incredibly wondrous and endearing performance. The other two actors are also astounding and pitch-perfect. I can honestly say that this is the best cast of kids ever assembled.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is a really cool and truly evil villain. She did incredibly at being both a seemingly kind yet cold-hearted (sorry) and fierce tyrant. Another perfect choice. Liam Neesan is fantastic as usual. What else can I say? The acting was perfect.<br/><br/>The story is handled very closely to that of the book and when it makes changes, they work. The opening scene is very focusing on the time-period in which they live, and the writers did a great job of filling in when C.S. Lewis would, for example, leave this to the readers' imagination.<br/><br/>Special effects on a whole was pretty well done. Tumnus' legs are pretty unbelievable, and the Beavers work amazingly well as living, breathing characters. However, I saw the credits listing several companies responsible, and sometimes it shows. There are a few moments when the effects look herky-jerky or cartoony, but overall they are pretty top-notch. Aslan, Tumnus, and the beavers alone make this film worth an effects nod at the Oscars, and the big-battle scene is pretty amazing to look at with the sheer multitude of creatures.<br/><br/>Now lets get to what you've all been waiting for: the battle. Yep, it's amazing. It was really great how they handled this. In the book, the battle is only described as it came to a close. The film stretches it out over 20 minutes, and every minute is spectacular.<br/><br/>I had a few gripes with the movie, though. I found the wolves to seem kind of out of place with their somewhat tough-guy accents. The score of the film is different and not half-bad, although some may not like its electronic blips and synth lines. It fits pretty well with the mood, though. Some won't like the part with Father Christmas, but it was in the book and HAS TO BE IN THE FILM! ""LWW"" is a great entry in the fantasy genre and one of the best films of the year. It's a movie that everyone can enjoy, and it will probably become a classic. Not only that, but it could possibly be the beginning of a promising new fantasy franchise."

","This was great. Jumping off the successes of The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the continuing Harry Potter series, it was inevitable that someone was going to get around to greenlighting C.S. Lewis' well-known collection of Narnia stories. It's fantastical tales of a magical land beset by the forces of evil and the struggles of the righteous have been popular reading for over 50 years; beloved by children and revered by Christian analysts for its parallels to another well-read collection of stories. I always wanted to read the books, buying nearly all of them at my grade school's annual book fair before the Pick-a-Path titles occupied my attention. I'm sure at that age I would have been as enraptured as the next child. My whimsy for childhood adventures still resides within and, admittedly, for a good portion of the film version I was along for the journey with eyes (mostly) open enjoying the exploits of Narnia the way most enact their hobbies  as passable time-killers. But the longer it went on, the less it satisfied my sense of wonder and eventually took on the more overt metaphors of one of my ongoing classes at Queen of the Rosary. Hint: It wasn't English or Reading."

","Andrew Adamson, who gave us animated gems such as Shrek and Shrek 2, directs his first movie involving real actors with mixed results. The first entry in C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is certainly a good movie to watch, but somehow lacks the magic of movies that stay with you after the film is over.<br/><br/>It's not easy to adapt a famous book, but in that aspect Adamson and his team of scriptwriters manage to stay faithful to the novel although still the story has suffered a few minor changes. The plot is simple, four siblings travel to a magical world using an old wardrobe, they will have to free the land of Narnia from the eternal winter that Jadis, the White Witch has sent.<br/><br/>The acting is good for the most part; experienced actress Tilda Swinton dwells more into mainstream movies and give her usual great performance as the White Witch, giving power to a character that is always diminished by the majestic Aslan, who clearly is the star. Liam Neeson does a good job as his voice, giving him dignity, but at the same time it focuses in the messianic side of the character.<br/><br/>This would not be a bad thing if it not were by the fact that Adamson focuses more in those aspects of the story, leaving poor development for the children and the adventure aspect of it. Too much time is given to how great Aslan is, that there is few time to explore that sense of adventure every kid has in it.<br/><br/>The movie takes itself too serious as an epic to a point that it almost forgets is aimed for the fun of younger audiences. It feels as if they were trying to make the story a new ""Lord of the Rings"" epic when the story doesn't go that way. Fortunately, this never gets too serious to become a problem and the movie still manages to be entertaining.<br/><br/>The film is not a masterpiece, but it can be entertaining for younger audiences. Do not believe the hype, it's not a perfect movie, just go to the theaters with an open mind, and don't expect any more than entertainment. 7/10"

"John K.-2","9","0","0","9 December 2005"," If you liked the first Harry Potter, you'll love this
","I read the Narnia books as a kid, and my imagination took flights of fancy that I would have loved to have seen on celluloid back then. Now I'm an adult and the technology has finally arrived. The various mythical creatures are brought to life spectacularly, the scenery is fantastic, there's some understated humour, and the final battle scene is a worthy successor to the Minas Tirith battle in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Indeed, this film both gains and loses by following LOTR. It gains because LOTR makes some of the mythical creatures in this film more believable. If you thought orcs, elves and hobbits were strange, wait till you see the magnificently rendered centaurs. But it loses some of its impact in the battle scenes because of its similarity to the LOTR battles ... though, in fairness, most mediaeval battles were pretty much like that, so it's hard to get much variation in.<br/><br/>As for the Harry Potter connection, the stars of the film are all kids -- except for the White Witch, played with commendable iciness by Tilda Swinton -- with the youngest child (Lucy Pevensie/Georgie Henley) likely to take home the most plaudits. Also, if this film has a weakness, it's that (like HP & the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone), it stays a bit too close to the book from which it was derived. Don't get me wrong, the book is an excellent, heroic story -- but it's a children's book, and some of the 'this happened and then that happened' moments stretched credibility for me as an adult. Oh, and one or two shots were a bit obviously greenscreened with the characters superimposed on backgrounds.<br/><br/>N.B. Much has been made of the Christian analogy in the story -- it's there, of course, but it isn't overplayed.<br/><br/>In short, if you can see it through a child's eyes, or if you haven't seen Lord of the Rings, this is a must see. If you have ... well, it won't seem quite the franchise monster that LOTR was, but it's worth the night out just for the technical effects on the creatures, and the rest of it is pretty good as well."

","I saw this film with my family: wife of 25 years, daughter (18) and son (15). We don't generally go out to the theatre as a group, but this was CS Lewis, so we made the exception. All were greatly pleased with the result. This is a wonderful film, wholesome and honest, childlike (rather than childish) and innocent, meant to edify and hearten the young of age as much as the young at heart. To me, this film helps support the contention that there is no need for filmmakers to shy away from this kind of family entertainment and that it can be done with rigor, skill and even artistic subtlety, just so long as the participants put their heart into the effort.<br/><br/>One wants to cheer everyone connected but let it be said that Tilda Swinton does especially well, bringing the White Witch to eerie and unsettling life. One is not surprised by the lengths to which the character will go but Ms. Swinton never reveals more about the character than she needs to and until she needs to.<br/><br/>Some have not been fully pleased by the special effects. I did not trouble myself about them, and found them quite satisfactory with rare exceptions.<br/><br/>See this film, please. You will be happier if you do, which is a nice state to be in this Christmas."

I liked the little girl as well! Those huge wet blue eyes could take you back when you were kid and remember all that wild imagination you had and you thought you were a hero in a dream land with knights witches wizards and animals which talk!

","I grew up on Narnia and have enjoyed The Chronicles as a child and as an adult. I was thrilled to hear they were making a full length feature film. On my way to the theater, I worried that the film would not meet my expectations because they were very high, partly because of the film's hype and partly because I wanted this beloved tale to be told better than any movie has told its tale.<br/><br/>From the moment the film began, I was captivated. The cast was brilliantly chosen and delivered the story beautifully. The cinematic flow was perfectly paced and held the attention of all my children (ages 5-13)through the end and then some. We can't stop talking about it. As much as we enjoy the Harry Potter movies, this movie seems to have more depth and less fear. The music was great, too.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages except perhaps those under 5; it is a story that will keep everyone interested and have them thinking long afterward about courage, honor, and sacrifice. I can't wait to see it again."
"suessis","10","0","0","11 December 2005"," A Dream Come True
","At the age of ten, I was given the first three books of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", and it began for me a life time love affair with the magical world CS Lewis. To me, Narnia was the perfect fantasy world, and I wanted to go there to escape the horrors of my childhood. It helped me get through some of the worst times in my life, and to this day if any one asks me what my favorite book is I will always answer, ""All of The Chronicles of Narnia"".<br/><br/>Today, I am 40 years old, and I have waited some people's lifetimes for the perfect film version of the book. I have found it in my recent viewing of Mr. Adamson's wonderful film. Everything that I ever imagined unfolded before me on the screen.<br/><br/>This book is a nearly faithful rendition of the beloved story with only minor deviations here and there. These deviations, however, make no difference to me in my enjoyment of this work.<br/><br/>The CGI special effects were astounding. The illusions of James McAvoy as a faun and Shane Rangi as a centaur are incredible. The totally GCI characters are truly impressive. If there is any fault here it is that, like Gollum in LOTR, they are almost too perfect.<br/><br/>The young actors who played the Pevensie children, while they may be strangers to filming in a CGI environment, I never once felt that they were not playing as they should to the CGI characters. They give wonderful performances, particularly Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. They are everything I imagined Edmund and Lucy to be.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is the perfect combination of ice and evil. The design of her castle is extraordinary. The costumes she wears are impressive. Her minions are perfectly ugly and evil.<br/><br/>The true spirit of CS Lewis' wonderful tale is here. While Lewis may have put Christian themes into this story the ones that he chose have universal appeal. The ideas of sacrifice, spiritual renewal or rebirth, and love of your fellow man are not the private privilege of Christianity. I consider myself an agnostic and have never considered this book to be Christian Propaganda. The film does not present the story that way either.<br/><br/>You can imagine then that I look forward to the filming by the team that produced this one to anymore volumes of the ""Chronicles"" that they choose to make."

","I'm not one for long reviews, so let me just say that this was a truly magical film that engaged the child in me that first fell in love with these stories. It was a VERY faithful adaptation that was true to the heart of the story, while actually adding more depth to the characters and their interactions than there was in the book. The seamless effects and perfectly cast children really whisked me away to Narnia and made me forget I was watching a film. The young lady who played Lucy in particular was a wonderful actor through whose eyes you couldn't help but view the events that unfolded. A must-see for your whole family (except possibly for very young children due to a few dark and disturbing scenes)."

","that's about as long as I lasted in this utter piece of crap. I can't imagine the cast and crew sat at the screening and thought job well done. It was as if the director thought he was doing LOTR cliff notes. The dialog was horrible and full of current references. About 30 minutes in I started looking around as I was in a not so full theater full of adults, wondering if I was the only one reeling from this assault to art sense, let alone common sense.<br/><br/>Technically it wasn't doing so bad, and there were a few good touches of the animals running and whatnot. There were a few cheesy CGI shots but honestly this was the least of this films problems. As others have mentioned above there was no reason to care about the characters, the actors themselves were struggling with a poor and tritely written script. It makes sense that the Christian Right is responsible for this mess, being as simplistic as they are."

Instead the chose Andrew Adamson, whose credibility is due largely in part to a lovable ogre, whose presence would have benefited this film greatly, and would not have surprised me at all. Narnia is one part shrek, one part harry potter, one part lord of the rings, one part new testament, and all parts unoriginal. Major disappointment. I wish I had more to say about how terrible it was, but I'll leave it at this - reading Narnia helped defined my childhood, and instead of adding to said definition of my early years, this film defiled many of the memories that I have. Horrible. Save yourself."
"thecrisis-1","1","4","12","26 May 2008"," This movie is complete garbage
","I just watched two controversial movies in the past week, one being The Chronicles of Narnia: lion/witch/wardrobe, and the other being The Golden Compass.<br/><br/>I'm sickened, shocked and horrified that moviegoers in the United States have rallied so firmly behind the former (Narnia) and against the latter (Compass).<br/><br/>Narnia is a shallow and predictable excuse for a movie, making no attempt to shroud its abusive and disgusting Christian imperialist message to the audience. It doesn't even attempt to get decent actors or a solid plot -- it just finds a Jesus/God character (the Lion, of course) and makes humans more important than all of the other animals, despite the shortcomings of the naive, lying and cheating humans. I understand the book was very short, but that doesn't make up for the gaping holes in the plot and complete lack of character development. The movie stutters from one scene to the next with no premonitions, no foreshadowing, nothing. Unless of course you know the story of the bible, but in that case you don't even need to watch this movie because all it does is chop up and regurgitate biblical tales to viewers in an attempt to further the Christian agenda. There is nothing new here, only some children and a bunch of animals who for some reason are willing to kill themselves to fulfill the prophecy of the return of the almighty humans.<br/><br/>The Golden Compass, on the other hand, was brilliantly dynamic, featured far better graphics and more diverse and unique characters and offered absolutely phenomenal acting. Daniel Craig was stern, Nicole Kidman was conniving and Dakota Blue Richards was gutsy, bold, unbelievably strong and tremendously courageous, to an extent that none of the children dreamed to achieve in Narnia. Simply put, Narnia was like a youth group adaptation of a biblical story in a church in the middle of rural Oklahoma and Compass was a stunning grade-A adaptation of the real history of the world by world-class actors.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows history can see the relevancy and importance of The Golden Compass. During the Dark Ages, organized religion WAS the Magesterium. They murdered and imprisoned people for speaking out against the church, they burned witches, they kidnapped children, they did almost everything that the Magesterium is accused of in Compass. This is a realistic and accurate portrayal of what has happened when religions and governments blend and imperialism and xenophobia take the front seat in foreign and domestic policy, today, eight hundred years ago or two thousand years ago. And it's the same thing that will happen in the future if we continue to escalate the war between Christianity and Islam.<br/><br/>The Magesterium also represents the attempt of *organized* religion to remove our souls from our bodies, which ironically are called ""daemons"" in the movie. This is a clear point that our inner demons, in real life, ARE our souls, as in that which makes us both good and bad is still what makes us. This movie is not a shot at faith and spirituality, but rather a shot at the blend of religion, power and government that so often convene when a church becomes involved in politics and thus gains power over society. We've seen this happen throughout history, so why people seem so shocked that Compass simply illustrates what has happened so frequently in the past 2-3000 years is truly beyond me.<br/><br/>Now look at Narnia. A delusional and unrealistic world where all you have to do is have ""faith"" in fairytale thoughts and everything ends up pretty in the end, with humans controlling everything and every other species of the earth obeying and abiding by the human agenda. To make the movie more marketable to children they make it so none of the good guys die in the end, they are only suspended by freezing them, there is no blood and while plenty of animals are killed and sacrificed, the children, who accomplish literally nothing throughout the entire film, are praised mindlessly by everyone.<br/><br/>Aside from the obvious fact that Compass had infinitely better actors and acting, better graphics and a much better plot, even the premise surpassed Narnia in historical accuracy, thoughtful foreshadowing of the future and its attempt to give a realistic impression of human nature when faced with an oppressive and all-powerful force.<br/><br/>Point being: Narnia is magical fairytale land, Compass is thoughtful, brilliant and historically accurate."
"noralee","9","3","8","17 December 2005"," Beautiful and Involving Adaptation of a Classic
","The visual success of ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is made possible by the innovations in special effects that were developed for ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While some of the settings and monsters seem a bit recycled from that epic, the magical creations of the novel are recreated believably and beautifully.<br/><br/>The opening of the story marvelously retains the setting of war time Britain during the blitz, complete with an Andrews Sisters song and war reports on the radio, setting the film in a reality where good was clearly fighting evil and evil was ruthlessly attacking civilians (just a bit of imagination is needed to jolt us to contemporary comparisons on either perceived side of several current struggles). While most of today's audience will not know about the evacuation of London's children to the safer countryside and their knowledge of train stations is probably from ""Harry Potter,"" the embarkation farewell is almost as much a tearjerker as Dumbo being separated from his mother.<br/><br/>Adding to the verisimilitude are the excellent child stars. Georgie Henley's ""Lucy Pevensie"" could be the granddaughter of ""Scout"" in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" for capturing wide-eyed innocence and curiosity without any cloying sweetness. William Moseley would get my pre-teen heart beating faster and he seems destined to play Jude Law's son, though without seeing him play with toy soldiers I wonder how ""Peter"" suddenly gains expertise in military strategy and tactics other than instinctively rising to the white man's burden. Anna Popplewell's ""Susan"" is not faint of heart as she combines femininity and tomboy action quite fetchingly. ""Skandar Keynes"" as ""Edmund"" well captures the temptation of sibling rivalry. Too bad they will too quickly age out for the sequels. <br/><br/>As twinkly as James McAvoy is as ""Mr. Tumnus"" the faun, Tilda Swinton is is so charismatic as the White Witch self-declared Queen of Narnia, that not only does she immediately get my vote in the MTV Movie Awards as Villain of the Year, even over Palpatine in ""Revenge of the Sith,"" but I thought she was more effective than bland, Liam Neeson-talking lion Aslan, even as she was very Saddam-like using informers, committing torture, imprisonment, habitat destruction and offering candy as bribery (good lesson here about not taking candy from pretty strangers, let alone tattling on your siblings). Too bad her costumes were a bit awkward, but her hair design was both regal and woman warrior.<br/><br/>Twenty years ago when I was first introduced to this book by reading it to my sons, I was completely oblivious to the Christian imagery, and could do so with this adaptation as well. Then as now I saw the gifts from Father Christmas as much a benign representation of the positive aspects of the Winter Solstice rather than eternal winter, as Christmas is at Hogwarts. Because the scene of Aslan's confrontation with the Witch is bloodless so as not to frighten children, it seemed more about emasculation to me than sacrifice, though having it take place in a Stonehenge setting seemed too specifically pagan (and that was constructed to celebrate summer any way). The battles are far less violent in clash and final results than in ""The Rings"" saga, which they otherwise imitate.<br/><br/>The talking animals are marvelously English, without any contemporarization or mugging that American animation inserts. Particularly fine are Ray Winstone as the voice of ""Mr. Beaver"" and Rupert Everett as the voice of ""Fox."" The wolves are quite the scariest things in the movie, as well as the exhilarating chase scenes, so much so that I don't know if the ""wolf trainer"" credit was literal or animatronic. A warning not to leave your seats immediately after the human participants are identified in the credits: the film continues to set up for the sequel. I didn't even recognize Jim Broadbent at first as ""The Professor,"" while the housekeepers' accent seemed a bit out of place. The centaur wasn't particularly memorable. <br/><br/>The closing songs by Alanis Morrissette and Tim Finn were lovely. The score was fairly pedestrian action-adventure, coming to life during the chase scenes and too bombastic during the battles.<br/><br/>The dozen or so special effects teams listed in the credits demonstrated the globalization of the movie business these days -- from New Zealand to Guatamala to the Czech Republic and Poland to ILM and Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The film is long, but the small children in the audience were only restless during the early set up scenes and were quite involved once the thrilling action started."

","This doesn't really contain spoilers, but in case it hints too much for someone I've marked it as so.<br/><br/>I just got back from a midnight showing....<br/><br/>Overall I'd have to say I was disappointed. I'll admit I've never heard of The Chronicles of Narnia until I saw a preview for it, as I now know the books have been out forever. The movie felt like they were trying to capture LOTR and Harry Potter all-in-one, and they just didn't pull it off. I felt no attachment to the characters, and so many of the characters seemed so hyped to turn out so meaningless. I also think the PG rating hurt the film a bit. I can understand wanting to reach a wider audience, and maybe thats how the author would have liked it, but it just didn't feel right to see someone jabbed with a sword only for it to come out as if it had just been polished; perfectly clean. Also I think it's pretty violent for a PG movie, even without the blood and details. So if you have young children, I'd possibly reconsider. I'd say at least 10 would be a proper age.<br/><br/>I guess my advice is that if you read and enjoyed the books, it may be worthwhile, but if you're just an avid moviegoer/fantasy film enthusiast pass on this, or at least wait until you can rent it. I dished out $8.25 for this flick and can I fell shorted.<br/><br/>*side note: I'm extremely tired as its now 3:30, the movie started 15 min late, plus 20 min of previews, so excuse any bad grammatical errors etc.*"

","I am a Christian, and I just wanted to say that I do agree that some people who claim to be Christians act very hypocritically sometimes.<br/><br/>It is really discouraging because as Christians, we are supposed to be consistent examples ( whether you take us seriously or not is beside the point; it's should just be our main goal )<br/><br/>There is controversy even among us Christians regarding The Lord of the Rings and now Narnia, but I would have to say ( without judgment or condemnation; I'm just voicing my honest thoughts and opinions ) that if anyone claims to be a Christian but does not feel uneasy about Harry Potter, there is something wrong.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to sound snobbish, but while those of you who are critical of us ""hypocrites"" lump The Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and Harry Potter together because they all contain ""magic"", there is a very distinct line separating Harry Potter from the other two.<br/><br/>I have not seen the Harry Potter movies, but watched part of ""The Chamber of Secrets"" for a while when it was on TV the other night. I'm sorry but there is something very evil there. I cannot explain the repulsion I felt in my soul... please bear with me.<br/><br/>The children are being taught to use witchcraft! And ( although I hear it is a little better in the newest movie ) it is treated rather lightly! The children don't seem to flinch at the presence of ghosts.<br/><br/>There are wizards in The Lord of the Rings, but ""magic"" is something which is treated with great care. There is no God in Middle Earth, so it seems that ( since some sort of ""Higher Power"" is needed to complete the story ) Tolkien chose to use ""magic"". Although some Christians are not in complete agreement as to whether or not this movie should have our approval, there is definitely not that evil feel to it.<br/><br/>I just read an article on the making of Narnia. C.S. Lewis said this when he wrote L,W & W: ""I said to myself, 'Let us suppose that there were a land like Narnia and that the Son of God, as he became a Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen'"". L,W & W is definitely more directly related to Christianity than LOTR, but, like Tolkien, Lewis used a different land and a different form of a ""Higher Power"" to represent the deep truths of Christianity. It's some- times more effective than trying to use today's world and the ""real God"" when trying to witness. You guys would probably just dismiss it immediately! :)<br/><br/>Thanks for listening."

The makers forgot some very simple lessons, firstly not to try and replicate the books. The film has to stand up on its own and be adapted accordingly. Many of the scenes could have been cut and would not have detracted from the overall understanding. Good things - the wolves, Aslan (excellent and believable)ummm...I'm thinking...OK I give up!

For those that have seen it, was there really much of a story at all? no .. straight up no. All the thought provoking visual dialog between the kids was cut out.

The visual juxtaposition between actors is incredible as well. Never have you seen professional actors try so so hard to drag a performance out of these empty shells calling themselves stars. Narnia sees the likes of James McAvoy, Tilda Swinton and even Liam Neeson battling valiantly to create a good film against poor cgi, an adequate score, a god-forsaken script and the worst performances given by children you have seen in your life. It is truly a terrible film and whilst your kids may enter the cinema shaking with glee rest assured they will exit shaking with sadness and confusion as to why Peter wore a crusaders outfit, why no one actually dies during war and how could someone have got such an easy formula so so wrong? Don't go and see Narnia, try medieval torture, you leave with the same effect.

Tolkien was right, when he told Lewis his book is not worth the paper it is printed on. And that's it!"
"jessica_hyatt55","1","8","34","10 December 2005"," Don't waste your money - not for young children!
","I went to see this movie, because I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I knew that the same special effects people who worked on LofR worked on Narnia. Although it was visually inspiring and the creatures and animals were well done, the actual story was boring and the violence was appalling, given that it's rated PG and for children. I don't know of any children who need to see epic battle scenes or animals (lion, wolf, fox) being killed, plus watching other children do the killing. When the movie began with the fear surrounding living in London during WWII, I sensed that it was going to be inappropriate for children. It was a very scary, violent movie - for a child. I think that the people who rate movies need to change the rules. It's pathetic. I could go on and on, but in summary, don't waste your money."

","I haven't written a spoiler - the entire movie is one big spoiler for anyone who respects the written words of CS (Jack) Lewis for the treasures they are, and who hopes that their child might learn a love of reading and develop their own imagination without being told what or how to think.<br/><br/>Problem one - Where is The Magician's Nephew? Without that before LW&W you are only getting Narnia Lite, despite what the theological purists say about the reading order.<br/><br/>Problem two - Jack Lewis wrote the stories to get children to think and imagine for themselves. Showing children what to imagine is like doing their homework for them, but on a much more soul-destroying and life-long scale.<br/><br/>Problem three - the voice-overs were chosen for pop-appeal rather than from serious quality actors. Comediennes and pop singers!!! A travesty wrapped in a farrago of misrepresentations.<br/><br/>Problem four - a wise person said that the Chronicles of Narnia should be read four times - as a child, as a young adult, in middle age and finally in old age, because the words of Jack Lewis will bring you a different kind of joy each time. <br/><br/>How can you do that with a movie? I can't think of a crueller thing to do to the memory and legacy of Jack Lewis or to your own children than to show them what and how to imagine rather than giving them the books and letting them imagine Narnia for themselves.<br/><br/>Except to show them the earlier 'muppet' version, but the crippling of the childhood imagination is the same unless they read the original words for themselves.<br/><br/>Truly great books were never meant to be recycled into celluloid, and this is one instance. Lewis wanted to teach children to think and imagine for themselves, and this film does neither and cripples both.<br/><br/>All in all, give your children the printed words of Lewis for the rest of their lives, not some flack's CGI imagination, editorial compromises and pop-culture voice-overs for a couple of hours of electronic babysitting.<br/><br/>This movie could debase the opportunity to imagine for one's self, for an entire generation of children who might have learned to love to read.<br/><br/>If you truly love your children, buy them the books and skip the fake film version - a cluster-bomb for a child's imagination and intellect."

","Well, Aslan is supposed to be the king of the universe of Narnia. In the book, He, is described to be big, almost as big as an elephant. Mayestic, wonderful, fear-inspiring. How many times did C.S. Lewis repeat: He is NOT a domesticated animal.<br/><br/>Aslan, in this movie, appears like a totally domesticated big-cat, a non-fear inspiring animal. When Aslan, the real Aslan roars, the whole cinema should shiver and try to cover their ears, for the voice of Aslan is the voice of the creation.<br/><br/>Now, leaving aside Aslan -what should be impossible- the movie is weak. Narnia seems to be a world inside a closet, not a universe biggest than ours that may be reached by some secret doors, one of which is a small closet. The battles are childish, the armors are feeble, the whole idea is lousy. Peter Jackson should have directed this movie, he has an open mind, and would be less concerned with making a movie for children."

The only character that resembled the book was Lucy, who was also the only good actor in the whole movie. All the rest were annoying and unrecognizable.<br/><br/>Thank god I only paid 95 cents to see this movie. I still want my 140 minutes back so I can read the book instead and actually enjoy myself.

","The movie is a LotR wannabe Take a classic story, then remove the majority of the dialog, the character development, and hype it up with a lot of slow motion battle scenes and well there it is. The battle scenes were brutal. To make it suitable for the 5- age category the centaur who was quite obviously killed to protect Peter (which i can't remember from the books but seems like a good idea) magically comes back to life in time for the coronation. Considering the MASSIVE budget some scenes like the battle scene or the obviously fake bombers at the beginning could have been done up and the scenery seriously needed an improvement. I have the BBC version on VHS and though that film is embarrassing the graphics are so bad it is a lot better story-wise. I loved the Narnia books when i was younger and the whole Christian symbolism etc. The movie ignores most of that and plunges right into action scenes to keep younger children amused while if this movie was made a bit more violent it would be 13+ and there would be more story.

","The movie improves on the book in several respects -- visually powerful (especially for Aslan, battles, and fauns), more focused and coherent, with the seeming factual nature of film bolstering credibility. Aside from those, the movie is a junk shop of what are presumed to be children's desires -- to be powerful, good, admired and magical. However, the movie is a wicked witch, offering a few short-term pleasures in an attempt to seduce the young. Let me mention as an illustration the main plot assumption: all good-hearted creatures are unified by the desire to put four bickering children on thrones as co-rulers of a non-human world. There is never a hint of why this fantasy might be an undesirable reality, because anything undesirable can be removed with a potion, prophecy or an attitude adjustment."

","I read lots of positive comments about this film but, as happened when I saw Donnie Darko, I do not agree with the other viewers.<br/><br/>First of all, the trailer was absolutely wrong because it pretended to be a sort of ""Lord Of The Rings"" production, but, watching the film, I realized that everything was represented in a childish way, much much much more than Harry Potter (and that doesn't pretend to be fantasy). The worst thing is that I didn't see any children at the theater maybe because of the ""I do not tell the truth"" trailer.<br/><br/>Here in Italy, the lion voice is really awful, irritating and difficult to understand clearly because they used Omar Sharif instead of a real Italian actor.<br/><br/>Some shots resemble too much the Lord Of The Rings, for example when the three brothers run away from the witch before meeting Santa Claus and they walk through the snow, just like the Fellowship of the Ring crossing the Misty Mountains. The only moments I liked were the battle and the lion killing the bad witch, but it was too ""politically correct"" because the good guys do not die and even frozen characters come to life again. I understand. Teenagers would have been disappointed by showing them a little bit of real life.<br/><br/>Maybe I would have enjoyed watching this film. If I was a teenager. But I'm 31 and I didn't."

","After having been treated for epics such as LOTR trilogy based on the creations of master Tolkien, I have expected producers of Chronicles of Narnia a much better depict of the tales created by another master of English Literature, C.S. Lewis. Although the film follows the works of C.S. Lewis, it seems effortless in the sense that actors are not up to the role they want to project with the children acting in an awful manner. CGI is also very poor and highly unrealistic and background and animations are of very poor quality, especially when compared to LOTR trilogy. I would have expected a film of much better quality and direction. Maybe that's because there is only one Peter Jackson unfortunately."
"danielececiliani","4","2","5","24 December 2005"," quite a disappointment
","This comment is meant for those who are mislead by the highly overrated score on IMDb and perhaps expect too much of this movie.<br/><br/>Having read a review that wasn't too enthusiastic about it, I went to see the film yesterday without any high expectations, by which I usually enjoy it more. Putting my brain at rest and eyes focused on pure enjoyment and entertainment, I was at least hoping that it could carry me away into this magic world of Narnia. However it didn't.<br/><br/>Regarding the history of the movie I couldn't help comparing it often with Lord of the Rings. Yet, everything that made LOTR so great, seemed to be lacking here, even if this story was probably meant for a much younger audience. The lack of tempo made it even boring at occasions. It took the children (or the movie) way too long to enter Narnia. Once there, the slow pace just went on, wasting time on silly and meaningless dialogs instead of explaining and revealing more of the history and background of this world. Santa??? The 4 children had to carry this film throughout the end but their wooden performances didn't succeed in this at any time. Not a bad word on the witch though, Tilda Swinton did a pretty good job. Together with Oreius they were the only two characters that stood above the ground.<br/><br/>About the credibility and predictability of the movie. There wasn't one moment where I thought something bad was about to happen, not the slightest sense of a threatening atmosphere at all. At a certain moment it even became funny or absurd (like telling such a bad joke you eventually have to laugh about it). I often call it 'Arnold Schwarzenegger'-humor. 'Are you with me' Peter asks Oreius. 'Till death' he answers. Sorry, but those lines just don't work if there's no bond or connection between the characters. We've seen them what, 5 or 10 seconds together? Enough said, I just don't agree with the general opinion about this movie and I usually do. Just to compare, this comes from sb who adored LOTR, enjoyed the 1st and liked the 3rd and 4th Harry Potter movies."
"plhartless","5","2","5","23 December 2005"," Mediocre
","I found the books very moving. I found the start of the movie promising. But the movie is paced very poorly: too much time is spent in setting up the children and the Narnia environment, and not nearly enough time is spent on the Aslan part of the story. I felt little investment in these characters; the pacing felt rushed and geared more toward chase and battle scenes than toward the material and scenes that should be so emotionally gripping. The big emotional scenes were far too rushed. And given that the movie has made the choice to go for the adventure aspect of things, the CGI effects were great...for 1982. <br/><br/>Inevitable comparisons will be made to Lord of the Rings. To some degree, these aren't quite fair: Tolkein's work is, from a literary standpoint, stronger. That aside, had Peter Jackson made this film, it would have been fantastic. And by that I don't only mean special effects (though there did seem to be a bunch of cast-off costumes from LotR): this director needs to learn about pacing.<br/><br/>On the good side, the faun, Mr Tumnus, is played very effectively, the children Lucy and Edmund are strong, and Tilda Swinton rocks as the White Witch--she's the best part of the movie, really. <br/><br/>Otherwise, it was rather disappointing. It wasn't awful. It just wasn't good. If you've read the books, as many on the forum have, you might be able to wring the emotion out of the film based on your memory of your reading. If you haven't read the books, this film will leave you wondering what all the fuss was about."

","I can't believe there are so many people who actually find this a good movie. I would give it a 1 out of 10, but since it's a child movie i give it a little cut. There are a lot of child (/disney) movies that i like very much, both animated and real. However this one was just plain terrible.<br/><br/>The worst is the children. They are casted to be SO cute but they just can't act and they irritate the crap out of me. If this was the only failure i would maybe see through it, however there is really nothing good about this movie.<br/><br/>The beginning takes far too long and could easily have been cut 15 minutes, it seems like the director wanted to make the movie last for like 3 hours, to match the common image of ""epic"" fantasy movies. The story is very very simple and predictable but i guess you can't blame the director for this. The computer generated scenes also just not cut it. Sure it looks nice, but it all seems a little too rushed. CG Animals are not real enough and backgrounds look plain and dull.<br/><br/>Laughable i found the part where a battle is just about to begin, and the sound fades completely like in Gladiator. There is even a matrix-like moment.<br/><br/>Oh one light could be the music, it was very beautiful from time to time.<br/><br/>To sum things up: completely unlikable, unrealistic, bad-at-acting main characters ,bad CG, bad story, good music<br/><br/>just a terrible movie, don't waste your time and money."

From the start the Peter, Susan and Lucy (though to give the girl some credit did well for someone of her age) ruined it through shoddy acting, they played their roles poorly. Edmund was the saving grace of the four main characters but not by much.

"katfish38","2","2","5","19 December 2005"," Zzzzzzzzzzzz...
","My summary accurately captures my sentiments for this film. I must admit that I was not a huge fan of the book either, but the movie felt rushed and off balance. I could've cared less if any of the characters lived or died. I found it very bland, boring and clichéd. This might actually be one area where the case could be made that the movie should have been longer to better develop the characters and build the relationships between them and Narnia's inhabitants. Their interaction with Aslan was flat and emotionless. The only shining aspect of the film was the part of Lucy Pevensie, played by Georgie Henley. She was absolutely precious throughout the film."
"la-cochonerie","4","2","5","14 December 2005"," Did I see the same movie as everyone else?
","Considering all the glowing reviews on this site, I'm beginning to wonder if I saw the same movie as everyone else. IMO, this movie was just bad. I am disappointed, but in a way not surprised, because I remember reading this book when I was younger and really enjoying it-- not surprised because the previews looked bad as well.<br/><br/>I'm going to say first off that the whole x-tian allegory thing didn't bother me in the slightest. Although I'm not x-tian per se, I do enjoy reading the bible on my free time and have no problem discussing x-tian issues with other people; in fact, I love doing so. That said, this movie was just too blatant. In fact, it was laughable. I recall the book being a lot subtler than the movie, and I get the impression that they made the movie this way intentionally (to attract the lucrative x-tian market). And what an allegory! If Aslan is supposed to be Jesus, what on earth was he doing fighting in a war and killing people? Wasn't Jesus the one who said, ""turn the other cheek?"" And Aslan's sacrifice wasn't exactly pure to say the least. It had a lot more to do with fulfilling the prophecy (ie, making the four humans survive) than actual charity. One wonders if he would have bothered had it been anybody else (probably not, since he was killing characters left, right and center in the movie). There are more.. but I won't bother. Needless to say, Santa handing out lethal weapons to children had me laughing out loud (much like the rest of the movie).<br/><br/>But terrible allegories aside (these are forgivable, and I'm sure justifiable, since almost anything is justifiable in religion), this movie was bad on many technical levels as well: 1) The acting was wooden. Lucy in particular was just terrible. The only bright spot, in terms of acting, was the Witch. She was actually quite convincing (minus her horrible wardrobe).<br/><br/>2.) The CGs were awful. The movie honestly felt like it was made in 1997 and not 2005. The green screens were poor (I'm being kind here). The cg characters were badly made (wooden) and lacked any kind of life. It's pretty bad when in almost every scene you think to yourself, ""wow that looks pretty fake."" And the wolves were particularly bad because they kept switching between real dogs and fake wolves. It was quite distracting ""oh, real dogs again.. nope fake ones now"". The one scene I was impressed by was the one where the two girls are walking with Aslan in the Forest. That was well made (although, my memory might be playing tricks on me).<br/><br/>3.) Many of characters came across as creepy.. but not in that acceptable kind of creepy, but in a pedophilic kind of way. Honestly, when Lucy meets Mr. Tumnus, I was really expecting him to jump on her (although, I knew he wasn't). The same can be said about the Witch, although to a lesser degree, in her first scene.<br/><br/>Had it not been for these problems, the movie might have been great (the story is actually pretty interesting).. but bad and sometimes creepy acting, bad effects, and blatantly exaggerated allegories (that are bad too), wreck this movie and make it terrible in that ""showgirls"" kind of way (although, I think showgirls was intentionally made as an ironic comedy). In fact, my friend and I were laughing so hard during this movie, that one person sitting next to us actually moved.<br/><br/>I mean come on, how can you not laugh at a movie that has Santa giving a bunch of kids totally lethal weapons, and tries to do so with a straight face?"

So putting stuff like that in a movie is a bad idea because not everybody could see it because of their religion. So over all i didn't like it at all it was Very confusing you couldn't really follow the plot. I saw it with 3 of my other friends and we are all 13 and 14 years old and we could hardly follow it.

I then found out that The Chorincles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe would be coming out at Christmas, and being a fan of the book when i was younger i was intrigued by this multi-million pound blockbuster. Although i wanted to see it i was not all that excited about it. Over 2 hours later i walked out of the cinema blown away. The effects are outstanding, and the decision to have 4 unknown British actors play Lucy, Edmond, Susan and Peter Pevensie was a excellent idea.

","The special effects have been discussed at length by reviewers and viewers posting their opinions on this site, and they were certainly impressive.<br/><br/>Where I think this movie fails miserably is its character development. I've read the books, and know what care Lewis put into developing his characters personalities so that we can understand them.. but this movie doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. One minute, the kids are saying ""we should really get out of Narnia"", and then a minute later, ""lets fight in the war and die for Narnia"". The moral dilemma that Edmund faces is almost completely glossed over, and the viewer is left with only close-up reaction shots of the kids to substitute for actual exposition and character development.<br/><br/>I was also shocked at how they beat you over the head with the Christian message of the story. I know Lewis intended to copy the story of Christ, but I didn't expect the movie to attack so directly any characters that opposed the view of the ""christian path"".<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that its worth seeing for the special effects and it's certainly entertaining. But as a movie that I'm expected to feel anything for beyond mindless entertainment, it fails, as I was unable to connect with any of the characters whom I felt were very relatable in the book."
"JumeirahSun","8","2","5","11 December 2005"," An excellent children's movie--thank God they are believably English.
","I went into this movie not wanting to like it. I know the Narnia canon from front to back and, after seeing some disappointing changes made for The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, I didn't want my vision of Narnia to be tainted. But the reviews for this film were so strong that I gave in and paid my six dollars to see it. And it was excellent. For once the filmmakers (writers, really) have not taken license with the story but have instead just pared it down a little to make it fit into a timeframe. It was the CGI stuff that put me off in the previews but it didn't look too bad. I mean, occasionally it made me cringe (the fox) but on the whole it was not terribly distracting. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton, as the witch, steals this movie. She is not a typical Disney villain--she is a bad-ass, and while watching I remembered that, after all, she is Jadis, the warrior goddess from another world, and it seems that the writers remembered that, too. The characters in this film have older memories of Narnia: memories that go beyond the Pevensies' experience. There are enough pointed looks and loaded answers to make sure that we, the audience, are aware of their significance. The costumes and makeup in this movie are outstanding--better than Lord of the Rings, I think. The only thing I found slightly amiss was that, as per Pauline Baynes's illustrations, I had always envisioned the witch as a brunette, but she looks so totally cool otherwise that I am not complaining."

ABout the Christianity in the film, the book IS based on Christian beliefs, but thats just how the movie is. But overall, its not as if the whole movie was just trying to sell Christianity or put down other religions. So, If you want to see something I really do recommend this, Its never really boring, and its very touching, it also has great music that just flows right along with the scenes. Not to mention that the whole film is absolutely stunning.

"Amy_cosmicchic86","10","2","5","11 December 2005"," A gorgeous treat for everyone!
","MILD SPOILERS AHEAD! It's as simple as this: young or old, see this film! The scenery, direction, actors, and, of course, the story are wonderful. The purity of the original book is upheld and the one or two added bits, such as the Blitz scene at the very beginning of the film, work extremely well. The child actors are all decent enough, all of them able to carry their scenes and successfully convey the courage and heartbreak of their characters. Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes as Emdmund and Lucy are particularly convincing and when Lucy weeps for her fallen friends it melted even my cold cynical heart - so don't worry. As for the adult thespians, Tilda Swinton is positively glacial as the White Witch, James McAvoy is perfect as the sweet, tortured Mr Tumnus - and his chemistry with Henley is excellent - and Jim Broadbent makes good use of his limited screen time as the Professor. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan settles comfortably into his familiar role of kind mentor. New Zealand is apparently THE place to film one's fantasy epic these days and indeed, it's advantages are made very clear in this film. 'Narnia' (as most people are probably referring to it as) will thrill and it will delight and it should warm the hearts of everyone but the most bitter cynics. I went to see this film with eight friends of varying dispositions, some of whom adore the book and some of whom have never read it before and we all enjoyed it very much. Seeing a book so beloved by the nation brought to life on cinema is very satisfying and with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings et al, it is becoming a regular occurrence. Let's make the most of this new so-called Age of the Fantasy Film and be thankful that we got to be here for its time on the big screen. <br/><br/>So, come on, indulge your children and your inner child and buy some hot chocolate and some Turkish delight and get down to the cinema now!"
"fandeloso","5","2","5","11 December 2005"," Sad - both reviews and the movie
","I don't know what's worse - the disappointment I felt after seeing the film, or some of the pathetic comments about its religious nature. I grew up a fan of Lewis and, having read his Narnia and other fiction (and non-fiction) books, I have to say the film is a huge let-down. No doubt, Peter Jackson should have done it. Unlike the books, it's just plain hollow. It's rushed and lacks the epic nature of the books. It should have been on par with LOTR, but comes nowhere close. What's worse are the scenes which are obviously trying to reach that level and which so blatantly fail.<br/><br/>As far as its religious nature, some of the reviewers here don't seem to realize that Lewis was a Christian who wrote - among other things - allegorical tales. This wasn't an alternative to Harry Potter, as some seem to think. It was an adaptation of some of the most loved and widely-read children's books in history.<br/><br/>If you don't understand why this had religious overtones, read the books. If you thought this movie would have made Lewis proud, read the books. If you want a great story in which you can get absorbed, read the books."

","Some of the costumes in this movie were unforgivable, they looked like they were taken directly from the Xena Warrior Princess set. Seriously. I don't understand how the director allowed it to happen. The CGI was excellent, but I felt like the director couldn't make up his mind on which direction to go with the overall feel of the film. The casting was off as well, the children started to really irritate me with all their whining and crying, but again, that should get thrown on the director and not the actors. And I don't understand why the centaurs needed so much makeup. It didn't look good and didn't make a lot of sense since centaurs are half human/half horse, and not human/horse/elf ears. The whole thing felt very disjointed to me. There were just a lot of simple things that could've made this movie the classic that it deserved to be."
"egorho","5","2","5","9 December 2005"," Over-hyped! Just Okay!
","Okay I admit, I took the bait due to all the coverage and church screenings of this movie and bought advance tickets for myself and my 12 year old son. He read the book and really didn't want to see it but I STILL got tickets. I should have listened to my son. I don't know why the Christian and church groups are really pumping this movie up. I don't get it. At any rate, here is my 2 cents worth.<br/><br/>First, this movie is really, really over-hyped. The clips shown make the movie appear more than it really is. I don't want to tell you any story lines but I will say this, see it at a matinée performance if you just have to see it and can't wait for HBO. But I will say this, the special effects and the animal characters are extraordinarily done. This movie should be a shoe in to receive an award for special effects. That was the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Second, they hype this movie as being better than Harry Potter which I promptly paid to see for a second time after watching Narnia. There really is no comparison. Potter is far better movie and I haven't read that book either. Without having read Narnia, the plot was ALL TO PREDICTABLE from the very beginning. There really wasn't that much suspense involved. More than once I whispered to my son what was going to happen next and was right.<br/><br/>Last, I just wanted to say that it seems like there is going to be a tread to Potter like movies and if Narnia is indication of what is to come, then the Potter movies don't have a thing to worry about. Try to duplicate they might, but with Narnia it seems like all they did is a bad imitation. Go if you must, but don't expect very much."

","I was expecting a lot more from ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" because it is a great story and there has been a lot of hype about this picture. Unfortunately I felt after seeing it that there were parts of it that just didn't seem to be as quality as I hoped. For example, Mr Tumnus is not shown in full-body and close-up, it is always a legs shot or a face/upper torso shot, or shot from far away, so we can't really get a feel for how faun-like he really looks. Another example is where large backgrounds look a bit fake like a matte painting. I felt that the beavers were a bit over the top with comedy.<br/><br/>On the plus side though the voice acting of Aslan was wonderful, and the children were adorable. The story is well told."

","I have read all the Narnia books. I never liked them. When I saw the trailer, I had my suspicions -- and went to see the movie anyway, thinking ""they might have turned bad fantasy into good fantasy."" No such luck.<br/><br/>Visuals and performance: The acting is shallow throughout, with the exception of Tilda Swinton, who is the only one deserving of any stars here. There are so many talented, brilliant child actors in Britain; why did they choose what can only be the worst of the selection? The effects are ridiculously bad; only a third-rate computer game should get away with such a disaster without attracting much criticism. In the rare moments where you manage to get caught up in the set, a horrible CGI sequence will throw you off again. Speaking of the set: When I read ""ILM"" in the credits, I gasped with disbelief. Is there an ILM temp brigade, or something? <br/><br/>Content: Everything bad about the books was amplified, and where you could have overlooked it in the books, you can't escape it in the movie: the kids go from being victims of war to participating in a war themselves (even the visual parallel between air raid and air attacks in the battle is unmistakable); independent thought and criticism, especially from girls, is undesirable (anything Susan says, no matter how sensible, is met with ridicule); mercy is almost entirely unheard-of (whose head would Jesus bite off?). Finally, there is ONE extremely if involuntarily funny scene; in fact, most of the audience in the theatre where I saw the film started laughing -- the resurrected Aslan, back-lit in a kitschy stone arch, complete with flowing mane and all, is a lion equivalent of a blonde, blue-eyed Jesus painted on black velvet. The sappiness is so overwhelming it becomes ridiculous. In short, Tilda Swinton's performance is the only thing worth seeing, but even that is not enough to redeem the movie as a whole."

I could almost see through them! The writing was nearly word for word from the book. I'm not kidding. It shows that the writer cannot think for himself and therefore must copy words from the original source. The movie has no flow, and I don't think that it is any coincidence that the 'good guys' colours are the same of Rohan in Lord of the Rings.

This film gives us an impression how this is solved in these days: almost perfect I would say and I am that convinced now, because they showed us in very broad details, how good they are in doing so. Maybe they forgot to look at whats needed in addition to make up a convincing movie. Maybe the Lord of the Ring has ""ruined"" the scene of this kind of movies by being too perfect. OK, they tried to copy several elements, but constantly they succeeded in destroying their well done computer tricks by lots of nasty looking blue-box scenes. Few moments have some kind of ""romantic touch"". Additionally most of the real actors seem not to love their job. Sometimes I got the feeling that they are just clumsy reading some lines from a teleprompter while their animated counterparts are always more talented. From my point of view this film is absolutely childish and a waste of time for grown ups. Maybe my little kids like it - no blood at all and its black'n'white all over. No follow-ups please."

I'm guessing Disney's idea with this film is to compete with Harry Potter or with LOTR, I think they are failing miserably. If they are lucky enough they might recover the 150M they spend in this film, I just hope they don't decide to make the next books into films. As an investing tip, sell all your Disney stock or hope that Pixar's Cars will be as good as all the other Pixar films, if not, you are better off flushing your money down the toilet. Whatever happened to good screenplay writers in Disney? People wonder why the box office slump, well, it is easy, big studios spend 150M creating movies like Narnia.

Lucy is the only good thing about this movie, without her I would've not even bothered to set through it.<br/><br/>Imo, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe could have been a great film but it seems that the director was more interested in presenting a coherent biblical account than exciting film making. this film is boring not because of its religious context, it's simply a victim of bad direction acting and a bland script.<br/><br/>The CGI is decent, but it does not give the movie an epic feel even the major battle is badly choreographed and the action is repetitive and boring.

The climactic battle between the armies of the White Witch and those of Aslan clash on Pelinore Field, the mountain in the background missing the white towers of Minas Tirinth. yes, the animals are wonderfully conceived CGI, the centaurs weren't all that great, and the head centaur was downright ugly. <br/><br/>I love Turkish delight! My father used to buy it at the local foreign grocery in Miami when I was a kid. I wouldn't be tempted by a witch producing a whole plate of the stuff.. too sweet.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton was the only saving grace of this pedantic, lumbering and altogether molasses-like movie. She captured the essence of the White Witch. The Einsteinian time travel stuff is a nice touch but I ask you this.. what happened to the whole kingdom when all four of the heads of state suddenly vanish one fine afternoon? Also, Jim Broadbent (Topsy Turvy) was underused.<br/><br/>Now, as to the Christian bent, it was painfully obvious. At one point, Aslan says ""It is finished"", a direct reference to the last words of Christ on the cross. I was less offended by the obvious references to the Gospel than by the vain attempts to conceal and camouflage the other dogma(too numerous to mention here, and frankly I don't want to go into it)<br/><br/>I am sure this film and its progeny will please the same crowd that paid tribute to Caesar to see The Passion of the Christ, but those of us who saw the penultimate good v. evil story brought to the screen (Lord of the Rings et al) will probably not be among the future ticket buyers."

You just don't want the kids to win the stupid battle because the characters are flat and boring. The exceptions are Lucy, the White Witch and many of the non-lead characters.

","Pretty good movie...very faithful to the book with a few minor exceptions. I'm a little worried about how the digital effects will look 5 years down the road...as I am with all movies to rely heavily on digital effects. I was very impressed with the child actors who don't have a lot of experience in other films or TV shows. As I was watching the film I could easily see how a child place himself right into the Narnia universe while playing at home...and how easily I could have if this movie came out when I was the target age. The movie does stand alone without sequels, much like the original Star Wars did. However, just like Star Wars, sequels are inevitably going to happen. Maybe even a prequel. Who knows?"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","2","6","20 April 2006"," Even though the movie does have its flaws, it's still close to being perfect beautiful imaginative entertainment.
","Quite honestly the movie surpassed my expectations. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought that the movie was sure to become a dreadful failure. It looked cheap, had unconvincing special effects, had a cheesy bad name and looked like nothing more than a light-version of the Lord of the Rings movies. But no, the movie turned out to be surprisingly good and entertaining. It's a beautiful looking- imaginative movie, that despite its flaws is still a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The movie has an absolutely wonderful imaginative story and is almost entirely set in an imaginary world, that visual looks really good. The imaginative story provides the movie with a certain charm and magical feeling. Also the costumes and special effects add to this feeling and charm.<br/><br/>Its a children's movie and its a real good one. So it might not be as heavy and spectacular to watch as other fantasy movies but it's still just as entertaining and imaginative. For children for who The Lord of the Rings trilogy is still to heavy, violent, dark and perhaps to serious this is the ultimate perfect alternative. But this movie is more than just a light-little-version of the The Lord of the Rings movie. This movie is good and strong enough on its own, even despite the fact that it was obviously inspired and made in the same style as the The Lord of the Rings movies. <br/><br/>The movie has some really good moments in it that are highly imaginatively and very beautiful to watch. Some of the action is impressive and also the climatic spectacular end battle does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Donald McAlpine is great and so are the sets and costumes but truly spectacular is the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams, that really uplifts the movie at certain moments. He really is on the way of becoming one of my favorite movie composers.<br/><br/>The cast is really good. The children cast is impressively good and all of them are highly convincing in their roles, even though their character might not be. Also the presence of Tilda Swinton as the villainous White Witch is a real big plus for the movie. She plays her role extremely well; villainous and evil but not too scary for the kids. Most of the other actors and voice-actors are also good but their role is too small to really leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>But as strange as it might sound, the movie is also heavily flawed in multiple ways. The storytelling and pace are really lacking at times. Some characters just pop-up out of nowhere without getting a proper character introduction. Also in the next following sequences the characters are not developed and are lacking in depth. Because of this, it's hard to care sometimes about certain characters. At some points the movie also feels extremely rushed, such as for instance the ending. The movie doesn't always take enough time to build up its story and the emotions and characters in it. It all makes it too obvious that Andrew Adamson is still a beginning director that still has certain things to learn, especially about storytelling.<br/><br/>Also the whole, moralistic story with family values and Christian undertone doesn't do much good to the story and storytelling. It's not as overly present as expected but it still works distracting at certain points in the movie and perhaps even makes it a bit too ridicules to watch at times. But overall I must admit that it was quite toned down in the movie, so it's not really a big issue. At least not to me it wasn't.<br/><br/>The special effects are really a mixed bag. Some of the effects are amazingly good looking and some others are highly unconvincing. Multiple different special effect studios worked on this movie, so that explains the diversity in quality. The Oscar nomination certainly was too much credit for this movie, especially when considering that the effects for ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" were not nominated at all. So basically that's saying that the effects for this movie were better than ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith""? Sorry, I don't think so...<br/><br/>Still I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, and still give this movie a high rating, due to its entertainment value. None of the weaker spots and flaws of the movie prevent this movie from being spectacular and beautiful looking adventure/fantasy movie. I'm now really looking forward to the other movies, from the book-series written by C.S. Lewis.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I loved these books when I was a kid, an I was really looking forward to this film. Sadly, however, there's a workmanlike quality about this film - the acting is fine, the locations attractive, the CGI effects ranging from the fairly ordinary (the beavers) to the very good (Aslan). It's all very ""worthy"" - it seems everyone is aware they're making the film of a classic novel, and the result is strangely lifeless and unmoving. It's very similar to the series of filmed Shakespeare the BBC produced in the '70s - it's a straightforward version to show in classrooms, with not a hint of originality or any particular vision. For a fantasy film the art-department is depressingly literal, with the entire film grounded in a leaden visual style that never grips the heart in the style of - say - early Gilliam.<br/><br/>The pacing and plotting are slow and cumbersome, but this stems from slavishly following the book. Possibly the episodic structure of the book is only really suitable for television. This film may be suitable for less-excitable children, but adults should give it a wide berth."

","Look. I am going to keep this short and sour. I was hugely disappointed.<br/><br/>I was also read the books as a child and continued to love the C S Lewis series throughout my life as an adult. <br/><br/>Why with all this focus on 'Big Budget' - which seems to be more and more the basis on which 'blockbuster' films market themselves - do we lose so much of the original novel material, our favourite parts, which mean so much to us?. These films lose their sentimentality (Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket) and we are rushed through a 2 1/2 hour production with no substance and little heart, Seeing this novel brought to life on the screen could have been brilliant. Instead I am left with a bitter taste of disappointment and regret that I forked out $14 to go see it on it's opening day.<br/><br/>The worst thing was, I wasn't expecting much (as I wasn't with Goblet of Fire) and walking out of the cinema, I couldn't think of one thing other than 'well, they did great animation work with Aslan'.<br/><br/>BAH!"

I expected to be enlightened by the Christian philosophy of C.S. Lewis. I left the movie thoroughly underwhelmed, and half expecting to see Aslan edition Coca Cola can. To be honest, I just didn't see the big deal. Whereas some will say that this movie is an epic tale of redemption, bravery, and fantasy I didn't see most of it. There are children acting childish and learning how to take responsibility for their decisions, but that's about it.<br/><br/>The visual effects were very, very good. Kudos to the production team for making realistic looking Fawns, other magical creatures, and a phenomenal Aslan. When they weren't overacting the child actors too did a bang up job on screen too. However they were unfortunately burdened by one dimensional roles and oftentimes came across as whiny and bratty on screen. The actress playing the White Witch was simply excellent, came across as quite sinister, and convincing. <br/><br/>In sum, entertaining yet highly annoying at times. The cinematography and score are purely by the numbers, and probably borrowed from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This would be an excellent movie on DVD or network television, but not an evening on the town."

The movie did not improve from there.<br/><br/>Maybe I no longer fit the demographic for this movie but quite honestly, I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. That coming from a guy who sat spellbound by The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and then bought the even LONGER extended DVD for each movie.

Lewis to be fascinating and had quite high expectations for the movie.<br/><br/>The beginning of the story starts out quite boring (even in the book), but picks up pace quickly. The movie really doesn't start to get entertaining until about 30 minutes in. But once it did, I really enjoyed the film. Besides the numerous errors, the film actually did not leave me disappointed, especially after watching the incredible battle at the end of the film. The battle was so incredibly well done that the only film it could possibly even be compared to, was The Lord of the Rings. Splendid visual effects and terrific animation fill the audience with wonder and excitement.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson also kept quite close to the book, which made me extremely grateful after seeing so many wonderful books be torn to shreds by directors trying to make a work of art. Condensed on time, Adamson of course, had to leave a few bits and pieces out but still creates the first of what I hope to be many wonderful movies.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this epic ""war"" movie was rated PG even with one of the most incredible battle scenes of all time. I found at no times was there any inappropriate humor or excessive violence, helping create the ideal ""family film"", while still creating a superb film. The audience gave it a standing ovation both times that I saw it on the opening night in a two different sold out theaters. Overall, The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe succeeds in the adaptation of a classic masterpiece for all ages and still beholds the massive amount of allusions and symbolism that was held in the book.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."

","OK, this review is going to be based on a Christian perspective, so if you don't like what I'm saying, I do apologize in advance if I offend you.<br/><br/>OK, a witch, magic potion, spells that can cause long winters and turn beings into stone, mythical creatures such as satyrs, minotaurs, centaurs, griffins and the like along with a boatload of talking animals. What could possibly separate this from such occult movies like Harry Potter? One word, Aslan.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in the 1940's, with the bombings over London happening. To escape these, four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy have been sent to the England countryside. while there, they enter a wardrobe that magically seems to disappear the farther in you go into a wooded area in a world called Narnia. A world ruled by a cruel White Witch who has cast a spell that causes Narnia to be in winter forever, but never Christmas. Lucy, the youngest, was told early in the story of a White witch who ruled like she was queen, and of the spell that caused a hundred year winter and no Christmas. Edmund meets the White Witch, and unwittingly betrays his brother and sisters to her. a Beaver family explains to the rest of them that the Witch is afraid of a prophecy that says that four human children, two boys and two girls will take the throne and defeat the White Witch. They must now seek help from the one creature in all of Narnia that could possibly help them against such evil. Aslan, lord of the wood and the king of beasts.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful adaptation from C.S. Lewis' classic book. Whether you like it or not, it is a Christian movie. C.S. Lewis didn't make a direct allegory, but made a supposition in the person of Aslan. What if there was a world where mythical creatures lived and talking animals existed? And what if God sent his son there in the form of a lion? Aslan is the animal representation of Jesus. And he is what makes this movie such an excellent piece of cinematography. And there is a battle, a dynamic battle between good and evil. The White Witch is perfectly portrayed, an almost beautiful, but cold evil that wishes to rule and destroy.<br/><br/>The casting is perfect, and the effects are phenomenal. Nothing is really lost from the book that went into this movie. It even adds some characterization that adds very nicely to the movie. The battle scenes are epic and the most wonderful moment, morning at the Stone Table, is magnificent. I recommend this movie just as much as I recommend the Lord of the Rings. They are both wonderful fantasy stories that you can draw many Christian ideals from (or even just good morals if you want). There's more that I would love to say, but I think I've held you long enough. My final words, this is a wonderful movie that I think everyone should see."

A hit at the box office it may be but that doesn't go far enough to securing it as a classic. Far from it, this is on a par with Independence Day.

","The lion Aslan dominates your attention in every scene he appears in, and as the story unfolds, he becomes as human-like as any of the four children. <br/><br/>The four children seem normal enough with their constant teasing and fighting among themselves, but when events truly matter, they come together and exemplify the highest standards of sacrifice, courage, fidelity and heroism. Both children and adults will find inspiration and role models in these four children. <br/><br/>The lion Aslan is a mystical and almost biblical hero. There are many parallels between Aslan and Christianity, and you can watch this film anywhere in the religious-secular spectrum you care to. I suspect that over many years the other six books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia will be made into movies and they will have the same type of financial and artistic success as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy had. That is high praise indeed.<br/><br/>FYI â€“ There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."

"djansen24","5","1","2","1 July 2013"," Charm of the novel lost in a wash of special effects
","The 2005 version of this classic children's novel is a very competently made film. It for the most part seamlessly blends special effects, CGI, and live action together. The acting is competent. It follows the book with few exceptions. Why only a 5 star rating? It takes itself way too seriously. C.S. lewis' novels were so enchanting because it was all about tone first with story a close second. In the film, while the plot is followed, the charm was lost. The characters were stiff and serious. I did not feel the excitement of children exploring a new world. I did not feel reverence and awe in the presence of Aslan. What I remember mostly from the film was the last battle which was extended and shown in great detail. In the book, the battle is given only a couple of paragraphs. But since this is Hollywood, they felt the need to extend it and ramp up the violence. In many ways, I felt I was watching an action film for adults marketed to children. The only scenes that came close to enchantment were with the beavers. But that didn't help the serious tone of the film to lighten up. This is one of those films where less would have been more, slower have been more exciting, and character more entrancing than action. What surprised me the most was how the fabulous Tilda Swinton came off so unconvincing as the White Witch! I still have yet to see that character portrayed convincingly. <br/><br/>Basic advice, if you want a ""good looking"" film with action and special effects, then you will like this film version of the novel. But if you are willing to forgo the superficial pleasures and enjoy the tone of the novel (the most distinguishing aspect of the Lewis' book), then check out the 1988 BBC television version. It production value is very crude by today's standards, but it captures the magic of the book better and lets the story unfold naturally."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","2","20 May 2013"," Solid mythic adventure film, but all too often striking us as having been made with one's head more-so one's heart.
","Films of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe's ilk were a dime-a-dozen at around the time of its release. Unleashed upon us once the Lord of the Rings films had had their fill of our cinema screens; somewhere in the middle ground of the Harry Potter Franchise and then preceding projects such as The Spiderwick Chronicles, one can only muster up as much enthusiasm as one can when offered yet another magical, mythical adventure fraught with danger and wonder but driven by kids. The project in this case is a film based on the immortal books by C.S. Lewis; an English author who wrote about the trials and tribulations encountered in a magical land named Narnia, to which the entrance was of course granted at the back of the most famous wardrobe in literary history. One could argue Lewis was ahead of the game in this regard; writing which was released around the time of Tolkien's fictitious escapades in Middle Earth as youngsters ill-suited to their dramatic, danger-filled surroundings took on the elements. It is sad, then, that Andrew Adamson's adaptation of the first in the Narnia series is mostly as colourless and nondescript as all the other fantasy adventures in spite of its cherished, game-changing foundations.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson's previous two films were both Shrek and Shrek 2, and where there was more of a biting energy in those films which subverted fairy tales and folk stories. Here, Adamson has gone all out to take something back from those projects in his production of a full-on-fairy-story with enchanted kingdoms and talking animals which is played for grimaces more-so grins. The tale begins in Wartime London, a city prone to attacks by the German air force as Hitler's armies sit perched across a small stretch of water at what potentially lies in wait. Trapped in the chaos of what will forever be remembered as The Blitz are the Pevensie family consisting of just their mother and her four children: Peter (Moseley); Edmund (Keynes) Susan (Popplewell) and Lucy (Henley) – a unit already mourning the loss of the man of the family to the war and now stuck here in their garden shelter as the flak rains down.<br/><br/>As was with many at the time, these kids are shipped out of a war torn London and into the countryside; a greener, safer locale where they may wait out the war with elderly guardians. Those unfamiliar with the historical importance behind such course of action, or indeed already aware of said item and looking for a decent dramatic depiction of it, should look no further than a late nineties production entitled ""Goodnight Mr. Tom"". The children are not a congealed unit, they argue; bicker; brand one another ""selfish"" and fall out pretty easily. Boredom and disillusionment at this large countryside house owned by a professor, who does not at all strike us as a professor, gives was to a harmless game of hide and seek wherein the eponymous wardrobe allows access to the wintry world of Narnia: a place where animals speak; war between two set sides broods and the key characteristics of the landscape and climate is snow and the freezing cold. Although as is custom in these films, the youngest discovers the secret first but no one around believes them.<br/><br/>Narnia arrives with its own set of challenges; there are allies in the form of Beavers and Lions, of which feature the voice talents of Ray Winstone and Liam Neeson, but then there are enemies and it is Tilda Swinton's White Witch who comes to be the chief threat. Along the way, the kids in the film learn (with the design being that the message will transcend unto the kids in the audience) the value of teamwork; of working together, especially if you're of the same blood, and that accepting sweets from strangers leads to bad things... My confounded inability to recall the books as well as I'd like does nothing to guard the criticisms I have for the film, a film whose worst characteristic is that it's a tad flat and whose content is, at the worst of times, often asking to be merely disregarded as nonsense. The text's carefree approach to the material, on top of its generally cartoonish aesthetic as a palette of bright colours and a range of contrasts sets the scene to what is ultimately a bloody fight to the bloody death, highlights its child-orientated thematics of fighting on through strife and using one's powers responsibly more than I would have liked.<br/><br/>Director Adamson works here with live action for the first time, although he breaks himself in easily with the retaining of some of what he's used to in the form of CGI animals voiced by famous people prancing around the screen looking expressive. He gets results out of the young cast, who do a thorough job in playing people put through the wringer before being asked to go and win a war that a Lion cannot against a pack of wolves and middle aged woman with a steely gaze. But the film is a stepping stone project more than anything else and the best you can say about this particular adaptation of a famous piece is that those involved do a professional job with an eye to move onto bigger things."

","This movie is awesome. It has brilliant computer animated creatures. They look so much real, obviously great studio works. Besides, it has a nice plot which begins with the discovery of a mysterious wardrobe which is the entrance of a fantasy land Narnia. It has a fast-paced story with lots of excitements. I found a hater (I don't wanna mention his ID but it starts with 'm') in the review section whose review is in the front page of IMDb complaining about 'soullessness' (I even don't know this if this word even is used by normal people). I also check the other reviews posted by this guy and found this guy also hated 'Lord of the Rings: The return of the king' saying it was disappointing. Now, obviously he is a fantasy hater, just trolling and under rating the awesome movies in IMDb. One thing I fail to comprehend how on earth a slow-paced movie like Atonement(2007) gets 8 rating while this exciting fantasy movie gets below 7 rating in IMDb. Are people getting too much narrow minded to confine their edge of imagination into their daily drudgeries? I feel sorry this fantastic movie is under rated."
"temlakos-1","10","1","2","9 April 2010"," This story stands alone, and well
","The true test of any work of literature, or any theatrical performance in any medium (be it stage, film, or TV), is: Can this story stand alone, and impress those who have never before seen this story told in any other medium? In the case of Andrew Adamson's adaptation of C. S. Lewis' ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" the answer is an unqualified ""Yes!"" On one level, this story is an entertaining and indeed rousing story of action, adventure, and suspense. It takes a very common children's fantasy--climbing into a confined space, like a closet or, as in this case, an armoire--and having all manner of adventures without ever actually leaving that space. That is a game that all of us have played as kids at one time or another. But this time it's different. This time it's for real--and some elements of the adventure are not very nice. But then again, that's what makes it satisfying--it presents our heroes with obstacles to overcome.<br/><br/>Or in one case, it teaches a lesson about letting yourself be seduced by someone who tells you what you want to hear, long enough to take advantage of you. In the classic ""be-careful-what-you-wish-for"" department, ""special treatment"" might not be at all what you thought you wanted.<br/><br/>On another level, it is--yes--a passion play. Christians will recognize at once which character makes the supreme sacrifice for another person's rather dreadful sins. And even if you don't know that story, perhaps if you hear the Christian story after watching this film, you will understand why it is so powerful. Have you ever wished that you could do something over? How grateful would you feel if someone were to lay his *life* on the line for you? C. S. Lewis also takes a jab at those who assume that a story is ""logically impossible"" just because it sounds fantastic. His point is that the credibility of the witnesses must sometimes trump even the ""fantastic"" quality of the stories that one witness tells, if that witness has never been known to tell a lie. Andrew Adamson has not lost that lesson.<br/><br/>Happily, the solid cast, and not the special effects or the fantastic story concept, carry this show. Georgie Henley makes an adorable Lucy, one that will always carry your sympathy. Skandar Keynes is equally excellent as Edmund, the mean kid who falls right into a trap laid by one who knows just how to play him. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are incomparable as the older kids who learn the real meaning of responsibility. Seeing William Moseley's Peter confess his failings as an older brother before Aslan the Lion is almost alone worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Nor should one leave out the villain in this piece. Tilda Swinton plays Jadis, Queen of Narnia, aka ""The White Witch,"" like every schoolteacher in the middle grades who was ever accused, with any justice, of seducing the male students in her charge. To see her whisper sweet nothings at Edmund is to feel a chill up your spine if you have any relation whatever to a boy in ""middle school"" with a teacher with a reputation for...! Her abrupt change from the beguiling seductress to the harsh enemy has all the shock value that one could ask for--and to see how those two clash in the end will definitely give you a rich sense of irony. You will never want your son's teacher to offer your son a piece of ""Turkish Delight,"" or any other kind of candy, ever again! And yet, for all that, it is entirely family-friendly and handled in the best possible taste--or as good as one can handle it when it includes a major battle. ""Battles are ugly affairs,"" says one supporting character, and this is no exception, so beware allowing children to see this film who scare easily.<br/><br/>That aside, this film has something for everyone, adult and child alike. It makes a great start to what promises to be a very heartwarming series."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","1","2","30 March 2009"," ""King of the jungle"" taken one step too far
","I remember being hugely disappointed the first time I saw the first installment in what is shaping up to be the massive adaptation of the Chronicles of Narnia novels into movies. In sheer numbers, this collection will be second only to the making of all of the Harry Potter movies which, if I may say, seems to be getting more and more like pulling teeth with each successive movie. That depends, of course, on whether or not they make it through the whole series, which is debatable. This is not, as you know, the first time the Chronicles have been attempted. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is the most famous of C.S. Lewis' classic collection of seven novels, which is part of the reason that expectation was so high in anticipation of its release. <br/><br/>I read the books several times when I was a kid, although I haven't read any of them for probably almost ten years. Nevertheless, I hold the stories themselves in high regard and so I also had high expectations of the movie. When it was first released I was unimpressed. I don't remember exactly what I said about the movie back then, but I'm pretty sure that some strong words, like ""sucked,"" were thrown around.<br/><br/>I watched the movie again the other day and, while I can see what I didn't like the first time, I think I was a little harsh in my initial opinion of the movie. For starters, it is a brilliantly visionary and faithful re-creation of the book for almost the entire first hour, and doesn't get genuinely cheesy until the talking wolves show up and the movie forgets that it's not supposed to take itself so seriously. The Christian undertones are slightly heavy-handed (note: when I say ""slightly"" I really mean ""extremely""), although this is not exactly much of an aberration from the novel, which in many ways made real efforts to rival the Holy Bible in its direct, straight-forward Christian message. <br/><br/>You know how those educational videos that they show us in school, whether you're in school now or you were in school 20 years ago, all look like they were made in the early 1970's by people being paid in bad polyester suit patches? Or how those videos that they show in driver's training look like they haven't been updated since the conversion from BETA to VHS? Most outwardly religious movies suffer from the same fate. Consider, for example, the hilariously bad 2002 film Time Changer. Remember that thing? Ouch!!<br/><br/>At any rate, those familiar with the numerous past adaptations of the story will find the whole ordeal a little redundant, but the rest of us (and that's most of us) will most likely be looking at this adaptation with fairly fresh eyes. It's a major motion picture, instead of the radio plays and animated or television features that preceded it, and is packed with brilliant performances and impressive special effects, although I would be lying if I said that there were no bad effects and no bad performances in it. <br/><br/>The story involves a group of young children sent off to live in the country while World War II raged outside their home, and they find themselves stuck living in an environment very unfriendly to children. While playing hide-and-seek, little Lucy hides in an old wardrobe and discovers a portal to a world called Narnia, where humans are a myth. Before long, they all find themselves in Narnia trapped by their own consciences into staying and battling the evil White Witch to protect the inhabitants of Narnia from her vicious wrath.<br/><br/>The film, like the books, is aimed at a young adult audience, as it should be. The books are meant for exactly the same age of children as the movie is, which speaks well for the success of this adaptation of Lewis' story. The roles of the children are cast with uniform perfection, and Tilda Swinton is outstandingly ruthless White Witch. As an aside, this is how the Terminatrix in Terminator 3 should have behaved. <br/><br/>Strangely, the only performance in the movie that is really distracting and out of place is Liam Neeson as Aslan, theumlion king. The animation of the lion is a distraction in itself, but Neeson's soft spoken voicing of the squinty-eyed beast, who always looks like he's about to fall asleep or has hair spray in his eyes, doesn't mix well for what is supposed to be the long-loved and lost King of Narnia. It's easy to see why he's loved, but there is no air of real respect or authority about him.<br/><br/>James MacEvoy, by the way, gives one of the best performances in the movie as Mr. Tumnus, the half-man/half-fawn that Lucy meets as soon as she first enters into Narnia. This is a tremendously talented actor, and even after a string of consistently brilliant performances in outstanding films, I don't think he's getting the recognition that he deserves. Lucy and Edmund are the other critical characters in the story whose casting could have single- handedly made or broken the movie, and both are flawless. <br/><br/>There are times when the effects are unimpressive and even downright bad (some of the evil Witches evil henchmen are of the old, cartoon-like CGI variety) and it's interesting to consider that Tumnus's initial betrayal of Lucy is exactly the same betrayal committed by Hoggle against Sarah in Labyrinth, although I guess it's not exactly a rip-off. I don't feel like researching it at the moment but I'm willing to bet that this story was written before Labyrinth"
"Wizardling","3","1","2","5 January 2009"," Boring and makes little sense.
","Still, I shouldn't be surprised. Even as a young kid the Chronicles of Narnia books didn't appeal as Diane Duane or Tamora Pierce's (to name just a couple favourites) excellent fantasy novels did. The thinly veiled religious allegory made as little sense to me as actual religion did. It is hard to believe anyone can read or watch this stuff without severe eye rolling action.<br/><br/>But I suppose I'm not the intended audience. I'd suggest this film only for the religious or small children who have not yet developed a bullshit-o-meter - because I just couldn't get immersed in the story. It was just... silly."
"moviewizguy","7","1","2","28 December 2008"," Some journeys take us far from home. Some adventures lead us to our destiny.
","Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis, four London children are sent to a professor's country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch. To defeat the witch, they must join forces with Aslan, the lion God of Narnia.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed in what I saw of this film. It's good, yes, but it's not really all that fantastic, compared to the first films of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" I think Lewis deserves better. However, it's good enough to start off a franchise (hopefully). In this first film of probably many, we're introduced to four children, all uniquely different in a good way. It feels like you would want to spend a whole movie with, which is the first thing one must do before making the movie.<br/><br/>The CGI effects were brilliant, along with the set designs, costumes, and action sequences. But no, this is not a rip-off of ""Lord of the Rings"" in any way, although it does in the trailer. Instead, the two films are completely different, both just seeming to have epic battle sequences, one which seems to have animals fighting. The magic is decent, I guess, although I hope they can expand a little more in the future.<br/><br/>I found the film quite good because of the allegory behind it. The film obviously touches on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, which is probably why this film was so successful during the winter season. Apart from that, I found the film quite long. The first act drags a bit and I thought they could've sped up the pace a lot better.<br/><br/>The performance by Anna Popplewell, the youngest of the bunch, is quite...annoying. She seems like a rip-off of the character Hermione in the ""Harry Potter"" series. Apart from that, everyone else was fine. The best character in here is Tilda Swinton because her character is vicuous. I mean really vicious. I think she ranks up as one of the best villains in movies.<br/><br/>I think the film is a decent start to the franchise. I hope the films would get better along the way, much like the ""Harry Potter"" films, as well as more magic that made people fall in love with ""The Wizard of Oz."" The look of the film is beautiful yes. It's a stunning achievement. Overall, it's a good film for the family, although it's a bit violent for a PG rating."
"Netscape_Navigator","7","1","2","26 December 2008"," a satisfying, solid fantasy movie that even the harshest critic can enjoy (like myself)
","I don't think I've ever used the phrase, ""a movie everyone can enjoy"" to describe a movie, but I'll do it here. OK, done. I'll give props where it's due, for a PG movie for kids, this was surprisingly engaging, non-cliché, and very, very well written.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of fantasy movies I like, and that has to do with the way they're presented to you. They present the world to you in an already existing state, bombarding you with everything without gradually introducing you to its various elements. They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place. I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't). In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the ""pre-fantasy"" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.<br/><br/>**The character Lucy single-handedly kept me interested with her GREAT acting in the beginning where she was prominently featured. She was better than a good 70-83% of grown actresses that I've seen, and probably 98% of child actresses not named Dakota Fanning and a select other few. I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual. ""Yeah, I don't know, why DO we do that??""<br/><br/>**I loved the interaction between the kids. I loved the tension there. In most PG movies the good guys are usually black and white, you don't have ugly things like traitors, jealousy, and greed.<br/><br/>**A mark of a well-written movie is how many times you DON'T have to say to a character on screen, ""why are you doing that?"" or ""why AREN'T you doing this?"" Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, ""wait, what? You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???"" That's perfect. That's exactly how a real person would behave, and the actress pulled off the well-written lines just as perfectly, as she questioned her siblings with a confused look. I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.<br/><br/>I only have a couple complaints:<br/><br/>**When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier. She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only. But how did she know the exact boundaries or properties of this magic elixir? It's MAGIC. How do you know that it won't revive him? No one specifically ever defined its limitations. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).<br/><br/>**I didn't like the sword fighting scene between Peter and the witch. It just looked weak, like they were struggling to swing the sword(s). Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.<br/><br/>**This one is minor, but, the grown versions of the kids at the end just looked very goofy.<br/><br/>Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however. If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie. Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride. The plot didn't feel contrived, it was believable for what it was, and the characters are extremely likable, to the point where I was hoping that even the CGI animals don't get hurt or killed. This movie has a lot heart and certain charm to it that leaves you happy for seeing it.<br/><br/>***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random. I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV. It was the scene at the end showing a front view of the lion and the four kids as they walk towards the camera, towards the coronation area. As corny as it sounds, there was just something noble and inspirational about that scene."

","OK, first off, I have been a HUGE fan of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe since I had to read it for summer reading in fourth grade. It's the ONLY summer reading book I've ever read that I reread about 3 (or more) times a year.<br/><br/>When I saw the original ads, (You know, the ones with just the name and the snow-covered mountains in the background?) I was actually looking forward to seeing it. Unlike other movies (those of you who've read my other posts, you know that I usually hate the previews, love the movie) I actually wanted to see this. Then mom told me ""I saw an actual preview for this, it looks really scary"", but heck, I'd been reading and rereading this book since fourth grade so there was NO WAY I was gonna miss this thing.<br/><br/>The story of the four brave Pevensie children that get teleported to another world inside a wardrobe where a war is taking place at the same time as WWII, befriend chatty beavers, fauns, centaurs, talking animals, and meet the heroic lion Aslan (Liam Neeson), then fight in a battle against Jadis, the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) that changes their lives forever...I enjoyed every single minute of this, both reading AND watching the movie.<br/><br/>I have to say, for me, the best part of the movie was the battle. It was incredible, the CGI was amazing, and the score by Harry Gregson-Williams was fantastic, almost John Williams-esquire!

","I admit, I've never read the book. So I can't comment on how well the movie stays true, other than to say that the director must be following something (other than normal ""cinema story-telling"") because this movie seems to make little sense. Moreover, any book-following following seems to stop at the basic plot outline only, and does not scratch the surface of the details or deeper meanings.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is there; yes, you can follow the story and see what happens; but there is absolutely no explanation by way of dialog. It starts off okay, then about halfway through there's a paradigm shift and the characters stop conversing almost completely. It's as if the director/producers suddenly realized they had limited funds, so they eliminated the writers and decided to include only the special effects; perhaps at the same time, the director realized the movie would take 3 hours to complete, and so they cut-out everything not absolutely ""essential"".<br/><br/>What's left is a somewhat eclectic and disconcerted series of ""pretty pictures"", with no qualifications of any of the character's reasoning, motives, thoughts, or actions. They do what they do, things happen as they happen, and we're left to just ""accept"".<br/><br/>The resulting movie has little character development, a seemingly shallow plot, and leaves the viewer with an empty feeling."
"vip_ebriega","8","1","2","12 May 2008"," C.S. Lewis will be proud.
","My Take: Terrific special effects and magical storytelling make for one sweeping adventure.<br/><br/>THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is the first adaptation of C.S. Lewis classic fantasy adventure in many years, and it's also the latest in the long line of big-budget fantasy epics, following the success of the HARRY POTTER and LORD OF THE RINGS series, both adapted from novels. NARNIA is not the best entry in this new cinematic debacle, but both the money's worth and the cost is there. I loved it, special effects and all. The movie (directed by another New Zealand-born Andrew Adamson from the SHREK films) is filled with all the wonders of special effects, the best that Hollywood has got to offer (until the next one), but the film isn't just about special effects, even if they're great. The characters and plot finely holds up. I, who enjoyed Lewis' works on the Narnia book series, enjoyed this film version, and I'm pretty sure Lewis would have been proud by this treatment.<br/><br/>When I was a kid, I used to wait for a stage play of this story which came out every Holiday season. When I got a little older, and the show stopped coming up, I moved to reading the book. I've read two novels in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"", ""The Magician's Nephew"" and this one. So, when the big-screen version is announced, I was anticipated with the news, and got up to see it quickly. The movie version is not like the musical play I saw as a kid, but comparisons aren't required. This is a fantastic adaptation that does Lewis some justice. The characters, CGI or not, from the book aren't dumb down and remain very interesting. And played by a young British cast makes them very appealing to the big-screen.<br/><br/>For those unaware of the story, four orphans, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Annie Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Kaynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) are whisked to the magical world of the title, where they encountered that it has been cursed with eternal winter by the evil yet appealing White Witch (played with real malice by Tilda Swinton). The only hope is to fulfill a prophecy held at the beginning of time, with the help of the valiant lion king Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>The special effects are first-rate. The make-up and visual effects created by the Academy-award winning crew behind THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy are just as believable as their previous Award-winning work. For a long time, the CGI lion is almost real. But besides the effects, the adaptation is wonderfully faithful. All the very appealing characters and patriotic sequences, as well as those dark ones, are very well lift from the pages of Lewis' books.<br/><br/>Very well done, and magical. It's highly recommended with a **** (out of the usual 5).<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"jaredmobarak","8","1","2","12 May 2008"," Once a king and queen of Narnia, always a king and queen of NarniaThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
","I remember the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis very fondly from my elementary school days. Never having read the Lord of Rings until college, once the films began to be made, Narnia was my one outlet into fantasy. Yes, there were a couple BBC productions that our librarian showed us while reading the epic saga, but being over a decade ago, having a reboot seemed like a perfect idea. Piggybacking on the fantasy train during the mid-2000's was a no-brainer and who better to direct than family friendly man Andrew Adamson? While, I guess there were probably a few that could come to mind considering he had never helmed a live action feature, (his two previous films were Shrek and Shrek 2). However, after viewing the filmtheatrical or extended as I viewed most recently for this reviewyou can't fault anything that goes on. The direction is great, the acting natural when dealing with leads of the age they are at here, special effects superb, and one can't fault the source material. Whether you take offense to the blatant Christian metaphors and Jesus-like events or not, don't let those preconceptions hold you back from watching the very well done piece of escapism cinema for the whole family that is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.<br/><br/>The story is a tale of duty, courage, trust, and forgiveness. With World War II going on outside their house in Britain, the Pevensie children are escorted out of the city to the country home of Professor Kirke, (a wonderfully eclectic Jim Broadbent). While cooped up in his mansion, the kids decide to play games in order to stay sane, one of which is hide and seek. During the excursion, the youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe, a perfect place to hide. Once inside, however, she discovers it is a pathway into a mythical land called Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus and learns about the White Witch who has taken over as Queen and shrouded the country in 100 years of winter. Only the true king, Aslan, can save them all from her medusa-like penchant to turn all enemies into stone and her utter disregard for anything good. As one would expect, upon her return, (hours in Narnian time, but only seconds in ours), the other children don't believe her tale at all. This dissension only adds to the rough relationships slowly burgeoning between the siblings, causing a rift in their solidarity and a way for the White Witch to work on young Edmund, (once all four kids arrive), he with the most anger and jealousy towards the others, to get the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve to be destroyed once and for all.<br/><br/>Being a children's film above all else could hinder the emotional toll trying to be portrayed. Fortunately, this never becomes a problem. When there is battle and death, no blood is to be seenthis is not a Tolkien adaptation full of decapitations and gore. The warring sides contain talking forest creatures and mythical beings like dwarfs, centaurs, and phoenixes. Each is very well fleshed out and a true part of the proceedings, never appearing as more prop than character. They add to the immense accessibility for young children to find themselves drawn into the world and fight against the villains. The environment is handled deftly, winter is a luscious white and the transformation to spring is subtle and effective. Each detail is cared for, as there is not one instance for you to take a too close look and find yourself watching craft rather then story.<br/><br/>Sure there is some great voice work from the likes of Liam Neeson and Ray Winstone, but it is the live actors that shine, whether in human form or fantastical. One of my favorite aspects of the film is Mr. Tumnus the faun played by James McAvoy. Not only is it mentioned for his real portrayal of all the emotions and inner wrestling with his heart and his fear, but also for the special effect work. Making his legs disappear into the hooves of a faun is very impressive and seamlessly done. Then you have Tilda Swinton as the White Witcha performance that I will admit could scare many a young child, and possibly a few adults too. She takes cold-blooded to new levels and her icy stare mixed with the false smile she uses to brainwash Edmund is great. Devious and purely evil, she carries each scene she is a part of.<br/><br/>So, while Adamson has crafted winner, allowing all the pieces to fall together and be successful, he is not the last line in getting the rest of these books adapted to film. A lot must be put upon the four principal roles of the Pevensie children. If they are not believable, no one will take the time to see the rest that contain them, let alone the ones where people will have to be introduced to all new characters. Thankfully, these kids do the job and I can't wait to see how they handle the work in Prince Caspian, being that they will all be knowledgeable in the fact they were kings and queens, victorious in battle. This story is where they discover their heroism; the next is where they use it to battle evil once again. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are the elder two, Peter and Susan, and while they can be a tad stiff at times, they do the job when needed. Skandar Keyne and Georgie Henley, as Edmund and Lucy, are the true finds. Both are natural and endearing, young children holding grudges and not thinking through their actions to their possible conclusions. They are fallible creatures and act as catalysts for much of the film. Never sticking out, nor showing their inexperience, these kids carry the film on their shoulders and prove that this franchise has only begun."
"ceoa","10","1","2","10 May 2008"," What a great movie!
","I first have to say that I did not see this in the theater back in 2005, nor did I read any of C. S. Lewis' 7 Chronicles of Narnia stories. Now I wish I had done both.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie was on a movie (cable/satellite) channel about 2 months ago. I was flipping through the channels when I came across it and it was about half over. I only watched about 5 minutes of the movie and was so intrigued by it that I actually stopped watching it and checked to see if and when it would be on again. I found out that it only had one more scheduled showing starting at 3am in the middle of the week. Thank goodness for DVR, I set it to record the movie and watched it the following Saturday, twice! The story is great, the visual effects are outstanding and I can't think of a better way to portray what it means to have or find courage, honor and love.<br/><br/>I have since found out a lot about the Chronicles of Narnia stories. I got excited when I found out Prince Caspian movie is being released and the planned release of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in 2010. I know they plan on making all 7 stories into movies. I just hope I'm still around by the time the last one is made, as I am 50 years old now!"
"basschick","4","1","2","20 April 2008"," Generic Children's Action
","I love fantasy movies, made for both children and adults from Labyrinth to Lord of the Rings to the 1939 Wizard of Oz and the Harry Potter series. The two things I don't love are generic fantasy movies and directors/writers who feel that they can rewrite an epic tale better than the original author. And they did it by leaving out almost everything that made the Narnia stories emotionally believable or unique.<br/><br/>The movie is much more confrontational than the book. Peter battles the White Witch in a sword battle and Aslan saves Peter by knocking her off physically. The children and the beavers leave the beavers' place as the wolves arrive so that there is a chase scene.<br/><br/>And the movie starts with a world war 2 bombing and the children being sent away in a long good bye in the train station scene. It also makes the Professor sort of goofy and inaccessible and the housekeeper just plain mean, not merely put off her stride by children.<br/><br/>The kids? Well, the movie makes a point of showing Edmund as mean, selfish and awful all the time before Narnia. They're also none too bright - they break a window and run to hide in the Wardrobe. Like if the housekeeper doesn't find them right now, she'll forget all about it? And Lucy is just a little too young.<br/><br/>If you were expecting Jadis to be magnificent or regal, forget it. She's a medium level evil character with no real malevolence and nothing of the royal and completely selfish and powerful queen who followed Digory and Polly from elsewhere to Narnia.<br/><br/>This movie also dots every i and crosses every t. Children are a lot smarter than this movie gives them credit for, and if they have to stretch just a little to understand everything, that's how we grow. If you dumb everything down - particularly a book or movie that was originally something that made us think, all you succeed in doing is not letting us think.<br/><br/>And last - Aslan. There is no mention of his powers - heck, no mention of whether he even HAS powers or a long life or anything else - or of his being the son of the emperor across the sea. Aslan and Lucy do not develop a special relationship.<br/><br/>If you love children's action and fantasy adventures, you may like this movie. If you loved the Narnia books for the wonder and character development of all the characters and the country of Narnia, don't expect much and you won't be too disappointed."
"biggunracing85","7","1","2","25 February 2008"," this movie stayed true to the book
","We watched two movies in class, the new and the old versions of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"". The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was about a group of kids who were playing around, and while they were playing around they found an imaginary country. This country was called Narnia, they had to travel very far to get there and then eventually go into battle. The newer version I thought was a lot better than the old one. The new one was more realistic and had better special effects. I also liked it because you could actually understand what was going on instead of being distracted by the bad effects and of how fake it was. I also didn't like the old one because the animals looked like stuffed animals. Another thing I liked about the movie is that is stayed true to the book. One reason I didn't give this movie a 10 is because it got boring after awhile, it didn't have any real action. Also you know that any of this stuff can't really happen. I would not watch this movie again but would recommend this movie to anyone who has watched the older version or has read the book."
"mikewalters58","8","1","2","21 February 2008"," Narnia!
","After watching the movie ""Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe,"" I would rate it at an eight. The movie was very entertaining to watch. I loved how there was all different creatures that were all animal or half animal half human. The artist was very creative. Mark Johnson Philip Steuer did an amazing job bringing all these characters to life. In my opinion the movie is way better than the book.<br/><br/>This story is about four kids that get sent away because there is a war going on over Europe. They end up at some professor's house and the one child Lucy finds a wardrobe. It's a door to a magical land. She tells her brothers and sister they end up on going on an adventure.<br/><br/>When comparing the book to the movie I think that the book was more child- friendly. It described all the animals; they were what I expected them to look like. The book also made Edmund seem more evil than in the movie. In the movie they made Edmund seem fairly innocent. Lastly I like how in the movie they showed the kids life before they went to the professor's house. In the book they don't explain much of their life or why they get sent away.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie more than the book, but the book was still good and better then I expected the book to be. The movie stuck to the plot of the story that C.S. Lewis wrote."

"prodigy-25","10","1","2","20 December 2007"," An excellent movie.
","Negative comments here left me wondering if people who wrote them ever watched ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" at all. Or how people manage to watch the quality of CGI instead of movies? I don't get it.<br/><br/>It's just a wonderful fairy tale, it's not about good CGI or bad CGI. (I'm not an expert so I won't judge, but to me it all looked pretty natural. And now that's a cliché - to blame CGI instead of your own lack of taste.) It's a beautiful film and one that you really want to watch again. <br/><br/>Yes, I've read the original novel by Lewis and, yes the spirit of the book isn't lost at all (the movie is a bit more serious, but not at all boring as some people claim). The storyline is kept mostly untouched too (nothing like what Jackson did to LoTR). <br/><br/>10/10 - I can't imagine how ""Narnia"" could possibly be better."
"joliefille411","10","1","2","9 December 2007"," Breaking the Spell...
","So usually I'm a book purist, especially when I read the book before I see the movie. I almost always prefer the book over the film version. However, I loved LWW quite as much as the novel. This may not be such a huge feat as this book was never my favorite of the series. I'll reserve my harshest criticism for The Horse and His Boy or Magician's Nephew, providing we make it that far. I even adored the old BBC version, furry-baked-potato beavers and all. Its sad how laughably that version had aged.<br/><br/>Anyways, to the movie! It was lovely in every way. I must sadly admit that even my imagination did not do the stories as much justice. The scenery was gorgeous and the costumes were lovely.<br/><br/>As far as the casting went- I was tremendously pleased. Lucy has massive potential to come off as an annoying twerp, but thankfully Georgie was not at all grating. I liked Skandar very much- almost too much. I always imagined him extremely sallow. I heard many complaints about the kids being cast too old, but I always think people are younger than they are, so it didn't bother me. Hands down, though, my favorite character was James Macavoy as Mr. Tumnus. He was simply adorable! The animals have vastly improved from the puppets of olden days. Things look so real. I often wonder if in 10 years they will no longer look as real, since I'm sure people thought the same thing about effects made 10 years ago.<br/><br/>As far as the storyline- I really had no problems with anything- except one scene. The melting of the river icecapades. And that wasn't even because it deviated from the book. It simply bordered on cheesy. The whole time the movie felt like a fairytale, but for a few minutes it just seemed like a sequence of Indiana Jones was slapped in. Very jarring. And I always wonder why nobody's faces were extremely red or tinged with blue and why there was never any steam coming from them- something I'd expect from an ice bath. I hate when something in a movie takes me out of the story and makes me focus on the anomaly.<br/><br/>So overall, it was really really good. Possibly more moving than the book. I really will have to read it again to be sure. I am dying to see the sequel and hopefully the series!"

The beginning of the movie was amazing, very wonderfully done, though after that it just started going downhill. The movie was very faithful to the book, which can work as an advantage or a dis-advantage, in this case it was the latter. There was not a rising plot, there was a lot of fluff, the action scenes weren't built up, though the aftermath was clear. I felt some of the actors were rather wooden.

The battle scene was my favorite part of the movie, the music was also very good during that scene. Narnia is a great movie to watch with your family, friends, or whoever. The movie stayed true to the book, except for the frozen river scene, but it was still very good. Pippa Hall did a great job of casting the four Pevensie children,( William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley). The movie may seem like a children's movie, but that is because it is based on a children's book, so what would you expect? If you are or ever were a fan of the Narnia series, i suggest you watch the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe. The next movie, Prince Caspian, will be out on may 16th, 2008, and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader will be out in 2009.

","From adding the Blitz, to extending the battle, and warming your heart at the end, this movie is one of the best family films ever produced! Based on The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which over 40 million copies have been sold, Disney takes C. S.

The Actors, William Mosley as Peter, Anna Popplewell as Susan, Skander Keynes as Edmund, and Georgie Henley as Lucy, were outstanding! Andrew Adamson did an amazing job as the director, and extra credit to him, because this was his first live action film ever produced. That was the big question, He did great with the Shrek movies, BUT, how is he going to do with live action movies? He didn't do it just to do it, he did it from his heart, and that is what makes a great film. The special effects were also amazing, being done with care and the latest technology. Also, the fine details weren't minimized, but maximized. For example, in the beaver's house, they could have skimped by without adding the things that the book said the beavers had in their house. They also could have left the wolves tails unchanged, wagging like a puppy's, chasing after a ball or toy. The story itself is a big part, a story that teaches an important lesson, touches your heart, and builds your courage and character. All around, it's a great film, and a must see for everyone. That's why it came in first place in family films in 2005. That's why there's a special four disk special edition available. That's why over 40 million copies have been sold. And that's why I'm typing this today. But don't take my word for it, See for yourself what I mean. I'm sure you'll agree.<br/><br/>-Daniel Jaeger"
"nunemkh","10","1","2","26 August 2007"," An amazing fantasy cult favorite and an instant classic.
","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, is my number one favorite fantasy film.<br/><br/>This is because it has all the right ingredients. The score, the acting, the story, the imagery, its all incredibly well done. And because it's the first in the series, and director, Andrew Adamson's first live-action film I could excuse the minor flaws.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting enough to capture the audience's attention and the pace is done well enough so that the audience stays with it. The film is about the Pevensie children who are sent to live in a house in the English country side while their father is fighting in the war. Their mother stays behind but they cannot because of the bombing raids that have been occurring: the introduction where we actually see a bombing raid is quit exiting. And so while the children are entertaining them selves in the mansion by playing hide and seek, the youngest, Lucy, finds a large wardrobe to hide in. the wardrobe that Lucy hides in turns out to not have an end in fact it leads to a parallel universe. And so we enter Narnia. A few other events take place and soon enough all four children are in Narnia and cannot leave. It's not because the portal disappeared, but rather they feel morally obligated to stay and fix the problems they have created and to fulfill a prophesy. But this prophesy turns out to be delayed a bit when Edmund, my favorite character, betrays his siblings and all Narnia by siding with a tyrant known as the white witch.<br/><br/>NARNIA is a great film because even though it is one out of a million other fantasies aimed at kids, it stands out because it has such a whimsical quality to it. The colors, the lighting, the characters, it all adds up to a magical mix of atmosphere.<br/><br/>The score is perfect. The songs played during the battle sequence is beautifully moving. As well as the music during a citrine scene which I cant say too much about since it would be a major spoiler.<br/><br/>The mythology in NARNIA is also enjoying to watch. It seems like a mix of Greek, Roman and western European mythology. I must say every shot that includes a Griffin is marvelous. This mythology of creatures also insures some key characters being animals. And some of my favorites include two talking beavers who happen to be marries. Also the character of Mr. Tumnus is a very nice one who seems to contribute to the plot greatly although not too many people noticed that.<br/><br/>I would have mentioned Aslan in the previous paragraph since he is also a talking animal, but because he is the god of Narnia and an amazing character that has gone down in fantasy history, he deserves a paragraph for himself, although maybe only a book would be able to do him justice. Aslan is the god of Narnia and like the god that religious people believe in on earth, he is completely mysterious. Its not always clear why he does or doesn't do the things he does or doesn't do, but it does always seem to work in the end. Aslan, along with all the other Narnian creatures, is created amazingly by the film makers. There are so many incredible shots of him. He is also voices perfectly by Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>I think what makes me respect this film so much is the fact that there was so much love that went into making this film. And of course that is a very important ingredient in film making.<br/><br/>So I would definitely recommend this film to everyone, watch it, and buy the DVD. I got the 4-disc edition and its great, if you're a fan you should buy nothing less than the 4-dosc set. It includes more special features than the 1 and 2-disc editions plus it has a feature-length documentary on C.S. Luis, the author of the beloved NARNIA book series."

","I'm sorry everyone but I HATE this movie. The comments all seem to be positive. Does no one else see things the way I do? The first trailer I saw had me so excited that maybe they'd done gorgeous justice to my favourite books of all time.<br/><br/>Not so.<br/><br/>Yes it has lavish sets/costumes/props/pixels/unnecessary action... but it sure as hell cheaps out like any blockbuster does in telling the story.<br/><br/>Disney has been making me angry since I was a kid watching 'The Little Mermaid' and knowing she should turn into sea foam at the end. This is no different. It felt like this movie had been made to sell a video game. What's with the rushing across a breaking up river? What's with the battle scenes and DIALOG!? almost jokingly copied straight out of Lord of the Rings? This story is not a complicated mess of meanderings and secret meetings with underground (no pun intended) animals. This wasn't Narnia, it's a modern mockery. It is a movie for it's time when audiences want bigger and better CGI, millions of orcs/centaurs/whatevers fighting each other in clean digital fashion. DOES NO ONE HAVE IMAGINATION ANYMORE TO SEE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES? That was part of the point to the story in the first place. The books inspired my imagination like nothing else ever did. This movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination. Like so many movies these days, it hands everything out on a silver platter. Sometimes I yearn for the days of 2-d animation and creativity in solving problems without computers. Yet, 'Pan's Labyrinth' used CGI without overdoing it. Maybe this is what you get with the director of 'Shrek' at the helm. I have very little hope for 'Prince Caspian' being any better.<br/><br/>I'll just stick to my books and the badly animated, yet so much more entertaining, 1979 cartoon version that actually has some real feeling. -From a girl who used to look in everyone's closets."

","This film is a masterpiece, a wonderful film, an excellent film, a wonder to behold. Sure, they do change several things, but who's quibbling? Not me! I liked all the cast, except there was one problem with Lucy- that face she makes when she is upset. I could'nt stand it. It makes me sick every single time I watch it. Swinton was good, but the witch- no matter who she is played by, she is ugly. Kellerman (original BBC TV version) did animate everything way too much, and overdid it by a long shot. Swinton, however, was quite perfect as the witch. She will HAVE to come back for the Magician's Nephew, but as for Silver Chair, I know that witch was of the ""same crew"" and all that, but I think that if she tried to do that role too, she would basically be redoing her role from this, and therefore downplaying her role in this. Skandar did not have any facial expressions, except when he got wounded by the witch- his face was contorted beyond all reason. Jonathon Scott, from the BBC version, did not have any facial expressions at all, not even when he is being the unsatisfied brat. On the other hand, I thought the animators for the animated version of this did Edmund's facial expressions quite well. MOST AWESOME SCENES: when the two armies run at each other- there is dead silence, until the first sounds of hand-to-hand combat could be heard, and the second is when the centaur guy tries to attack the witch."
"james-forrest","6","1","2","28 June 2007"," Wow. What a shame. Who has seen the original here?
","The reason I haven't seen this remake earlier is because I heard how bad it was. Now I know why. The first thing that got to me was the acting of all of the children. Unbelievably...bad! Come on guys this is Narnia, what I grew up with, I want to feel your emotions! But I got none.<br/><br/>The second is how all this CGI looks nice but in the end actually makes the original 1988 Narnia so much better. Firstly the acting was actually good, and secondly, there is something about seeing a physical, beautiful lion or seeing those two cheeky beavers (even though they were two actors in suits)..again physically being there instead of some CGI garbage, that added to ""real-ness"" of this fantasy land. Aslan had this presence that was shattered with pretty Computer Animation.<br/><br/>Also, with the characters, (because they actually acted in the '88 version), their relationships between themselves were so much more real, unlike here the attempted emotion about finding Edmund again..I don't feel it. I don't really believe they cared about finding Edmund again, yet, in the '88 version...I believed it all! I am rambling here and have made massive comparisons to something I originally watched on ABC , only because given current advances in movie making they could have made this so much more. What they have given us is something children will no doubt like, but more mature movie goers like myself have to shake my head in shame to imagine if the rest of the series will be filled in this empty-shell style.<br/><br/>The only reason this gets a 6 out of 10 is because it was a good trip back to the original Narnia, and I have not seen it in a while. I will probably watch it again tomorrow to remind myself of how good it is. Everyone else- get the original"

","When I heard they were doing a motion picture of Narnia, I had a little checklist of things in my head that the movie absolutely had to do right for me to be happy coming out of the theatre. They had to show the interaction between Lucy and Tumnus well. I didn't want Tumnus to come across creepy and squicky, especially. I wanted to see the scene between the Queen and Edmund. I wanted to see the presents from Santa, even if we didn't see Santa. And they absolutely HAD to have grown-up Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy on a hunt at the end. I was not disappointed by any of those scenes. They were all there, and they were all wonderful.<br/><br/>Tumnus was perfect and timid and just wonderful to watch, and the costume and effects for his hooves were perfect. Even his scarf was lovely. The scene with him lulling Lucy to sleep by playing his pipe, and Aslan breaking the spell is absolutely gorgeous. And his horror at what he's been forced to do was well-played. <br/><br/>Tilda was lovely, if extremely understated. I'm still trying to decide if I would have wanted someone more over-the-top for the Queen. I love Tilda, but I was expecting more histrionics, I guess. On the other hand, she was gorgeous, and definitely coldly cruel. And the scene where she made a hot drink and Turkish Delight for Edmund was perfect. <br/><br/>The scene with Santa was almost exactly word-for-word from the book at the beginning, though I did miss him giving them the presents for Edmund as well, and apparently the beavers deserved nothing... I do understand why they cut that part of the scene, but still.<br/><br/>But my favorite scene was the Hunt. I was so worried they'd sell it short and keep them kids, but I desperately wanted to see the older versions of them, and the return to the ""real world"" as it were. It was so perfect, and the falling out of the wardrobe kids again was exactly how I'd hoped.<br/><br/>Now, I'm a long-time fan of the Narnia books. Read them several times over the years. And though I didn't see the Christian imagery when I was a kid, it's blatant to me now. And while I'm stridently anti-religion, and those sorts of things usually annoy the heck out of me, I can honestly say that the scriptwriter did an excellent job on transferring it all across. There was no new imagery to ""suggest"" further religious stuff, and I don't particularly think they toned down what CS Lewis actually had in the story itself. I thought it was actually quite well-handled, considering.<br/><br/>Other bits and pieces:<br/><br/>* Jim Broadbent as the Professor. Such an excellent casting choice. He really does the childlike surprise and interest well.<br/><br/>* Aslan. I would have liked a stronger voice, actually. I love Liam Neeson, but I don't think he was strong enough for the part when it came right down to it. I guess it felt to me like Aslan was holding back a bit.<br/><br/>* The Beavers were fabulous. The animation was perfect, and the interplay between the two of them was wonderful. And Dawn French was fabulous, as usual. <br/><br/>* I have heard others say that Edmund steals the movie, but really, aside from one scene at the beginning of the movie, everything I saw in the movie with him was stuff that was straight from the book. And the boy they got to play him did an excellent job.<br/><br/>* Peter--the young man they got to play him was excellent. He is how I have always seen Cedric Diggory in my head, if a touch younger than Cedric in GOF.<br/><br/>* I quite liked how they illustrated the realities of the children's situation before they got on the train, and also how much the kids really felt like siblings. Whoever was responsible for that did an excellent job.<br/><br/>* My husband was thrilled at ""Aslan's on the move."" Rather important line, and nicely done. Sent a thrill through me when I heard it. And another wonderful line that I'd totally forgotten about until it was said: ""Ward Robe in the land of Spare Oom..."" Which makes me think of Rock and Rule now, but it's an adorable line.<br/><br/>* The wardrobe itself was an absolutely gorgeous thing. WETA outdid themselves, and not just on that, either. The costumes after they arrive at Aslan's camp, and the weapons and crowns were all gorgeous.<br/><br/>* Tumnus's punishment. I was practically biting my nails waiting for Edmund to stumble across Tumnus in the Queen's courtyard, but when they showed him it was utterly perfect and so miserable. Poor Edmund...<br/><br/>* And OMG, the swordfighting. I kept snickering at Peter using his sword like a gun, keeping it trained on whoever he was fighting, but I love that in the final battle sequences they were actually swordfighting--meaning that they weren't fencing with the ruddy things or using them like clubs. Tilda especially shone in the battle sequences.<br/><br/>So, yes. Good movie. Watch. It's worth it."

I must agree with all of you that state ''the acting sucked''. I didn't like the actor who played Lucy, and the others did a mediocre job. The story is great, but they didn't capture it too well. Visual effects...Yeah, they are doing their job. The musical score were fulfilling and well made. It's no Gladiator or Star Wars, but it's quite nice.

The Chronicles of Narnia talks about the four kids who travel through a wardrobe to the land of Narnia and learn of their destiny to free it with the guidance a mystical lion. The animations and the sound effect are great. In the film, it includes a lot of scope, depth, and wonder, so that it almost excited me in every minute. The characters are acting so great and I will choose Georgie Henley as my favorite character. She is Lucy Pevensie in Narnia and her performance is excellent. She can show me that the pretty and active of the real character and she can express her own feelings very truly. I am very touching after watching it and I think I learn a lot of things in the film. Although the film is based on a kid's book, but it is very suitable for anyone . I think all of you will be entertained by it and I want to present the film to all of you."
"jordan-trevino","6","1","2","9 December 2006"," Narnia is sugar-coated ""White-man's Burden""
","...First of all, Narnia is a world of animals. Being devoid of humans, it can be understood as the idealized realm of the natural, despite being nothing but fantasy. What is interesting, is that the natural is not conceived as mere existence, but rather presupposes a certain moral value-system. CS Lewis thus is able to take his morality and paint it onto the idea of nature. He therefore justifies his beliefs by embedding them into the firmament of existence in a fictionalized world. The animals of Narnia are therefore divided into good and badÂ—and this world is wrought by a moral battle between the good lion and the evil witch.<br/><br/>The entry of the four children is something like the ""white man's burden"". The four are somehow fated by the scripture of some manifest destiny in the prophecy to overthrow the evil witch and save the natural kingdom. What is even more perverse is the superimposition of British schemes of royalty and nobility onto the scene, echoing the arguments of ""divine right"" of old...<br/><br/>For more: themeasure.blogspot.com, Where I wrote this critique entitled Latent Ideology in Entertainment"

","The tragic reality of our time is that people don't read books and don't like to be challenged. The greatness of Lewis's books were their commitment to hard realities and the strength of hope when it is not sugar-coated.<br/><br/>This film was made for modern Americans. No surprise there. But Lewis's books were written for a far wider audience.<br/><br/>As deviating as Peter Jackson's films were, at least they were entertaining in their own right. This was just boring fluff. The actors have a self-consciousness in their performance that is as bad as the self-consciousness that poisons modern American integrity. Mr. Tumnus was always one my favorite characters from the books. But here he is a weak fool with no convincing heart. I think many fans expected the professor to be more like Lewis himself. One good scene was when the Lucy is staring into the fire while listening to Tumnus's flute and she sees the figures dancing in the flames. They would have to make the whole film in that manner if they even wanted to come close to the spirit of Lewis's books. While in the theatre I sat next to a boy probably four years old. He was completely bored, jumping around, kicking the seat in front of him. During the fire scene, he suddenly became completely still and was utterly enthralled.<br/><br/>The child knew."

During World War II, a family of four children are sent to live with professor, little do they know this was the beginning of a unforgettable event. Based on a book by C.S. Lewis the Chronicles of Narnia takes you in an astonishing venture with Lucy, Edmond, Susie and Peter Pevensie, staying in this new house must abide to many rules; not touching, no yelling and especially to leave the professor alone. With all these regulations instituted the Pevensies still find many loopholes, during one of there games Lucy the smallest girl saunters into the wardrobe and is whisked into a different world. A snowy paradise, upon meeting Mr. Tumnus, a half human faun, she is kidnapped, yet upon her escape she makes her way back home. Edmond the second youngest stumbles upon this wonderland and meets the cause of all the troubles, the white witch, she befriends Edmund using some of his favorite food and offers him the position of king if he were to bring back the rest of his family. Eventually all four children walk into the terrain of Narnia and hear the background story from a friendly beaver about a prophecy, a king named Aslan and an army that could defeat the white witch. With the help from many creatures and witty plays, the kids start to bring spring back to Narnia and weaken the powers of the white witch. With an army of mystical creatures, talking animals and magical weapons the two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve go into battle to fulfill the prophecy, but do they succeed? I give this film 3 out of 4 'davids.' This is a movie to enjoy with everyone, the scenes were magnificent, the story line is amazing, plus the battle scenes are glorious and they didn't even use blood, this is a must see movie!

","Fairly bland and sanitized attempt at an epic, which has some beautiful landscapes and interesting characters, but not much else. Some pretty terrible performances from the kid actors, and some truly crappy CGI for the various woodland creatures. Some scenes are kinda cool, but, for the most part, they're far too childish and boring. I mean, Santa Claus giving them weapons? You've gotta be kidding me. And the final battle scene is so poorly executed that's it's barely exciting or even interesting. Still, the production design is top-notch, and it never feels boring or overtly preachy (though I could clearly make out the thinly veiled Christian symbolism). Overall, simply mediocre."

Then a (too) brilliant idea emerges as he plants it in the ice as if in butter, foreseeing the coming surfing ride. Gosh it's so ludicrous....

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","10 July 2006"," We need more movies like this, except even better ones.
","What begins as a cheesy Disney movie rich in terrible one-liners and bad CGI (the beavers were unforgivable) turns into a great spectacle of fantasy cinema some 30-40 minutes into the film. While everything after Lord of the Rings in terms of epic battles feels half-assed and, frankly inadequate, The Chronicles of Narnia does a good job at establishing a true 'heroic' feeling with our main characters toward the end and the recipe for fantasy is accurately followed. I think we need much more fantasy movies out there and now that the 21th century has opened with blockbusters of its nature, there will hopefully be more like this.<br/><br/>My only big problem with the film was the little girl playing Lucy Pevensie. For those of you who aren't familiar with the story, Lucy is the youngest in the foursome of siblings that the plot centres on. They are the ones to enter the wardrobe that takes them to the world of Narnia; they are the heroes in a quest for Aslan. Lucy is made into some kind of prodigal heroine who dominates the course of events; she is rude, snappy and badly acted. This little brat is the most annoying character I've seen since Jar-Jar Binks. She shouldn't have been in Narnia at all - they should have left her the wardrobe and locked her up. Anna Popplewell who plays her older sister Susan, on the other hand, is excellent. It may well be that she is just average and that the rest of the cast are really poor (they are just kids, after all) - but whatever the reason, she is the one thing that kept me watching Narnia at the beginning when it was at its worst.<br/><br/>Visually, everything except the beavers were handled nicely and for a children's movie, this wasn't bad. Charismatic actors like Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson certainly helped things along the way, making this into a worthile adventure. 7/10"

It is like comparing Alien vs. Lassie. <br/><br/>Perhaps 140 minutes just wasn't enough. Things seemed to happen too fast but it is always problem when making books into films. Still I think that this could have been done much better. All warmth and emotion of the original story was gone.

","It has taken some time but finally, the right time and film came along to mark my 200th film review. I had bought this for my Better Half for her birthday in April but we hadn't watched it until today, when we shared a lazy Sunday morning in bed together. Having fond memories of the BBC TV adaptation in the Eighties, I had high hopes for this. It also seems determined to mimic another recent fantasy outing filmed in New Zealand and one that I enjoyed from start to finish. But while ""The Lord Of The Rings"" has a more adult feel to it, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" is strictly aimed at younger viewers and has a more kiddie-friendly feel than Peter Jackson's stunning trilogy.<br/><br/>The first ""Chronicle Of Narnia"" focuses on the four Pevensie children Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, Anna Popplewell and William Moseley respectively) who are evacuated during the Second World War to the home of a reclusive professor (Jim Broadbent). During a game of Hide And Seek, Lucy discovers a strange wardrobe which leads to the white wintry world of Narnia. Before long, they are all caught up in a titanic clash for the future of Narnia between the dark forces of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and the amassed armies of Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). Can they all survive the battle ahead, especially when it appears that there is a traitor in their midst? <br/><br/>As if further proof were required, New Zealand is the place to go for shooting films with jaw-dropping scenes of snow-capped mountains and rich, lush forests. And, as ""Lord Of The Rings"" also proved, CG creatures have come a long way since Jar Jar Binks. From Aslan to Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy), each and every creature looks fantastic and believable. Sadly, there are moments when there are slight gaps in the CG sheen where it becomes apparent that characters are stood in front of a green screen instead of a beautiful sun-drenched valley. Make-up and costumes are also of an extremely high standard as are the performances of the four main actors. Henley is probably the best of the four, proving to be the equal of her older contemporaries.<br/><br/>The problem this film has is mainly one of pacing. Whereas ""Lord Of The Rings"" has the luxury of spreading itself out over three massive films (and still not get everything in), ""The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"" has to cram everything in during its 140 minute duration and it sometimes feels rushed or like it doesn't have time to explain things - for example, it never explains that you don't find your way into Narnia if you're looking for it. It is also trying too hard to be ""Lord Of The Rings"" - thrown in Gandalf and you'd honestly never know the difference. And while I agree that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, director Andrew ""Shrek"" Adamson displays precious little imagination when it comes to telling this story which is a shame, given the vivid imagination of the original author, C.S. Lewis. But while this is basically Diet ""Lord Of The Rings"", this is still a fantastic film and one which tells this classic tale better than it ever has before. It's bright and thrilling and exactly what a children's adventure movie should be. Don't wait until you've hit 200 movies - go and get the special edition DVD and treat the kids."

It seemed to me that there was a time when one movie after another was made to depress and criticize everything ... as if there was an overall conspiracy of negativity that anything good is bad. And if you dared to make a movie that was about the good qualities in people, then you were ostracized by the industry.<br/><br/>It seems to me that now that time is over. With such wonderful entertainment going on in this past decade (Shrek, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings - all three powerful solid movies each in their own right - etc etc) the movie industry has finally got it right. Make the movies you want - the ones that sell, the ones that don't - the ones that entertain the ones that don't. People will still flock to see them - b/c they are the movies."
"angry-man","6","1","2","21 May 2006"," Not bad, but not great.
","I was a big fan of the Narnia book series when I was a kid and it was not without some skepticism that I went into the theater to see this, the first big-screen incarnation, of the series. That said, I rather enjoyed this adaptation by director Andrew Adamson - who interestingly enough is a native New Zealander like Peter Jackson of ""Lord of The Rings Fame"" and considerable fortune;) Is there is something in the picturesque rolling landscapes of New Zealand that just imbues filmmakers with the passion and drive to see such large scale endeavors realized? Who can say. In any event, Adamson's previous co-directing credits for the wildly popular ""Shrek"" & ""Shrek 2"" and a strong background in visual effects were surely helped in landing him this gig on what has become (if I'm not mistaken, the most successful blockbuster of 2005). Young Georgie Henley sometimes stealing the show with her portrayal of little ""Lucy Pevensie"" and Skandar Keynes as her brother ""Edmund"" is also quite well cast and fills this the most dynamic role of the film quite convincingly. Anna Popplewell and William Moseley are adequately cast as ""Lucy"" and ""Peter"" respectively but are out-shined (and perhaps rightly so) by the performances of their afore-mentioned younger colleagues. Tilda Swinton as ""The White Witch"" is flawless: cold and menacing as I remember from the book. Indeed her introductory scene as she seduces young Edmund is quite a memorable moment in the film. Look for a good voice performance by Liam Neeson as the omnipresent ""Aslam"" as well.<br/><br/>The setting in the film are about as epic and sumptuous as you'd expect, shot in locations ranging from New Zealand to Poland, and the visual effects, while not flawless are generally satisfactory and the scale of the battle is certainly well realized. Of particular noteworthiness are some of the great creature designs by make-up artist Greg Nicotero (it's nice to see that Adamson had the good sense not go with CGI for everything).<br/><br/>On the flip side, though, the pacing for the flick lags a bit and in the end, though I enjoyed the film, it's tough for me to say whether it really captured Lewis' world and characters quite as I remembered it, but then it's been ages since I've read any of those books;) So get out there and give Disney more money why don't you? It's certainly a film that benefits from being seen on the big screen."

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great fantasy/family/action film, it is very flawed, mostly through the direction and performances of the four central children, the timing was also a little off. We already had several good fantasy action and even family films out this year such as, Batman Begins, Robots, War of the Worlds, King Kong, Star Wars 3, Harry Potter 4. That is simply too many of this kind of film in one year to fully appreciate them all. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is second rate to most of these films, the effects to King Kong, and War of the Worlds, and all around to King Kong, and Batman Begins.

C.S. Lewis meant for an epic adventure filled with amazement and extraordinary visuals, which the film seems to deliver there, but it lacks in some respects.<br/><br/>The actors used for the main roles of the children were not impressive, and were rather lacking in various respects. As for the animation of the assortment of beasts, that was by far, spectacular. The storyline is very generic, and you can tell that it's meant for a wide array of viewers. With the storyline being so general, you miss out on the important details and the reasoning, and are pretty much blatantly told the how's and when's. The basics are definitely there, but it's not a ""Lord of the Rings"" when it comes to detail, which I think could've improved the overall outlook of the film.<br/><br/>The movie, though widely thought of as a biblical reference, is sparingly that. The book, however, definitely is a inspirational and reflective portrayal of various stories and ideals from the Bible. The movie is pretty easy to interpret and without the detail as mentioned above, you don't get the same feel when it comes to the metaphorical and representation that C.S.

As for the special effects, they're nothing to write home about. I guess the kids will enjoy the movie, but I do prefer other fantasy movies that are less pretentious and much more exciting (just like ""Neverending story"", ""Willow""). <br/><br/>The best things in ""narnia"" are the expresiveness of the girl who plays Lucy, and the talking animals (those effects are really something). Just an ordinary movie... all talk.<br/><br/>*My rate: 5/10"
"patlightfoot","10","1","2","6 March 2006"," Best film this year.
","From someone who was born during the second world war in England, I loved it. I have never read the book, so can't comment on its adaptation to the big screen. But to me, the screenplay really was wonderful and magical. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD, because I will buy it. <br/><br/>I just felt the lion symbolized the British struggle against the Nazis. But a literature scholar said C.S.Lewis' original book was more involved in the negative effect of Christianity? I can't comment but besides the cinematography overall I felt I could watch it many times. Although I felt it would attract the young at heart just as well (possibly more) as a junior audience.<br/><br/>I am glad it was award an Oscar for Makeup, and would have liked it to have earned a few more nominations, etc.<br/><br/>I think it will become a classic. So I hope Walt Disney will release it on video/DVD a lot quicker than they did Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>Pat"
"hawksburn","2","1","2","27 February 2006"," The Lord of the Weak...
","To compare this to Lord Of The Rings would be wrong because as far as comparisons go this pales. Comparing this to Labyrinth or Krull would be fairer. <br/><br/>Where LOTR had strong characters and deep story threads we get some of the weakest child-actors ever in a movie perfectly suited to the least demanding 10 year old.<br/><br/>Where LOTR had a sense of dread and darkness, Narnia gives us no more menace than an overacting Tilda Swinton and some not very well realized cgi wolves.<br/><br/>Where LOTR gave us a world that seemed real and lived in Narnia gives us the castle from Walt Disney World and a land too perfectly groomed. Where LOTR gave us heroes to believe in, Narnia makes so many missteps that we care little about the fates of the characters before us.<br/><br/>I loved the Narnia books as a child, but I've come to a realization that they're children's books. They haven't grown with me as an adult unlike the Harry Potter series for instance which have cleverly grown darker with every new release as its dedicated audience gets older. The Narnia stories are simple stories, tho they do possess great moments of pathos which unfortunately weren't realized very well in the visualisation. Witness Aslans sacrifice as a huge missed opportunity for the viewer to connect with the journey. Because they are simple children's stories we know that the world won't be as gritty & dirty as the world of Middle Earth, but we're disappointed still when we see it. <br/><br/>While the books may still retain a sense of wonder, this movie does nothing to convey it. LOTR set the bar extremely high for fantasy movies, Narnia attempts to lower it back to where it was again.<br/><br/>In one word: Drivel."
"reid-brown","10","1","2","15 February 2006"," Are they still allowed to make films like this?
","I have just seen this film long after the hype and having read almost nothing about it - I have to say that this is the most overwhelming experience I have ever had in the Cinema. I wouldn't have expected it to affect other people in the same way but apparently it does.<br/><br/>It got to me because I grew up in England in the sixties (actually living next door to Lucy Barfield, the dedicatee of the original novel and of course the one after whom the youngest character is named) and I saw the last of that England that the picture captures so well in the opening scenes. I can promise you that those sparky and plucky English children we are presented with really were like that. And as for the evocation in those early scenes  the London Station, the Country Railway, the Professor's House  one wants to applaud even the aging and distribution of the objects in the rooms. The Mother saying goodbye to them at the station was a proper mother from those times, the fleeting expression on the face of the guard seeing the evacuee children off was a gentle English expression of the type that Orwell wrote about  this sort of attention to detail amounts to genius.<br/><br/>James McAvoy's charming and ridiculously moving Tumnus makes a perfect introduction to the land of Narnia, and the interplay between him and the wonderful little actress who plays Lucy is a joy to behold. And then we are into this story of Good and Evil, and it is made absolutely clear, in the true spirit of Lewis, that Good and Evil underlies the Deeper Magic and that there can be no compromise between them. Which is why I think the film has been so successful. These pukka English protagonists, of the type now routinely portrayed in films as sneering, rapacious, bigoted, you name it  show a true spirit of courage, humour, honour, loyalty, and courtesy which I am sure international audiences from wherever respond to deep down, but have been deprived of for so long.<br/><br/>So congratulations to all involved  congratulations to William Moseley for being indeed Prince Peter the Magnificent. Congratulations to New Zealand Director Andrew Adamson for demonstrating true Cinematic Genius of the type that conceals the hand of the maker -as opposed to the officially acknowledged Genii who are known only by their surnames  Kubrick, Scorsese, Hitchcock  and whose identities are immediately obvious after one scene."
"derekmcmillan","Null","1","2","12 February 2006"," Tilda Swinton
","Tilda Swinton is brilliant in the role of the Queen of Narnia and her make-up artist and costume designer deserve Oscars at least.<br/><br/>She has just the right tone of seduction and unpleasantness in her dealings with Edmund and her voice and facial expression are just spot on all the time. She has by far the best role of course.<br/><br/>Lewis put this female figure with bare shoulders at the centre of the story and it is interesting that he tends to like seductive female characters as his villains. He lived in an all-male society and had a very ambiguous attitude towards women.<br/><br/>As a child (and this is the spoiler!) I was disappointed with the part of the book which was based on Christian mythology. I was impressed and saddened by Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund. This was not least because that sort of thing did not happen in children's' books very often. Then when it turns out he knew all along that deep magic would bring him back to life it seemed a cheat.<br/><br/>I wonder how many children locked themselves in wardrobes after watching this film! Overall a magnificent spectacle at the heart of which was Tilda Swinton's haunting performance - brilliant."
"ninja_superstar-1","3","1","2","11 February 2006"," Weepie, manipulative, pro-war ""kid's"" movie.
","When we first see Narnia, it's through the eyes of a cute little girl and a wondrous creature named Mr. Tumnus. I thought, this looks like a sweet kid's movie. But C.S. Lewis does not stop with providing an environment like Narnia where a child's mind is free to roam. No, instead children are thrust into a war movie that teaches about divisiveness, that diplomacy does not work, and likens Jesus to a magical lion. It was too much for me to swallow, and I would never expose my children to such drivel. And could they find a prettier, Aryan-looking boy to play the part of Peter? Good special effects though."
"tralston555","10","1","2","6 February 2006"," Great movie
","Excellent movie! For all of you C.S. Lewis enthusiasts out there, this movie really portrays in large measure what one feels reading his book. I was afraid that certain themes or motifs wouldn't be conveyed correctly or respected, but the actors and production team did a wonderful job. You'll instantly love the characters and turn to the movie again and again! Can't wait for the new movie, Prince Caspian, to come out. If you liked this movie, check out Shadowlands with Anthony Hopkins as C.S. Lewis. I know it's not exactly like the play, but they still do a go job. Some of C.S. Lewis other books that are just brilliant are Mere Christianity, the Screwtape Letters, and the Great Divorce. The titles do not always give away what's inside, so make sure to check them out."

","A wonderfully adapted movie for a good book. True it's not the same, but purists need to get over it. After all, not every book to film adaption can please everyone.<br/><br/>One of the major things that I loved was how much more alive Aslan was than he was in the BBC productions. He captured all the spender that he had in the book. The BBC's stiff puppet and monotone voice really disappointed me before.<br/><br/>The music and the acting were amazing! Except for the minor changes, the movie was the book. Just as I'd pictured it.

"lordshaneez","3","1","2","3 February 2006"," A Let Down...
","I had my expectations high when I went to watch Narnia as I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and I enjoyed Harry Potter too equally. But Narnia was a total let down. Maybe it was my expectations, but I believe I wouldn't like it otherwise too.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia is the adaptation of the classic by C.S Lewis. T.C.O.N tells the story of four ordinary children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie. They discover that a professor's wardrobe leads to the magical land of Narnia, and help to save it from the evil White Witch. They are helped in their quest by Aslan the Lion and several other creatures. The tale culminates in an epic battle against the forces of the witch.<br/><br/>The movie fails to keep the audience glued to their seats as the pace gets very slow in between. There are a lot of flaws in the direction and the dialogues are also sub-standard most of the time. But the directors have done an excellent job with the special effects and character make-up. The background score is excellent too, but played at the wrong time/scenes. A little more of editing would have probably helped the movie better.<br/><br/>Anna Popplewell & Georgie Henley have portrayed the characters of Susan & Lucy excellently. The boys have done a fair job too, especially Skandar Keynes who plays the role of Edmund Pevensie. I don't need to mention Tilda Swanton as she is already a great actress and she has done her job well.<br/><br/>Overall the movie would be probably enjoyed by children, but it fails to impress the adult audience unlike the Harry Potter series which is a children's movie but also equally enjoyed by all class of movie-goers."
"timashoe","10","1","2","2 February 2006"," Follows the book!!!
","This movie followed the book so well. I fell in love with little Georgie Henley from the start, feeling that she did an excellent job of portraying Lewis' Lucy. Mr. Tumnus was a delight, his character pulling together the movie from beginning to end. Aslan was all that I had hoped for and more (still having been shell-shocked from the BBC puppet years earlier). The White Witch was satisfyingly chilling and majestic, and I disliked her through and through when the movie was done. The set was incredible, and the battle scene very well done. The sweeping panorama was breath-taking. Best of all, this movie was one that you could take even small children to see without having to lean over to cover their eyes and ears - no blood, no gore, excellent message, and not corny or cheesy like some other 'good message' movies. Well done!"

","I'd recommend this movie to anybody who is looking for a good family type movie.<br/><br/>The actors in this were fabulous. I agree with Skander that the witch would give Voldemort a bad time. Aslan was great, the kids were all great actors and everything in the movie clicked. I've seen it 4 times and plan to see it many more. I was particularly taken with the excellent job done by ""Mr. Tumnus"" (can't remember his name now), and by all four of the kids. <br/><br/>I wonder how many people know that many children were sent out of the cities during the blitz and many of them were never reunited with their families. I knew one in Australia whose family were evidently killed and he stayed there. <br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were especially good, and I think some of the scenes are actually better than ""The Lord Of The Rings"". <br/><br/>Again, I'd advise you to take the time to see this great movie."

I felt that this movie persistently tried to show what was written in the book not carefully considering the natural flow of the story. People who are fans of this book might have known every detail and backgrond story of every scence when they were watching. Even after the end of the film, i wasn't convinced to believe that Narnia had its unique style and story.

"jeanninerouse","10","1","2","25 January 2006"," Refreshing and unique. The conflicts of good and evil are there in all their glory. But this movie of Narnia gives them fascination, without complication!
","I am perplexed by all the hoopla about comparing the central figure in ""Narnia"" to Christ. Both Christians, and anti-Christians, seem to be 'Up in Arms'. Nonsense. Do they want to discredit ""Tale of Two Cities"", ""Billy Bud"", etc. too? <br/><br/>Christianity did not invent self-sacrifice any more than Virgin Birth (Confucius and Zoroaster are credited with virgin mothers) or a celebration around Dec. 25th (before Christ it was and still is to many, Winter Solstice). It would be wonderful if people would try to stop giving credit for good plots to some religion or another. Don't they think writers have any imaginations of their own?"

I was not disappointed in the least by this film. I thought the casting was brilliant and the kids did a terrific job as the Pevensie's, (A.K.A. the kings and queens of Narnia). I would recommend this movie to everyone, (I am definitely going to see it again) and especially to those of you who always feel that a book is better than the movie it is made into, you will not be disappointed!

I was bored during all the film. There are no depth of characters, almost no interrelations between them. There are no background stories that movie is telling other than main story. And why Aslan is so important we don't know (maybe it is explained in the book but it would be nice if they explained in movie yes there are some clues but they are simply not enough)<br/><br/>But there are some surprises for me which are seeing Turkish delights in movie and lion named Aslan (Aslan means lion in Turkish) <br/><br/>I dunno if i were 12 maybe i would like this movie but now it is just a piece of crap."

"escheps","3","1","2","23 January 2006"," A flat, tedious movie although visually beautiful.
","Although the movie is visually beautiful and quite true to the book, it is also very flat--lacking excitement and timing. I found it very tedious and I had really looked forward to seeing it. There were too many sudden transitions (for instance, the children going to battle in medieval dress). Characters that might have been extremely interesting were barely presented (the professor, the housekeeper) and the animal characters were reminiscent of cartoon characters in their delivery (making their interaction with the actors very superficial. The children, on the other hand, gave delightful performances although they were not given much to work with dramatically. It is hard to know if the script was superficial or the direction was lacking tension and drama--perhaps the fault lies with both."
"drk150","8","1","2","21 January 2006"," Fun ride, but not enough development to be very emotionally moving.
","This movie should have been longer, or perhaps a series. I simply didn't think there was enough development to justify the battle at the end. I understand that if you've read the book, you have a deeper understanding of what's going on and what the character's motivations are, but a film has to stand on its own, and not rely on previous knowledge of the viewer to work. In the world of the book, the children have reasons to stay in Narnia and contribute to events there, but in the world of the movie I think they would have left once they got Edmund back from the White Witch. Narnia and its citizens just didn't seem real enough or important enough for the children to want to stay and help at their own risk. Perhaps the inevitable sequels will help fill in gaps.<br/><br/>Also, we're not given much time to meet some of the important characters. People are just tossed onto the screen with no introduction, development, or motivation, which makes it hard to invest in them emotionally and pull for them in the battle.<br/><br/>The production quality was great, Aslan was very believable, which is a necessity for the film to be a success. All of the other special effects and sets were seamlessly executed, so the viewer can be drawn into the story instead of being distracted by thinking ""how'd they do that and why didn't it look better?""<br/><br/>All of the actors do a good job, despite being given a few cheesy lines. Each of the children has the right character traits that define their roles. If I were about 10 years old I probably would have thought this movie was spectacular, but as an adult I just need a little more substance before we dive into the epic battle. Maybe I'm just not a member of the target audience."
"Geomapboy2","10","1","2","17 January 2006"," Amazingly Accurate adaptation of C.S. Lewis's masterpiece
","When I saw Narnia, I was amazed by the movie's cinematography. Everyone who has read the book knows that C.S. Lewis was great friends with J.R.R. Tolkein of LOTR fame. Narnia is one of those family friendly films that looks at the struggle of good versus evil.<br/><br/>When the film opens, the Battle of Britain is in progress. A few scenes later, we meet the Pevensie children; Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, who are portrayed marvelously by William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, and Georgie Henley. By the order of prime Minister Winston Churchill, all children must be evacuated from London. While the credits roll, we see the Pevensie children board a train at King's Cross Station and taken away into the English Countryside. They are sent to the house of a professor who has strict rules for the Pevensie children.<br/><br/>One day while playing Hide and Seek, Lucy uncovers a wardrobe and wanders into a mystical land called Narnia. She soon discovers that there is a war between the armies of the white witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton) and the armies of the Narnain king, Aslan the lion (voiced by Liam Neeson). A few scenes later Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe and is confronted by Jadis. During the movie, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy are announced that they are the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve. Peter becomes a leader in Aslan's army and Edmund is imprisoned by Jadis, the self proclaimed Queen of Narnia. He is later rescued by Aslan. Aslan forgives the sins of the children before he is put to death by Jadis. A battle between good and evil is about to take place to determine who will rule Narnia.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is one of the best Disney Films ever. This movie deserves a perfect ********** stars."
"dkeymer-1","7","1","2","16 January 2006"," Worth Seeing, With Some Reservations
","Narnia is exceptionally well filmed. The four Pevensies are arguably the most beautiful family of young children you'll see in any movie. Tilda Swinton is awesome as the Ice Queen. She combines stunning beauty with ferocious will in the role. Jim Broadbent has a small --very small-- role in the film. <br/><br/>The computer animation is head and shoulders above any I've seen before, especially the beaver husband and wife. The majestic lion Aslan is impressive as are the fauns, centaurs, trolls and ogres who swell the ranks of the armies of the Good and the Evil. Only the wolves' mouths when they speak don't quite make it. <br/><br/>Having praised the actors and computer actors, and adding that the sets are stunning and the climactic battle scene good, let me state what's wrong with the movie. It is faithful -- more faithful than I would have expected in a two-hour-plus movie, to C. S. Lewis's novel. And that's the problem, because Lewis's novel, no matter how revered as a children's ""classic,"" is flawed both as fiction and as theology. <br/><br/>In the novel, you can skim past the pages where Santa Claus appears, with his flowing white locks and dressed in Victorian red-plush coat and boots, riding a sleigh with a full complement of reindeers in front, to give the Pevensie children their gifts, gifts which will prove crucial in confronting the dangers ahead of them. In the movie, you can't get away from how odd this scene looks juxtaposed with what goes on around it. It teeters on the brink of mawkish, and it strikes me as the type of scene an old-ladyish Oxford don might well have appreciated over fifty years ago. <br/><br/>More disturbing is the equation of the lion Aslam with Christ. It's bad theology. Aslam does not have the relation with his followers that Christ had with his: Aslam's are his subjects and like it or not, he's a warlord, at least until the Great Battle is fought and won. Aslam also does not have the relation with God that Christ had. He isn't God's son, he's a lion. He's the King of the Beasts, more in line with pagan wood gods of the Romans or Druids than with Christian deities or semi-deities. <br/><br/>But, oh my, are those children adorable and boy, do the animal scenes make it, and wow, is Tilda Swinton hot --and a good actress too. So, all in all, Chronicles is well worth seeing. <br/><br/>It's just not worth believing in."

","*cries* Okay, I'm just getting over its longer stay at number one.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most beautiful fantasies I've ever saw. It sort of surprises me though that it was PG. Near the end, there was a large battle riddled with mythical creatures and animals killing other mythical creatures and animals. In it, one of the siblings almost dies. There are many intense moments. The White Witch is the cruelest PG movie villain I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Some may argue it rips of LoTR but I say it's similar but different. So what if it was, like LotR, filmed in New Zealand and props were made by WETA? The acting was just marvelous, especially the four siblings, Imelda Stinton, and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan.<br/><br/>If you loved LotR, then you should definitely check this movie out."
"balata787","3","1","2","15 January 2006"," Confusing
","*There is a spoiler in this review* The best thing about the whole movie was the CG. It was extremely well done and looked great, actively drawing you into this fantasy world. Besides that though, I really did not enjoy this movie. At 2 1/2 hours it seemed to drag on too long, yet it also didn't seem to really give you the full context of the story. For instance, the children are told that they are part of a prophecy that declares they are to lead the people of Narnia to victory in a great battle. The children all hear this and prepare for battle, while barely even questioning if they should risk their lives for these people they don't know. I feel like there should have been more resistance to this proposition before they just marched into battle. Although this really doesn't say anything about the movie as a whole, the little girl who played Lucy (Georgie Henley) scared me a little. She looks quite odd with her big grin, and every time she was on screen, I felt someone annoyed. Anyways, overall Narnia is a great visual feet, but the story feels rushed, yet still long. I really don't know how this movie is getting above a 7 right now, because to me it was painful."

","It's been a while since I last read the book, so I can't say how true to the book it is... but I absolutely loved the old version of this, so when I watched it the first time, I was comparing it the whole time. Which is why I saw it again, and it just took me away! The film starts with the devastation of the Blitz in 1940. Very quickly it moves on into Narnia, and how all 4 children eventually come to enter that world. The children learn their purpose in Narnia, and although they have their doubts about it, they travel across the land to meet the great Aslan and defeat the White Witch.<br/><br/>Like I say, the film moves very quickly to begin with. There's not much (if any) unnecessary speech, or slow moving shots to fall asleep to. When the children are in Narnia, the story still moves fairly quickly, keeping you interested. Unlike the old version, I felt there was a constant chase from when they left the Beavers' house right up until they get to Aslan's camp. Being an action fan, this kept my eyes fixed on the screen! Aslan was portrayed very majestically, with a voice of someone who really cares, but with a roar so powerful that if you were really there you'd be shaking! The final battle made me think instantly of the likes of 'Braveheart', yet is was filmed in such a way that you can see how brutal battles are, but without showing any blood or gore, so that kids can enjoy the film as well.<br/><br/>To ignore the Christian themes in the book would do it injustice. The film showed these themes, neither making light work of them, nor pushing them 'in your face' as it were. Anyone who has a small understanding of who Jesus is will see these themes, and can ponder them in their own time, but kids can easily watch the film and take it purely as a great adventure story of good overcoming evil.<br/><br/>This film is far better than the old one (although the old one is still great!), and anyone can enjoy it. If you are not wanting to watch it because of the Christian themes in it, then watch it as an adventure film (like 'Willow'). This really is a masterpiece, with a fantastic soundtrack to accompany it!"
"CoyoteDancer50","8","1","2","13 January 2006"," Excellent rendition of the story
","This movie is an accurate, loving portrayal of CS Lewis' book. It is a child's story, sweet, loving, not too complex and altogether charming. I found the production quality to be quite good, some very nice battle scenes and tense moments that worked well for dramatic contrast to the pretty basic good versus evil mythology, and I thought the White Witch was particularly well portrayed without being overwrought. She was quite chilling (no pun intended). Overall I highly recommend this movie for anyone, but especially those of us who have always loved CS Lewis's classic series. As a final note, I'm not Christian, was not raised Christian, and I didn't find any specific-only-to-Christianity jarring elements. The sacrifice and rebirth of the hero Aslan is a mythological theme that has been common to many fables and religions from all over the world. I believe anyone of any faith (and those of us who do not belong to any particular religion) would find this movie quite enjoyable for exactly what it is...a charming children's story."
"superratty-tmy","Null","1","2","12 January 2006"," A Chronicle of Mediocrity in the Making?
","The Chronicles of Narnia...<br/><br/>One of 2005's highly anticipated movies, Narnia chronicles the adventure of four siblings during wartime Britain who stumble through a wardrobe into the land of Narnia, where they end up fighting alongside Aslan the Lion against the evil doings of the White Witch.<br/><br/>There are two ways of seeing this film, from my perspective. Firstly, let me put it positively. I made a comment to my friend when I came out of the cinema, ""When I came out of the cinema after watching Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, I was vomiting blood due to watching a complete cinematic disaster. I came out of Narnia thinking, 'ok, not bad.'"" It's not a bad film. But it's not a great film either. There is a certain barrier that Andrew Adamson seem to be unable to lift the film above it. Many of the cinematic sequence are deserving of wows and pows, like the build-up to the final battle, where the eagles soared and the animals charged. The animation of the beavers, and the other animals, were close to perfection.<br/><br/>But there was magic missing. Narnia felt very much like a frayed edge of a beautiful portrait. It just wasn't smooth enough, or great enough. It left me wanting more. A good example of the same feeling would be Bryan Singer's first installment of X-Men. The film made me want more, and unsatisfied. But X2 built up from it nicely and turned out to be one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>So perhaps Narnia can build on this film. It's not a bad foundation, and if Harry Potter can slowly improve over the years (Goblet of Fire, the 4th installment, is pretty good), Narnia certainly has a greater potential to do even better.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>(this show didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects)"
"althaia","9","1","2","11 January 2006"," Fantastic
","This film is excellent, but just so people who don't bother to read books don't sound ignorant to those of us who do, ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" is actually the second book in the Narnia chronicles, so no there won't be seven movies made unless the directors decide a prequel ""The Magician's Nephew"" is in order.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see ""The Magician's Nephew"" made as it is the beginning of the series and explains why Aslan has such power in Narnia, how Narnia was created, why the Professor believes Lucy's story and why the wardrobe grants access to Narnia.<br/><br/>Otherwise, though, the film is excellent with a soundtrack which, although a little clichÃ© at times, is otherwise moving and fairly well placed throughout the action. The costumes, particularly for the White Witch, are fantastic and the special effects are well blended with reality, avoiding that unfortunate trend to add unnecessary effects.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie for anyone who has read Narnia and loved it and even for those who haven't, since the script doesn't rely on prior knowledge of the book. For those who have seen it, it's worth the sweeties."

","I have just seen this movie and wanted to comment on it. I think that it is a fairly good movie. Not a movie that I HAVE to see again, but still it was good. Narnia is very well made and also all creatures are very nice. I saw this movie with my brother and towards the end of it my brother looked at me and asked me how many times the little girl (Lucy) had been crying. I've given this some thoughts since then and he's actually right about Lucy crying all of the time. The last couple of times she cries in the movie we actually started laughing. Not that it is destroying the movie, but maybe if you see it again you'll notice that she starts to cry many times. Or maybe you have noticed this too...?"

","I loved this movie! It was as good to me, a 37 yr old mother, as it was to my 6 (soon to be 7) yr old son. It also gave me hope that really good family movies are still being made with a passion. Some scenes were so good that I actually teared up. The newcomer child actors in the film were excellent & I see a bright future for them all. I don't recommend the film to children under 5/6 yrs of age due to the horrible villain creatures that were shown to on the side of the ""White Witch"". They were horrible looking & would probably cause nightmares to small children. I just hope the team that put this movie together do it again, because there is a real talent there. This was a beautifully made movie with such emotion that each person who sees it will not be able to help but be touched. I know you all will love it too! GO SEE IT!!!!"
"K_Kuhlemann","6","1","2","9 January 2006"," I was a bit disappointed actually
","Don't know what I was expecting exactly - I think perhaps I would have liked it more if I had read the book as a child as there would be an emotional connection to the story. As it is, I feel the story wasn't strong enough to sustain a full-length feature film. Maybe it is the Lord of the Rings effect... <br/><br/>I thought the children were very pretty, but not very likable - haven't read the book so don't know if they are like that on the page? The eldest children constantly wanting to dash and leave the poor talking critters to face their fate, Edward being horrible... Little Georgia is, of course, all cute and nice. But a whole lot of pointless pouting was taking place, I say. <br/><br/>On the positive side, my son loved it - it sure is a good film for the kiddies. The wardrobe transition scenes are excellent, as are most of the CGI characters and the Narnia landscape."
"derboiler","3","1","2","9 January 2006"," Highly overrated movie for kids
","Oh my gosh- this movie is really totally overrated. I haven't read the books so I can only talk about the movie. First of all it looks like a children's tale which tries to have a bit from Lord of the Rings. It naturally fails completely. The characters are very flat and don't have any substance. The plot itself seemed to be a fast forward version of its original story. That's the only thing I can think of. I really doubt the books are that flat and badly written. As the film is moving very fast to the final battle it looses any bit of atmosphere that might have been created in the beginning. To see these kids swing around swords and fighting in a life or death battle is very dull. I could go some steps further but this would spoil the film. If there is something to spoil at all...<br/><br/>What might be interesting?<br/><br/>Nicely animated fantasy figures A story which is more for kids than adults Beware that there still exist some fighting scenes which may not be suitable for small kids.<br/><br/>Result:<br/><br/>As a movie for children I would give it a 5 but as an adult which has certain expectations of a fantasy movie I can only give it 3/10 points. Very disappointing."

","I thought the movie was fantastic. The animation and computer generated characters were awesome. The visual effects were wonderful. Kept ya on the edge of your seat - caught me off guard a couple of times and I jumped. Shed a few tears as well. Can hardly wait for the next one.The actors/actresses were well suited to the parts they played. Excellent comparative of the Bible. Hopefully it will help keep children focused on the good and not the evil. The wolf pack was very realistic. I loved the beaver couple they were delightful. I was taken aback when the evil queen slapped Edward. However, it did bring home the point that was being made. Evil has no patience its get it right the first time or watch out. Good, like God, has more patience than we can possibly ever hope to possess. God loves us no matter how many times we fail, and is always there to help us through any danger or obstacle."
"luvlightin","9","1","2","9 January 2006"," Awesome! GREAT!
","I would see this again, and again!!! Definitely gonna by this on DVD! The White witch is the creepiest queen i have seen in a long time! She does an excellent job portraying the evil of Narnia. As does the lion portray the goodness in this place. I would definitely recommend this movie for everyone. Small children may find the Lions death a bit much, but if you can keep them watching they'll learn a very important lesson in the end. The other thing that i thought was that the ice effect was really great! The Ice Castel, Frozen river and interaction of the ice and snow with the characters seemed so real. I had no problem believing that everything was covered in snow, ice, and powder frost. Lastly if you get the chance READ THIS BOOK SERIES!!!! It Rocks too."
"rzajac","Null","1","2","9 January 2006"," Allegory blowback and a few other issues, but still worth watching
","Sorry, but I don't have a totally glowing review of Narnia. Given the response among my pals and me here in Taiwan, I'm sort of curious what is going on in the minds of the folks' who check in to post these 20-thumbs-up reviews.<br/><br/>One local response in particular summed it up: One of my buddies said he's getting sort of tired of the relentless barrage of Manichean sensory overload flicks. I can see his point. They may have a cuteness factor to soften them (e.g., cute Hobbits in Ring, or the kids in Narnia), but the big thing now seems to be starkly dualistic fantasy white-hat/black-hat CGI-enhanced action.<br/><br/>That said, I understand that the Narnia books were supposed to be a Christ allegory, and can see the attempt to set forth at least the basic ideas that shape and inform the plot development, especially the one involving Aslan and Edmund.<br/><br/>Before continuing, I should point out I didn't read the Narnia chronicles, though I have read Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, and The Great Divorce. And I've seen both the BBC and American productions of Shadowlands.<br/><br/>It seems that even someone as capable as C.S.Lewis can't recast a sacrifice myth so that it makes sense.<br/><br/>It's going to be interesting to see how American fundamentalists (in particular) will respond to this. When the White Witch refers to the universal moral principle to which even Aslan is bound, won't they flinch at this as a usurpation of God's sovereignty; a kind of ""cosmic muffin"" pantheism? Then the problem enters in that, if the moral principle is truly universal, it applies here on Earth as it does in Narnia. If we can't (and don't) transfer honorary debts here on Earth, how can Aslan take Edmund's lumps for him, romantic though it may seem in a parallel universe, in living color, and on the big screen? And, to the best of my knowledge, these elements are the crux of the prevailing Christ myth espoused by most folks that call themselves Christian. In general, the net effect of the scenarios with a spiritual payload suggest to me more of a Hindu/Buddhist message e.g., where the illusory treats the White Witch manufactures for Edmund are the Hindu ""maya."" Moving on, a few more observations.<br/><br/>Other commenters have kudos for the kids' acting, but I remember the palpable relief I felt when Jim Broadbent hit the screen, and I got to see a little *real* acting for a change. The kids were OK, but really that's all. Well, perhaps except for Edmund's character (see below).<br/><br/>I thought Peter's character transition was mismanaged. He starts out as this hapless kid with a dazzling sword thrust into his hands and then suddenly is supposed to be a formidable foe to enraged, strapping, battle-hardened, armor-encrusted, chimerical beasts. Perhaps this is where my unfamiliarity with the original books has me at a loss; it may be that Lewis more carefully crafts this transition, and makes it more believable. Perhaps this was a tricky thing to engineer in the screen writing, so they just hoped the viewer would obligingly bridge the gap. Well, it sort of stuck out for me, so there you have it.<br/><br/>Much else in the movie is great. I really liked the way Tumnus the faun was understated; nicely directed and acted. The sets were fantastic, both in Narnia and Earthside. The music was good, though I didn't care for the selection that ran during the opening sequences/credits; that blockbuster-requisite one-style-fits-all guaranteed heartstring-tugger sound felt out of place for the period and situation; no doubt the product of a session between the producers and industry consultants. It sort of started me off with a bad taste in my ear. Too bad! You'd think I wouldn't care for the heavily produced images, but they were so very, very well done that they generally didn't feel ""imposed."" Excepting the allegory blowback issue mentioned above, a lot of the story and character development is great. I love Edmund; he's a great character, and his contrast with the other characters gives a great illustration of venality, and makes that love that accepts him and shepherds him to a better spiritual place all that much more deep and truly loving. His character was well directed and acted, especially in light of the fact that it was so difficult.<br/><br/>OK, enough for now. Thanks for reading."

I have seen it 5 times and I will see it as many more as I can! Narnia is not just for children. It can be for anyone who opens his heart to the magic and lets himself be swept away into a fantastical land as a wide-eyed and innocent child. Every aspect of this movie was absolutely dead-on. I read the books as a child and initially didn't believe the movie could live up to my expectations, but it passed with flying colors. I especially was able to appreciate the Christian allegory now that I am older, and it was perfect. Costumes=Perfect. Visual Effects=Perfect. Musical Score=Perfect & Vitally Important! Acting=Perfect. All of it was perfect. The young actors were especially amazing! :) As a 16-year-old female, I now have a huge crush on William Moseley (www.william-moseley.com) but not only for his cherubic good looks, but also for his incredible talent and on screen presence. His work with fellow actors was extremely impressive, especially with the fantastic Georgie Henley. That girl can act amazingly and is absolutely adorable! I expect big things from her in the near future. her role was so convincing that I never once doubted I was in Narnia with her. Honestly, the winter scenes made me so cold in the theater! Good thing I wore my fur coat (HAHA) every one of the 5 times I have seen the film! Everyone was cast perfectly in their roles...Everyone! Infinity thumbs up to all actors and those involved in the production of my new favorite movie...My only favorite movie...Until the next installment comes out perhaps? :)"

Now, you may have read that this is the first in the series of the Chronicles of Narnia. It's not. The Witch, The Lion, and The Wardrobe is the second of the series, The Magician's Nephew is the first. It explains how Narnia was formed, how the witch came to Narnia, how she came to her power, and how the prophecy came into place.

Narnia will most definitely be in the running for Best Picture honors. Tilda Swinton gives a very believable performance as the the witch/sorceress/warrior.

"pineapple_1013","9","1","2","8 January 2006"," A very well made adaptation
","I went into this movie expecting it to be okay. Not great, but okay. I read the novels (all seven of them) when I was a very little girl, and then again recently, and I found them to be. . . well, good children's books with a hit-you-over-the-head allegory. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with a Christian message (one should expect that from a Christian author), but I always felt that subtlety can't be over done in writing. But then, they ARE children's books. But I digress. The movie totally surprised me. Blew me away. It was a very faithful adaptation of the book, so it's not as though much was added to change my opinion. The director and the four children cast as the leads, as well as the effects, however, reminded me why I loved the story as a little girl. It was exactly how I'd imagined it when I was seven but couldn't quite imagine it again at 19. Narnia was beautiful and vibrant and just scary enough, as was Aslan, who seamlessly fit into the work. I could gush and gush about the effects, but I won't. Just go see the movie. The same goes for the acting of the four actors playing the Penvesie children. The little girl playing Lucy was incredible to watch, she was so convincingly amazed by everything. The children had great chemistry with each other, fighting and coming together like real siblings would. I was just really impressed with every aspect of the film. If you want to be swept off your feet and feel like a kid again, go see this movie. It'll remind you of why you used to push on the back wall of your closet when you were seven."
"jack_roo","5","1","2","7 January 2006"," CS Lewis Would Have Been Proud
","... so said the older gentleman behind me when this movie finally ended. I woke my children up and they roused themselves just in time to see that the credits held a surprise. Unfortunately for the enthusiastic Narnia fan behind me, he had already rushed off home to read the book again, and had missed this, and I would tell you what it was, except they put the house lights on in the middle of it, and I might miss something of deep significance. If you loved the book you will no doubt find this movie satisfying but for those of you with more modern lives this frankly is a yawn. Much has been made of messages Lewis wanted to convey but few speak of the messages he didn't mean to convey but does anyway - if the thought of an 8 year old girl skipping off innocently to have ""tea"" with a half dressed hybrid makes you a little uneasy you may get his drift. In the end it becomes a bit Lord of the Ringish, only a good deal more sillier. As for the on screen children, they are an irritating bunch, ""fahther way in Indiah"" types, and as for my children, the only magical door was the one marked ""EXIT""."
"stargunner","5","1","2","6 January 2006"," too surreal for its own good.
","In light of the recent fantasy novel-to-movie wave, I think it's safe to say that they're all a bit over indulged. When the height of realism in computer graphics stops wowing people like it use to, and this fad of film begins to slow, we will look on the Chronicles of Narnia as the weakest of these.<br/><br/>All in all Chronicles of Narnia was an average film. Its strongest point was its epic production scale. That couldn't save it at all. Yes, the graphics are stunning, but there's a huge problem with it all. The contrasts, the colors, everything in it that is CG or design is far too bright. Yes, Narnia is a magical, fictional world, but so is Tolkein's Middle Earth and J.K. Rowling's Hogwarts. Their worlds do not make people's eyes bleed. And neither should Narnia. While watching the film everything is simply far too vibrant. Even scenes that should be dark and ominous, like ones with the White Witch and her minions, and scenes of death and battles.<br/><br/>It really killed the film for me. Every field was lime green, every tent and garment of Narnia was a lively red and white, brand new and untainted. It made the White Witch seem far less evil than she really was. And the death of Aslan was simply unmoving with a pink and yellow sunset adorning its background.<br/><br/>I could go on about it forever, but I'll leave it at this. Just because you're in an imaginary world, doesn't mean you don't have to convince your audience the place is real.<br/><br/>Moving on, the acting was alright, but nothing worth noting. The casting was well done, yet at the same time the screen play killed the good choice of actors. I know you have to fit hundreds of pages of a book into a 2 hour film, but it's not like Peter picks up a sword and suddenly knows how to slaughter hundreds of minions of evil. I had trouble playing along with the film in this aspect, too.<br/><br/>Some of it was too quick, some if it was too slow. A lot of things were done right, but other things were done wrong. I'm not trying to be negative about this film. I loved the books as a child and one would think I'd have a huge positive bias in favor of this film. Yet in many ways this is a very disappointing movie and unlike most cases I'm going to throw in the towel saying I'd rather be reading the book than watching this film.<br/><br/>5/10"

","This movie is not exactly BAD, but somehow the current rating does not exactly reflect what I think about it. Good things there are, and I don't want to list them here. But there is exactly one weak point from the movie, patronizing. The dialog in the film seems to be very poor, never read the book, so I can't tell if they are picked up right away from the book, but for some reason I doubt that. When I was watching the film, it started being very fascinating, then I found myself slowly loosing interests. The acting from the young actors are obviously immature (The best performance is from Anna Popplewell, the youngest of four), dialogs are dry and boring(ending up stating simplest fact and most obvious happening from time to time).<br/><br/>Watching this film, I can't help comparing it with Harry Potter's. Dialog from Harry Potter's films are not adult like (that would be unreal), but they are more of adult-wannabe(which is exactly what kids are like), and I truly find that both real and funny. Actors from HP are also brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall I can only give it a 5, it is just a film without a good script and solid acting wrapped up in a sweet computer generated world. By the way, if you are over 20, don't bother going there."

","As a lifelong Narnia fan, I had high hopes for this movie, which were unfortunately not met. There were moments that really hit spot on--I liked the explanatory Blitz scene (even though it wasn't in the books, I think today's children needed it); getting picked up by McCready; Tumnus' cave and his piping;the powerful Stone Table scene, even the casting of the Pevensie children.<br/><br/>However, why add the waterfall/ice floe scene? It broke the mood, as all I could think of was hypothermia and implausability. Was this 'improvement' really needed? Why the repeated slamming of Susan for being so smart and logical, by both Peter and the Professor? Why adding Decalogue (the Beavers sniping at each other, Susan as above, the Fox) that wasn't very effective, when there was *good* Decalogue in the book that didn't get included? Why the generic New-agey music that fails to evoke emotion--even Aslan's re-appearance was utterly untriumphal! There could have been much better music (New Agey, Christian, whatever...just better) And also, why the weird blotting out of Peter's unicorn's genitals--not that Iwould have looked had there not been a strange dark triangle that attracted my eyes when it reared (and why not make the horn indigo, a detail repeated in at least 2 of the Narnia chronicles?).<br/><br/>I understand that film is a different medium than literature--but there are successful adaptations, and I really can't consider this one. My mother refused to see TLOTR because she was afraid the movie would replace her own imaginings of what Middle Earth was like; I told her that would be no problem should she see Narnia."

I never read the book but what I saw in the movie is bad, very bad. It feels like you meld abandoned scenes from Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter with weak story, bad direction and completely uncreative fantasy world. Everything there was just recycle from many genre classics and even worse from computer games and intros - some scenes are direct copy from Warcraft III intro! There is also a Matrix scene, a lot of LOTR stuff and so on. Not a single new and interesting point in this movie. It looks to me as ""one more generic fantasy"" created not by human, but by very limited CSG - Computer Screenplay Generator. The voices of animals are bad (except for the beaver), and especially The Lion. <br/><br/>OK, it's not a complete waste - it's probably a very good movie for 7-10 year old kids, and CG is correct (but nothing special). Also, I guess that those who read the book may see it differently, but from my point of view it's awful. To compare this to LOTR is like to compare a week old BigMac with a finest dinner in a royal restaurant. Consume this movie only if you are starving. Overall 3/10 is more than enough."

Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed.<br/><br/>The good points were the acting by the four children, and the special effects.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story takes its fantasy world too far. I might have been able to accept the premise about the children going through the wardrobe into a secret world, but once there, why keep straining our disbelief with talking animals, magic, strange creatures and stuff that just doesn't exist? To put it another way: If sword-wielding centaurs trot around in your neighborhood, maybe this will make sense to you, but where I live, it seems more than a little weird.<br/><br/>I know that some people were moved by the religious theme. However, the concept of merging the story of Christ's betrayal, crucifixion and resurrection with a ""through the looking glass"" plot didn't do anything for me at all.<br/><br/>I'm curious about the audience this picture was made for. Parts of it seem too scary or too intense for young children. Older children and adults will easily predict the ending. Maybe the age 10-to-14 crowd will consider it a classic, but unfortunately, I left that age group quite some time ago.<br/><br/>Once again, I know many people completely loved this movie. My purpose in writing this is not to tell them that they're wrong. There certainly are way worse movies out there. But I do want to make clear that ""Narnia"" is pure, imaginative fantasy. If that isn't your cup of tea, this movie isn't for you."

","While ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (now there's a mouthful) is in no way a bad movie, it still falls short of its own aspirations. And quite possibly Walt Disney and Walden's; though there's no proof, it's difficult not to think this is the opening salvo of their me-too response to certain other movie series (we all know which ones, so I won't name them). Especially since Peter Jackson's movie(s) seem very much like an organic product; this seems more like an assembly line, though still very far away from a failure.<br/><br/>Giving the roles of the Pevensie children to four stronger actors would have helped, though director Andrew Adamson has to share the blame; it's not always that stirring, and the story loses itself towards the end (and unlike, say, ""King Kong"" or any of the entries in Jackson's trilogy, it doesn't wear its length that well - although ironically this clocks in at a comparatively economical 140 minutes). Perhaps he's not quite as used to dealing with live actors as with animated characters like Shrek. (Although some of the CGI is suspect, meaning Aslan. If only he'd been assigned to Industrial Light & Magic instead of Rhythm & Hues.)<br/><br/>Then again, Adamson does get excellent performances from Tilda Swinton as the White Witch and James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus, and the stodgy beginning and slightly fizzled finale is made up for by just about everything from the point Lucy discovers Narnia; Harry Gregson-Williams' score and the voice work helps, although having Alanis Morrisette and Tim Finn warbling over the credits doesn't. I'll be back for the second movie (it's surely not going to perform badly enough to rule out the next one) but ultimately Bill Melendez's TV cartoon version from the '70s is better.<br/><br/>And yes, I did get the Christian allegories, but it didn't bother me. We don't all have a thing against religion here, you know. :)"

","Yes, I saw this on NEW YEARS EVE. Instead of going out and getting drunk, I saw this movie! It was quite a movie. That is, if you can stomache the idea of four kids, all under 10 years of age, conquering the EARTH (that is Narnia). It was still good. I was impressed that good ol Liam Neesom played the Tiger. Sure, he was Jesus, we all know that. Lucy was Mary Magdelane and God was the PROFESSOR. I am so tired of all the commentary on how the BIBLE is similar to this novel. I was impressed with the way the BUFFALO SOLDIERS kicked butt!! Yes, there were soldiers that literally had BUFFALO HEADS. That was actually quite funny."

","So finally we managed to go and see this movie at the cinema. I didn't know what to expect. Some reviews I've read recently generally compared the output to Lord Of The Rings, so I had some expectations for sure. I felt quite, well, like someone had stolen my cookie after the movie ended. It was all OK till about the middle of the movie and the plot development to me was a little bit too slow perhaps but still OK. Somewhere after passing the mid part of the movie I felt that the plot developed all too fast. And all of a sudden the movie had ended. What happened? For sure there are great effects here, both visual and audio, but the plot just developed so quick in the end. It felt like the director realized after filming and completing the first 1½ hour that he had only one hour left to go and he had 2/3 of the story left to tell, so he tried to find some kind of compromising middle path and it didn't please me. It's a cosy movie and fully OK worth its playtime but hey, by judging the voting here makes one wonder if people's been extra generous with the points due to its Christmas times..."

","I admit I've never read the book... But now I do want to check it out very badly! <br/><br/>Tilda Swinden as the White Witch was good especially when she played Gabriel (Gabrielle?) in ""Constantine,"" but this can lead to typecasting as nothing but a villainess! <br/><br/>Whereas Jim Broadbent as the Professor was most intriguing - he played a villain in ""Moulin Rouge"" and in Jacky Chan's version of ""Around The World in 80 Days"" and a good guy this time yet each character may seem familiar - each was their own entity... Perhaps he should have been Dumbledore? <br/><br/>Typecasting in the hero section comes with Liam Neeson playing the Qui-Gon Jinn/ish talking lion, Aslan (what a beautiful name), but then he has played the anti-hero Darkman - which was a while ago! Aslan was not exactly messianic to me, he was more John The Baptist-like, in that he tended to presage the children whose visit was foretold...<br/><br/>His laying down his life for Edmund was Christ-like, but more along the lines of John The Baptist losing his head to Salome - yet then there was the resurrection for having faith! He also called on the armies of the dead to help the living army of good, like Judgment Day! <br/><br/>A very intriguing notion using pagan/Greek mythic characters to portray one of Humanity's best theories... Christianity, what a pity we all find it so difficult to practice it! <br/><br/>Using four unknowns as the Pevensies was smart, but their choice for Lucy is a bit off, as she tends to be stone-faced or not sure when to laugh or cry!<br/><br/>However, the choice for James MacAvoy as Tumnus was good, this shows marvelous versatility for the young Scot who played Leto Atreides to perfection in ""Children of Dune."" <br/><br/>The effects were far superior to Xena to have the Cyclopes, Centaurs, Fauns and Satyrs move with ease and grace! Aslan looked natural when talking, and so did the beavers... Even the Gryphons moved better than in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban""!! <br/><br/>As for Maugrim the chief of secret police, he was a truly fearsome wolf and using Michael Madsen's voice made it more effective! I love how the four children of Adam & Eve adopted the tactics of World War II in the fight against the White Witch - using boulders for bombs and Phoenixes as incendiary devices to compensate for lack of numbers!!<br/><br/>This is doing better than the Harry Potter series that is starting to head for a nose-dive in my view, I eagerly await the ""King Caspian"" and ""The Dawn Treader"" instalments! This was much better than the cartoon I saw as a child..."
"andrius-mazeika","8","1","2","28 December 2005"," Great vision-- difficult actors/unhelpful script...
","In Andrew Adamson's newest film concoction, ""The Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" C.S. Lewis masterpiece came to life. It is a pity, however, that this film did not completely match up to Lewis' vision. This is not to say, on the other hand, that the story itself was bad. To be honest, the writing for the story was fine. Throughout this motion picture, I could not help but dislike Edmund and Peter. I was indifferent towards Lucy, Suzanne had her annoying parts, but they weren't as bad as the two whiny brothers.<br/><br/>Peter, CLEARLY alluding St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church, disappointed me greatly. Even though an adolescent, I expected much out of his character. The way William Moseley portrayed Peter was not very helpful at all. The fact that he didn't acknowledge his obligation in Narnia to lead the Army did not bother, but how the actor portrayed his lacking of acceptance to take on a task did. He sounded too wimpy. Now, with this being said, it wouldn't surprise me if Moseley had not seen Star Wars- Episode IV: A New Hope, especially the parts when Obi-Wan Kenobi would ask Luke Skywalker to come with him to Alderaan to hand over the plans to destroying the Death Star. Luke reluctantly declines, but in a manner that becomes believable. In a more defined perspective, I was looking for something of a Harry Potter, not a Ronald Weasley. Moseley has much to learn as a young actor, then again the screenwriters and Adamson did not exactly put Moseley in his element.<br/><br/>Where Peter was too wimpy to lead any Army, Edmund's character was not fully revived. I had no sympathy for Edmund's character at all. He was perceived just like any normal child growing up in the shadow of an older brother, however, I did not KNOW Edmund in this movie. I viewed him more as an annoying and spiteful brother, and should he have died at any point in the movie I could have cared less for the Pevensies and the fate of Narnia; which was never the initial case. Adamson did not revive the goodness within Edmund. I was waiting for that throughout the whole movie, and didn't see it once.<br/><br/>Probably one of the most important elements in a good film is the dialogue. There were certain parts in this movie when I couldn't help just but saying, ""Ugggh...."" For example, when the Pevensie children were at the ruined home of Mr. Tumnus, birds were trying to get the attention of the Pevensie children. The birds would go, ""Psst!"" It killed me when Suzanne said, ""That bird just 'psst'ed at us!"" At such a critical point in the plot, I couldn't but help being disappointed. I didn't buy into the line at all. I sunk into my movie seat while shaking my head after hearing that line, and had done this a handful of other times while watching this film.<br/><br/>Adamson did a good job at bringing the world of Narnia to life, but failed to bring along most of the characters. The only characters that I cared about were the Beavers, Mr. Tumnus and Aslan. The Beavers, Tumnus and Aslan were the only characters that I actually had a sense of who they were. The rest I could care less for."
"supertom-3","7","1","2","27 December 2005"," A worthy adaptation!
","Not before time this classic story has finally been brought to the big screen. In this time of sequels, adaptations, and a real lack of original ideas it seemed only right that CS Lewis's first Narnian tale should be given the big budget treatment. Under the direction of Andrew Adamson making his live action debut following two successful gigs as director of the Shrek films, this film has the requisite looks and Adamson proves worthy of a film this big, albeit lacking some of the extra flair and conviction injected into the last two Potters and particularly the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story of the Pevensie kids finding a magical world inside a wardrobe, and becoming the saviours of a whole world. It's a classic tale and taps into the inventive imaginations of young children. It certainly strikes a chord with younger children perhaps more so than Tolkien's middle earth books. Wardrobe is certainly a well made spectacle but at it's 140 minutes length something between book and films doesn't quite gel. In truth the books are extremely simplistic having been aimed at under 10's primarily. This means that in order to transfer the book to screen the filmmakers have had to extend parts, add in depth. Unfortunately there isn't much depth added and as such the character development of the children, and other side characters is thin, or anorexic for want of a better word. At times the film heavily milks LOTR. In fact milking it so hard at times that some cheese actually comes out. We have the kid's given special weapon's etc as they become moved to the idea of helping Narnia. However the battle scenes seems fragmented and tacked on and the kid's barely uses their special gifts before the battle ends sharply. Really this is nothing to have the epic 30 minute battles of the Two Towers and Return Of The King running to the hills.<br/><br/>The film though is still an enjoyable fantasy romp and feels very short despite the epic running time. It seemed to breeze by, because there wasn't much depth to it. The Pevensie kid's are good. Georgie Henley is engaging as Lucy, perhaps the most important role, while Skander Keynes is not as strong in his role as Edmund and at times grates, but being so young he can be cut slack. Willaim Mosely does well as Peter, while the beautiful Anna Pepperell (Whose surname could almost be that of a Narnia inhabitant!) is very good as Susan. What works is that all the actors are perhaps two years older than their characters in the book, and as such there is an added maturity to the performances while they still all look right for the part, something similar in the Potter films as those actors continue to grow in their roles. As for the White Witch, she is played with menace and gusto by Tilda Swinton, strangely sexy as the epitome of all evil.<br/><br/>Harry Gregson Williams was like the director a surprise choice to do the score. However he adds something interesting to it and isn't merely content to do a generic fantasy epic score. The music really adds something to the film. Of course the effects, aside from a few sub par moments, are all excellent particularly the creation of Aslan the lion, voiced majestically by Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Overall this is a worthy adaptation of a much beloved book that may fall short of the standards of Peter Jackson's LOTR films and the last two excellent Potter films, but as far as fantasy films go it's a worthy watch and truthfully does as much as could be done with such simple material. While Adamson may not have been the ideal director to explore the world visually he certainly does a good job. ***½"
"rpbaro","7","1","2","25 December 2005"," The screen adaptation of one of C.S. Lewis' The Chonicles of Narnia: Four children embark on an adventure to save a fantasy world, plagued with eternal winter.
","I think it's a good movie. It's well casted--all four leads give impressive and promising performances and the White Witch is on point. The supporting cast is really good. I'm surprised by all the well-known British actors lending their voices. That's nice.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the old BBC miniseries version, so I was excited to see this adaptation. Although I like it, I was disappointed by the pace of the film. It drags in the beginning and it haphazardly speeds up near the end, which should have been fleshed out simply to emphasize the significant scenes in the latter part of the film.<br/><br/>I find it surprising that Disney is the producer and distributor because The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is veiled in a Christian allegory. This is another reason why I'm disappointed by the film. Because of the novel's religious connotations, Disney and Anderson made sure not to emphasize that aspect of it. Nevertheless the basic Christian symbols and themes are there if you are careful to not get lost in the film.<br/><br/>The special effects are really good, almost flawless.<br/><br/>Anderson attempted to make an epic film and he didn't quite make it. He put all the characteristic camera shots and action sequences akin to epic films, but it was some were blatantly just for show. Especially because of the pace at the end. I don't know what the editor was thinking but cutting from shot to shot, from scene to scene so quickly.<br/><br/>Anderson and the screenwriter seem to not be conscious of character development. That's probably making Lewis shudder in his grave.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Good movie (I'll definitely by the DVD when it comes out), but Disney makes cookie cutter films and totally sucks anything profound out of what it touches [(i.e. this film, Pocahontas, etc.)(They do better working with Pixar, who saves Disney's ass with their films)] and Peter Jackson should have gotten his hands on it."
"bollycritic","3","1","2","25 December 2005"," Poor attempt to take me back to childhood...
","With the fondest of memories, I think of the daily hour-long story time sessions my grade two teacher, Mr Rowell, used to treat us to. Through out that school year, we were mesmerized by his reading to us from a few of the Narnia series books, including The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. And because of the beauty of those novels, our whole class was turned on to the world of reading.<br/><br/>This film, though, does nothing to remind me of those great hours from my childhood. There is little magical about this film. It's just Disney's poor attempt to mint a series-based, money making franchise, as its competitors have done of late with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. The difference is that Peter Jackson's films are classics (better than the hard to read novels, in my opinion) and the Potter series just turned got a shot in the arm with the Goblet of Fire. Those studios recognized that the audience has to enjoy itself while they make money.<br/><br/>Narnia though runs most often like a cheap rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. The scenes with the children discovering Narnia through the wardrobe (some of the best from the novel) are the most boring in the film. Disney is going to have a tough time trying to entice me to go see the follow-ups.<br/><br/>Save your money and buy the books to read to your kids. You're better off."

","The first half of the movie was great, except for a few unnecessary shots. I was worried how they were going to handle Mr. Tumnus' attempted abduction of Lucy without making him seem like a molester, but the actor had the right stuff and managed to make the scene work. Lucy's meeting with Mr. Tumnus under the lamppost is one of my favorite parts in the book (no moralizing, just magic) and is probably one of the best scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>The Beavers were wonderfully realized. They're warm human characters and the voice acting was appropriate (although the Cockney threw me off at first). I didn't like Maugrim quite so much. He looked like a run of the mill wolfdog when he should've looked like an epic foe, and his voice was distracting. I wish they'd borrowed the wolf from The Neverending Story.<br/><br/>My interest flagged after the kids met the lion. Up until then, there was lots of magic and nice touches (the dryad made of petals smiling at Lucy, who has a knack for looking amazed). Is it wrong that I think Aslan is the most uninteresting part of the story? Wouldn't a more appropriate allegorical stand in for Jesus be a lamb? Wouldn't it be a better scene for the kids to finally meet Aslan only to find out that the hope of Narnia is just a lamb? Aslan is mighty and everyone loves him, but Jesus had no power in the world as a carpenter's son and no influence outisde a small band of fickle followers. No one in the story doubts or denies Aslan until he's already cold and dead. I also wish the director spent less time showing us battle and more time showing us the Witch's cold charm, Edmund's moral struggle, Aslan's joyful resurrection, and the children interacting with the creatures from Narnia. In the book, the battle was just a way of wrapping things up, it wasn't the payoff (Aslan's resurrection was the payoff)."

"Johnny_Shannow","6","1","2","22 December 2005"," Entertaining, but doesn't capture the spirit of Narnia
","I would say that although this movie has it's entertaining moments, it can't hold a candle to the old BBC and animated versions. Although the music was quite good in the new movie, it lacked the great theme which conveys the magic of Narnia in this old TV version and also the animated version which also has a nice theme, a big mistake I thought to open the movie with an Alanis Morissette song. Without a truly great magical theme I never got the sense that it was even Narnia that the children went to whenever they went through the wardrobe.<br/><br/>I'd heard that the new film was a very faithful version of the book, but when I saw it I thought it was far from that to me. Virtually every line from the book had been altered and it was so corny to hear Ray Winstone's Mr Beaver use of cockney slang ""geezer"". The way Mr Tumnus constantly referred to Lucy as ""Lucy Pevensie"" was also very annoying, seeming as in the books the children's' surname isn't revealed until after The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. However both the old BBC version and the animated version, take virtually all their lines from CS Lewis's book. I don't know whether I'm too picky being a Lewis fan but to me even the way the children were shown to be riding talking horses in the film was like heresy, not only are they not mentioned to ride talking horses in the book, but also in The Horse and His Boy, we are told that no Narnian would ever dream of riding a talking horse because it was seen as derogatory to them, Bree only allowed Shasta to do it because he needed him to escape from Calormen.<br/><br/>However all being said it was nice to see with a bigger budget and improved effects, a more realistic depiction of talking animals, and a truly stunning battle scene at the end, unlike the few pathetic animated creatures that are used for the flimsy battle at the end of the BBC version, but at the end of the day faithfulness to Lewis's book is far favourable to superior effects and action."

","*** CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *** <br/><br/>I have seen a lot of film adaptations of books I've read. Sometimes the film is better than the book (Lord of the Rings actually improved on some parts of the book by consolidation and editing). Some are dreadful.<br/><br/>However, this time I feel they got it right. Yes, there were elements cut out, including some I loved (the lion at the White Witch's castle, that was so wonderful in his jubilance is just a shadow of the book), some things were added (more tension when the children are leaving the Beaver's home by a tunnel rather than the front door, when Mrs. Beaver has to take a second to lock it) and even characters and scenes either added (the fox) or changed (the river crossing).<br/><br/>All these seem picky, however, as EVERY MAJOR POINT of the book was in the movie.<br/><br/>The transformation of Peter from young boy who holds a sword in awe to knight who can fight is given, the forgiveness of Edmund, the mice chewing at Alsan's bindings at the Stone Table, these are all there! I loved the Narnia books as a child. Even though I read both Tolkien and Lewis and probably thought Tolkien better as a child, Narnia has stayed with me longer.<br/><br/>No, I am not a practicing Christian. I was an Anglican, but one of the things I loved about Lewis was his depiction of the more Anglican view that all Good Works that are done by someone are Good in the eyes of ""God."" (See ""The Last Battle"") That God is not some egomaniac as many seem to believe, that needs ""credit"" for a good work (if it isn't done in the name of Jesus, these people say, it isn't a Good Work), seems far more convincing to me of an omnipotent, omniscient God.<br/><br/>Narnia is wondrous because you can read it as a story, as a moral tale, as Christian allegory (though Lewis denied this) and more. It has something for people of every age and every level of complexity. The film managed to preserve that.<br/><br/>I hope Disney makes a TON of money from this film, and completes the series, giving this same level of attention to every film, every book."

","Well I see there are mixed reviews about this film and that made me even more curious to see it.<br/><br/>I have to agree first of all that ILM has fallen away a bit from the standards set by the Weta based special effects/CGI department, George Lucas needs to catch up. The effects would have been acceptable five years ago but the standards reached by Peter Jackson's team has set the bar higher. The main culprit was the background/actor combination i.e. in front of the snowy mountainous - as in the background looked entirely separate with very different lighting on those actors in front - even a telltale outline around them! The CGI animals were all excellent however, though its true the movement of clothing, particularly as Lucy and Susan are riding on Aslan's back to the battle, is rather unrealistic and non-moving. However, some of the wide angle shots with the animals in them are breath taking. The CGI/special FX in the newest Harry Potter were superior (that's the best HP to date in my view, on a par to the first).<br/><br/>Yes, the child actors were a little experienced, but they REALLY looked the parts. Lucy, the smallest, was especially delightful and exactly as I imagined her. Tilda Swinton as the witch I could take or leave. I really did imagine, and as described in the book, the witch looking more like someone like Angelica Huston, but a younger version perhaps. Tilda did some things right and others were wrong. Did not like her costuming, but the children's War-era clothing was perfect.<br/><br/>My favourite scene was when Lucy met Mr Tumnus the first time, fresh out of the wardrobe, just pure delight, exactly as I imagined, the richness of the colours and so much more. I found the faun (James McAvoy) vaguely attractive! (is that because I'm a Capricorn!?). Anyway, he and Lucy were perfect (although the connotations of kidnap were downright scary in todays ""stranger danger"" climate). The ending also was excellent where the four children had become adults ruling Narnia for many years and again stumbled back to the wardrobe - their adult counterparts were exceedingly well cast and believable.<br/><br/>These are just a few points to this film, but it is such a complex film on so many levels its hard to begin. However, overall, easily worth the $14 I paid to see it and the more I think about it the more I would like to see it again. Anyone complaining about having spent the ticket price on this film (other reviewers on IMDb) should seriously think about what else $14 would buy them! Yes, Peter Jackson could have done this better, Ridley Scott too (remember ""Legend""?), but this is still WAY BETTER than most of films of this kind, only once in a while did I think it veering towards the serial/TV standard of Xena or Hercules fantasy.<br/><br/>An imperfect film, but SUCH A TALL ORDER, I was not disappointed, there were some real special scenes along the way.<br/><br/>(My ""spelling mistakes"" in this are simply because I'm from New Zealand and we spell things the English way, i.e colour, not color etc.,)"

","The movie was a good film to take my family to. The story was very close to the book and the few differences were mainly omissions of a few scenes that while were of interest in the book, really were not needed to advance the story and were likely cut for time. The pace of the movie really kept you interested through out the whole movie and it was visually stunning with the special effects and the CGI work for the characters.<br/><br/>The movie is also both safe and fun for the whole family. There was little in the way of excessive violence and certainly no gore. I took an eight-year-old to see it and he had no problems with it. It was also entertaining for all of us. For the children it told a wonderful tale that they had not heard before, and for us adults who were read to from the Narnia series. I only hope that they plan to do more of the series and that they do them in the same, high standards as they did this one,"
"cns-5","8","1","2","19 December 2005"," Cinematics doesn't compare to Rings', but excels it in subject.
","There are some screen shots that take you right out of the movie and back into the reality of sitting in a theater with a few hundred people. There was one scene when the children and lion were atop a mountain looking beyond and the wilderness behind them looked as fictional as a Saturday Night Live background. <br/><br/>I wanted to feel removed from the theater, experiencing a story, as I had with the recent Potter (Goblet of Fire) movie. That said, NArnia's story is head and shoulders above Rings and Potter in subject. There could be no Potter or Rings story w/out the delineation of good and evil realized by Narnia's subject matter. Narnia predates Potter by decades, and its first installment of Narnia (Lion, Witch, Wardrobe) was published at least four years before Rings was first released."
"evanston_dad","9","1","2","18 December 2005"," Finally Makes It to the Screen, and Guess What? It's Pretty Darn Good!
","Oh, expectations where high, as I rabidly loved this series of books when I was a kid. How relieved I was, therefore, when I discovered that they made a pretty good movie from C.S. Lewis's debut Narnia novel.<br/><br/>At first I was worried. A clunky and unnecessary prologue depicting the London blitz and the children's journey to their uncle's home in the country didn't help, and the children themselves seemed pretty bland. But the director and screenwriter were wise enough to keep things clipping along, and it's not long before Lucy has ventured into the wardrobe for the first time. Her first scene with the faun Mr. Tumnus set the tone, and from that moment on, I felt Lewis's story was in good hands.<br/><br/>Little Georgie Henley is a fine little actress; I thought at first her Lucy was going to be too sweet and syrupy, a la many a child actor. But instead she was spunky, just as one would expect based on the way she's written in the book. The actor who plays Edmund is good too; he and Lucy are the most vivid of the children. Susan and Peter are a bit more bland, but that's o.k.; they're bland in the book too, and it's no surprise that their characters only make it through the first two novels before being written out entirely.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton gives a magnificent performance as the White Witch. There were many times when she had to have been reacting to little more than a blue screen, but she's never less than superb. Liam Neeson voices Aslan nicely, and the lion itself is one of the best special effects I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Narnia looks just the way I imagined it when I read the books. The film makers feel no need to tinker with what is already a perfect story, and the only additions they make (like the action set piece on the frozen river) are minor and take nothing away. I liked the tone of the film as well. This was not a Disneyfied version of the story. The books, though written for kids, were dark and intense. The moral conflicts felt real, and there was always the feeling that the children were being forced to grow up too fast, to deal with adult realities before they had developed the adult emotions to go with them. An apt story for a WWII audience, and the movie wisely keeps the tone. The killing of Aslan, in particular, is quite scary and disturbing.<br/><br/>The climactic battle scene is spectacular. It obviously owes something to Peter Jackson's recent ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but it doesn't steal from those movies. Indeed, given the fact that those movies are so fresh in everyone's minds and so ready for comparison, it's very high praise to say that ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" holds its own against Jackson's films.<br/><br/>Die hard fans of the books should not be disappointed, and those who haven't read them just may be able to tell why they're so loved by seeing this film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"triple8","10","1","2","18 December 2005"," The movie many of us have waited our lives for.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>This is going to be a hard movie to review because it will be nearly impossible to keep my objectivity. Let me begin by saying I grew up with this book. I don't remember exactly how old I was when I read it, I just know how much it meant to me and the feelings of childhood magic it produced in me. Through the years, I've read it on occasion and those feelings never fail to be stirred again and again and again. Narnia the movie, is something myself and probably millions of other enamored fans have waited their lives for. I always wondered why this hadn't been done as a major film before and always felt somewhat of a yearning. So finally it was and I saw it yesterday. And it was wonderful.<br/><br/>I think the movie version of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a joy to view. Absolutely captivating and incredibly done. One positive were the special affects, particularly Aslan. I simply could not believe the realism in every last detail, especially the facial expressions. It was almost mind numbing and such a relief when one thinks about what it could have been like.<br/><br/>Mystery, magic, that feeling of timelessness-it was all there, most prevalently at the very beginning, when the words :Presents: ""The chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", went up on screen. For anyone who has loved this book and craved a movie version of it, this was not just a moment, it was THE moment. At least for me it was. <br/><br/>The performers were great and it was like meeting old friends (and enemies!). First, All four children were terrific , I never cease to be amazed that people of that young age can act! It's awe inspiring. I'm not going to say any were better then the others, all were great. So was that wacky, Wondercful professor (""what DO they teach them in school these days""?!).<br/><br/>And now we come to the White Witch. Now when this movie was first being made I had heard a rumor (which I don't even know if it was true) that Nicole Kidman was asked to play the white witch. I am a fan so I was very pleased. So much time later, when I heard she was not, in fact, cast as The White Witch, I was a bit disappointed. I needn't have been! Tilda Swinton rocked! She was just fantastic (best supporting actress nod should be hers). She made the part her own in a wonderful way. Swinton was electric, her white witch was spot on and also looked the way the white witch SHOULD look. Kudos!<br/><br/>All the supporting characters-real or otherwise-were great. But I really must mention Aslan again. Liam Nielson's voice was perfect but the facial expressions still amaze me, modern technology is also something worth being in awe of. Also worth mentioning was the great, utterly wonderful musical score.<br/><br/>But most importantly is the fact that this movie was adapted from the book so faithfully. I was amazed by that and by how much of the dialog was verbatim or nearly so. Certain things were exact, other things varied a bit but were for the most part in keeping with the book, though there Were a few things missing that I'd have liked to see (Edmond being knighted by Aslan after the battle was won for one). Overall though, very little varied greatly and that is such a relief and a tribute to the wonderful book and it's brilliant author, C.S. Lewis.<br/><br/>The negatives? None really. I have searched for some, since I do want to have some objectivity. Others have mentioned that it would have been nice to have a narrator, that was something I had thought of too, after seeing it. One because the narrator could have explained some things that the book explained and the movie does not. And second because one aspect to the book that made it so magical WAS the narration of C.S. Lewis. It would have been nice to have a Narrator woven in somehow.<br/><br/>I will say that there is one thing I was a tad bit disappointed in and that is the fact that Narnia, while beautiful, majestic and magical didn't look to me, beautiful, majestic and magical enough. I wanted it to be the most beautiful thing I had ever seen-surpassing the cinematography in any movie ever made. It didn't. Although Narnia was beautiful to look at and became more beautiful as the movie deepened, it never blossomed into the most visually beautiful movie in the World. I wanted Narna to look like the magical place of wonder I had in my mind growing up. It did and it didn't. It kind of did but not quite to the extent I would have liked. I was considering giving the movie a 9 because of that and not a 10.<br/><br/>But then I expressed this view to a confidante and fellow movie goer who made an excellent point. That perhaps no movie version could ever be quite that beautiful and magical because it would be competing against a version that didn't come from anything actually seen, but from a child's imagination. And that really is true. All the millions of people who read this book were free to imagine Narnia in any way they wanted. To me, when thinking about it, the movie still deserves a 10 of 10 rating. It really is magic that a story that was told so many years ago, still has remained so loved over the years. The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe meant so much to me as a kid (and adult) and it means so much to me to have seen it on the big screen, a movie for all seasons, rich in story and still as magical as ever."

","A fantastic adaptation of a classic book<br/><br/>The four Penvensie children were played very well, and helped to give as good overall outline of the plot. Mr Tumnus was probably my favourite character in this adaptation, as he gave a good first insight into the mysterious world of Narnia. I felt, however, that perhaps the rating could have been a little higher, 12A?, as I felt that it had just as much violence in it as 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', which is was competing with; eg. main battle sequence, and in particular the well-filmed death of Aslan.<br/><br/>Overall all I felt that itwas a fantastic adaptation of a classic book, and one can only hope that they do as good a job with the other six books."

The children were perfectly casted, all of the ""fantasy"" characters are very realistic, and Aslan is just as I had pictured. A few parts may be different from the book--the addition and deletion of certain scenes--but it makes for a great movie.

The witch was truly evil, and Tilda Swinton was perfect at playing Jadis.<br/><br/>I loved that the cgi creatures did not look really fake at all.

Right from the beginning, the young actors and actresses showed themselves as being highly mature adults.<br/><br/>There were also parts of the movie where I was on the edge of my seat, literally! I was so excited about what was going on, I was shaking. There is also, though, drama and comedy.<br/><br/>If you have read the books, you will not be disappointed.

"Surecure","9","1","2","17 December 2005"," Absolutely wonderful...
","I am completely unfamiliar with the literary work upon which ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is based, so I can only make my judgement on the film alone, and not whether it is a solid adaptation (though many say it is). I went into the film figuring that I would at least enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I did.<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the best movies I have seen this year, all around. The story is fantastic and rich, the acting is top notch (especially Tilda Swinton's Witch) and the design and special effects are spectacular to watch. While the effects in some areas could have been improved (the beavers didn't look as spectacular as Aslan or the griffins, for example), the overall achievement in creating the world as it is presented is truly astounding.<br/><br/>Special mention has to go to Harry Gregson Williams for a truly fantastic score. Right away, the score comes out on top and it is never overdone. This is especially noticeable in the battle scene as the score fades away just before the two opposing forces collide. Every subtle nuance is poetic and Williams has certainly outdone himself.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a film I know I will be buying the day it comes out on DVD. It is easily one of the most entertaining films of the year and a perfect family flick."
"dj_bassett","Null","1","2","17 December 2005"," It's a fine adaptation
","In fact, I think in some ways it surpasses the original. Tilda Swinton's White Witch is, I think, a lot scarier than anything Lewis himself came up with, plus the final third of the movie has an oomph and push rather lacking from the over-schematic original. I also liked the early set-up which helps give us a sense of these characters before they enter Narnia, set the story in a place and time, and in a neat way foreshadows part of the climax.<br/><br/>There is a certain thinness which is inescapable, a fault of the source material itself. I respect Lewis, but don't consider him an especially good writer of fiction. Narnia is a hodgepodge of myths, folktales, Christian symbolism and talking animals straight out of The Wind in the Willows. It feels contrived, not especially ""real"".<br/><br/>But if you have any fond memories of the book at all you'll like this, it's a marvelously faithful adaptation. As for the Christian elements, they're there but it's not a dreary Sunday School lesson -- the movie's as Christian as you want it to be, essentially."
"kiitana","7","1","2","16 December 2005"," Pretty good, but not quite
","First off, I felt as though this was a pretty well done movie. For the particular audience it targeted, the movie was spot on. However, for the rest of us, it seemed as though something was lacking. It really seemed as though there was an attempt to make the movie feel epic, but it fell short in the end; there was no buildup to the major battle at the end. Even the killing of Aslan had very little buildup to it. Everything just seemed to 'happen', there was very little flow. For instance, the entire movie, all the children want to do is rescue their brother Edmund and then go home; even on the eve of battle. Then, without warning, they decide to fight. It left me wanting more, and not in a good way. Overall though, I would say it is still worth seeing."
"Pavel-8","9","1","2","14 December 2005"," Narnia provides the best movie experience of the year (for me).
","Let's get something out of the way: this is not an easy movie for me to review with objectivity, because more than any other story adapted to film, I have a personal connection to The Chronicles of Narnia. My dad read them to me when I was very young. I've read the entire series myself at least a dozen times. I've listened to the tapes so many times that I hear that inflection when I read the books. I was Peter in a kindergarten rendition of this movie. Author C.S. Lewis's wardrobe is at my college. I took a Lewis class there. I took a Narnia class in high school. The freaking name of my high school comes from these books. So yeah, I have something invested in the books. Having said that, I was apprehensive about how this story would be adapted in a movie world that has recently seen versions of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", to both of which this would inevitably be compared. Most of those fears proved to be unnecessary, and I won't dwell on any book-to-movie discrepancies, which I thought mostly minor or acceptable artistic license, although I'm more than willing to discuss them. On with the show...<br/><br/>The most famous of C.S. Lewis's beloved seven-book ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" follows the adventures of the Pevensies, four British siblings, as they stumble into the fantasy world of Narnia, where they find themselves in the center of a conflict between good and evil. A land replete with talking creatures ranging from beavers and wolves to centaurs and fauns, Narnia is reminiscent of Middle Earth, but like the entire story, is based in mythology more classic than epic, with a black-and-white fairy tale feel that is evident on screen.<br/><br/>Greatly aiding that mystical sense is the score of Harry Gregson-Williams. With ""LWW"", the film veteran (""Shrek"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"") finally has a known theme to place alongside his name. Dominated by strings, his melodies accentuate the tale with a light (but firm when necessary) nature appropriate for such a magical land. Likewise the vivid cinematography of Donald McAlpine (""Moulin Rouge"") never gets too big (ahem...""Troy""...ahem). The camera suitably swoops and soars with the action at times, keeping the scenery bright and fresh, wisely eschewing the bold, dark edge (and PG-13 rating) of ""LOTR"" and the mechanical nature of the first ""Harry Potter"" movies, always returning to the children, the core of the story.<br/><br/>These two technical aspects highlight the greatest triumph of ""LWW"": the overall tone, which was was a pitch-perfect amalgam of fantasy and reality that is aimed at a young audience. Unlike many such movies, ""LWW"" is based in the real world (WWII Britain), but spends much of its time in a fictional one. Smoothly transitioning between while still distinguishing the two is more difficult that it might sound. But by focusing on the children (all of whom acquit themselves well) and properly telling the story from their perspective, the story primarily moves along at a brisk pace, and ""LWW"" accomplishes that task.<br/><br/>I know this isn't phenomenal cinema like ""The Lord of the Rings"", although the gap is smaller than you might think once you factor in the story's younger target audience. ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" features similar and simpler motifs of love and sacrifice, good and evil, life and death. These quintessential themes are wrapped in the magical shell of Narnia, a place that appeals to the wide-eyed child in everyone, not just those who have read the books. Who doesn't want to happen upon an alternate universe and find amazing adventures there? Who doesn't want to encounter talking animals and mythical creatures? The exploits on screen are such that they will appeal to anyone with a pulse and an imagination.<br/><br/>Knowing the story does alter the movie experience. If you have read the book, little of the plot is surprising, which eliminates much of the novelty. However, familiarity alternatively provides a tear-inducing satisfaction, like watching a loved one accomplish something exceptional. Hearing great lines spoken, seeing previously unseen people and places, enjoying small moments that are thoughtfully included, and noticing references to the rest of the series; all of these things indescribably form the happiest movie experience I have ever encountered, a singular blend of relief, joy, exhilaration, and contentedness.<br/><br/>As for the inescapable comparisons to its contemporaries, based purely on its cinematic merits, I place ""LWW"" ahead of three Harry Potter movies, and behind ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Because of my intimate ties with the source material, I crafted a more personal connection with this film than the others. Sure it was a bit slow at times; yes, the Pevensies were a little too one-note; maybe the CGI looked a tad awry at times (although I would attribute much of that to the blatant weirdness of seeing talking animals); but I willingly blinded myself to the movie's minor shortcomings, and in return received an unmatched cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I hope that everyone else can find a fraction of the joy that I did through these books and this movie. 9 of 10."
"reiver102","9","1","2","14 December 2005"," Wonderful!
","It's nice to see that since the dawn of the 21st century we have experienced a renaissance of sorts in the fantasy film genre. Ever since Peter Jackson unleashed Lord of the Rings on the world, things have been going well. And what better follow up to Tolkien's masterpiece than his friend C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia?<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I was somewhat skeptical about the future of this film (even though it was a nice trailer). I was afraid it would be some thrown-together movie to follow in the footsteps of LotR, with pretty visuals and eye-candy but a butchering of the story (I'll admit here, that I have not read more than a few pages of the book, but considering the popularity and age of the stories, I do not doubt the quality of the material contained therein). Fortunately, I was wrong. This movie excels in many ways, and in some ways, even surpasses LotR in terms of entertainment. Considering my devotion to all things Tolkien, this is a major achievement :)<br/><br/>First off, all the actors are great. One thing I've noticed with movies like these is that child actors can make or break a movie. Too many times kids are thrown into a movie to be 'cute' but their acting is just nauseating. Not so here. Each of the kids conveys a sense of realism in their role, keeping it low-key when needed and bringing in the emotion at the right points. The White Witch, like her kingdom, is cold and cruel, and the iciness of her stare says as many words as her deep, hard voice. Aslan, voiced by Liam Neeson, is perfect. Coming right off the heels of Batman Begins (in a villain role), he comes off as kind and understanding, yet proud and majestic, as the Lion King of Narnia. Still, at 130 minutes, the movie still feels a bit too short. It takes a while before all the kids even enter Narnia, and then things kind of roll from there.<br/><br/>As I have said, I have not read the books (yet), but from what I've heard, it stays remarkably close to the books, which is good, as I had some beefs with the changes Jackson made to the LotR movies (I admit, some were necessary, but not all). I shall have to read Lewis' works and see for myself.<br/><br/>So, at any rate, if you are a fan of the Narnia books, or just classic fantasy in general, you have to see this movie. Movies like this show that we have indeed come a long way since the days of Dragonslayer and Clash Of The Titans. With good acting, a solid story, and great effects, this is one of the greatest movies of 2005."
"caladiamond","10","1","2","13 December 2005"," Excellent movie! Best of the Narnia bunch!
","I thought that this was by far the best of any Narnia movie! To those of us who are fans of the book, we're relieved to finally have a movie that lives up to the imagination of C.S. Lewis. The children were perfectly cast. William Moseley as Peter carried the feeling of the eldest brother and gave depth to the character not felt in other versions. The computer animation was seamless and allowed us to see the animals with a liveliness never show before. Liam Neeson gave a spectacular performance as Aslan. I feel that the storyline was well adapted to the adventurousness of today's audience. I'm looking forward to further Narnia books coming to life in the same spirit as this one."
"dmri_nz","7","1","2","13 December 2005"," Great overall but acting was a letdown
","This film is pretty good and kids will absolutely love it. Especially if they have read the Narnia books as I did ten years ago. Andrew Adamson did extremely well for his debut feature, but he did make a huge, huge mistake in casting chidren with no acting experience. The role of Lucy Pevinsey is really important to the film, so why would Adamson and co. not cast one of the thousands of child actors around who've been in front of cameras since they were in diapers? Georgie Henley is a cute kid, sure, but any kid can be a cute. The same can be said for William Moseley, he was a little too limp to really carry off a role like Peter. Tilda Swinton is absolutely perfect though. I'd have had nightmares about her if I'd seen this as a kid and thats the biggest compliment I can think of. There is some really good CGI going on here as well. Despite a whiff of unfulfilled potential, the first in the chronicles is definitely worth a trip to the theater."

","Don't get me wrong - I didn't think this was a bad film and enjoyed it more than Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>But... For me it added nothing to the book. I think this has a lot to do with the way C.S. Lewis describes everything/one so well, it's a doddle even for a 7 year old to imagine everything in a pretty 'realistic' fashion.<br/><br/>Fine, if you haven't read the book, it makes a good children's film. As an adult I think the thickly painted allegory is a bit too much with the story often feeling clumsy and made to fit.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me."

","The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a truly great film in every sense, and is without a doubt the best family film I have seen in a long time. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that people actually applauded. Narnia is brought to life in amazing detail, and represents the novel in a way I doubt C.S. Louis could have ever imagined. It is sad he could not live to see his creation finally given the attention it deserved. <br/><br/>The performances of the four stars are amazing, with the young Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie stealing the show. Tilda Swinton is cold and ruthless (and amazing) as the White Witch. The performances of the CGI creations are also beyond expectations, achieving a level of excellence and realism I have not seen since Gollum of The Lord of the Rings. When Aslan first walks onto the screen, he does so with all the might and majesty of a real lion. As with all the other characters, the fact that they are CGI completely disappears, as every hair and muscle on their body moves with the grace of a living creature. <br/><br/>The story is as close to its source as I have ever seen, and never strays too far to flesh the story out. The climatic final battle outshines any other like it. Also, for those afraid of how Disney might handle a story with such obvious religious symbolism, do not fear. I will not spoil the details, but suffice it to say that NOTHING, religious or otherwise, has been changed from the original story. It is nice to see a movie with such high morals do so well. In the end, this is an amazing story with fantastic effects and brilliant actors but most importantly, it makes you feel good when you leave the theater. I wish there were more movies like this."

","I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe several times when I was younger, and later read the entire 6 book series. The movie is a faithful adaptation and likely the best live action version so far. Fans of the books have nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>---Spoilers--- The problem with this movie is that it misses the demographic a bit. It is too childish for anyone over 13 to really appreciate, and too violent for children who would.<br/><br/>When I saw this in the theatre, the children were delighted by the Mr. Tumnus, then horrified to see him frozen alive. They liked the talking cheetahs, but then cried as they tore out the throats of their wolven adversaries. Needless to say the pivotal sacrifice of Aslan had kids screaming and crying.<br/><br/>So be warned, it is a good movie, I liked it. But while there is no blood, there are themes that are far too graphic for young children. This movie should justify a PG-13 rating for this content, though a 13 year old would probably think it was stupid."

","Just got back from seeing this film and thought it was bloody brilliant!!! the actors were perfectly cast, esp james mcavoy as mr.tumnus who i loved! Both the story and essence of the characters from the book were really paid attention to and i don't think they ruined it at all for me, i am a massive fan of the books and look forward to more films being made! All in all a major thumbs up! oh and the music was amazing too, actually don't think there was anything i didn't like about this film, which is quite unusual for me! Found it quite good that although it was filmed in new zealand there was still that essence of britishness about it that was present in the books, i love the 'but we're not heroes we're from finchley' line!!"
"Anaksunamen","10","1","2","12 December 2005"," I Loved it!!!! One of The Best versions Ever Made!!!!!
","Now, back when I was in the fifth grade I remember that we had to read the book of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. I Loved the book and thought it was awesome, I got 100% on my report and we got to watch the 1988 TV movie after everyone handed theirs in.<br/><br/>I've seen the TV version on Masterpiece theater, and I've rented it several times. I loved the attention to detail. Me and my friend had a marathon of the television series a while back and after it my friend turned to me and said ""I would like to see this remade before the end of the millennium."" well, sadly that didn't happen, but now it is 2005 and here we have the first version of this film put to the Silverscreen and.......<br/><br/>Now I am in University, and I was very excited to see this film. I saw it this evening with my friend who had said she wanted to see it remade, and I absolutely loved it!!!!! I appreciated the attention to detail, how they didn't skip on anything,I liked how nothing felt rushed, they took the time to see the statues in the witches castle. I liked all the actors, they did a wonderful job of fulfilling their roles. I liked Lucy especially she was far less whiny sounding in this version than in the TV one. I liked it when a great looking more traditional version of Jolly Old St. Nick leaves and she says to Susan ""told you he was real."" lol This film made me think to myself, I can believe in anything I wan't to believe and no one can tell me otherwise."" If your still a child at heart, you can still believe that there is a sense of magic and wonder in this world and rightly so!! This film had such a mystical and fantastic sense of wonder. Roger Ebert was right when he said ""This Movie has Charm of all things."" It was wonderful to see. I was glad that none of the themes were watered down. The Costumes were beautiful, the Beavers looked a little like Capiveras, I liked the fox, and the river scene, it was an excellent for of suspense, I was extremely glad that Father Christmas was not cut out. ( although I thought he would ask where Edmund was, and I was hoping he would give his sword and shield to the beavers to take with them) Liam nesson's voice did the character of Aslan Honor!! The Battle scene was epic and astoundingly comes as close to greatness as Lord Of The Rings. I was also so glad to see the Polar Bears in this movie that I saw on the Poster, I was worried they would not show up. I thought it was really grand and interesting to see Polar Bears instead of Horses. I enjoyed seeing the Griffins and all the mystical, odd looking creatures that were summoned to fight for both sides. (I think I liked the Minotaurs and Centaurs Especially)<br/><br/>The only thing I was worried about was the white witch, I am very found of Barbara Keelermans version and I was wondering if Tilda Swinton could top it, looking at previews I didn't think so but now having seen the film I can breathe a sigh of relief, for Tilda swinton plays very well indeed, expressing just enough a charm in order to lure Edmund in to her trap, I remember the other one shouted at Edmund a lot! and I thought it was funny how she overplayed it quite a lot.!! I was thinking back to the scene when Edmund walks in on the white witch and she looked like she was yawning and then she goes ""How Dare You!!"" lol that was funny. I am really looking forward to seeing all the other films One thing is for sure, This Verson is definitely going in My Home Video collection."
"ctadoyle","10","1","2","12 December 2005"," Thoughts
","I was highly impressed with the movie. After the first half hour of really getting into it, I never looked at my watch for the rest of the time. From the previews, the special effects looked great but I wasn't so certain of the acting. Lucy's character and range of facial expressions is amazing! Tilda Swintin as The White Witch can raise the hair on your arms with her lightning fast mood swings. The other children were well cast, too. As someone who's been reading the Narnia novels for over 15 years, I was glad to see they stayed pretty true to the story and brought it to life better than ever. I cried during the scene with Aslan, I'll admit. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is beautiful. I've been listening to it since I saw the movie."
"badger-37","7","1","2","12 December 2005"," It is a very, very good Movie
","But it is no ""Lord of the Rings"", more like ""Harry Potter"". I love the books and I think Disney did a good job but I feel they made a serious mistake in ballyhooing the ""allegory thing"". People who come to the movie particularly for that will be disappointed, it is so subtly done that If you hadn't been told about it in advance , you probably would't register on it Those people who stay away because of the ad stress on the allegory, miss a very good movie. Since this is a fantasy{ aimed toward children?} the battle scenes are clean, no gore. Exciting but not frightening. I hope they will continue with the rest of the books in the series. I don't recall any additional allegory in the rest of the books. Hopefully ,those children seeing the movie will be encouraged to read the books and see Narnia for themselves"
"kirstylass1984","10","1","2","12 December 2005"," Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe - amazing film!
","I go to see most films with a sceptical frame of mind, well most films based on my favourite childhood books anyway! Most of the time I feel that it's not just the film that adds to an overall opinion of it. It's environment, it's company, it's the experience! Seeing this film for the first time, was also a first time at the newly built multiplex cinema in town - without advertising i think we can all guess which one it is! The screen was huge, so that sold it for me straight away, the lighting was perfect, and the temperature was toasty-warm. Just right for the weather outside and on the screen! With the film starting as it did, a fictional scene from WW2, i was slightly taken aback as to where that fit into the book - but then i figured, it's Hollywood, we need to allow for some leeway! As the film progressed i was more and more impressed. The actors, i thought,were perfect for the parts, the house, and the professor exactly as i'd imagined it whilst reading it all those years ago.<br/><br/>As the film progressed, i thought the makers got everything down to a tee; the lamppost, Mr Tumnus, Narnia itself. The special effects were out of this world - Aslans legs wobbling slightly as he padded around the children, amazingly realistic. Even the soundtrack was spot on.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling refreshed, that finally Hollywood has got it just right - I don't have a bad word to say about this film...10 out of 10 and highly recommended!"
"evoock","9","1","2","12 December 2005"," Must see this movie!!
","If you enjoyed watching Lord of the Rings, this is the next movie that must be seen. Truly a remarkable film bringing the book series to the big screen. C.S. Lewis may have hated the idea of making a movie of this back in his day, but I am sure he would have marveled at this show. For me, this raised the bar for entertainment. One exception would be the lack of fear coming from the White Witch. Perhaps this was done to prevent little kids from being too scared but as an adult I would have liked to see more than just utter cruelty. I would say it is worth every penny. A non stop action film that involves heart and spirit. This movie will bring out emotion like E.T. and keep you locked in your seat. While the actors are unknown by me, the little girl reminded me of a young Drew Barimore. Please bring your family and friends to this movie, they will all enjoy it!"

I didn't know the movie was over 2 hours long until it was over. It had you from the first few minutes and was absolutely mesmerizing .<br/><br/>Everything about it was fabulous. The actors were great, the special effects were terrific and the storyline was so well done. I'm actually taking my 7 year old son back to see it at the movies versus waiting for it to come out on DVD.

","I am an 8th grade science teacher in Lakeland, Florida. We teach on teams, and the reading teachers on both 8th grade teams had the students read the book in class, either on their own or the teachers read it aloud. Our students were very hooked into the book. So we decided to take them on a field trip to see the movie on Friday the 9th when it came out. We had around 200 students attend a private showing - they had the theater to themselves - it was great.<br/><br/>The student's loved it!!! They laughed, they applauded, they cheered, some even cried!

I loved it and saw it twice opening weekend. To bring to life C.S. Lewis' words and minds eye was amazing and done skillfully, sticking to the true story nearly word for word. Even knowing the story, I hung to the edge of my seat more than once. It is a beautiful film with rich, vibrant color and breathtaking landscaping. The characters and acting are priceless, fitting character to actor skillfully. Aslan is enchanting, frightingly awe-striking and good and gentle all at once. I was not disappointed in Narnia at all and I highly recommend it and can't wait for the second of the chronicles."

"skymovies","7","1","2","6 December 2005"," Ignore the religious tub-thumping; this is one for the kids
","As an adaptation of a much-loved saga of mythical realms and fabulous beasts, largely filmed in New Zealand by a New Zealander, this first Narnian chronicle was always going to invite comparisons to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings juggernaut. But where Middle Earth was shrouded in gloom, Adamson's Narnia is a more welcoming place; a winter wonderland that children would love to explore, White Witch or no.<br/><br/>The tale begins in dark times as the Pevensie children - Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter - are evacuated from blitzed London to the country mansion of twinkly Professor Kirke. During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (well-cast debutant Georgie Henley) stumbles into a room furnished only with a huge wardrobe, at the back of which she finds... a snowbound forest. And has tea with a faun called Tumnus.<br/><br/>Of course, Edmund poo-poohs her story until he follows her and is lured into doing the bidding of wily white witch Jadis (the spikily splendid Tilda Swinton). If he brings her his siblings, he'll get as much Turkish delight as he can eat. Now that's sweet-talk.<br/><br/>When the Pevensies arrive en masse, Tumnus is gone but a kindly Cockney beaver (voiced by Ray Winstone) tells them that only they can fulfil a prophecy to restore peace to Narnia by joining the righteous forces of the noble lion Aslan. But Edmund's treachery sets Jadis and her wolves on a relentless hunt to catch Peter, Susan and Lucy before they reach Aslan's army.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the book's Christian overtones, but while the movie retains the story's core elements it goes easy on the preaching to provide well-intentioned and wholesome entertainment - you know, for kids? Admittedly, the self-sacrifice and subsequent resurrection of Aslan is laid on a bit thick and 'Jadis' does sound like 'Judas'. But it's possible to overlook the biblical themes to enjoy a basic tale of good-versus-evil.<br/><br/>The pacing is brisk and the denizens of Narnia are nicely rendered (though the green-screen work is a bit shonky), from the earthly beavers and wolves to minotaurs, griffons, centaurs and cyclops(es?).<br/><br/>Grown-ups will appreciate it as a cynicism-free breath of nostalgia... but they may have to keep an eye on the kids when they next go shopping for bedroom furniture.<br/><br/>Just a few questions to ponder: where's Aslan been the last 100 years when he's needed? Why aren't the beavers afraid of humans wearing fur coats? How come Lucy's potion heals the most horrific wounds but not a cut lip? And why are all evil creatures - white witches excepted - ugly? Lord knows."
"daughterofEve","10","1","2","11 December 2005"," Very good!
","This was an AMAZING movie! The story was very true to the book, and as someone who has read them since I was little, I know the story back and forth. Aslan's voice was wonderful, the White Witch was chillingly evil. And the Pevensie children were wonderful actors! Lucy was so convincing she had a natural talent for acting, Edmund grabbed your heart and you felt so sorry for him. Susan was very convincing as the older sister who thought everything out, and Peter did wonderfully as the older brother taking care of the younger siblings.There were only a few times when the matting for the movie was off, and it was noticeable. The added scenes went along with the story wonderfully, and did not break the rhythm at all. I really hope this is not the only Narnia movie to be made, it was so good!!!!!"
"shadow-moses","9","1","2","11 December 2005"," Nothing like rodents acting!
","Chronicles of Narnia is a fantastic film. The children are very well cast, each has very distinctive and believable differences and characteristics (plus I couldn't help but adore little Lucy, her cuteness is lethal!) Narnia itself is very well done. Through great sets, locations and special effects it gives the strong feeling of an unearthly fantasy land.<br/><br/>My single favorite aspect of this film was this: animals giving realistic acting! When the children meet the beaver couple, the performance those beavers, and all the other animated animals is totally believable. Their facial expressions and body language are very natural and believable. After seeing this I can't help but feel a Redwall film is not far away.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this film regards the lead-up to battle scene. I do not remember how it was done in the book, but I feel the film could have benefited from a few minuets of army-gathering and arming. Peter Jackson said the build up of armies adds tension and anticipation to the film and I have to agree, here it feels like ""ok kids, heres your armies, have fun!"" Other then this, I loved this film."

"Arcane00Tears","10","1","2","11 December 2005"," None
","This movie is now the best movie I have ever seen. Aslan was done beautifully, the battle was AWESOME, and it was pretty true to the book. Some things were a bit off and some things were added. And that whole Christianity thing? Oh just clamp your jaws. I am a Christian and I didn't even think twice about the whole Jesus as Aslan dying on the cross/stone table thing. The book was more Christian-like to me. The movie was more about Edmund becoming a man, Peter becoming a leader, Lucy becoming grown up and realizing responsibility and Susan the same. I am a HARDCORE reader of the Narnia series and it is one of my favorites. I believe the director did an excellent job with re-doing it. My standards (which are pretty high, especially for this movie) have been reached. I can't wait for them to do the rest of the books. Disney is FINALLY redeeming themselves! Overall, my new favorite movie of all time."
"grayure","9","1","2","11 December 2005"," Surprisingly good
","I was hoping that this would be good but somewhat dubious about it, but when i saw it i was relieved to discover that it actually was quite good. It stuck quite closely to the book, and when it deviated it did so in appropriate ways - none of the deviations seemed tacked on. I was impressed by the presentation of a particular icon of popular culture, who was presented in a way that harked back to how he was portrayed before commercialism got hold of him, and i wished he could become the new standard. The religious aspects of the film were neither under- nor overstated, and it worked fine on the level of an adventure film and as an allegory. I was very emotionally involved, partly because of having read the books as a child until they fell to bits, and i was actually moved to tears once. It was also so much better than the BBC TV version, and in that i'm talking about acting rather than special effects or scenery. However, the special effects did make me think that when they finally do 'His Dark Materials' in cinematic form, it will be able to do justice to those books too.<br/><br/>If they do decide to do the other books, i would certainly go to see them as well, and they would have the advantage of having good writing to back it up.<br/><br/>The only problem was that the climax of the film was too drawn out.<br/><br/>I'm amazed Disney could do a children's film that was actually good."
"horsecrazy6791","10","1","2","11 December 2005"," Everything I thought it would be...and more!
","Wow!! I have to say that Narnia is by far the best fantasy adventure movie I have seen in my entire life! I'm not A huge fan of Harry Potter like lots of people I know, However I really liked The Lord of the Rings...But not nearly as much as this movie. When I got to the theater on the day Narnia was released, it was already packed with people! Some who walked in slightly late even had to leave=) I thought that Georgie Henley, the little girl who played Lucy was adorable, and she did so well considering she has never acted before. This little girl played her part remarkably and I don't think there is another child actress out there that could have done better. Hopefully she'll be in more upcoming movies, because it's good to have a variety of children in movies instead of the same ones over and over, such as Dakota Fanning. Even though I love her amazing personality and acting abilities, she has been in so many recent movies! Dakota is so in demand right now that she doesn't even have to audition for her movies anymore! Anyways, to get back on topic, this little girl was just so amazing, and so cute. I loved her.<br/><br/>The other actors/actresses did great too! William Moseley, the guy who played Peter acted like a responsible older brother to his three siblings, looked after them and was brave enough to fight for Narnia. I think his acting abilities are pretty amazing, especially since he hasn't been in many movies besides Narnia. Skandar Keynes, who played Edmund did great in this movie too. His character was the second youngest of the four children, and he was the second to go through the wardrobe and into the magical world of Narnia. I thought he did really well. Last but not least, Anna Popplewell, who played Susan, the second oldest of the four. She did an awesome job as well. Her character was supposed to be friendly, but a little boring. At times she tries to act smart and superior to the rest of her siblings. Overall, I thought they all did an excellent job! <br/><br/>Another thing I loved about this movie was how close and precise it was to the original story. After seeing the movie, I came home and found The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe book in my closet. I started reading it, and it felt like I was watching the movie all over again. They did such a good job keeping it like the original, and I was so glad because I hate it when people take classics and ruin them by changing them too much.<br/><br/>All in all, this is such a wonderful, magical movie, and I loved it!! If you are thinking you won't like it because it seems like a kids movie, it's not. Narnia is a great movie for all ages, and C.S Lewis would be so proud. Definitely a 10/10."

The visual effects weren't perfect, but they satisfy. And this movie doesn't fail to keep you interested for the whole time. You'll be on the edge of your seat for a majority of the time, particularly during the final battle. It was ""Lord of the Rings"" toned down, basically.<br/><br/>And the audience agreed with me. They cheered when it was necessary and when it wasn't necessary. They also booed whenever the White Witch came on screen. It was really fun in there.<br/><br/>Not that this movie has some faults.

","This movie was very good, but a little violent. It makes me curious to see how they will create the creatures in a local production of Narnia.Lucy was very dramatic, Edmund was just mean, Susan was protective and Peter was brave. Aslan's name is impossible to pronounce (is it Az-lan or As-lin)? I jumped at a few periods in the movie. It was definitely worth the money I payed to see it. Pretty similar to what I've read in the book. Saddest part-When Aslan is sacrificed. Funniest part-When Father Christmas came and they thought is was the White Witch.

The film remained true to the story although I was disappointed that Mrs Beaver did not try to take her sewing machine with her when they left the dam! The acting was generally great although Georgia's (who played Lucy)immaturity showed with some slight acting downsides. I was amazed at the reality of Aslan's character and felt he appeared very realistic except when he was running with Susan and Lucy on his back - that, I felt, was a slight flaw in an otherwise exceptional series of animations.<br/><br/>In my opinion, much better than the 1980s BBC version!"

","I was planning to take my nine year old grandson to see Narnia but, after seeing it by myself last night, I have my doubts unless he has already read the book. I had never read the Narnia series, and so, although I knew that one of the characters was a Christ symbol, I did not know the details as to how things work themselves out. I found the CGI elements to be extremely well done. I thought the children were well portrayed, especially the oldest boy and the youngest girl. But I felt the suspense during the ""death"" of Aslan and the injury of the younger brother during the battle very keenly, and don't think it is appropriate for many children. A PG-13 might have been a better rating."

","Being a big fan of the books, I went into this movie with no expectations, afraid that I would only be disappointed. But I could not have been more happily surprised. If you're a fan of the book you'll notice a few changes, but none of them seemed to detract from the story. They all fit and made the action move a bit faster and added a bit more tension, which was bound to happen. The only thing I didn't like was the appearance of the White Witch. Tilda Swinton did a fantastic job playing her, but I found her look distracting, it really didn't fit with the image I had in my head. Everyone else, though, was spot-on. When I first saw Lucy I thought she was too young, but twenty minutes into the film I couldn't imagine anyone else. Georgie Henly is quite the talented ten-year-old. I can't wait to see what they do with the other Chronicles."

My family and I could have stayed in the theater for another hour of this movie. We certainly hope that more of these are made. We watched a show called Beyond Narnia about C.S. Lewis prior to seeing the movie. That show really put things together for the movie. The settings for the movie and the acting are all fantastic. The beavers really draw you in as two ornery characters. The Ice Queen is about as scary a villain as you would ever want to see. She is the nice to your face and stab you in the back villain that we can all relate to all to well this day in age and obviously when the book was written. In this classic battle of good versus evil, it was very easy to find yourself on the good side and cheering them on! This will be a ""must have"" DVD when it comes out. Absolutely Top Notch!

Anna Popplewell, Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson MPAA RATING: PG for Battle sequences and frightening moments RUNTIME:<br/><br/>Story: 4.5/5 Acting: 5/5 Sound: 5/5 Visuals: 4.5/5 Endorphin Factor: 4/5 Big Screen Experience: 5/5 Scoring system: Average: 4.6/5<br/><br/>MOVIES IT COULD BE COMPARED TO: Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Harry Potter films <br/><br/>DETAILS: So Thomas7g and I are talking, and we bring up the Yahoo IMVironment on chat for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. As we're talking, I tell him that although the first preview looked good, it really wasn't on my dradis for priority movies this holiday season. However, when I went to Narnia.com, and checked out the new trailer, my mind was immediately changed, and so off I went to take in what looked like a very promising movie.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. The film really does stand out well, and even with only my vague memories of having read some of the C.S. Lewis classic (and seen the animated feature that was broadcast on CBS many years ago), I fully understood the story. The actors in the film were all perfectly cast, and played their roles to perfection. Liam Neeson, as the voice of Aslan, was easily recognizable.<br/><br/>The visual effects were damn good, but much of it could be easily discerned as CGI. The sound effects rocked, and I loved the soundtrack to this film. Might just have to pick it up.<br/><br/>There was an awful lot of crying in this movie...more than I remember seeing in previous incarnations. <br/><br/>There were good laughs, and much of them came from either the talking animals, or from Lucy, the youngest of the four siblings who is actually a little wise beyond her years.<br/><br/>The Witch, Jadis (Tilda Swenton) was ferocious in this movie. At first, when I saw her, I thought it was Alice Kriege (The Borg Queen from Star Trek: First Contact), but the accent told me otherwise. Nonetheless, Jadis was a bad ass...especially in battle.<br/><br/>Fantasy movies are really starting to see their heyday, with the overwhelming success of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and the Harry Potter movies. This film looks to continue that heyday with great success. In fact, it's actually made me get up the urge to give the LOTR movies another chance.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: I'd still have to prefer the Harry Potter films over this, but The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is a beautiful film in its own right, and will find its way into my DVD collection upon release.<br/><br/>Respectfully, Martok2112"

","I grew up reading these books. They were my life's blood. I read it for the first time in the summer before 3rd grade and was captivated by it. I read it over, and over again. Those books were some of my favorite childhood memories. Sitting in the theater watching my favorite story unfold before my eyes was an amazing feat. They captured it ever so well and Liam Neeson was brilliant. The White Witch was terrifying yet so regal. Aslan himself was also an oxymoron almost. He seemed so dangerous, and yet in his eyes so gentle. The graphics on him were very detailed, from every hair on his head even to his eyebrows! There were moments of suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat even though you know what happens (if you have read the book). The children were genius, each of them showing maturity in some moments. You feel connected with them all. It is a great movie for any age. It is however a boarder line PG movie. There was no blood shown which is most likely the only thing keeping it from being a PG13. I highly recommend this film."
"jbarczewski","10","1","2","10 December 2005"," A wonderful movie!!
","We just got out of seeing this movie opening weekend and all I can say is Wow! What a great movie! I really wasn't familiar with CS Lewis's books before tonight, but now I will be reading them and recommending them to my family. My 10 yr old daughter really enjoyed this movie as well, it is enjoyable for the whole family.<br/><br/>This is one of those blockbuster movies...it sold out several of the performances this evening. My line for the Mega screen filled up the entire lobby of the theater. And after it was all said and done, the theater erupted with cheers and clapping when the credits finally ran, well done Disney and Walden Media, well done.<br/><br/>I will be going back to see this again to pick up on some of the finer points and symbolism of the story line and this will be one of the DVD's that I add to my collection.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, your whole family will enjoy it! The storyline and the underlying message are first class."
"plegowik","9","1","2","10 December 2005"," A very worthwhile film
","In a family with more than one child, how can each child be made to feel special? C. S. Lewis solves this quandary by making it logical for a kingdom to have four thrones--one for each child in the four-child family who are the protagonists of this film. C. S. Lewis surely remembered his childhood and recreates a magical, wondrous world, the kind we all know before puberty clamps down on our imaginative powers. Everything about the film drew me in--the mythic creatures, the talking animals, the gorgeous scenery. And the White Witch! what an ice queen! I don't remember the actress's name, but she is the most memorable character of the film (certainly had me shivering in my skin). . . well, the youngest child (don't remember her name either) is pretty memorable, too. This is a very worthwhile film."
"ret0712","9","1","2","10 December 2005"," Jack Would Be Proud!
","Adamson has done a faithful-to-the-original job! I read the book back in the early '70's and didn't understand some of the images, but this was a treat to watch. It does a much better job of representing Lewis's work then the earlier versions. I found myself relating scenes in this film to other works by Lewis (the scene where the children are walking in the grassy valley, on their way to meet Aslan, reminded me of a scene described in ""The Great Divorce""). It's always a wonderful experience when the anticipation pays off in an excellently crafted film. Thank you Andrew Adamson & Douglas Gresham for a visually beautiful & esthetically faithful version of this classic. Jack would be proud!"
"doboyski","9","1","2","10 December 2005"," Terrific Family Film (ages 3-11)
","Great family film. We took the kids (3, 6, 11), all of whom enjoyed it at some level. It held the attention of the three-year-old--no mean feat for a live-action movie. He talked about it all afternoon. The six-year-old loved it. The 11-year-old, the critic that read all seven books, liked it a lot.<br/><br/>No sex, double entendre or innuendo. No foul language at all. There's some violence, but nothing remotely graphic. We see no blood or gore of any kind. There are some scenes that are startling and a couple that are scary, but I don't think there are any nightmare-inducers (though ask me tomorrow morning).<br/><br/>The White Witch is a little intense, but it's good to see a villain who is just bad and not the helpless, misunderstood victim of some psychological tragedy that should excuse or mitigate her behavior. She does it because she's evil, pure and simple.<br/><br/>We'll buy this one for the collection, and watch it many, many times. It's a rare film that works for all the members of the family. To us, that's as good as gold."

"ureshinamida","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," Not as bad as some people make it out to be
","Almost everyone is in love with C.S. Lewis' Narnia series. I honestly was not sure if this movie would be too successful (Talking beavers? A villain whose sleigh is pulled by polar bears?) but when I saw it today the theater was packed with people of all ages.<br/><br/>It almost feels like the creators wanted to make another Lord of the Rings, but honestly I found myself cracking up during the battle scenes; I could only take the armies of polar bears and cheetahs so seriously. Sometimes I got the feeling that I should be enjoying the movie much more than I was. The sets and visual effects are spectacular, but then again what major movie *doesn't* have good effects with the technology and talent available in 2005? Aside from a few really fun and mesmerizing scenes, I never felt taken into Narnia."
"Allen-31","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," I thought it was really good
","Just saw the movie today. MUCH better than I expected it would be. I was dreading 2-1/2 hours of Hollywood ""fantasy"" piffle. But it appears the director took his cues from LOTR and Harry Potter. The effects serve the story, not the other way around. And the story is what REALLY sells this picture combined with the great cinematography. It's a very faithful rendition of what I remember from reading the book so long ago. The acting is the only weak part, largely because of the kids being relatively new. Tilda is fantastic as the White Witch. And the talking animals do not seem overtly silly as I feared. Aslan is wonderful. Even Mr. Tummus is quite good. So the kids' acting abilities are more are more than made up for by experienced cast members.<br/><br/>And anyone who has it in their head that this is a ""Christian"" movie and fear being evangelized by it, not to worry. The brilliance of Narnia is that it doesn't preach and doesn't hit you in the head with a sledgehammer in order to point out the Christian parallels. And you can read as much Christian allegory into it as you want. It's not hard (speaking as a non-Christian) to approach this movie with a deep liking for Aslan's spiritual nature and the common themes of love, good, evil, betrayal, redemption, and forgiveness in this film. In fact if all that wasn't there, it would be a visually pretty but ultimately empty piece of Hollywood fluff. Of course people will compare it to ""The Lord of the Rings"" which is a much more mature work. But as an adaptation of a children's story, I think they did a fine job.<br/><br/>Treat yourself and go see it. Fair warning though. The theater I went to was packed with little kids, many under age 7. I don't think kids that young are going to get that much from the film. I often heard young voices piping up asking questions and parents working to shush them. Fortunately I was sitting far enough away from most of the kids, so it wasn't too distracting.<br/><br/>P.S. -- It pays to linger a little bit after the credits start rolling. There's a nice little end scene that suddenly cuts in about a minute or so after the credits start. Don't rush for the exit."
"cwei-1","Null","1","2","10 December 2005"," Narnia - magic comes true!
","I just went back from the movie. It was so crowded...just like Star Wars EP3. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe novels were my favorite when I was in elementary school. I remembered after reading all the series of novels, I wondered why there was no one making movies (not mini TV program) for Narnia. Until now, thanks for ILM and WETA's cooperation. At last, the magic comes true! The director Andrew Adamson and all other creative crews visualize the story in novels. Basically, I think the adaption of this movie from the novel is excellent. Such as the white witch, she is just like what was in my mind while I was reading the novel. I think most readers will not be disappointed. I find it is a Disney movie and it is for kids; thus there is no blood and much violence in this movie. (Unlike the lord of the ring trilogy, it is basically for adults and it is quite violent and bloody, but Istill love it, and it is very realistic) I think I can say it is ""the lord of the ring - kid edition"". The movie score composed by Harry Gregson-Williams is great and touching. Special effects and Visual effects are extraordinary. They are quite realistic. Most of the sequences are just like what they were in my mind while I was a child. After seeing it, I was moved. Finally, this classical stories are on the wild screen just like the lord of the ring, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and so on. I heard most other people saying that they love this movie when leaving the theater. I do really look forward to the next Narnia movies! Go see it! No matter you have read the novels or not."
"gmpressley","10","1","2","10 December 2005"," A very faithful rendering of the book....
","Chronicles captures the book well, including many of the important nuances. The entire effect of the film, however, will be to render even to the most faithful reader a better, more complete understanding of the book. Just great....kids should see it, young adults, and the old folks, too! <br/><br/>For those who have read the entire Chronicles, something that really matters is how well the movie provides insight into the characters of the four children. The real mystery child is Susan, and viewers should pay special attention to her actions and reactions. Viewers should also note the time slippage between Narnia and England, for that is key to understanding the other books. <br/><br/>There are two ways to read the Chronicles...in the order they were written or in order of events in Narnia, as they are usually arranged now. If you are intrigued by Narnia after the film, the Magician's Nephew, the first volume in the beginning of Narnia to end of Narnia sequencing of the books, will answer some key questions---like why that Lamppost is there?...And where did the wardrobe come from?...And why Professor Kirke is likely to believe the children? My bet is that there is going to be a whole lot of reading of all seven volumes of the Chronicles in the next year....The 50th Anniversary edition with colored versions of the original Paula Baynes illustrations is worth its weight in gold. <br/><br/>See the movie, read Lion Witch Wardrobe, and then reading the other six. Unlike Lord of the Rings, most of the loose ends are tied by the end of the read. If Hollywood undertakes to produce the other six books, there are some great motion pictures ahead, but they are going to need special effects that go way beyond this first picture, for the full magic of Narnia is only hinted at in LWW. You simply don't stop reading once you start because the magic just gets better and better."
"Flower_of_the_Lily","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," Like being ten years old again
","Wonderful way to spend an evening! I had my doubts going into the cinema (the early trailers reminded me more of a Series of Unfortunate Events than Narnia) but any fears I had proved unfounded. Although not a flawless work, it is an extremely well-crafted, entertaining one. The film opens amidst the London Blitz of WWII, which results in the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) being evacuated to the countryside for safety (there's a compelling moment at the London station as Peter gazes at a soldier who's only a couple of years older than he is) where of course, the whole story kicks into high gear.<br/><br/>The early scenes, though necessary, are a touch slow (apart from one literally explosive bombing raid at the start) and are used mainly to serve as our introduction to the children. However, once the wardrobe is discovered, the magic moments come thick and fast - particular favourites are Lucy's first visit and meeting with Mr. Tumnus the faun, the appearance of Father Christmas, the charming Beavers, the whole waterfall sequence, and of course Aslan (a triumph of CGI - I swear you'll be dying to stroke him) and the climactic battle at the end of the story.<br/><br/>There are some genuinely dark moments amidst all this, balanced out by some wonderful humour from the talking animals. The negative aspects are few and far between - the ending felt a bit rushed, and the characterisation of the children was a bit overdone; half-way through the film you'll probably feel like saying ""yes, Peter doubts himself but is ultimately a hero, Susan's the bossy one, Edmund the sulky one, we get it already!"" But these are minor gripes when the entire spectacle can produce the wide-eyed wonder you'd thought you'd left behind with childhood - particular acting kudos goes to a deliciously malicious Tilda Swinton as Jadis the White Witch, Liam Neeson as Aslan, and Georgie Henley who makes a wonderfully appealing, brave Lucy. A wonderful Christmas treat for kids and grown-ups who still tap the back of the wardrobe ... just in case."
"tesnath","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," Awesome Movie
","One of the best I've seen. Although not as good as LOTR. Although I was quite surprise why IMDb didn't list Liam Neeson as Aslan in the Crew list. but other than that I do recommend this movie. However there was too much Christian overtones. A lot of action which is a good thing. This movie will not bored you. Liam Neeson does a very good job, but i found the children to be average. I don't recommend the movie for younger children. There are a lot of scary scenes. If you love fantasy and action then this movie for you.It is similar to Lotr. There talking trees and animals. I particular like the beavers and the lion. I hope you found this recommendation useful"
"dale_jr_fan","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," Excellent
","Where to begin? This movie affected me in ways that are hard to describe. The best description I can think of is The Passion Of The Christ meets Lord Of The Rings, since so many of the central elements and themes from each of these movies are uniquely blended together in TCON:The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. The insights of C.S. Lewis as someone of faith, which the movie is faithful to, are instructive, yet the fairy tale theme makes the mind attempt to object to the setting of the movie, since the central themes are not fairly tales. It has so many touching moments where the teachings of Christianity are hard to miss. When Aslan sacrifices himself, it is very moving, and the scene is made even more touching by Lucy's and Susan's reaction to those events before and after they occur. This movie has it all: wholesome and instructive themes, suspense and mystery, comedy, a bit of violence, good vs. evil conflict, convincing performances, and dazzling special effects. This movie is a must see, as it has something for both adults and children, with no profanity or nudity. The battle scenes at the end may upset very young children though, so parents with young children may want to see it first without the kids to determine it their kids can handle it. There are a couple of things about the movie though that I do take issue with, which is my reason for not giving it a perfect rating. First, when Walden Media have movie options on all seven books in TCON, why did they stray from the order in which C.S. Lewis intended for the books to be read. It seems to me that The Magician's Nephew should have been made into a movie first. It provides background information for The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe: The creation of Narnia, The origin of the White Witch, The origin of the lamppost out in the middle of the woods, ""Professor Kirke's"" true relationship to the story, and the origin of the wardrobe and how it came to be a link between Narnia and our world. All these points will be lost on those who haven't read the books. I also take issue with the made up scene when Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and the children are escaping from the White Witch. This scene is not true to the book."
"trynityseven","9","1","2","10 December 2005"," A new favorite for me...a good reason for other parents to pause...
","I've been anticipating the arrival of this film since I first heard rumors it would be made. I became a great fan of the Lewis works as a teenager and have loved sharing them with my children as an adult. The film version was true to the novel - nothing seemed terribly watered down or removed as is so often the case with film versions of classic novels.<br/><br/>I was enthralled with the choices made for actors for all parts. Swinton (the White Witch) could not have been more aptly cast. The children all shouldered their roles with believability and grace.<br/><br/>The direction, art direction, score, and cgi were all first rate save two scenes in the film. There were two moments when my friend and I both agreed the combining of actors with background or scenery was less than seamless. There a few very minor details that are additions which are not in the book. But those add visually to the story and do not at all detract.<br/><br/>Lastly, I like to leave some information for parents trying to make a decision about letting children see this film. Spoilers will follow: There is one scene in this film in particular that I believe might be frightening to the point of worry for parents of very young or very sensitive children. The Stone Table scene where Aslan comes to the White Witch is imagined by Adamson in such a manner that the creatures loyal to the witch are quite grotesque and many may find them frightening. Some more conservative parents may find the battle scene between the armies of Aslan and the White Witch just a bit too realistic despite the absence of blood or gore. I personally have decided my children should wait for the small screen version (I think the large screen has a much more profound impact visually) and they are age 8, 7, 6, and 3 (I wouldn't let my 3 year old see it at all just yet). The Christian allegory is not altered or watered down by the film imagining. For non Christians the book and film version are amazing stories in their own right, and for the Christian the parallels between the story of Christ and this first of the Chronicles of Narnia are hard to miss (for those who do not know the story of how the Chronicles were first written, this allegory was intentional) <br/><br/>All in all, this film is magnificent. I absolutely loved it. It was so well done and well put together that I won't be surprised if we see Best Picture nods early next year. If you loved the book, you'll not be disappointed by this film. 9 out of 10 stars (with one deducted for 2 moments of less-than-seamless cinematography and cgi combination)"
"Adreamerisme","10","1","2","10 December 2005"," Our Hope Is Restored!!
","This movie was superb. it brought hope to me. hope that there are still good movies out there and there still are good writers and director. and yes, i have been a fan of The Chronicles of Narnia since i was a little girl. i was so afraid that it was going to suck. because it it did i think i would have been very depressed. this movie was so much like the book. they only changed a few things, and what they did change was an improvement. i am not saying that the book needed improvement, but what they did was perfect. i have no complaints. this is a movie i can see many many times! thank you Andrew Adamson for not ruining my life! this movie saved my life..."
"Othy59","6","1","2","10 December 2005"," Great Rendition for Children and Adults Alike
","Ever since the departure of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy there has been a huge gap left in fantasy cinema since then. Now Disney is obviously trying to fill in the gap with a big screen rendition of CS Lewis' (Tolkien's college friend and fellow fantasy enthusiast) seven-part fantasy saga The Chronicles of Narnia. Though, in my mind, that LotR gap can never be filled, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe does a damn good job at keeping our love of epic fantasy going.<br/><br/>Staying true to the book (with some extra added scenes to explain a little more depth of the story) and using a lot of the books dialogue this is an enjoyable treat for all the family. Though some of the performances are a little wooden, from the actors such as Liam Neeson for example and the kids especially. Even Tilda Swinton, who looked fantastic as Jadis, the White Witch, could have put a bit more malice and venomousness to the role. But this is the films only fault. The final battle is excellent (some bloody deaths could have been added, but that's just me) and the effects are satisfactory (I would have like to have seen some real animals used every now and then).<br/><br/>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great teat for the whole family leaving a sweet taste for the next installment, the Horse and His Boy. Just look out for some familiar props from Lord of the Rings like the circular sharpening stone, or, if you look carefully, the sword Narsil itself in the hands of a petrified Centaur."
"jtaqd","8","1","2","10 December 2005"," A Good Yarn
","Although not in the same league with the already legendary Lord of the Rings pictures, director Andrew Adamson (of Shrek heritage) has brought C.S. Lewis' ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" to the silver-screen with unusual humanity and style. In a courageous attempt to capitalize on recent trends of audience infatuation with the fantasy genre Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures brought us an expensive yet delightful holiday treat in the form of ""The Lion with Witch and the Wardrobe"". <br/><br/>A great many things about Adamson's adaptation of the Lewis books are very impressive. Interestingly though I did not feel startled by the quality of special effects. Perhaps LOTR/ WETA have ruined my view of effects for several years to come. But despite lacking a great many new thrills in the technology department Adamson has other tricks up his sleeve. I was especially impressed with the performances of the film's most integral parts, the Pevensie children. Despite risks of being overwhelmed by the abundance of CG characters, landscapes, and the resulting scenes, the four young actors who took on the lead roles of Lewis' valiant children proved themselves by excelling in almost every category. Skandar Keynes did well in producing the necessary audience feelings of disdain and eventual embrace of his surly but lovable Edmund. Anna Popplewell seemed like an old hand compared to her co-stars and handled her screen-time with grace and poise that is enviable for many of today's stars. William Moseley did justice to the character but he failed to make a resounding statement with his performance (I would be surprised if he is successful in turning his Narnia time into a long-term career). However, the most remarkable scenes in Narnia are not produced by the grandeur of special effects but instead by a tiny little girl named Georgie Henley. In the history of the cinema directors have shown sick fascination with hinging their films on the performances of children. While most people remember the positive moments in the history of film and children e.g. ""Sixth Sense"", ""E.T."", ""Oliver!"" there have been a hundred times as many distinct failures (Brandon De Wilde's ""Shane"" is my personal favorite). And in other cases failure has not been outright and is instead replaced by mediocrity of child performers which has led to mediocrity of the film as well e.g. ""The Road to Perdition"". Although her performance is not what the film hinges upon for its overall effect it might as well have because 10 year-old Georgie Henley provides the deepest magic you find in Narnia. Henley completely pulled me into the story every instant in which she was the focus of a scene. Her on-screen communication does not even walk a fine line with overacting, it remains perfectly within the boundaries of subtlety and magnificently communicates the innocence and fiery spirit of her character. My favorite scenes of the film are played out between Henley's Lucy and James McAvoy's good-hearted faun Mr. Tumnus (McAvoy is particularly outstanding among the supporting players).<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton's turn as the white witch was a primary reason for my interest in the film. However, I was relatively unimpressed with how her performance played out. Certainly Swinton did an admirable job but she lacked anything extra that truly made her stand out amidst the quagmire of CG characters. This role could have kept Swinton in mainstream villainous or powerful female parts for life but I am afraid she did not do enough with her screen time to justify any special attention. She will likely never become a contemporary of Cate Blanchett as she, and her promoters, may want her to be. Jim Broadbent's precious few moments of screen-time are everything any Broadbent fan would want them to be. He handles himself as always with unequivocal dignity and produces a fantastic sense of mystery as the ancient and secretive professor.<br/><br/>The quality of voice acting is certainly good. Ray Winstone, Rupert Everett, Dawn French and many other talented individuals lent their professionalism to the project and they add to Narnia's mystical ambiance marvelously. Liam Neeson took on the difficult role of Aslan (Narnia's equivalent of the Messiah) and I am sad to report that he simply does not have the ability to voice a lion like James Earl Jones (Mufassa from Lion King). Neeson has proved himself time and again to be one of the great modern-day thespians but he just lacks the power Aslan needed (and could only be provided in my view by Jones).<br/><br/>As a whole Narnia presents itself as a very good children's fantasy epic. However, Lewis' high focus on child content will leave Narnia out of any serious consideration for awards and status in the history of movie-making. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's will stand a test of time that Narnia cannot and will not. Still, Andrew Adamson's direction shows that he has the stuff to be a lasting directorial force in Hollywood (and with the success of the Shrek film's why not?). Not only does Adamson strut his technical stuff he also displays an uncanny understanding of what makes a movie humanistic and fantastic without exploiting or stretching an audience's collective imagination. He and his screen-writers cleverly expanded on Lewis' storyline (which lacked many necessary establishing factors) and did so without losing any of Lewis' charm or intent.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a Good Yarn that is worth seeing."

Last Christmas, we'd had the very entertaining Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Alas, it has not lingered long in the memory, and I fear that this adaptation, despite being entertaining, will follow suit. Like Lemony Snicket, it wants to be a young children's fantasy, and succeeds on that level to a greater extent. After all, it has a higher pedigree. The problem only begins when director Andrew Adamson (of Shrek fame) starts trying to emulate Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>This, the first of the Chronicles Of Narnia (there should be many more to come) begins with the four Pevensie children - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) sent to the house of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) during World War II. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy decides to hide in the wardrobe, and while moving towards the back, finds herself in the kingdom of Narnia. Many surprises and adventures follow, not just for Lucy, but for all the Pevensie kids.<br/><br/>I think there are many treats in store for those who haven't read the book. Now I knew that Narnia was ""in the wardrobe"" (who didn't?) but I didn't anticipate the several interesting characters and remarkable visuals that were to be seen in Narnia. Not that they eclipse the young leads - all four are credible, and I'm sure they will go on to even bigger things. The biggest names in the cast - Jim Broadbent (in a cameo) and Tilda Swinton, don't disappoint, with Swinton being especially chilling as the White Witch. Recognisable voices are all over the place, from Ray Winstone to Dawn French to Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Friends of mine have told me the film is very faithful to the book. That seems like another huge plus point, and in a way I suppose it is. But it's worth pointing out that what works so well on the page does not always work so well on the screen. I discovered this when watching Tim Burton's attempts to recreate classic moments from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory; however well he did them technically, they lacked a spark.<br/><br/>It seems that Adamson realises this, and it's at that point he enters LotR territory. Before long you will see (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) birds soaring from overhead in a key battle, the ""resurrections"" of important characters, a ""crowning"" moment - it's all been done before, and done better, by Peter Jackson. Even the effects were better in LotR - just compare some of the computerised animals to Gollum and you will see what I mean. Additionally, there's some blatant blue screening on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>It's not that the battles are bad. They do have their effective moments, such as a memorable duel between Peter and the White Witch, but they sometimes border on tedium and confusion. And the film is not without its moments of unbearable cheese - just watch, for example, how some characters are ""resurrected"".<br/><br/>Despite the best efforts of Andrew Adamson and his crew, the order of things in the fantasy world hasn't changed. The Chronicles Of Narnia have got off to a satisfactory start, but Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings are still - clearly - in front.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","this was incredible! it stuck close to the book, without being boring. there was all the magic of the big screen, without detracting from the message. the music and camera work was amazingly dramatic. also, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. and while at some points, you have to laugh at the sheer absurdity (ie when you first see the head of the ""secret police"" at Cair Paravel), overall the fantasy is as realistic as possible :). the theme stands out clearly and leaves you feeling satisfied. the casting was well done and Lucy is beyond adorable. the action builds well, the progression of events is in no way drastically altered from the book, the actors do an incredible job of conveying earnesty and intensity, and Aslan shines. all in all? this movie is every bit as powerful and enjoyable as i'd expect from something based on a work of C.S.Lewis"
"imaginarytruths","6","1","2","9 December 2005"," Slavishly faithful to the source material, a little perfunctory but mostly pretty good
","Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I adored these books when I was in the fourth grade. I am a good deal older and more cynical now, but I recall the books with a great deal of affection. I was wary about the film, both because it seemed like an attempt to cash in on the success of the Potter and LOTR films, and also because the books never seemed particularly cinematic to me (so much of it being things that only make sense from the point of view of a child). <br/><br/>The film opens with shots of German planes in the sky during the Battle of Britain. We're introduced to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go scrambling into the bomb shelter adjacent to their London home. It's a nice touch, a context that is only mentioned in passing in the book but which benefited from a more explicit showing now that WWII has faded from our collective memory. The film then proceeds with the events of the book, matching developments very closely. The four child actors play it all with a very English sort of reserve, which is a nice departure from the ""needs their Ritalin"" kids of many contemporary films, but it also mutes the sense of wonder sometimes. With the exception of a few moments between the very young Lucy and Tumnus the fawn, the kids accept what happens to them and how their lives are changed with relative nonchalance. They're good, and it's good to watch them as they endure and develop, but they're hard to relate to. <br/><br/>Turning to the ideological content of the film, the Christian metaphor becomes pretty explicit (perhaps even moreso than in the book). It didn't bother me per se, but I can see that becoming an issue for militant atheists. It IS a propaganda piece for the values that C.S. Lewis associated with Christianity at its best, but even as an agnostic I have respect for most of those values. I was bothered somewhat by the strident militancy of the last third of the film. There's a blend of childish awe and violence in the battle scenes that doesn't sit well with me, though to the filmmakers' credit they are just reproducing the tone of the book. But it's such a naive view of war, and it's so bizarre to set up these kids in a setting that plays like something out of Braveheart or Return of the King except with the miracle of no blood being shed. The mixing of violence and innocence, with religious overtones, is fundamentally disturbing to me.<br/><br/>Still, it's a good story well-told, and the filmmakers show a deep reverence for Lewis' writing and tremendous special effects know-how to bring it into motion."

","I've been looking forward to the release of Narnia for a long time and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed! The characters are wonderfully brought to life with every detail of the book shining through. I found at points the acting a little stilted but this does not detract from the overall brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>Conversion of such a loved book to film format would not have been an easy transition but the reason I feel it was so successful is that you can really see the love that the production team and cast members had while the film was in the making.<br/><br/>The film to me was every bit as fantastical and enchanting as the book was when I first read it. There is an emotional aspect to both the book and the film that I feel are quite unique and it is something that I have not found anywhere else.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to people of all ages and especially if your a fan of the book!

","Just got back earlier from seeing Narnia. It was a good movie. It was not Lord of the Rings good, but then neither are the books. The books were made as children's stories, and thus so is the movie. However, the movie is very faithful to the books, with only minor and inconsequential changes. Narnia is very colorfully created and with the exception of a really cheesy effect at the end of the battle scene, the FX were really well done and believable. The actress who portrayed Lucy did a good job. The other children weren't quite as convincing, but all the wonderful and mystical scenery/eye candy drew attention away from this fact. The movie could have benefited from a PG-13 rating, as there was a sense in the battle scenes that the director was holding back in order to get the lower rating, and the battle was thus not as intense or convincing as it could have been. Also, the movie did seem rather rushed at parts and could probably get away with being another twenty minutes longer. I can't wait to see what they do with the rest of the series though and all in all it was an enjoyable and light hearted adventure. I did not leave the theater feeling disappointed and anyways, until PJ gets around to making the hobbit, this is the closest we'll get to the Lord of the Rings with the possible exception of the Potter series. Now on to King Kong..."
"hennybul10","10","1","2","8 December 2005"," Excellent rendering of the book, great effects!
","The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe does a great job of being faithful to the book, but is exciting enough by adding a few scenes and showing the back story of how the children got to the house in the country. Though the movie starts a little slowly, things really get exciting when they go through the wardrobe. Beautiful scenery, and wonderful characters. The battle scenes are intense, some animals are seemingly in danger, but its done well enough that you can take the kids and assure them that it will all be okay in the end. Kind of like ""Lord of the Rings"" for children. Fantastic CGI of creatures, action, costumes and detail. The Lion is magnificent, (stone table scene might be intense for children) but no blood shown, violence is somewhat off screen. The kids are just too cute and the sibling interaction is very realistic. After viewing the movie, you will want to read the book and really appreciate the writing and dialogs that did not make it to the movie. The beavers'conversations in the book are my favorite - ""A lion? Is he safe?"" ""Of course he's not safe, but he's good! He's the King!"""

","I just saw an early screening of this movie with the church that my friend attends, and so I didn't have to pay for my ticket, but after seeing some of the garbage that has come out lately, I sure wish some of that money went to this movie! This film is truly mesmerizing! I went into this film after never reading any of the novels and not expecting much, other than the fact that it was getting some good early reviews and I have to admit, I was totally blown away. This film has great characters that are very enjoyable and easy to root for, and villains that you will hate. It's a grand tale that is placed together so well by the director Andrew Adamson, that I believe an Acadamy Award might not be too far off for him. He reminds me of Peter Jackson in the way that he weaves together this magnificent tale that i won't ruin for anyone here in my review. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great story with marvelous special effects and spetactular dialog that is smart and clever. I could watch this movie over and over again and i'll surely go and see this movie again. The best movie by far from this year!"
"charlotte_broos","10","1","2","8 December 2005"," Greatest movie of the year
","I went to the New Zealand premiere of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe last night, and to describe this film in one word: amazing. Even the word amazing is not enough to describe it. I enjoyed every single moment of the movie, not one bit was boring. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. You don't have to have read the books before, I didn't, and I understood it perfectly. The Pevensie kids deliver awesome performances, and the talking animals are so realistic that you actually start believing it would be possible. It is a good mix of humour, drama, action, suspense, fantasy, etc. By far the best movie I've seen this year, and probably in a few years (even better than Harry Potter, and believe me, I'm a big fan). Don't hesitate to go see it, it's well worth the money, and you'll be caught up in the wonderful world of Narnia that Andrew Adamson has brought to the big screen."

","As a teacher I am always looking forward to seeing movies based on children's books, but I never know what to expect. Many screenplays are often lacking in their accurate portrayal of the book. However, this movie was beautifully done and very true to the original work by C.S. Lewis. The actors were well cast, the cinematography was wonderful, the soundtrack was very nicely done, and the special effects were exceptional. I was truly moved by this movie and very pleased with the final result. It is an excellent choice for older children especially those who have read the original book. There were a few scenes that were a little intense for my seven year old son, but he still loved the movie and hasn't stopped talking about all of the characters. Overall I give this movie a 10 and recommend it for anyone who would like to revisit a classic story or experience it for the first time."

","I didn't know what to think when I heard that one of my beloved childhood books was being turned into a movie. Anticipation was the first thought, but then fear came over me, what if they ruined it? My fears were blown away within the first five minutes of the movie. I was in Narnia! My biggest fear had been that because Disney was making the movie that the talking animals like Aslan, and other fairytale creatures were going to become animated. I mean when we're talking talking animals and Disney I think of the Lion King and the Little Mermaaid. With Narnia it was real, it didn't look fake like I thought it would have.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about this movie! I plan on going back and seeing it many times before it leaves theaters, to tide me over until it comes out on DVD. :-)"
"lordbiggus","6","1","2","8 December 2005"," Narnia - impressive, but a little flat.
","Overall, I was really impressed with the first installment of the Narnia franchise. The CG and ""groundbreaking photorealism"" were truly stunning and a marvel that I enjoyed throughout the movie. However, I felt that the major themes of the book were not developed enough and consequently had little impact or emotional pay-off at the climax of the film. Obviously this is tailored for a much younger audience than myself, who I think will go nuts over the film, but for me I felt that there was nothing in Narnia that I hadn't already experienced from the trailer. My advice is take a kid along with you so that you can somewhat enjoy the film from their perspective too. Before I end this I will just say that I wanted to see more of Aslan going absolutely nuts and tearing the crap out of some of the weedy White Witch's minions. That would have earned the film an 8 on it's own. Andrew Adamson has already said though, ""The story of Narnia doesn't call for brutality."" That is the comment that I think even he doesn't quite agree with. I think overall the film is a little 'luke warm'. It is kind of brutal, just kind of soft-brutal. It is sort of scary, but not really. It is somewhat epic, but falls a little flat... which will make it a family box-office smash. The franchise is here to stay.<br/><br/>-Rich p.s. Georgie Henley (Lucy Pevensie) is a remarkable actress. She really delivers her character well and makes this film one worth watching."
"stupiddog","9","1","2","8 December 2005"," Actually no LOTR but still quite good

I did not read the books, so I cannot tell if they are following the storyline 100% but who cares.. This story still lives on in my thoughts and I caught myself 2 times looking at the wardrobe and thinking about sneaking inside.<br/><br/>This movie got a great visual performance (for me though) and a fetching story.<br/><br/>I give a 9 out of 10 for catching me in for almost two hours"
"aminuteman","8","1","2","8 December 2005"," Exactly What It Claims To Be
","It could have been overblown, but it wasn't. It could have been ""enhanced"" or ""inspired by"", but it wasn't. It could have been excellent. And it is.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to separate the movie from the book, the two being so closely mated, and that makes it practically impossible for me to rate this movie, since the book is one of my favorites of all literature. That, and one of my earliest memories is my father lying in the hallway reading this book to me and my brother as we went to sleep. How do you objectively comment on something so close to one's heart? <br/><br/>I was deathly afraid that the movie would try to be something that the book isn't. The Chronicles of Narnia are not the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They are also not the Three Musketeers, or the Legends of King Arthur. They are stories for children, stories that happen to be about the most important thing that has ever occurred, but children's stories nonetheless. The movie preserves this. The animation is excellent but not flawless, and the CGI is good but not top-drawer. This is irrelevant. The story is all there, every bit of it, from Edmund's snottiness all the way to the mice on the Stone Table. The dialogue is not straight from the book, but it's organic to the movie.<br/><br/>I was also afraid that no movie in this day could possibly tell this tale and leave intact the mystery and power of Aslan, as representative of the Christ. No review of this movie could leave out this essential point, I don't believe, for this story is, in its essence, a story about the root of all Christianity. And my fears were not entirely unfounded. There is some skirting of the essential point, but the light touch on it is unlikely to obscure the truth from those who know, while refusing to hit over the head those who would rather not have to face it. In the end, it was dealt with about as well as could be expected.<br/><br/>And I was most afraid that I would leave the theater and find that my childhood memories were overlaid with some sticky Hollywood film that would affect my love for the book itself, that I would see in my head only those images that the movie projected, and that they would alter, perhaps even degrade my love for CS Lewis's immortal classic.<br/><br/>That didn't happen. For me, the movie was a fitting tribute to the book, preserving its character and power while allowing the characters to live and breathe for a new generation that might not be quite as much at home with the printed page.<br/><br/>For Narnia! Long Live the Lion!"

"kmack928-1","4","3","12","10 December 2005"," A Cinematic Grab-Bag
","""J.R.R. Tolkien criticized Lewis's first Narnia book, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. He thought that there were too many elements that clasheda Father Christmas and an evil witch, talking animals and children.""<br/><br/>Tack on the blatant Christian overtones and you have the convoluted, pretentious, and self-righteous film that is ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".<br/><br/>If I was to pick a saving grace for Narnia, it would be the scenery, which, while lacking variety, was beautifully imagined and shot. Unfortunately you don't see much; the snowy woods were about the only set, until the epic concluding battle. Also, the visual-effects were extremely impressive, especially the photo-realistic animals, and creatures which inhabit Lewis' world. Although not on par with the Lord of the Rings (in part due to slightly weak voice-acting) the animals were vibrant, likable, and on occasion amusing. The effects are what truly shine in this movie, but not enough to carry it beyond mediocrity.<br/><br/>As for the acting (Despite a wonderful performance by the White Witch) well, it's difficult to criticize child-actors, as they are often way out of their league. Unfortunately, it must be done. The children were an abomination, the screen cutting away at every point any semblance of talent might be required, followed by shoddy voice-over crying. Susan, it seems, was purposely miss-cast, and her acting doesn't cover the void between literary character and on-screen heroine. There is no character development, aside from a ridiculous case of sibling rivalry. Apparently, a trivial argument between brothers is the basis for something far grander, grasping at straws in order to explain certain deeds, the writers fell short. <br/><br/>JRR Tolkien was correct in calling C.S. Lewis' story ""a literary grab-bag"" and that rings true with the film as well. Atrociously anti-climatic, with every single epic war cliché pulled from everything from the Lord of the Rings to Braveheart. How many hero's must we see wielding two swords before it stops eliciting the excitement of the first time? <br/><br/>Not having much to do with my overall review of the film, but something which must be mentioned, is the religious element to the film. The underlying Christian themes were overt and insulting to anyone of moderate intelligence. It's nothing more than religious propaganda, under the guise of a fanciful story. <br/><br/>Perhaps, if you loved the books as a child (and are a practicing Christian), or are a child yourself, you will find a worthwhile film in ""Narnia"". If not, I'd avoid this movie like the plague, go rent, or better yet read, Tolkiens work. A chop-shop fantasy tale such as Lewis', makes one truly appreciate the true genius of writers like Tolkien. Likewise, a chop-shop fantasy movie, helmed by the talented Andrew Adamson of Shrek fame (who, despite his best efforts, was unable to bring meaning to Narnia), makes you truly appreciate the efforts of someone like Peter Jackson. I hate to have to make so many Lord of the Rings references, but it was Narnia who made them so blatant in the first place. Frankly, and I'm being brutally honest, it comes off as a Rings-rip off, toting Christianity. Undoubtedly explaining the success it will see."

","The Chronicles of Narnia  The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is the latest film adaptation of the C.S. Lewis book that kicked off the Chronicles of Narnia series. Set in World War Two, the story begins as four children are whisked away to a big old estate far away from where the Huns are raining bombs upon London. The Pevensie children, Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan discover a wardrobe that leads to a kingdom called Narnia clasped in the grip of a century long winter.<br/><br/>The frigid spell is the result of the usurped rule of the Witch, who has declared herself queen of Narnia, when in fact the true rulers are foretold to be two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve. Local talking fauna are convinced that the quartet of Pevensie siblings are the prophesied revolutionaries who will be instrumental in restoring Narnia to it's former self, leading them all on an adventure revolting against the evil pretender to the throne.<br/><br/>Unlike Tolkien, Lewis's works are intentionally analogous to Christianity. Aslan, the lion found in the title, is a Christ figure. He is good and just, hated by the wicked and loved by the righteous. The book deals in themes of truth, honor, duty and sacrifice in barely disguised allegory to the Gospel. One wondered if Disney would leave those themes in place, or would the Witch Queen of Narnia be recast to represent George Bush, the Wolves his Texas Oil Buddies. Would Aslan become the heroic transgenderd heroin addict who rallies Narnia's bohemian community to wage peace against the forces of intolerance and corporate greed? To my joy, the Gospel themes are intact, and I daresay, quite forceful and explicit. The movie is at its strongest and most resonate in the scenes that depict Aslan's character doing what Christ did. The creators deserve credit and accolades from Christendom for resisting the temptation to water down a powerful story. Unfortunately, those same creators deserve a severe beating for chaining a gigantic steel ball to the leg of the movie. Great jumping catfish, just how long do you need to dwell on scenes of children traipsing through snow? I had loaded up with a big soda before the show, so I sat watching uncomfortably for fear of missing something big. I needn't have suffered so. The way the action has been paced, there were no small climaxes on the way to the big one. A good storyteller will traverse peaks and valleys on the way to the big mountaintop, but director Andrew Adamson makes the trip such a long slog that you are not excited by the big finish so much as relieved.<br/><br/>The child actors elucidate the famous British understatement, even the precocious Lucy. When a Limey from that era says ""things are a bit sticky"" he is likely armed with a teaspoon and surrounded by 100,000 angry Zulus. While I find that aspect of the classic English character charming, the surrounding action has to step up and provide a context that makes the understatement work. None of the main cast are particularly lively, with the exception of the animated ones who provide welcome relief along the grueling plot.<br/><br/>I will say that the animated creatures, particularly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, are delightful, and the combination of Liam Neeson's voice and a fantastic animated lion make Aslan majestic and noble. When Mr. Tumnus and Lucy relate that Aslan is not tame, but is good, the description is well befitting the character we've watched on the big screen.<br/><br/>TCON was written before the hand-wringing era of Dr. Spock and Teletubbies (In my day an alien flying saucer would be surrounded by tanks and infantrymen, by gum!). The Pevensies are given arms, and prepare themselves for medieval combat. These lead to some intense scenes, and I could see where less mature children might be distressed by seeing peers on screen in peril. I don't recall any blood or flying parts, but the implication is there. People and anthropomorphic critters are being bludgeoned, slashed and impaled. For my own part, I think we have given children the false impression that there isn't evil in the world that seeks to destroy them, but parents who think otherwise are hereby duly cautioned.<br/><br/>Chronicles of Narnia  The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe seems to want to be Lord of the Rings but the story's shoulders are not broad enough to handle all the majestic shots and lingering views. While parts of the movie are wonderful and moving, the sum of those parts are plodding. As a Christian, I am grateful and encouraged that a major studio not known for being friendly to my faith made a faithful rendition of a cherished allegory. The movie lover in me knows that it's about 20 minutes of scene-eating too long, and is disappointed."
"madpigmadpig","1","2","8","25 August 2007"," Completely crass in every way! Was an incredible strain to watch!
","First let's start with the general feel. From the beginning of the movie it seems very American and not at all British; even the choice of music in the early part of the film is out of step. Then there's the unnecessary use of partial sepia or brown tones to indicate that it's the ordinary world, or possibly to show that it's the past. Now let's talk about the family dynamic ( or lack there of), no family is simultaneously that vicious to one another and yet (on-and- off) so loyal. Actually, the point of loyalty brings another thought to mind; the betrayal of Edmond was not believable at all. Edmond is willing to first betray his sister and her friend for a piece of candy and then, despite the heavy-handed movie-villain acting of the (not scary or impressive at all) witch, he still tries to do everything she demands while continuing to expect some kind of reward (isn't he a little to old for that kind of credulity?), only to be (very predictably) taken prisoner. After that the extremely poor actors, both voice and live action, go on portraying moronic, cold-hearted bastards leaving dozens of obvious questions in their wake, such as: why didn't Susan just shoot the witch with an arrow when she was about to kill Aslan? Why didn't Lucy just tell Susan to get stuffed and try the healing potion anyway? Why do the beavers walk on two feet? Why is it that Peter is brave but stupid, Lucy is smarter than anyone else but weak, and the other two are just useless scum that merely upset the others and get in the way until the very end when they suddenly redeem themselves in a way inconsistent to their actions in the rest of the movie? Why was the actor playing Mr. Tumnus more like a supermarket cashier than an otherworldly creature? Why does Susan joyfully hug Mr. Tumnus even know she's never met him before, especially since she doesn't seem like a very loving sort of person? Why didn't Aslan kill the witch when he had her in his tent? Why was the the dialog so weak and uninspired? Why was the battle scene not even as good as the wookie battle in Star Wars? Why was Aslan made so feeble when he's supposed to impart a sense of leadership and majestic awe? And finally, why did they cast such ugly actors/actresses? With the exception of Peter, all the humans looked more like something from the creature shop than the mythical characters."

","First of all, I've never read the book, and if it is as great as they say the movie falls way short.<br/><br/>The plot is flat: a prophecy indicates that 2 girls and 2 boys will end a 100 year winter, in a fantasy land inside a wardrobe.<br/><br/>I've read some comments on this movie, most of them with the ""spoiler"" warning. I don't see the need to warn anybody because there's nothing to warn. Unless of course you expect the prophecy to be false.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is its predictability. You will find yourself no surprises or interesting twists, the movie takes you on a one-line story that ends where you would expect, even if you never read the book.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, but not distracting enough to forget that there's no depth, the few conflicts we see have very simple solutions. The main characters never really struggle as the sense of danger or pressure never kicks in.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a disappointing movie. Learn from my experience and don't go there expecting too much, you may probably enjoy it."
"ApolloStarr","6","2","8","10 December 2005"," Good Effects, Boring Story, Preachy
","I will admit I had never heard of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" until I saw a preview for this movie. I had no idea that it was a series of books until a few months later, and with that said, I had no idea what to expect from this film. From the very beginning, I noticed that the movie seemed to borrow scenes from other films. When the children boarded the train and left for the countryside, it seemed very reminiscent of the train leaving for Hogwarts in the ""Harry Potter"" films. I know there are not too many ways to film a train leaving for the countryside, but it just seemed odd. The first hour of the film was good, especially pertaining to the development of the character Lucy. Lucy is by far the most interesting human character in the film, which is not saying much. Her siblings have rather flat personalities, and there is not much depth to them at all. Once the movie ventures into the land of Narnia, things begin to slowly progress downward. I was never blown away by the land of Narnia, the scope just did not awe me as Middle Earth in ""Lord of the Rings"" had. The White Witch is a decent enough villain, but her dialog is a bit spotty in parts, but that's tolerable for fantasy villains. The story is one of a prophecy being fulfilled, how original, and we learn this from two talking beavers. The movie cannot seem to decide if it wants to be a children's fantasy movie or an epic, and this hurts the film. The effects are hit and miss, but Asylin the lion looked absolutely stunning. The other animals were done fairly well, but some of the various mythological figures were not so good. I hate to break the news, but C.S. Lewis is not a creative writing genius. He just took the life of Jesus and put into the realm of fantasy, and I do not see the originality in that. The scene where Asylin is brought to the stone table, which is the Narnia form of a crucifixion, is way too much like the ""The Passion of the Christ"" but with animals and fantasy creatures as the stand in's for humans. And guess what? Asylin comes back to life after being sacrificed, at that point, I proceeded to yell ""Jesus Christ"" and got a few laughs. The morals in the movie are very disturbing, especially when Asylin pretty much orders Peter to kill a wolf, and Peter never even offered the Wolf a chance to surrender. Overall, I never really connected or bonded with the characters and the story is very lacking in excitement and originality. I do not mind a movie with a message, or even a Christian one for that matter, but when you take a line directly out of the Bible, when Asylin says ""It is finished"", you are now pretty much making a propaganda film. The film was watchable, but it will not become an instant classic for me. I will stick to ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" for my British fantasy fixes."
"phantombnz","6","2","8","9 December 2005"," The first Narnia film is a droll, humourless affair...
","The long-awaited ""other New Zealand movie"" finally hits the screens. Will it live up to it's hype and it's $180m budget? Andrew Adamson has big shoes to fill; the Chronicles of Narnia encompass an imaginary world in the Tolkien mould, albeit at a less detailed and more child-friendly level. Thus children, not 300 yr-old wizards and rangers are the heroes here and Adamson has taken a gamble in picking unknown's for his characters; a ploy that worked somewhat for Harry Potter...but this isn't Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The film opens to a scene of WWII bombings in London a 5 minute sequence covering the first 5 lines of the book....we also have some character setting here; Peter is the stuffy, bossy one, whilst Edmund is the bad apple boy. After a Potter -style train ride they arrive at The Professor's house, their safe haven whilst the bombs are falling. It's all very gloomy and sad, which brings me to my first gripe. The situation portrayed in the book is one of excitement and wonder, not doom and gloom. Obviously Adamson was trying to contrast the boring world of Earth with the wondrous world of Narnia; but considering that they go there to fight a war anyway...where's the contrast? It makes for some tough viewing. The kids mope around and fight with each other, before Lucy, the youngest, finds her way into Narnia through the wardrobe. There she meets Mr Tumnus, half-human, half...something. He's charming enough, but his nervous manner indicates immediately that perhaps he's up to no good. Taking Lucy home and drugging her (not in the book) really doesn't help the situation. It ruins one of the best characters of the Narnia realm. Edmund's encounter with the white witch is interesting, if forgettable. Tilda Swinton has the cold complexion of an ice queen but ""proud, stern and beautiful""? It's simply not there. There's more moping and more kid-fighting before the whole sorry lot end up in snow-land.<br/><br/>After this it's all Aslan and war. The CGI Aslan is very stately and lionish, but is largely expressionless throughout - a far cry from the joy and sorrow he expresses in the book.. The movie drags on and on - we simply don't care enough about the characters to be interested in their fate - and eventually we get to the big battle scene. It's all pretty simple. (King) Peter's army is animals and half-animals; the Witch's army is men in monster suits. The good guys win of course and everyone lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>The first Narnia film is a droll, humourless affair. It says something when the first and only laugh is from Susan shooting the Witches' servant dead with an arrow (?!?) So where did it go wrong? From someone who knows the books well, there's an awful lot of interesting characters and dialogue left out. The book is only 200 pages but it seems Adamson was more intent on providing battles and set pieces than humour and magic."

Whenever someone was stabbed and killed, there was no blood on the sword, and at the end of the movie just about everyone who was 'killed' came back to life. there were some really big gaps in the plot.. and the main character went from being a 10 year old wimp to a warrior in about ten minutes. I also found the story boring for the most part with only about 15 minutes of excitement (during the battle scenes). The battle scenes were awesome and paralleled those of Lord of the Rings, however much of the story and etc i found to be extremely slow moving.

Actually, I don't know how all you people could have stood to sit through it and then call it a good movie.<br/><br/>The only good part about the movie was Aslan. Not joking at all. Aslan was captured magnificently. Other than that, nothing about the movie brought the book to life. Peter was a blotch on the radar who didn't even know which end of a sword was up; Susan was more like Boromir with that horn of hers; Edmund was the one you wanted to punch throughout the whole movie (and not just for selling out his family - that boy was a truly terrible actor); and Lucy was nothing more than an annoying little girl.<br/><br/>All over the movie I could see scenes copied shamelessly from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The scene on the river, for instance, when Peter fights off (hahahahahahahahahahaha yeah right) the wolves - a straight imitation of the scene in The Fellowship of the Ring where Arwen brings the river down on the Nazgul.<br/><br/>I don't see how anyone over the age of 1 could enjoy this hopeless rendition of The Chronicles. Better luck next time."
"mooshie01","1","2","9","28 December 2005"," Maybe the book was good but this is an awful movie
","First, I would like to point out that this is not a critique of the book as as I am apparently one of the handful of people who have never read it. I was actually looking forward to watching Narnia as it was recommended to me by a few people. Also, knowing that WETA was on board gave me the impression that it was going to be a quality production. Unfortunately, this movie seemed to rely primarily on special effects as it fails terribly when it comes to acting, storytelling, and direction. <br/><br/>One big problem was that there was no epic scope conveyed at all and everything felt like it happened in a week once the kids passed into Narnia. I found it ridiculous that a land that had been suffering for a hundred years of oppression from a tyrannical witch (who is quite possibly the best thing about the movie) is saved by bickering siblings who had absolutely no idea how to use a weapon or run an army a few days earlier. Actually, I'm not really sure why they needed the kids in the first place. From what I saw, Aslan would have done a much better job leading the army and it was he who finally defeated the witch in the end. I hope the book does a much better job conveying the kids' importance to the plot as they seem to be more like tourists in this movie. <br/><br/>Pacing was another problem. Considering how long this movie ran, I was stunned at the lack of character development or substance in the plot. They could have probably cut the running time in half or less and delivered the same message. You never really know why the witch does what she does, where Aslan comes from, why the kids are so important, or anyone else for that matter. Everything just seems to happen because it was ""prophesized"" or just plain convenient. If this is how it is in the book and they wanted to remain faithful, that's fine, but it definitely makes for a very shallow and unsatisfying movie experience. <br/><br/>I wish I could say more positive things about this movie but nothing unsaid comes to mind. There are plenty of people who liked this movie more than I did and I wish I could say why that was. I actually thought about walking out of the theater at some point but kept telling myself that it was going to get better. Considering the large following that this book has, it either deserves much better treatment or it just does not translate very well to the big screen."
"dbrookfield","4","2","9","10 December 2005"," Trix Are For Kids
","Having seen (and enjoyed) the Harry Potter movies, and to a lesser extent, the overlong Lord of the Rings movies, I decided to join some friends for this bit of fantasy.<br/><br/>I do think it plays well as a kids movie, but as an adult, it's just a bit too slow-paced and cutesy for my taste. The characters were thin and underdeveloped and the action scenes tended to fall short for the most part, at least in comparison to other films in the genre. I'd recommend you check out Potter and his Goblet of Fire instead.<br/><br/>The ending, in my mind, unfairly rewards the youngsters. Thousands strived long and hard for this particular goal over the centuries and died trying, while the kids reap the rewards simply because they are fulfilling some arcane prophecy. The message seems to be, ""no need to work long and hard, kids!"""
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","1","3","1 June 2008"," This is how kids movies SHOULD be made...
","There's a real sense of wonder and magic in the air throughout this film. It has something for everyone: Fun, adventure and a deeper meaning than you'll find in most children's movies. It has an innocence about it, but does in no way talk down to kids. It's a genuinely enjoyable film that delivers in all areas.<br/><br/>For someone like myself (who is usually unimpressed with kids movies and annoyed by the child actors who populate them), I can - in all honesty - say that I was in no way annoyed by the four young lead actors in this movie. The standout is obviously Georgie Henley, as the youngest Pevensie (Lucy). I assure you that seeing her reactions - which are *so* genuine - to everything around her will take you back to what it was like when you were a kid and still had that sense of child-like wonder. The friendship she immediately strikes up with the goat-legged Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) shows what it's like to be a true friend and accept someone who's different (which is a message kids need to learn). Lucy's youngest brother, Edmund (Skandar Keynes), is almost the total opposite. He's the angry one, who's always getting into trouble and making bad decisions. Even though I found him to be the least likable of the four siblings (and the actor over-emoted on occasion), he *does* prove his worth by redeeming himself at the end.<br/><br/>The two older actors (William Moseley as Peter and Anna Popplewell as Susan) both give solid performances. While Peter does come close to being the typical angst-ridden teen (and Susan the bossy know-it-all), they thankfully manage to keep their characters likable and don't overact too often. Tilda Swinton - who literally plays an ice queen by the name of Jadis - imbues her character with a real sense of malice, but - at the same time - keeps her performance dialed down (opting for an eerie calm instead of over-the-top yelling). She is cold as ice, in all senses of the word, and this is what makes her White Witch so formidable (well...that and when she's kicking butt with twin swords).<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't be Narnia without the many magical creatures who populate it. They are brilliantly brought to life by a mix of impressive CGI (except for that one dodgy-looking rhino) and well-cast voice actors. Liam Neeson is marvelous as the mighty Aslan (the way the animators manage to convey so much emotion on his face is truly amazing). Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French) are a likable pair and aren't the usual annoying variety of talking animal that you find in kids' movies. Michael Madsen is suitably menacing as Maugrim, the White Witch's head wolf. Rupert Everett even gets a memorable cameo as the helpful Fox. There are also many other extraordinary creatures throughout - most of which are on display in the epic final.<br/><br/>The scenery is quite breathtaking. When you see the meticulous effort that has gone into designing Narnia, you'll no doubt be overcome with the same feeling of awe as young Lucy. The movie benefits immensely from a very fitting and memorable score (and make sure you don't walk out as soon as the end credits begin to roll. There's something extra only a little ways into the closing credits - proving that good things do indeed come to those who wait). The creatures, the scenery, the music - all of it combines to bring alive this truly magical land that you will never want to leave.<br/><br/>As far as family films go, this one is - in a word - perfect. It will appeal to kids and adults alike. Before you know it, you'll be searching the back of your wardrobe for a magical land. And should you not find one there...you'll be taking a sledgehammer to the back of your wardrobe and knocking holes in it until you find such a wondrous place as Narnia."

","You have to thank the Harry Potter franchise for starting the fantasy- books-into-movie-transition-hype because ever since 2001 when the boy wizard made it's movie debut, other fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings decided to rule the movie box office where no longer did action movies pumped up with hardcore violence and blood or mindless plots grabbed audience members but literary heroes with good hearts.<br/><br/>The Chronicals of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe tells the story of four children who go off to live with their eccentric uncle (Jim Broadbent) while World War II is breaking out all over Europe, including England where the children used to live. Lucy (Georgina Henley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmand (Skandar Keynes) and Peter (William Moseley) try to make the best out of living at their uncle's mansion where they are not allowed to make any kind of noise until one day when the kids are playing a game of hide and seek that young Lucy discovers that a coated closet takes her to another world of magical creatures including a half faun/man by the name of Mr. Tumnus (Scottish Actor James McAvoy) who is forbidden to make contact with humans along mentioning that The White Witch (Tilda Swinton) will punish those who break law in Narnia.<br/><br/>The older kids don't believe Lucy until the following day they discover for themselves that their closet their younger sister hided one time leads them to Narnia where it seems strange to be talking to creatures who can talk back. They meet with Mr. Beaver and his wife where they tell the kids that they're meant to be heroes and save Narnia from the White Witch just before Edmund betrays them.<br/><br/>(Note: I have never read the books just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but I do follow with the characters and plot through Internet) I did wanted to see The Chronicals of Narnia back in theaters, but I was glad that I got to see the film on DVD where everything looks beautiful just like the film itself. Apart from the acting, I thought that each of the four child actors did a good job in convincing me that they could take charge when put into peril. Another thing about the film that took me by surprise was the voice credits from tough guys Ray Winstone (The Departed) doing the voice of Mr. Beaver along with Michael Madsen (Kill Bill) as Grimel, the head wolf of the White Witch. Liam Neeson is the voice of Aslen, protector of the creatures of Narnia which surprised me since he played both a hero and a villain that same year with him being the villain in Batman Begins and a good guy in this movie.<br/><br/>This is a good movie to all ages!"

When I first saw the trailer a few years ago for the film, I was scared to see it because I wasn't sure if it would ever compare to the book. But you know what? It's a film, that's a book, I don't like to compare the book to the movie because I think that's how people end up hating a movie is if it's not faithful to the book. A film is bound not to be like the book, some things have to be changed for entertainment or because there is no way to adapt a scene from a book onto film. So finally decided to just go ahead and give The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe the movie a chance and see what it was like. I watched it a couple days ago and really enjoyed how everything was presented and I felt like it was very faithful to the book after all.<br/><br/>Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan are all brothers and sisters, set in WWII in England, for safety's sake, their mother sends them to a friend's house. When they are playing hide and go seek, Lucy finds a closet, she goes in to discover a whole new world. A world called Narnia, she meets a faun(who is half man, half goat), Mr. Tumnus, who warns her to go back, that the White Witch will come after her. She goes back, but tells her brothers and sister, who eventually follow her into Narnia. But Edmund has been bribed by the evil White Witch to betray his brother and sisters. But they must work together to bring peace back into Narnia and are to be the future kings and queens.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a wonderful film, to me it was kind of a new epic for the kids, like how Lord of the Rings isn't meant for kids, this was a film they could get into. I still prefer the book, things just lead up to your own expectations and imagination. But still the acting, the special effects, the story is just lovely and I'm sure that this is a film that you will definitely enjoy. It's a great family film, worth the watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

While staying there the youngest of the four children, Lucy, came across a wardrobe in an empty room during a game of competitive Hide-n-Seek.

Also I love reading, and I liked that I could picture the characters and scenes the way I wanted too.<br/><br/>I think all of the characters did a great job and played their roles perfectly.

","Very rarely do you find a good film with such wisdom and depth that leaves you with a triumphant feeling. The Chronicles of Narnia is one of those films.<br/><br/>Based on C.S. Lewis' timeless story, Andrew Adamson brings the story to the silver screen and breathes life into it like you've never seen. The direction is majestic and powerful, with amazing special effects and dazzling shots. The screenplay is written with such intensity and fire that it brings epic moments to the film. The actors do a marvelous job in believability and pull off all types of acting in the film.<br/><br/>Enhancements include a brilliant musical score and a spectacular battle scene. What else can I say? This was a great movie, and a family one too.<br/><br/>The only things that I wasn't satisfied with was the opening. While still good, it still wasn't the best opening for such an awesome film, and is really just a device to get the characters to the next location. Another is seeing the kids as adults. For some reason, the characters did not match up with the younger versions of themselves, so it was an awkward moment. Also, the film is watered-down because its supposed to be a family film. But its still a magical one.<br/><br/>But those minor flaws do not hinder the greatness of this film. Tilda Swinton is the best witch around, and the sacrifice scene is so well-written (some cheesy lines but overall good). I can't really explain just how well the film works with itself AND the book. Faithful to the book, faithful to the family, and faithful to what makes a great film. 8.0/10."

The film's locations were also a real treat. Finally, I enjoyed the small part that Jim Broadbent brought to the story as Professor Digory Kirke. The musical score was also very appropriate and majestic. All in all one of the finest fantasies to come to the screen. I would imagine this will rank with Lord of The Rings, both films based on stories by good friends and rival professors, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien."

","This is one of the ultimate fantasy classics. I was impressed with the amount of CGI that went into this, especially how well they integrated the half-human creatures, like the centaurs and fauns, with their human actors. Aslan was awesome, truly majestic, humane yet at the same time very much a lion. I got to see my DVD in 3-D due to a pair of TV Eyes glasses I got off eBay. They turn any movie 3-D! The inside of Mr. Tumnis's house was beautiful rendered in 3-D, I wanted to live there. The scenery was wonderful, from snowbound vistas to springtime forests, to the plains of battle. All of the creatures looked so much more real and solid, more fully integrated into the movie than they were in 2-D. The moral story is still there but it's not heavy handed. And I just loved how bratty Edmond was and how well the kid actor played him, especially after he had his change of heart and was trying to atone. I haven't read the book in a long time but I think the movie captured it very well, certainly better than most."
"sasamijurai","3","1","3","2 May 2006"," Too violent for kids, too immature for adults
","I watched this DVD because I'm a fan of the LOTR films and CS Lewis apparently wrote similar content to Tolkien. I've never read any of these books though. As a film, this movie fails. It starts of well, the initial scenes with Lucy and the Fawn are delightful and magical. In fact there are probably 3 good performances in this film, Lucy who's acting is a joy to behold, the Fawn guy who does a decent job and Orlando or rather the White Witch who plays the part of an evil witch - just right.<br/><br/>Special effects were not extraordinary by any means. LOTR - FOTR, had better effects by far, while the battles in Narnia were, I think too violent for the target audience. The film is just not serious enough for a mature audience but too violent for little kids, I'd say. There isn't enough substance to this film and it seems to lack spirit, except for a few moments (like Lucy and the Fawn).<br/><br/>I don't think this film teaches anything about Christianity, and I personally think Sailor Moon is more Christian than the pagan celebrations depicted here but then again I never read the book so maybe it's just a fault of this film. Overall - OK for kids, if you don't mind them having to put up with violence like little Lucy having a dagger (to kill orcs with). Fantasy fans should rather watch LOTR, I guess. This film is superficial kitsch, but then again, it's Disney so what can one expect?"

","I can't believe anyone saying that this movie is good. This is such a money-making movie. They spent loads of money, not on acting or the story but only on the graphics. And, i admit they look stunning. Though the storyline is worse then 50 cent's movie. Then the fighting...can you imagine kids from London, sword-fight like noble knights and kill creatures i/e Minotaurs. And then there's the worst part of all: the music, compared to music composed by Klaus Badelt, Howard Shore, John Williams and James Horner this sounds like a composition of a bunch of mentally challenged people. All these freaky synthesizer noises don't fit in the fantasy image this movie wants to create. Plz people, don't support this awful production."
"The Mogul","4","1","3","6 February 2006"," A Rather Unenchanted Magical World: Embark Upon A Pacier Adventure Somewhere Else.
","Oh, the disappointment! To walk into the cinema expecting something with the verve of Lord of the Rings, or at least with a comparably good mise-en-scene, and instead to be treated to this lacklustre matinée! The film's greatest flaw is its laboured pace: the fault of casting on the basis of looks, poor acting direction, and flabby dialogue editing.<br/><br/>The young actress Georgie Henley (Lucy) really shines, but her three siblings get progressively more wooden with age. The White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and her sidekick Ginarrbrik (Kiran Shah) turn in the worst performances of the lot. Swinton is as enchanting as a doleful catwalk bitch; her jarring seduction of Edmund never convinces, and thereby makes nonsense of most of the plot. Shah delivers his few lines in the fashion of a Hong Kong schlock overdubber. Liam Neeson turns in a journeyman's performance that is just too portentous to suit this fantasy, whilst Tumnus (James McAvoy), although possessed of a lively face, also belabours his lines.<br/><br/>I don't believe, however, that the actors are entirely to blame: delivering one's dialogue at Sesame Street pace is a problem which inflicts most of the cast; it is the director, therefore, that must be charged with the crime. Narnia is Adamson's first live action feature, and it is all too apparent.<br/><br/>Having to deliver their lines in little snippets, and through many repetitions, actors depend on a director to orient them within the film, and to choose the right take! Adamson either failed to coax the necessary stuff from his cast, or else failed to hear that their performances were dragging. A third, worse, alternative, is that he positively encouraged a ponderous acting style.<br/><br/>Less than brisk editing is the other half of Narnia's pace problem; crisper cutting would have significantly improved this film. All those half second pauses  between lines, between shots, between actions  accumulate to drain it of life.<br/><br/>Performances and pace, however, aren't Narnia's only woes. Generally workmanlike effects are badly let down in a few instances that just can't be forgotten. The waterfall and its ice flows loudly declare their artificiality; they put one in mind of a shopping centre display. And when it came to equipping Aslan's soldiers with leathern jerkins, Peter in particular, how did the costumiers come to settle on fabric so fake you could smell the vinyl from the cinema's back row.<br/><br/>The film can't entirely undo Lewis' magic: with those grievous exceptions above, most things are competently done, and the beavers are entertaining. However, the Narnia experience is decidedly pedestrian; there just isn't enough levity, enough lustre, in this film. I never really felt like I was on an adventure; I often, sadly, felt rather bored.<br/><br/>The cinephile will find this film slow-going. Even those who read the book along time ago will find it so well signposted most of the surprises won't be surprises at all."
"james_mcgowen2002","5","1","3","31 January 2006"," How I felt...
","First, I like get two facts clear before writing the review: (a) I am a Christian from both the Anglican and Catholic denominations, so there will be no surprise that I have something in for this film (b) And I also began reading C.S. Lewis' adult work (i.e. his science fiction trilogy, ""The Screwtape Letters,"" and his theology) before reading his work for children.<br/><br/>I first saw this film in Hobart, Tasmania with my Dad and two friends from the Anglican church as a type of treat. I was interested in seeing it because I admire the work of C.S. Lewis and also I wanted to see this film out of interest. I confess that my only ""Narnia"" experiences were the cartoon and BBC versions, and, so I started reading all of the books, and I got the invite by the time I was halfway through ""The Silver Chair."" Anyway, onto the film...<br/><br/>The film goes along a good pace and does an okay realization of Lewis' Narnia, the New Zealand backdrop does as well for this film as it did for Middle-earth (I was most impressed with the portrayal of Father Christmas). As for the computer graphics, they may not be as well done, as say ""Lord of the Rings,"" but they added perfectly to the creation of Narnia (indeed they much better than the BBC which had F/X no different than the original ""Doctor Who,"" so that I couldn't tell the difference between a werewolf and a normal wolf). As for the acting it was okay, the children were all right and being connected by a desire to go home. Although he merely provided the voice, Liam Neeson was a perfect choice for the voice of Aslan because in the book he has a ""golden voice,"" while Tilda Swinton was a perfect choice for Jadis, making her evil witch first ambiguous than going revealing some more evil. This was better then the other versions that tend to show the witch as a screeching crone. Ray Winstone and Dawn French were good as the beavers, provided some good humour.<br/><br/>My only complaints with it, are some shots that feel cheaply as if shot on hand-held camera, the camp fox and the ending. Those shots felt artificial and seemed to clash with the rest of the film, as did the portrayal of the fox by Rupert Everett. His line about being one of the good guys seems to be more Hollywood then Lewis, and he seem to be doing this out of a favour for the director for his work on the second ""Shrek"" film. As for the ending, I know it is a film and different from the book, but to it felt a bit too quick, especially the chase of the white stag, and when the children came out of the wardrobe, it felt too Hollywood as well. The only ending worked was with Lucy and Professor Kirke looking at the wardrobe and talking their Narnia experiences, unfortunately this was set a bit after the end credits when people were just heading out of the cinema! Otherwise it was all right adaptation of a work, while not being able to set the house on fire, it did perfectly to entertain for a whole evening."
"shaid","4","1","3","31 January 2006"," disappointing
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I have read the book far too long ago to make any comment if this one a good adaptation or not. I do remember that the book was full of magic and at time I have read the book several times. I can only say that I didn't like the film as I was missing the magic. Something was missing and I found myself cold and detached when watching this film and it came as a surprise because the trailer was quite promising(a proof that one should watch trailers very cautiously).<br/><br/>The technical aspect of the film is also not perfect. In some of the scenes you can see that it has been filmed with blue screen(and for a film which relay on special effects, that is a big miss). Some of the performances are not apt for the task. Especially William Moseley & Anna Popplewell ( respectively: Peter & Susan Pevensie). Their acting is dead wooden and do not bring the characters to live. If any thing save the film from a total disaster it is the performances of Skandar Keynes(Edmund Pevensie) & Georgie Henley(Lucy Pevensie). Their characters are well played and are convincing. The best performance comes from Tilda Swinton(White Which), who give a new meaning for the say: ""you are as cold as ice"". When ever she is on screen the chill and icy tone made me feel freezing(and in need of a cup of warm chocolate).<br/><br/>I am sure children will love the film. Adults who have fond memories from the book may be much more disappointed. Shame we have to endure another 6 adaptation of these books."

","I think this film was a cheep cut off of the book. And is defiantly not worth seeing. It wasn't much like the book to be onset it just destroyed the whole story. The only descent part is towards the end when the goodness of the warmth fought the evilness of the cold in one big battle. This film is a no see. I was expecting a lot from this epic tale but all i found was Borden. All i was thinking is when will this film end cause it just seemed to drag on and on and on. I walked out the cinema highly disappointed and tired. If u want to see a good film see Just friends. yeah don't see Narnia anyway and if you bring your children they will get really board and possibly fall asleep."
"Rich B","9","1","3","29 January 2006"," An excellent adaptation with superb effects. Very entertaining.
","When going to see this movie there were two things that were with me as baggage walking through that darkened doorway, thankfully I managed to leave both right there allowing me to enjoy the movie. One was the animated film I saw when I was a child, and the other was the hype and associated comparisons to Lord of the Rings both by Author association and Hollywoods new found love of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Neither affected the viewing of the movie and I was drawn into the film from the opening scenes. I can quite honestly say that even if I had been affected by those pieces of baggage, or indeed carried some of the religious argument into the cinema, I would still have been pulled into the movie just the same.<br/><br/>The story grabs you from the opening scenes of the Blitz and the performances of the children pull you right in. Immediately you understand the group dynamics and personalities of the children. That's one of the amazing strengths of this movie that carries from beginning to end, the storytelling.<br/><br/>Despite the huge effects and locations the real power is the story itself, pulling the classic book down into a manageable movie and yet keeping the moralistic tale filled with believable and identifiable characters. The movie does this amazingly well.<br/><br/>The acting is superb too, which helps the audience succumb to the tale. In particular the children are the shining stars of the film, with Georgie Henley as Lucy shining the brightest. There's a fine line between a young child star overacting and pulling off a strong performance of a childs' naivety, and she walks that fine line perfectly.<br/><br/>Skandar Keynes as Edmund is another character who is very ably acted, he portrays the petulant child well. Through this performance you can actually understand how he comes to his betrayal and you empathise with the range of emotions as he realises what he has done and how his young family have been affected.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson as Aslan was an interesting choice. Originally I had heard that this was to be voiced by Brian Blessed and that due to, allegedly, changes in his voice from dieting he was swapped for Neesom. Now this choice seemed poor for me, the voice of Blessed is strong and commanding and I didn't feel that Neesom carried the gravitas that could carry the role. How wrong I was. Neesoms voice was perfect for the part of Aslan, projecting warmth and strength wonderfully well.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is really good with Tilda Swinton proving to be a very strong and foreboding White Witch. Other roles, such as James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus and voices like that of Ray Winstone as Mr Beaver, are very well acted and totally immersive.<br/><br/>The effects are stunning in this movie, although there are a few moments where the green screen effect is apparent. What makes the larger creature effects so good is that they are combining CGI with costume and make up, combining reality with make believe. The only slight stumbling block of these effects is during the full scale battle scenes when CGI takes over totally and some of the more natural textures and movements are lost. However its not a huge setback and your eye is only distracted by it if you are watching very carefully, while you're absorbed by the movie you're likely not to notice.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are choreographed very well be they live action or CGI. Flowing and fantastically detailed, the larger battle scenes do not end up as a mess of creatures and body parts. I was reminded of the battle scenes from The Last Samurai which were almost graceful in the way they played out.<br/><br/>There are obvious comparisons with Lord of the Rings during the battle scenes, the sheer scale and epic feel of them as well as the multitude of mythical creatures, but that's where it ends. Sure there are many connections and similarities, but these are two altogether different tales and hugely different movies.<br/><br/>Something else I noticed on this movie - and usually when this aspect of a film is so noticeable it's a bad thing - was the music. Music should compliment the story, said the composer of The Crimson Rivers soundtrack, it should not try to overtake and retell the story. Likewise it should not disappear into the audio track and not have some form of impact.<br/><br/>The music for this movie hits these statements firmly on the head. It matches the movie perfectly and every scene it touches, it helps to build emotions and heighten tension, and bring the audience back down when the pace slows.<br/><br/>I have to say I was surprised at the ending. The temptation to create it in an overly romanticised manner or dwell upon the successions to the throne is avoided and instead we are treated as adults and the conclusion moves on more to setup the second movie. Oh, and a spot of advice, stay to watch the credits.<br/><br/>This movie belongs alongside The Lord of the Rings and holds great hope for the remainder of the trilogy."

"dtail42","2","1","3","6 January 2006"," All praise to JEEESUS, ahem, AAAASLAN! ...
","Had a bit of a special cinema-experience the other day; as a European visiting the US - Georgia, to be precise...<br/><br/>With two kids (6 and 11 yrs) of the people we were visiting, we went to see Narnia So, there I am, sitting in the Deep South, where a man is a man, and the Bible and a gun are both to be found next to the bed.<br/><br/>Ra-ra-ra, movie starts, at first very nice, but I was very disappointed by Narnia itself; I found it to be less than magical; very clean, and extremely dull-witted play by all kids except the smallest girl. The good guys look as if they are made out of clean plastic Lego or Playmobil parts put together by a toy-company, and the castles have the 'just out of factory - no people actually LIVE in them'-look that only big multi-nationals such as ""Castles-R-Us"" (a.k.a. Disney) can come up with. Where are the latrines that splatter-painted the walls of real castles in warm, earth-brown tones? <br/><br/>The most realistic things in Narnia were the bad guys; the minotaurs and the winged demons and orc-like creatures that actually were sweating and wearing stuff that looked real, and not like fancy-pancy plastic armour. Go Evil!! Speaking of Good vs Evil; the lowest of low points came when Aslan was resurrected; appearing with the sun-halo behind him, and music majestic and epic enough to tell even the dim-wittest person in the audience that ""Go(o)d was back to kick ass!"" - at this precise moment, arms shot up, hands were clapping, the word ""YES!"" was repeatedly yelled out with gospel-choir-like fervour, and I the word ""Jeeeeeesus!"" was heard yelled above it all. I should've brought my big paper bag after all.<br/><br/>After the movie, slowly filing out of the cinema, we passed a small guy with slick hair and a neatly ironed, white shirt. He was smiling a most benign smile, with a level of facial expression not unlike that of a playmobil figurine. He was handing out little pamphlets and postcards, with a mighty, roaring Aslan on one side, and text on the other side extolling all the Great Lion's virtues and how these were more or less analogous to those of our lord Jeeeeesus (with proper referencing to bible-passages, of course).<br/><br/>So, there; religion in the US today. I hope every kid in Europe will be able to watch Narnia and only marvel at the magic of it all, without having some more or less hidden religious message stuffed down their throats. Or - even better! - go and see Harry Potter and his adventures in a less-than-perfect but infinitely more interesting world instead :-)<br/><br/>I give it two stars; one for the best scene in the whole film: The Blitz over London in the beginning; and one for the Evil Queen desperately trying to make it more than a complete failure."
"sarastro7","4","1","3","30 December 2005"," Over-hyped
","I'm fresh back from having seen Narnia on the biggest possible screen. I knew better than to have great expectations, so I was only slightly disappointed. The story is very straightforward - you know where it's going, and it just keeps on going there and going there. The book is too compressed here; events happen too fast and there's no real time for developing the characters.<br/><br/>In the final analysis this Narnia movie is just a run-of-the-mill Hollywood production of a story that was and is a far better fit for the small screen as a TV series. Also, a big-budget production like this pretty much had carte blanche with the creation of the fantasy world of Narnia, and still they couldn't come up with anything particularly imaginative. This movie reads far too much like what it is, but shouldn't exclusively be: a kids' movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 10."
"buddahchuck","6","1","3","29 December 2005"," Another Film Failure
","How eagerly I awaited my viewing of this movie! I was excited that this story, which was so nicely crafted and developed my eager young mind. The chronicles of Narnia are a fantastic story. That being said, this movie is another example of how these horrible film writers have ruined every descent story there is.<br/><br/>First, the movie, being released after Thanksgiving, was clearly more concerned with Marketing for the Christmas season, what with the appearance of Santa Claus and the addition of Narnia having not had a Christmas in over 100 years. If Santa Claus had more to do with the plot (he does give the weapons) then perhaps this cameo would have been more productive, but once he leaves, there is no mention of Christmas or Santa for the rest of the movie. It seems as if this was just a last minute addition just to satisfy the whim of the producer.<br/><br/>Second, the characters were hardly developed at all. I suppose the viewer is supposed to pick-up on the tired motifs of (1) the child who always tells the truth but is never believed (2) the antagonizing, self-serving older brother (3) the bitchy (pardon the language) older sister and (4) the indecisive oldest sibling. Aside from all of these, we learn nothing about the characters that makes them unique to the story of Narnia. Honestly, this movie made me sick of British children all around. The gap-ridden smiles, the freckles (grr... ginger kids), and the terrible naivete of these children grates on every nerve as they stumble through fairly tame obstacles. And by the time you get to the end of the movie, all you know about the characters is the motifs, and as Aslan crowns each of the children, he assigns titles that are the complete opposite of what little we know about the children: the self-serving older brother is ""the Just"", the bitchy older sister (who just wants to go home the whole time) is ""the Courageous"", the indecisive Oldest sibling is ""the Great"".<br/><br/>Third, the special effects are clearly the only thing in the movie meant to capture your attention, and in that, I feel the movie is successful. The Lion is amazingly real-looking, the white witch really looks mean, and the centaur is really cool. Too bad the costumes suck, and the plot suffers because of all the graphics they try to add.<br/><br/>This movie was a let down. I'd prefer to watch the TV version because at least that version had half-way descent writing. When will the filmmakers learn that computer graphics cannot make-up for the lack of a good story and certainly shouldn't be exchanged for basic story tools (e.g. Characterization, mood, setting etc.)."
"stephen-dhondt","4","1","3","27 December 2005"," uninspired bore of a movie
","I can't possibly believe that anyone would rate this movie over 5/10 ... and that would only be for the effort of making it.<br/><br/>I have to be honest and say that I had my mind made up about the film even before my friend dragged me to the theatre to see it. <br/><br/>The opening shot was promising, I didn't expect the movie to start with a war scene, but that was about the only unexpected thing about it. From the point the kids leave their mother behind and travel to far off places it all turns to bloody sh*te.<br/><br/>The casting agency did a dreadful job and chose 4 of the most annoying actors éver! With one of them even surpassing Home Alone's Macaulay Culkin! At one point of the film I was actually rooting for the Witch to actually kill him, or at least torture him or something.<br/><br/>The visuals are lacking in imagination and are plain dull with a laughable final act that has no suspense whatsoever. And someone should inform Adamson that night scenes need to be lit too ... they were pitch black!<br/><br/>(minor spoiler) And for God's sake, if you're going to kill off a character, LET IT STAY DEAD! Don't create a boring weepy scene only to magically revive the corpse 5 seconds later.<br/><br/>The only good thing (and that's still arguable) about this film was Tilda Swinton. She is and always will be a good actress. But even good actresses can suck in lousy movies ... and she came very close to sucking in this one.<br/><br/>Perhaps all is not lost for the other possible book adaptations. But Walden Media may want to find another director, actors, CGI department if they ever want to compete with the Harry Potter series."
"hagman22","5","1","3","26 December 2005"," By far the most over rated movie I have encountered this far on IMDb
","This movie is really a good example of a bad Disney movie. OK, it is obviously made for children only, but that's no excuse for lacking all kinds of depth and emotion. I watched the movie in a cinema ranked as one of Swedens best, so the film makers really had a great opportunity to stun me, if not with a touching screen play so with spectacular special effects and nice filming. But no, nothing. In the cinema I could follow the reactions of my fellow watchers and the audience as a whole. The best words I can find to describe the reactions of the audience is flat and numb. Some clever lines were dropped that delivered some laughter but that was it. A movie that leaves a huge part of the audience untouched is in my eyes not a good movie.<br/><br/>To summarize: This film can probably give a thrill to really young ones, but if you're over 13 I would really recommend another movie, if you like movies that deliver so to say. But yet, for me this movie was a must as I read all the books when I was young so I don't regret spending 80 Swedish crowns (approx. 10USD) to watch it."
"charlsbalazs","2","1","3","22 December 2005"," I don't remember the book being this bad
","I read this book about 20 years ago, liked it, but wasn't crazed. Shortly into the movie, I cringed, and tried to remember if the book really was this bad.<br/><br/>Let's start with Tilda. She carried on, and did wonders with what she was given. Unfortunately, she wasn't given very much. The White Witch really wasn't that scary. Villains these days are much more complex and at least somewhat sympathetic. The White Witch was just a bitchy dictator. Not scary. Voldemort would rip her to pieces, and any Sauron or even Saruman would turn her inside out.<br/><br/>The special effects: OK, Aslan was good. Everything else--not good. There's one scene where the three kids are standing on a hill looking out across Narnia, and the background looks horrible, like a blurry, hastily-painted backdrop, or a bad green screen drop-in. The rest of the effects are sub-par for 2005 to say the least.<br/><br/>Lastly, the whole sacrifice/resurrection bit. Was this how the book was written? Halfway through the story, CS realized he hadn't come up with a way to get a sacrifice and resurrection, so he just dropped in the whole ""deep magic"" rules and whatnot? Then why did I (or anyone else) actually like the book? <br/><br/>Unsympathetic characters, one-dimensional villain, amateurish plot device(s)--this movie just is nowhere near the hype. Go see King Kong again."
"jltredinnick","3","1","3","21 December 2005"," Powerfully disappointing
","I expected so much more from a movie with as tried-and-true a storyline as The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Apparently, so much effort was spent perfecting the computer animation that all the other aspects of film-making fell by the wayside. True, the inhabitants of Narnia are diverse and fantastical enough to warrant some digital effort. But the life- lessons of Narnia are not conveyed through the flashy mythical animals, no matter how realistic.<br/><br/>The screenplay was lame - contrived and trite. The cinematography was inconsistent. Scenes that were heavily computer animated were pretty standard, but those that were actually filmed - earlier, pre-Narnia shots and narrow, humans-only shots - were distractingly awkward at times. And lastly, much of the acting was seriously sub-par. Unexpected islands of talent within the cast are provided by the performances of nine-year-old Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevency and James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. <br/><br/>Overall, though, I'd say skip it - unless you are a die-hard Narnia fan. Then wait for the DVD and rent it, but don't spend $8.50 and a three-hour excursion to the theater like I did."

","I saw this film yesterday with my children aged 8 and 5, both girls. They both really enjoyed it. I thought it was average. The character of Lucy was well portrayed by the young actress. However, Edmund, Susan and Peter were way off the mark. Bad casting? I don't know but I found that I didn't care one jot what happened to these three. I was actually hoping that the White Witch would turn Edmund to stone when she captured him. I also felt the same with Aslan. When he was sacrificed, I didn't care. I don't think the screenwriters were able to convey any meaningful relationships between character and character or characters and audience.The White Witch was excellently cast and played, mind you. She was very convincing. The worst part of the film was the beginning. The relationships between the siblings was very weak. It seemed like the writers were rushing it along to get into the main body of the story. Even when Lucy had gone 'through the wardrobe' for the first time, there was a part where her brothers and sisters were disbelieving of her. I was thinking 'Just get on with it!' Once they'd all gone into Narnia, the film picked up a bit. The scenery was breathtaking and the special effects were great. I think these were the only things that saved the film from being awful. I read all the books when I was younger and enjoyed them immensely. Wish I'd seen the film then as I think I would have enjoyed it more! Children will love it but adults? Be prepared for 2 hours of mediocrity."
"brianeridge","6","1","3","19 December 2005"," Enjoyable but not memorable
","In my opinion the movie is quite well done, well acted and visually impressive. It was a good diversion that did successfully get me into this fantastical world.<br/><br/>The primary thing I found unsatisfying was with the four protagonists as I can't remember any movie where the main characters do so little and are so unimportant to the unfolding of the story. In my opinion, they are present but not much more.<br/><br/>C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkein were apparently friends and both LoTR and Narnia were written about the same time. In LoTR the characters constantly make difficult decisions that determine their future, they make significant sacrifices and their strength of character and body are tested from start to finish.<br/><br/>In Narnia, with one significant exception, the characters are lead around from the start to the finish. The meet other characters by chance and each linearly gets them where they need to be next. They are destined for prestige in Narnia before doing anything beyond showing up.<br/><br/>Each of the four kids have interesting personalities but in my opinion at the end of the movie they are all the same undeveloped stereotypes as they were at the film's opening. Having not read the books, I don't know if I would have the same concern there or if the film version sacrifices so much that it is lost. My hope would be that the book does far more in this area.<br/><br/>For such a large budget and classic story I was very surprised that it would lack something so basic to story telling. At least that was my experience with the film."

","I looked forward to this film so much as it was so enjoyable as a child. However, I would like to find out who cast the children in the film because I thought all bar the little girl they were absolutely terrible. Everything about their acting was annoying and in places embarrassing. Does anyone share my views on this or is it just me. The oldest boy in it was by far the worst and I just felt like grabbing him from the screen and telling him to wake up. Very disappointed as I loved the book so much. I hope that something is done about this in the follow up films otherwise I think they might have a few less viewers. All that to one side the CGI was amazing and the well known actors like Ray Winston were extremely good."

","Here's what I suggest, WAIT for the DVD to come out. No point spending money for this movie unless you have kids 14 and below who want to have some fun.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is fantastic, but then again, in this day and age you've come to expect that from every movie. It's not enough sorry to say. The kids acting are terrible. There is little that makes you want to keep watching or keeps you on the edge. The story moves along so fast with so little content that you lose all interest in it. It's simplistic, boring, terrible editing...and more.<br/><br/>If its Friday night and you have nothing else to do, go enjoy the graphics but other than that...its not something people above a certain age group will find enjoyable. If anyone tells you that fantasy and long books are supposed to be like this...tell them Lord of the Rings is what its supposed to be like..not this."

","LOTR for kiddies. Most kids from about 6 to 15 will be able to associate with one of the characters, its a fairy tale for any adult who watches it. Dialogue is lame, the main characters are all overacted, which would be OK I guess for kids under 12 or so who may need it to follow the story. <br/><br/>While I know Tolkien and Lewis were friends, the stories are definitely aimed at different aged audiences and no Narnia film will IMPO ever match any of the LOTR.<br/><br/>I'll not watch the rest of the Narnia films, which I'm certain are in pre-production by now..."

"isildae21","9","1","3","10 December 2005"," Masterpiece!!
","What an experience!! One of the BEST fantasy films I've ever seen!! To sum up what I feel about it: Things I didn't really like (but didn't hinder my enjoyment of): Some of the CGI was just shoddy, and being made by WETA and for the money they spent, there's something amiss to that.*ponders* It was TOO SHORT!!! I felt like it needed At least another hour to finish what it started, and GAWD we could have used it considering how good it actually was. I mean I loved these characters and I wanted to get more out of them. What's worse is I feel they used the fact that it was so short to skimp on a few things, and that's just a shame. And I'm not necessarily talking about things straight from the book, I'm just talking about character development and interaction...because you could TELL these characters adored each other so much they just LONGED to have more time together.<br/><br/>The cinematography could have been better, and the editing could have been tighter.<br/><br/>Again these things didn't interfere with my love of the film, I just think these things could have made a really good movie--GREAT! One last gripe...there seemed to be an almost lackluster inattentiveness to detail, and that bothers me again since this comes from WETA...WETA can and HAS done better! And I think Disney was really pressing them for time, and that's a shame, because what they COULD squeeze in was MAGNIFICENT!! Things I bloody ADORED!!: Ummmm ALL OF IT??? REALLY, some of it was impossibly beautiful and had the potential to be...transcendent.<br/><br/>TUMNUS TUMNUS TUMNUS TUMNUS TUMNUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okies I could have withstood another 4 thousand hours of Tumnus FOREVER!! He was the GOD of Narnia (to me) and I can't speak my praises of him anymore. He was charming, haunting, charismatic, eerie, simple, complicated, angsty, sweet, humble, loving...so many other adjectives. He really is my favorite character, and to be honest I think he was better in the film than Lewis even wrote him.*adores* EDMUND!!!! GUH! He was everything I'd hoped, but perhaps not as nasty as in the books. He was truly a lonely and hurt little boy who just missed his Father very much, and children often misbehave when they are hurting. I think the film truly allowed us to extend great sympathy for his character and I think that's grand!! Jadis/Aslan-I'm putting them together because I think they both sort of blend together what Narnia is about. There was something more ancient and powerful and archetypal than even Lewis himself ever realized in their characters. I'm not discrediting that it's a Christian fairytale, that was made clear enough...But Christianity is based on older religions, and whether Lewis tried to or not, the truth and power of those ancient religions come through the strongest from these two characters. I loved Jadis's fire, as frozen-hearted as she was, her need to win went beyond desire...It was all that really mattered to her, because that was the way it was meant to be, and she could not escape herself. Aslan's sacrifice was the same. He couldn't escape that older innate truth anymore than Jadis could, and that truth is What must be MUST be. It's the oldest truth there is, and in the end it's the only one that really matters...The King/God/Savior MUST die, and there must be ONE to kill him. No matter the reason and no matter the myth, it is just the way the universe works, and Lewis just happened to understand this. That said Tilda was ASTOUNDING and she radiated her own kind of beauty, a cold and isolated loveliness that was truly magical, she was as tender as she was cruel, and as ruthless as she was apprehensive...It was a privilege just to see her act. Liam as Aslan was JUST as astounding and his voice just resonated wisdom, so much so that had Aslan spoken to me I could not help but respect him utterly, and he truly did look like REAL lion! The rest of the Penvesies: GUH these kids were so great! Peter was lacking for the first half of the film...but when Edmund fell, you could SEE the ferocity in his eyes, and THAT's what I wanted to see in Peter-wonderful! Susan was just a lovely lovely girl and had such a knowingness to her, plus she's pretty darn good with a bow and arrow! Lucy was Lucy, and that's a good thing, and she was such a pure spirit of all girlhood, and I felt like I was experiencing through her those feelings I had as a little girl, something I had desired to feel for such a long time.<br/><br/>The Ending...Awesome stuff!! The crowning was good, but Aslan leaving and that little ""talk"" between Lucy and Tumnus was BETTER!! Then the stag hunt with the four adult Penvesies was TO DIE FOR!! When I buy the DVD I'm going to have that on instant replay for weeks, it was just the most wondrous thing in creation. It wasn't even that they were beautiful and perfect, THEY WERE THEMSELVES!! I could totally believe they were those same four actors all grown up! I wanted that scene to last forever, and I didn't ever want them to go home.*worships Adult!Penvesies* To say the least I can totally and honestly admit that it was MORE than I'd ever hoped for, and that some of it was SOOOO right, that I could disregard most of it's failures. Bad CGI?? Who cares! It was the story Lewis wrote, and what else matters??? I truly feel I've been to Narnia and back!"
"gazzo-2","8","1","3","10 December 2005"," Very good, sorta Oz but strongly religious in places.....
",".....you know, Aslan being brought back from the dead and all. Who would have thought a movie about a talking lion, beavers, rhinos, cheetahs, etc centaurs, satyrs, etc-would be so moving and involving? I never read the books, but respecting the writer CS Lewis very much, I more than wanted to give this a chance.<br/><br/>It's well worth your time. Sure there are Lord of the Rings type backgrounds and imagery, sure you have to suspend disbelief(talking beavers?), and you wanna swat the second boy a lot, but still-this works and works well.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton as the White Queen was great, scary, believable. I liked all four of the kids, esp. the youngest-Lucy. Good jobs by them. You will enjoy the battle-harpy eagles dropping rocks, a bombing run anyone? and root for the good guys.<br/><br/>Weaknesses? Well--you don't get to know who is who all that well amongst the menagerie of animals; esp. the centaur, rhino, etc that show up towards the battle, the kids sorta accept their fates/roles quicker than you would imagine, and the ending sure seems odd. Tacked on, etc. They were inside Narnia literally for Years, then whap! back on the floor as they were at the start, mere minutes after they'd left.<br/><br/>But that's just carping. Best parts involve a thawing out waterfall, the big battle, and of course, Aslan's sacrifice.<br/><br/>***1/2 good stuff."
"sam-604","7","1","3","10 December 2005"," A magical film but.......
","Filming a book is never easy because a director has no way of knowing what is in your mind's eye. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is hailed as a great piece of work because although he may have imagined it differently than from you or I he did managed to bring Middle Earth to life and you could believe it exists. So it was with some degree of expectation that the magical land of Narnia would also shine on the screen. Shine it does but not as wonderful as you may hope. The sets are fantastic, the CGI is god-smackingly good and the battle scene is superb. Where the film falls down are on the things you cannot quite your finger on. For starters, Narnia does not seem cold enough during the evil white winter, Tilda Swinton (as Jardis, the White Witch) doesn't seem evil enough , Aslan (although superbly CGI) doesn't seem majestic enough and the film does not seem magical enough if say compared to Harry Potter. The children actors are at times are a little wooden but do a good job. Regardless if you can get over the nit picking it is great film for kids and adults who know the story. Also it was the first film I have seen that added material to the book in a beneficial way without taking too many liberties. More of B+ than a A-. There is cartoon version made in '78 and I would recommend watching that as well if not just for the music which is so perfect for the story and a real shame that this film did not have that cracking soundtrack."
"lanzman","9","1","3","10 December 2005"," Spellbinding!
","The Chronicles of Narnia has been on my ""to read"" list for years, but I've never quite got round to it. There was always something else to read first. So I went to the movie with no preconceptions and only a vague idea as to what the storyline was. Visually, the film is absolutely enchanting. From the lavish landscapes to the amazing fantasy creatures, it all works. The audience I was with was silently spellbound thru most of the picture. We were sitting in the back row and we didn't even see very many people getting up for restroom breaks! Storywise, things move right along (as you would expect in such a hefty novel translated to a single film) but it never feels rushed. The actors all do a superb job and casting Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was simply inspired. The only thing I would have done differently would be to have cast a different actress in the role of the Witch. Tilda Swinton does a creditable job and is suitably menacing when she needs to be - and she looks good in the combat sequences - but I think if an actress who was a bit more overtly feminine had been in the role, the aura of menace would have been enhanced. As it was, you know the Witch is up to no good from the first moment you lay eyes on her, and you wonder how Edmund could fall for her BS. But this is a minor quibble. Overall, an amazing movie that leaves you wanting the next installment. You have to hope that the production team returns more or less intact for the next one, they did such a good job here."
"jt4logos","10","1","3","10 December 2005"," True to the book
","PERFECT! wonderful film, impeccable casting, well-paced, and nearly flawless special effects. I am looking forward to all its sequels. Am planning to see it again in the theater. I was very pleased with the beavers; their personalities were funny and serious and homey. Little Lucy was a remarkable actress; she drew me into the film immediately. The Aslan was powerful but kind; the development of Peter into a real King made sense to me. The young actor seemed born to the role. The castles were gorgeous. Mr Tumnus the faun was exactly right. I noticed at several points that the movie theater was absolutely quiet, almost breathless. All the chase scenes were cliff-hangers and had me clutching my date's hand till I noticed my fingers aching. (His too probably.) I missed a couple of great scenes that had been in the trailer -- hopefully they'll be in the DVD. The children and animals were taken seriously, a refreshing change from the sitcom silliness of most children/animal movies these days. Highly recommended."
"spaceballstheflamethrower","9","1","3","10 December 2005"," Excellent Book Adaptation!
","The acting is top notch, most notably Tilda Swinton as the White Witch and all the Pevensie children are brilliantly casted. The effects are some of the best I have ever seen, I was skeptical at first at the idea of a world of walking, talking animals coming to screen, but Adamson knocked the vision out of the ball park. The story of this movie reflects Lewis's tale so well I would have to say that it is one of the best book adaptations that I have ever seen. But not only does it stay true Lewis, it exceeds some of his descriptions! A two page battle sequence in the novel turns into a beautiful 25 minute action experience. If you are atheist, Christian, catholic, whatever, this is a must see film. The story is simply stupendous regardless of age, race, or religion. Although some people are calling it Lord of the Rings Jr., it never felt like a kids movie. It is a story about four children and their adventures through a mystical land, that is age appropriate from anyone from 8-108! Big ups to Disney, Walden, Adamson, and of course CS Lewis, go see this film!"

","I have read other peoples comments and I did not read the story as a child, however I did see the animated t.v. movie as a child and was excited to see if this live version, with the C.G.I. would be all that I remembered. Well, it was! There were times you could actually see that the actors were in front of a C.G.I. background, but then again Narnia only exsists in the imagination. I was very pleased to see that the movie followed the story pretty much scene for scene. I was especially excited to see if they would complete the story with the Kings and Queens chasing the white stag (like in the t.v. movie) and returning to their world. It was all there! Just like I remembered. The actors were brilliant! My six year old went and he was a little scared when Aslan went to the White Witch but he was fine with the battle scenes. Go see this film!"
"lekha85","10","1","3","10 December 2005"," A Magnificent Piece of Cinema
","I was so worried that this film would disappoint after all the hype surrounding it but I really was mistaken in my fears. A combination of solid acting, superb graphics and a classic story came together perfectly to provide what I believe to be the film of the year. There was no attempt to avoid the comedic value of the story which only added to the enjoyment factor but the fear was present as well. The acting was sensational on certain parts and the big names were not a disappointment- Dawn French particularly was superb. There is always a worry with child actors that they will fail to draw you into the story after their years of trained acting but this was not the case. There is no doubt that there is a hint of 'Lord of the Rings' throughout the film, despite the Director's protests, but the two original stories come from such similar backgrounds and genres this comparison is inevitable. Truly a film for all the family- adventure, comedy, romance, deceit, love and friendship all in one film."

","I was hoping for really good things from this movie, but it left me feeling somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>All the ingredients are there to produce a really good film, a good book, stunning scenery and ILM on special effects duty ...but, the screenplay is a little bland, as are the performances of the children. The director has failed to make them sparkle in their roles, just as he failed to excite with his inconsistent pacing through the movie. There seemed to be a lack of excitement throughout, with scenes building and then not moving to the next level to really excite the audience.<br/><br/>It made me jump in a few places (hence the PG rating) and there are good things in this film, Aslan looks terrific, costumes and locations are wonderful but ultimately I found it all uninspiring.<br/><br/>It should have provoked some real emotion within me, but didn't (the book did!) They need to tighten things up if the remaining stories are to be turned into great movies."
"Korben_Dallas","4","1","3","9 December 2005"," Review from someone who hasn't read the books
","I didn't have any expectations regarding this movie but still it managed to disappoint me. The special effects are fantastic and are sadly the best part of the movie. Aslan looks amazing! My main problem was that the movie wastes a lot of time in some scenes like the War in London, Pevensies taking the train, going to the new home, Lucy meeting Tumnus... The Witch is far from being scary and her castle or evil deeds are unimpressive. The Beavers look great and are believable. Aslan is great. The rest of the characters in the movie are given ZERO depth. Are we supposed to feel sorry when they die in the war? I didn't even remember their names. There is little if any character depth in this movie... even the Pevensies. Geographically the movie gives us little or no indications as to where the characters are or where they are going. People just show up like it's a 20 minute ride. In the frozen lake bit the kids are half way through but they manage to outrun a sled in a couple of minutes. Suddenly there is some ancient prophecy that we don't know and now the kid has to die. Then there is a war and the kids know how to fight and to lead a medieval style battle. Everyone who read the book will probably hate my comment but this is MY OPINION. I didn't read the books and honestly I don't have any intention on doing so. If you want to give something for your kids to read get some Enid Blyton. There are no mythological creatures but the adventures are far more interesting."
"WyllyWylly","9","1","3","6 December 2005"," Excellent Realization
","I read the Chronicles of Narnia when I was little and remember distinctly being very moved by the story, in particular when Azlan's story unfolded. So many years later, the movie that I created in my head has come to the screen in all its glory.<br/><br/>Thanks to the visual effects of WETA and excellent acting by the young cast, Narnia lives if only on screen. Little time is wasted getting the audience into the story and once the action starts, it doesn't stop. It's difficult to tell where the effects start and stop which is what contributes to its believability.<br/><br/>This is fantasy of the highest order, suitable for children of all ages - including the older ones like myself. It's not often that the audience breaks into appplause at the end of a movie but that was the case here, and it's well deserved. You are cheating yourself if you wait for the inevitable DVD: this one is truly majestic on the silver screen, and should be seen that way."
"alvinvigil","8","1","3","7 December 2005"," A Visual Feast... Mesmerizing
","Having not read any of C.S. Lewis's fantasy novels, I was wondering what sort of magical world I would be entering upon viewing The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Like the world of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, Narnia is a fantastical place, where animals speak, centaurs and satyrs roam the lands but is divided by good and evil. Four London children escape the wrath of World War II and go to live in the countryside estate of an eccentric professor (Jim Broadbent). There, while playing hide and seek, they find a wardrobe chest that leads to the snowy land of Narnia. The evil ice queen (Tilda Swinton) has a hold on the land of Narnia and turns anything and anyone into stone that tries to up rise against her. The land is a never ending white Winter. The children join forces with the creatures of Narnia, led by the leader of the pack, the lion Aslan, to defeat the evil White Witch and her quest for ruling the land.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia is a visually impressive feat of Winter Wonderlands, Ice Castles, talking animals, mystical creatures, and a battle between good and evil but one of the most magical effects is that of Lucy, the youngest of the four children, who first enters the land of Narnia. Emotion as such cannot be created by any CGI. Disney's reported $150 million gamble hits the right notes for a successful franchise from the 55-year old book. To some, the story could be an allegory of the story of Christ but I didn't find that the film was arching for too many Christian themes. There are some bloodless, but violent scenes but as most children stories go, good always overthrows evil. Not only will children be thrilled by The Chronicles... adults, too, will be mesmerized."
"jboothmillard","6","2","10","31 December 2005"," The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
","Everyone was looking forward to a big screen adaptation of the classic children's book by C.S. Lewis, and director Andrew Adamson (Shrek) has done a good job making that happen. Basically the four Pevensie children, Lucy (Georgie Henley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), Peter (William Moseley) and Susan Pevensie (Anna Popplewell), are evacuated to the country after war has broken out, staying with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). One day, when playing a game of hide and seek, Susan hides in a large wardrobe of an empty room, and goes through a magical porthole leading to the land of Narnia, where she meets faun Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). She quickly returns when he warns her of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and next to enter the land through the wardrobe is Edmund, who meets the witch, calling herself the Queen, and she wants to meet the other children too. Soon enough, all four children are in Narnia, and it is only when Edmund is kidnapped he knows the ""Queen"" is evil, and it is up to Susan, Peter and Lucy to find him and get him back. When they are all brought back together, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver (Ray Winstone and Dawn French) take them to the true king of Narnia, Aslan (Liam Neeson) the lion, who ends the winter, and tells them of the prophecy they are part of. Now they are set to go into battle with the Witch's army, with all the other good guys, to bring peace and harmony to the land, and become the new leaders. Also starring Rupert Everett as Fox and Michael Madsen as Maugrim the white wolf. The performances, especially by the nasty Swinton and the majestic Neeson, are good, the special effects are well done, and the action is as good as you'd expect, it may not be amazingly good, but it a great family fantasy adventure. Filled with marvellous effects and made in Britain, this is a very good adventure story. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score and Best Song for ""Wunderkind"".

","This movie really disappointed me! I have never read the books and did not see the television series as a child. So I watched this film with an open mind, not really knowing what to expect, just that it was a children's movie, and in the adventure/fantasy genre. For me the movie had really bad special effects, the creatures were OK, but the blue screen scenes are really, really bad, and some of them are used in very unnecessary places. The story does not manage to introduce the land of Narnia properly, and the white witch is just a one-dimensional villain, lacking depths and motives. So the story stumbles along, showing us mythical creatures by the numbers, not knowing why some of them are good or bad, not letting us know how anything came to be. The climax of the film is over before it has begun, and I found myself wanting the witch to win, cause everything was so tacky and annoying. I understand that the concept was kept simple, because it's mainly for children. However, the great movies for children, manages to work on more than one level, making it entertaining for people of all ages, because it has a heart and a soul. This movie is missing both."

But one after another:<br/><br/>My girlfriend and me went to cinema to watch this movie, at the end she did enjoy it and I was bored to death. Here are some reasons why this film was...unconvincing...for me:<br/><br/>The characters weren't worked out properly, they remain flat until the end, so it was hard to feel with them. Same with the story; if you haven't read the books some questions are intruding; why is Peter able to fight like a maniac in the final battle when he killed a single wolf just by luck a couple of scenes ago ? Why are the humans so important for Narnia ? What does the professor give to the kids at the end ? <br/><br/>The CGI were nice sometimes to look at ( panning shots ), but most of the time they remained at B-Movie -level. ( Read some other comments because of that ) <br/><br/>The famous final battle was very disappointing. It was neither coordinated nor thrilling, I thought ""Well, at least It'll be over soon"". Battle characters and animals weren't introduced, they hopped around thats it. What about the Minotaurs for example ? And didn't I saw the scene with the sword-pointing Minotaur on the rock somewhere else ? ( Yes I remember, Battle of Helms Deep in LotR II, change the minotaur with the orkchief ) <br/><br/>Its a miracle how they keep characters shallow because shortage of time and make you feel like it never will end, I constantly watched my clock in desperate mood. <br/><br/>No no, shame at you Disney. It is possible, look at LotR! But that requires more than a couple of CGI's and well done advertising.

","I must admit, from the first shot that took you up into the cockpit of the German Bombers over the London rooftops, I had high hopes for the this film. Beautiful opening, I thought, emotional, and set up the relationships between the characters quite well while maintaining good pacing. Unfortunately, as the film continued, it started to drag in its attempt to fit all the characters and the plot elements into what turned out to be at times a tedious experience. <br/><br/>Admittedly, this is well crafted film, and it's meticulous workmanship can be seen in every shot and transition. The actors and CG characters all do a wonderful job of maintaining the fantasy that is Narnia. You won't be seeing any swaying cardboard cutouts and badly rendered crowd effects in this film. But perhaps I have been spoiled by the likes of Peter Jackson and even Chris Nolan with his recent take on the Batman franchise, but this version in all its loyalty to the work of C.S. Lewis somehow missed an element of magic which comes from a directors authorship. <br/><br/>In other words, this is not an enduring creative masterpiece, but rather palatable adaptation An adult vision of a children's story. It never creates that distinction between Narnia and the real world, and by creating a Narnia that is as believable as that London Flat, it actually took away some of the wonder that could have made this film as enduring as the original work by C.S. Lewis. The director did not choose to show this world as it would have appeared in the eyes of a child. . .the over bearing whiteness of winter snow in contrast to a damp musty country estate, the incredible and unbending evil of the manipulative white witch that distorts her beautiful features to one of animal like menace. <br/><br/>Remember how in the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's world suddenly went from black and white to technicolor in the turn of a tornado. Ah. . .there's the authorship that transitions a classic work of literature into a classic film. So in the way that every shot was predictably framed, in the same way that every cut was just the right length, and every costume just as it would have been in C.S. Lewis's world, it became a technical affair which for someone like me who already knows the plot quite well became. . .well. . . boring. <br/><br/>But then again. . .this is a well made film. Few would call it a blasphemy of the original version laid on paper and not celluloid. But this version is like a well made suit. Beautiful, but a suit never the less. Perhaps I went the the theater seeking not a suit, but rather, a pair of wings. . . not quite proper dress etiquette but that's what makes it magical."

","This Movie , i must say was a huuuge letdown...<br/><br/>First of all any movie can have great special effects and scenery now a days , so we start judging the movies on the different aspects instead , like acting. The acting in this movie was very poorly done , the four kids were understandably inexperienced to be in such a movie , but then the casting director should have done a better job at trying to find the right set of kids to act in it... The dialogs between the kids , were as annoying as nails to a chalkboard.<br/><br/>The only character i enjoyed watching was aslan himself , but since aslan was made up of special effects , he had no mistakes to make... Another thing which annoyed me was that in a scene u could clearly see that peters sword , was bending to the wind...O.o<br/><br/>All in all this movie was a huuge letdown , i expected more from the director and the crew to at least get better actors , and better directing... but i guess they made this movie for the money rather then for the story...."

"mandaface17-1","3","1","4","2 January 2006"," The Chronicles of Narnia: My View
","My analysis is solely based on the movie and NOT on the books!!<br/><br/>I have four major qualms with this movie: a) the simplistic way in which four main human struggles are presented b) the simplistic/inaccurate way in which human tendencies are presented c) overall fake way the movie is filmed in general d) the simplicity of its conclusion<br/><br/>a) While watching this movie, four main human struggles were presented (though feebly): i. old vs. young- The classic struggle of young children versus the mean, old guardian-like figure seems to creeps its way into the film. It seems as though there are two sub-groups of old vs. age presented in this film, one being the children against the new, old guardians (the ""professor"" and the ""housekeeper"") and one internal struggle between the eldest children versus the youngest. The mean, old ""housekeeper"" is in part the reason that all four children discover the secrets in the wardrobe, for they fear that they will be chastised for breaking a window. The film also presents the struggle between the eldest children and the younger ones for they do not believe they have found a magical land in the back of a wardrobe. ii. woman vs. man- The film presents an aspect of women versus men. For example, the youngest child is a girl while the eldest is a boy, and it seems as though they find it difficult trying to identify with each other. Also, the lion is presented as a man and the evil witch is obviously a woman. iii. good vs. evil- Obviously the film is all about good vs. evil, and of course is solved by a wonderfully happy ending. (the bad witch vs. the good lion) iv) brother vs. brother- Another struggle simplistically represented in the film, the competition between an older, wiser, more handsome brother versus a younger, less wise, less handsome brother who is driven to betrayal. The movie tries to present the difficulties two brothers have with internal, family competition and is of course solved at the end of the film. *All aspects are seemingly solved at the end.<br/><br/>b) There are three human tendencies seemingly represented throughout the film: i. females are always compassionate, sympathetic- Three scenes seem to represent this aspect best: the two sisters watching the execution of the lion, the witch killing the lion, and the sisters weeping over the lion's dead body. As the witch is about to kill the lion, it almost seems as if there is a tear in her eye, for girls should be compassionate (of course!) and not evil. The sisters cry as the lion is being executed also signifying the fact that females tend to be tender and sympathetic. The scene in which the sisters stay next to the dead lion as the two brothers prepare for battle also signifies the aspect that females should always be tender (weak?). ii. females can be conniving- The witch is presented as a seemingly nice 'ruler of Narnia' when the youngest brother meets her. Then, of course, the witch is found to be conniving and truly evil. This almost seems to convey the notion that females can be outwardly kind but can become vicious, conniving individuals. iii. men are always ready to fight- The scene in which the sisters are crying as the men are fighting also represents the aspect that men are always prepared to fight. This simplistic realization is sometimes downplayed by the individual acts of the youngest girl. She seems to be presented as a brave, young, daring girl when she persists on saying that they must fight the war that they caused.<br/><br/>c) I found the filming utterly unbelievable. The battle scenes were very much like the ones seen in Lord of the Rings, and it seems that the director spared no expense in making them. Yet, there are individual scenes in which you can tell that the children do not see animals. Perhaps its due to bad acting, but it sometimes seemed that the animals were not there (obviously they are not).<br/><br/>d) The conclusion seems to bring every struggle to a sickening, unbelievable, simplistic conclusion. The children are all crowned ""Kings and Queens of Narnia"" bringing the whole aspect of old vs. young to a close since the old lion will no longer rule Narnia. Also, as the children roll out of the wardrobe, the professor asks where they have been and the children do not respond for fear that he won't believe them. Yet, the professor surprisingly says to ""try me"" (me- meaning him) perhaps settling the issue between the whimsical, young children versus the old, wise professor. The conclusion also seems to solve the whole issue of women versus men in that each child is crowned (not only the men), the witch is no longer living (for she is killed by the lion), and the fact that the brothers now accept the youngest, female child's whimsical story. The death of the witch, the 'resurrection' of the lion, and the crowning of the children all signify that good has beaten evil. Of course the two brothers are now pals as they each equally rule over Narnia, and the brother versus brother competition seems to be over. The film's simplistic representation of the basic human struggles, tendencies and its overall fake/copy-cat-like filming undermines the overall message. The movie almost belittles humans and signifies the fact that humans will inevitably have war. The beginning of the movie presents four young children trying to escape a war, but in the end they are each faced with a different, magical war. They become passionate about the cause, and it seems as though the movie presents the fact that humans will fight for a cause they feel deeply about. Maybe I am just an idealist, but I don't think that way. Perhaps this movie is only to be considered children's entertainment."
"DianaC224","3","1","4","2 January 2006"," Beautiful to look at, but not great
","First off, a little background: I am an avid reader, lover of good stories and films (classic and new). I adore the LotR books and films, and I love the HP books and the last two HP films. Therefore, I came into Narnia really hoping to love it, predisposed to love it. Boy, was I disappointed!<br/><br/>Spoilers>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br/><br/>I haven't read the Narnia books. All I know of them is that they are supposedly Christian metaphor. Though I am an atheist, I adored LotR, which comes from a similar background. My mother, a devout Christian, watched Narnia with me.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at, with amazing winter settings, and wonderfully rendered characters. Aslan is magnificent. In addition to being visually stunning, the cast is great. James McAvoy is a darling Tumnus, Ray Winstone is a hilarious Beaver, Tilda is a ferocious witch, and Liam Neeson is regal as Aslan. Of the children, only Lucy and Edmund were truly interesting (the other two weren't explored enough- I mean, Peter is supposed to be this compelling King in the Making, but the film never justifies this). Narnia looks like a perfectly real world, and it would be easy to lose yourself in it if it weren't for the plot clichés.<br/><br/>Now the bad: As previously stated, the other two children weren't really explored. Susan's only purpose in life is to stand beside her more interesting siblings. Peter is destined for greatness, but all he really does is rally the armies to battle (though I will admit he had a great moment with the witch at the end). Lucy is a lovely picture of faith and love. These three children have only a little depth: they do not want to do battle, but they are unquestionably good. The only truly interesting one is Edmund, who betrays his family because of his inferiority complex. Since I haven't read the books, I don't know if this lack of depth is due to the source material or the director. One of the complaints that Christian groups have against Harry Potter is that he is a rule breaker and occasional liar with questionable ethics; this is precisely what makes him interesting- his faults!! Every great literary character- from Scarlett O'Hara to Bruce Wayne- is flawed, but these children (Edmund excepted) are perfect. <br/><br/>People in Narnia keep dying left and right, but getting magically resurrected. Now, being a fantasy fan, I am used to magical resurrections, usually involving a very powerful magical character, like Gandalf, Voldemort, even Buffy (twice, no less). Therefore, it is easy to accept Aslan's return, but it is really tedious when EVERYONE is resurrected. Only bad guys stay dead. If there is no death, then there is no peril, and therefore there is no drama.<br/><br/>Finally, the film moves very quickly from one thing to the next. One second, the children are discovering the magic of talking beavers, the next second, they are throwing themselves off a cliff to escape the witch while struggling with a prophecy that declares them to be royalty. Narnia is great and it is beautiful, full of interesting characters- why don't we linger with them for a little while. When the big battle (which is not really big) begins, we cheer the good guys because that is what we're supposed to do, but we really don't care about them. We love the children because we've followed them, but can we really say we care about anyone in their army? In LotR, we cared about secondary characters, like Theoden or Treebeard, because we were allowed time to grow to care for them. In essence, this film's greatest problem was its brevity. ain't it cool news (website) said it best: that extra hour is the difference between a film like this and a film like LotR.<br/><br/>Was the film awful? No. Is is preachy? Almost annoyingly so; my mother hated it (and she's a Christian). I would take young children to see it, but I would not pay to see again myself. If it's adventure you want, hop over to King Kong, or better yet, watch Harry Potter before it leaves theaters."
"maylamayla","3","1","4","29 December 2005"," Disappointed in Narnia
","I really enjoyed the first half an hour of this movie! I enjoyed the portrayal of Lucy and Mr. Tumnus. But overall I rather disappointed in the movie. <br/><br/>I agree that it was probably difficult to adapt a screenplay from the book, however, I did not think that changing around events and adding scenes was necessary or respectful to the readers of the book. I think the changes unnecessarily changed the movie into a less intelligent film. If nothing else they could have used some narration in this book. Perhaps they could've even begun with the children falling out of the wardrobe and narrating the story to the professor.<br/><br/>Was it really necessary to make the chase more dramatic in the fact that the witch appeared to be right on their heels rather than a few hours behind as in the book? Would it have been difficult to show the changes that the being in Narnia had on the children, couldn't they have somehow appeared stronger, braver, and more skilled. Rather than them literally stating that they are going to ""practice"" and making it appear that a few hours of ""practice"" could make them skilled defenders? <br/><br/>Could the witch have just acted out her disbelief at Aslan's return rather than her stony faced statement ""impossible!"" I missed the scene where Aslan is so delighted to be reborn that he throws the children in the air. I think Aslan throws someone up in the air in every book! It would've been nice to see this dimension of Aslan as well.<br/><br/>I hope that at some point in the future another producer gives this book a better life on the screen."

","This movie was nothing like the books. They are a great series, and unfortunately this movie did not do the story justice. The acting was pretty bad, the kids were adorable..but adorable does not equal good acting. Also, they attempted to make it a little too kid friendly, while the books have a more grow up feel about them. I'm guessing their budget was also much smaller than LoTR, since the special effects were nothing special...LoTR was upsetting only in the fact that they doctored the ending to give Liv Tyler a bigger part, however the rest of the plot was just like the books, and the director did an amazing job of making a fantasy movie that felt real. Unfortunately, Narnia did nothing of the sort, and like I previously stated, the actors did not make you feel anything really. The Witch looked at best bored and in need of some makeup, the kids kind of like they were along for a joy ride instead of in a real war and the CGs were poor. Overall it was very disappointing..the best part being the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 trailer."
"mockturtle","5","1","4","15 December 2005"," The Chronicles of Money-a: Jesus, Lilith and the drobe full of War
","It isn't so much what the Narnia says that is disturbing as the things that it is really saying and how that bodes for sequels and other popular entertainments.<br/><br/>One of the first lessons learned by one of the Pevensie children is that it's okay to go home with strangers. Especially if they offer you tea. If they offer you tea then you are just ill-mannered if you don't come home with them. Mr. Tumnus has been cast much younger than in the book, and the film is chock full of very weird close up shots of peoples' faces as they change expression. This combined with the borderline coquettish way the little girl playing Lucy has been directed to act, the lulling of her to sleep and the anguished ""I'm kidnapping you,"" made this scene more harrowing than anything in the recent crazy-guy-with-child-in-peril film ""Keane."" Is it really possible that people don't see how freaking creepy this sequence is? Another lesson: if you have an imagination you are a sissy boy-liar-traitor and probably have dark hair. You will betray your own family to their deaths.<br/><br/>Another lesson: Women should shut the heck up when a man (especially one with blonde hair and blue eyes) is making a decision. They keep telling Susan not to be so smart and she keeps shrewing it up with the wrong decisions, countermanding and undermining her man/brother (did I mention that's creepy too) at the worst possible times with the worst possible decisions. When will she ever learn? As I hear there is more punishment in store for women who think they want to have ideas, or be unashamed of their strength and (gasp) sexuality. Stay tuned! And if you are a strong woman, then you are heartless, asexual andwell, ultimate evil really. Why not end it all now and save Aslan the trouble of biting your head off? Thank any lion god that in movies it doesn't matter how cool you make the good guys: evil is always cooler. Tilda Swinton walks away with it to the point where there should soon be an epidemic of cross-dressing elementary school boys trying to be as tough as she is.<br/><br/>Another lesson: Christmas is all about presents and has bugger-all to do with Christ. As a moonbat I can't really argue with this lesson.<br/><br/>Know ye this: Lion Christ was shaved for our sins. Yea, upon his haunches he sat, taunted by Jew and Orc alike. Verily would he have been smote and struck from the book of life by the evil Smart Woman, save that Lion Christ knew the secret to tricking her: women can't read! Huzzah! With this gnosis he laid his fuzzy head upon the pagan altar bearing the very instructions of how he would rise again on the morrow. O for a muse of fur! <br/><br/>'Tis a rare film where the talking beavers are more realistic than the humans. Oh, and the new age music is simply awful.<br/><br/>Is this really what you want your children to be learning?"
"okiijin","4","1","4","15 December 2005"," Yawn...
","The lion the witch and the wardrobe is in my opinion, one of the worst of the seven books in the narnia series, but still a great book overall. However, I cant help but disagree completely with the length of this movie. If I recall correctly, the book was barely a novel, weighing in at a minimal 100 pages or so. Strech those 100 pages out into a two hour movie with unbelievably horrible green screens and blatant groan-able analogies, and any movie would end up with a less than 5 rating from me. Two hours! really! I'm not joking! Where did they get all that extra footage? Well, mostly views of the countryside, and long close-ups of the actors faces.<br/><br/>Almost every scene and character in this movie was ripped straight from the Bible, or from Lord of the Rings, and it shows. Names have been changed to protect the innocent (in most cases).<br/><br/>The Santa Claus scene was the worst. Why is Santa Claus in narnia? isn't it kind of another world? I think presents could have come from somewhere else just as easily, and that passage could have stayed on paper and out of the movie theater...<br/><br/>In defense of the movie, I understand completely that this was a movie based on a very Christian children's book and the analogies were meant to be understood by children, however, a little more subtlety could have made an okay movie into a decent movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Santa Claus scene was the worst. Why is Santa Claus in narnia? isn't it kind of another world? I think presents could have come from somewhere else just as easily, and that passage could have stayed on paper and out of the movie theater...<br/><br/>Even though I didn't care for this movie that much, if you haven't seen this movie yet, I do suggest watching it, because the later books in the series are much better and will make much better movies... and it would be a shame to have missed the first one."
"rebeljenn","6","1","4","10 December 2005"," Falls short of a better film, but good
","A decent film, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' is at times captivating, but, it falls short of delivering a better film. I haven't read the book since I was about 10, and I saw the cartoon on television -which I really enjoyed- before that. However, this review is not to look at the film adaption of the book and to say what was done wrong and what was removed; it's been too long ago for me to really remember the story to go into that detail! I am rating this as a film. Design, pacing, and acting and the three main areas that I'll cover in this review; each had varying levels of success. Although some of the film design was done very well, I did have some problem with some of the CGI and realism. Some of the design was done exceptionally well, and some of it wasn't. For example, the scenes of the children crossing the river, the lion, and the creatures turning to (or from) stone were quite well done, but I had some problems with the CGI beavers and some of the other critters. The beavers did not look realistic, but it looked as if they were made to be realistic without facial expressions (or limited expressions). The lion was done well, and CGI in other films is also done well, but it seemed to me as if the beaver got the short end of the stick (no pun intended) when it came to CGI. The battle scenes also involved some less-than stunning CGI compared to what I've seen in other films. Costume design and set design was generally very good from the castle to the beaver's home. There were some very good shots; in particular, the shot of the curtain falling down from the wardrobe while Lucy pulls on it is very good. The film did have some trouble with brining the camera into the scene; it seemed difficult to really get involved in the film in some places because the characters seemed distant while better camera use could have brought the audience more into the story instead of making them feel like outsiders. Pacing was another unfortunate drawback of the film. There was often a sense that some events were slow while the action scenes got less time. Not related to pacing, but I did notice consistency issues. Lucy provides one of the characters with a hankerhief, which is later retrived from another character and then by the same character at the end of the film. In principle, the character who presented this at the end should not have had the item anymore. Acting was done well throughout except for a couple of instances involving CGI, including the character who becomes alive again after being turned to stone. Overall, it's a good film for children, and it reminded me of Disney's older children's films. It also reminded me of Lemony Snicket -- I guess it goes to show that children enjoy films where children are in unfortunate circumstances and become the heroes. I hope more films like this continue to get made. It's certainly not a perfect film, but it is not too bad. I give it a 6/10."
"orcdoc","7","1","4","9 December 2005"," Fun film amazing design, let down by some truly horrible special effects.
","Just got back from seeing this film and I have to say, overall, I enjoyed it. Some of the imagery was exactly as I imagined it when I read the books, the White Witch and her castle, Mr. Tumnis and the Beavers. It's a very well made film, not sure if Andrew Adamson should direct real people, but this was his first time, so we'll see what he does in the future. As for the design, Weta has again created amazing creatures, armor and weapons and some of the effects are beautiful, such as the Beavers, but, some of the effects are appalling. The wolves, seen better animals on the PS2, Aslan, the one creature who should have been top notch, so-so, no life, no character, too much facial animation...real lions don't have that kind of muscle structure. Next time, go to Weta, ILM just can't cut it anymore. Anyway, no more complaining, fun movie, take the kids. they will love it."
"knight110tim","5","1","4","9 December 2005"," Mediocre children's film
","Let's get one thing straight - this is not the next Lord Of The Rings. That trilogy set the bar so high for fantasy films that it would take something pretty amazing to even equal it. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is not that film.<br/><br/>Amazing (but sometimes a bit wonky) effects sequences, wonderfully animated talking creatures, beautiful sweeping New Zealand scenery and odd flashes of humour can't stop this being very clearly an old school children's' film with a simplistic story, cheesy bits (like the appearance of Father Christmas to hand out the 'magic weapons') and two-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the four central child actors are very annoying - lacking the charisma, talent or maturity of, say, the stars of the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>Thankfully the Christian subtext is subtle and Liam Neeson turns in a warm vocal performance as Aslan, but it's the CGI Beavers and wolves that will really stick in the mind. A mild distraction, Narnia is a pleasant piece of gore-free fluff that will - eventually - become a Saturday afternoon television staple to distract the wee kiddies from their Playstations once ITV's copy of the Railway Children has worn out."
"pzazz_hij","9","1","4","8 December 2005"," Peter Jackson watch your back
","Straight away i've compared this film to Lord of the Rings which to be honest i probably shouldn't have done but there is no doubt about it that there are so many similarities between The Lion, the Witch and the wardrobe and Peter Jackson's Masterpiece trilogy that it would have been acknowledged eventually. A war raging in a world of magic and good vs evil that is inspired by a timeless novel, and filmed in New Zealand by a native director. It's too obvious for anyone not to compare. However, The Chronicles of Narnia should be given its own space in the world of cinema that will allow it to stand up against such a huge movie franchise such as Lord of the Rings because, put quite simply, its the most enchanting motion picture in years. <br/><br/>The story follows four siblings in their journey through a magical wardrobe and into the world of Narnia. Whilst there they learn of their destiny to lead an army against the evil White Witch who has kept Narnia in an endless Winter for 100 years. With guidance from the Lion messiah, Aslan, the four young heroes must find the strength to overcome the odds in the great battle of good vs evil.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Adamson has had great cinema success with his beloved Dreamworks creation of Shrek. But, this being first time behind a feature film, and a really big one at that, he had his work cut out for him immensely. Luckily he was clearly up for the challenge because with this spellbinding family epic Andrew Adamson has done the job perfectly. He made it so much better than i imagined it would be and the film genuinely has something for absolutely everybody's taste. As far as i'm concerned Adamson has himself a really good chance at an Academy Award because he has truly met the standard head on.<br/><br/>Visually, the film matches that of Harry Potter and all the special effect are so stunning and realistic that it will draw you into the magic even more. <br/><br/>The performances are excellent form the four leading youngsters and Tilda Swinton shows her evil side as the White Witch that could easily be her best spell yet. James McAvoy plays Mr. Tumnus with great emotion and captures the character on stunning form (I specifically felt a need to mention him because i think he's a brilliant actor and i'm an ever growing fan).<br/><br/>Its obvious that they would have had to cut some of it out from the original portrayal in the novel for various reasons. They kept the runtime to 2hrs 20mins and i, for one, am beyond impressed, nothing important was missed and everything was explained better than previous adaptations that i have seen of the novel. It was also good to see a film that didn't seem to last half as long as it did and that you didn't want to finish, the time went by quickly and i loved every single moment.<br/><br/>If you have any doubts about seeing this film for any reason, don't. Its a film for everybody that will capture and hold you until the very end. <br/><br/>From the beloved masterpiece by C.S Lewis another form of masterpiece has been created on the big screen, it is a must see and that is a fact that i must insist you pay attention to. <br/><br/>I know for a fact that Walden Media has optioned all seven of the Narnia books for film development and i really do hope that they make the rest of them because if they are half as good as this on screen then we will have a masterful saga.<br/><br/>If you really want to see a film thats worth yours family's money make it 'The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the wardrobe'. You will not be disappointed."

","I went to see this movie with some friends of mine and we had quite a debate was it just us having too big expectations, or the movie was really that bad:<br/><br/>The first hour you watch kids jumping in and out a closet and making a 5 meters walk in the woods, waiting for something to happen. Then an episode with an awfully casted Faun and a heavily over-polite British chit-chat over a cup of tea hogs the next 15 minutes, making a feeling inside a viewer that something really cheesy and boring is about to be happening the rest of the time. And the feeling is right -- lame references to Christianity, forced references to various mythologies with a menagerie of poorly animated and incoherent CGI characters that look like gathered from every fairy tale, myth, horror movie and Disney cartoon ever made... Then Father Christmas comes out of the blue riding a sleigh and arming the kids up to their teeth, turning them instantly from toddlers to warriors just by giving them 50 pounds of steel! All of that is garnished by a complete lack of imagination and creativity (a beaver called Mr. Beaver -- give me a break!!!), generic directing, pathetic music, corny landscapes and poor acting. The result is a killing boredom with a total lack of interest in the characters or that Narnia place where Turkish delights are a national treat (how the hell do they now for Turkey?!?).<br/><br/>The only highlight is the appearance (I deliberately don't say ""performance"") of Tilda Swinton. She is so weird that she just doesn't have to do anything special to look creepy. And still, it was all so corny! Little Georgie Henley (Lucy) is perhaps about to be going places too, but with some other movies.<br/><br/>To me there was nothing ""heart-warming"" in this movie, nothing ""moving"" (except for my bowl, however) and absolutely nothing worth seeing.

","Maybe it's just me, but the plot seems kind of too worn out. Or perhaps, it would be better to re-phrase - the realization wasn't good enough. Throughput the whole movie I couldn't stop wondering ""Why the h**l am I thinking of a weird combination between ""Heroes of M&M"", ""Willow"" & ""The Ice Queen""?!?!? Too brutal one might say, but acting of the four majesties didn't feel as ""real"" as the artificial characters per se. (Take the gryphon or the cute fox for example - let's not even start with Aslan.) And as NOT modest at all of me to say - I tend to ""catch & feel"" a good movie when I see one - but this one wasn't exactly the right kind. So personal or not, a message to people about to see ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"": Your children will love it, make sure you've had enough sleep before it (otherwise you might turn into Mr/Mrs Snoooreee) and even if you try to shed a tear at some point - don't even think about it.

","In a nutshell, I would say the movie was... Just OK'ish. As a huge fan of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Potter"" films, an epic fantasy movie such as this should have blown my socks off, but it just didn't seem to have any heart. <br/><br/>The movie starts in World War II England. Four kids are sent out in to the countryside to live away from the main brunt of the German bombing campaign. The children are quite bored, and they decide to play a game of hide and seek. When the youngest attempts to hide in an old wardrobe, she enters a mystic wintry world of Narnia. A land full of half animal, as well as fully animal creatures who can chat it up, as well as cyclops, and other various creatures we expect to find in such tales of fantasy. <br/><br/>Tilda Swinton does a quite competent job as the wicked white witch. Well, lets face it, just watching her beautiful face would be enough entertainment to half carry a movie. In fact, all of the acting is quite solid in my opinion. Also, the effects of the show are quite masterful, a job well done by all on that front. Where the movie comes up missing is how it uses all of the wonderful attributes it has. These are wonderful and magical images, yet we never really care that much about either the children or the entire world of Narnia. Sure, they seem nice enough, and the White Witch seems quite evil, but we never seem to get into the characters outside of rather shallow characterizations of good and bad. Its as if Disney tried to make a Lord of the Rings film. They kept all of the imagery and the structure, but they forgot the heart. <br/><br/>Now, I must confess. I nave never read the books myself, but even if they also never really let the reader get into the characters, I still blame the film makers, whose job it is to go beyond the source material and make a truly entertaining film for its viewers. I am unsure if the writers and directors were just not competent to this task, or if they truly felt like all they had to do is give us a few funny and cute lines of dialogue for us to understand why these human children decide to risk all to help them, or conversely why all of the ""good"" creatures of Narnia are willing to die in combat under the leadership of some seemingly random humans. <br/><br/>Another sadly missed opportunity was the final somewhat anti-climatic battle. While the first half of the movie is unforgivably slow to build towards some action scenes, the war itself involves a good idea of creatures running at each other, but rarely do we get to see any actual combat, or even contact between combatants! My mind was a wonder at the thought of a cheetah, rhino and centaur good guys duping it out with various half bull, cyclops or bat people. But, none of this is actually seen. Instead we get to see a lot of heroic poses and grunts from a multitude of admittedly wonderful looking mythical creatures. But, as I said, without gaining an investment in any of the actual beings we are watching, these poses come off as images some CGI technician thought would look good. <br/><br/>The ultimate realization of image over substance and hopefully not a hint of things to come in fantasy film. With that being said, I am sure it will make tons and tons of money considering the marketing megamachinery behind it connecting it to the recently very popular ""Christianity in film"" trend. But, it will never truly take the place of our beloved Lord of the Rings franchise."

","Chronicles Of Narnia Shane Gannaway One of the most daunting tasks a director can possibly try to tackle, has to be that of a movie that was based on a book. It's not just the regular movie goers he has to please, it's the thousands upon thousands of fans that he also has to satisfy. I can't say whether Andrew Adamson did a quality job of putting the book's magic on charm on to the big screen. I've never read the book. He did put something on there though. And while however beautiful it is, it has its flaws.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, is as a good friend of mine put ""a visual feast."" The movie is amazingly stunning in visuals and CGI. This helps bring some magic to this movie. The animals are amazingly done, looking extremely lifelike. The faun, or as some might know him, Mr. Tumnus is also very well handled. The way they added goats legs onto the second half of James McAvory is flawless. This movie doesn't lack on the visuals. It's got plenty of eye candy and many people probably won't mind watching it muted.<br/><br/>If the movie is not muted, then you have to sit through what seems like could have a solid story. Instead you are rushed through an adventure that was seemed to be squeezed into two hours for no apparent reason. The obvious Christian allusions are all still there, but there is a sense of rushed-ness as we fly through this film. There are times when you may watch certain scenes and wonder why they are in the movie at all. Basically, besides the rushed story it's the small things that start to grate. The fact the at a little girl no older then 10 can make a bulls-eye with a knife. The never convincing fake snow that the audience sees so much of. The feeling that Narnia was toned down a little, just for the kiddies. This movie is rated PG, so I don't know what I expected when I went to see it. It is though, a very violent movie. And the only reason it keeps this PG rating is by taking out in what would have been some very gory scenes, all blood. I hate it when this happens. When a movie is toned down, when the artistic value of film is compromised, just for more ticket sales, I get angry. And a kitten dies. It's a horrible thing. Anyway, that's what Narnia does. They tone it down and speed through all the while impressing you with some pretty sights and sounds. Like I said, I haven't read the book. It's my belief though, this book should have been made for the people who first enjoyed it, and not the little kids Disney usually shoots towards."
"Elizabethlea","1","1","7","4 June 2006"," Hollywood cardboard!! *SPOILERS*
","I am a fan of the Chronicles of Narnia (the books), I read them when I was a little kid. I just watched the movie on DVD and was appalled at the way the makers of this film turned the books into Hollywood cardboard. <br/><br/>For one thing you don't like/empathise/sympathise with the characters, because it is all just too easy. There is no going hungry in the woods, or anything that makes you feel as if getting through this adventure is a struggle. Or that shows the characters actually growing... in the book, this was not the case. By the time they are crowned or whatever, I was thinking to myself that this was totally stupid, they had not really done anything in the movie to deserve being crowned. Without the struggle & growth that is presented int he books, you wonder to yourself, ""what is the point???"".<br/><br/>The logic was much better in the novels as well - for example, in escaping from the beavers' damn they don't go down a tunnel or cross a river. They leave before the wolves get there, and because of heavy snows their tracks and scent are hidden from the wolves. They hide in the woods overnight, cold and hungry, while the wolves move on. <br/><br/>In my opinion the character Aslan should have been narrated by someone like Ian McKellan, because Neeson had way too high a voice and no 'presence'. You just didn't believe that Aslan was this all-important being who was around way back when the ""deep magic was written"".<br/><br/>The special effects were good. And I liked the way Mr. Tumnus was portrayed. That's just about the only aspects of the movie I liked. <br/><br/>Sure, it could be mildly entertaining if you hadn't read the books... but if you have I don't understand how you could enjoy this film. THUMBS DOWN.<br/><br/>I could go on and on for another hour about the different ways I was disappointed with this film. But I think you get the idea."
"SmthSSArmour","7","1","7","10 December 2005"," Outstanding - on a visual level
","If you feel uncomfortable at a (very) thinly veiled Christian message then don't see this film or if you do, be prepared to give it a chance. It's standard good overcomes evil fare but lifted by some superb acting. I went determined to leave any cynical preconceptions behind and simply to enjoy it for what it was - a good adventure story. I read the book as a child (9) and loved it, returned to it at 25 and felt put off by what seemed to be the worst sort of mealy-mouthed Christianity. The film hasn't changed my overall impression of the story as a Christian allegory likely to annoy the hell (no pun intended)out of anyone with atheist tendencies. As a confirmed agnostic, several bits did make me cringe inwardly, but I was able to enjoy it as a superb piece of film, rather than anything with a Message. If this is the first of a series, I await the sequels with interest."
"rupcousens","7","1","7","9 December 2005"," A counter-productive allegory
","Has the film downplayed the book's Christian allegory? Lewis's intent is still strikingly clear on screen. You get a hint of his dubious 'Lord, liar, or lunatic' trilemma from the Professor before the children even get through the wardrobe; and Edmund's temptation by Turkish Delight could be construed as a dangerous flirtation with Islam. But it's in the parallels of Aslan with Christ in the second part of the film that things get really obvious. The lion has his own Garden of Gethsemane moment before going off to be sacrificed instead of the sinful 'son of Adam', he is humiliated before being killed, his body is tended by two weeping women, and then he rises from the dead.<br/><br/>Lewis's intention was to prepare children's minds for reception of the Gospel by casting it in an adventure story, but surely there's a danger here. If you present Christ's sacrifice and resurrection in terms of magical fantasy, don't you make it more difficult for children to make the leap to understanding the New Testament as fact rather than just another parallel myth? The other key problem is that there is no logic to Aslan's passion: there's some mumbling about the 'deep magic' requiring that the Witch have a sacrifice, but I would struggle to explain to a child WHY it was required, or how this deep magic could be a force of absolute good. Rather than making the Christian message easier to assimilate, Lewis's tale just makes it seem confusing."
"Jeremyknix","8","1","7","7 December 2005"," Not bad... we'll call it solid.
","Saw the movie at a preview screening, going into it with a little preconceived notions as possible. I'm a student in my early twenties, and like many of my peers, hadn't read the book since my younger years in elementary school.<br/><br/>I will say this, the movie does a remarkable job of keeping as true to the book as possible- i found myself remembering smaller details i had forgotten about the novel originally. Swinton does a spectacular job at bringing the White Witch to life. I believe only small details were omitted (wasn't there a talking rat-warrior character who lost its tail in the original?), but nothing that seems to have dramatically changed the story.<br/><br/>Kids will enjoy this movie, for the most part, as there is little that should go above their heads (the younger ones will be entertained by the young cast and talking animals, while the pre-teen and teen audience will be able appreciate the film for its worth). Adults who enjoyed the Narnia series and movie-fare such as LotR will as well enjoy it.<br/><br/>However, i wasn't astounded. Yes, the battle scene was impressive, but while it triumphs over the LotR battles in variety of warriors, orchestration and execution was done better in the LotR trilogy (for those who will argue that the battle was not one of the main points of the novel, i argue that it was heavily emphasized enough, and well done, but simply not the best out there). There are points where the action and story falls into lulls that are not all that interesting, however true to the book, that leaves the movie feeling less-than-whole. The movie is heavily (though understandably) fueled by special effects that cannot alone the movie through its weaker moments. Add in a very Disney (double) ending treatment, and i firmly say that while this is in no way a bad movie, i wouldn't call it the best.<br/><br/>It's a good movie for the season, and one to see if you're a Narnia fan. Though don't feel you're missing out on anything if you don't catch it at the theaters. Knowing Disney, it'll be on DVD mid-Spring."

The battle scenes should not have been shot at mid-day, and if need be, should have had more of an overcast feel to it. It felt too sun-shiny for such a scene.

The landscape and the setting of the movie was fantastic, and it looked very believable. <br/><br/>This movie is all right in some cases but in most, it fails.

As a movie-goer, not a follower of the books, I found it to be disappointing. It feels like Disney's attempt at a huge series and this one is marginal at best. The special effects, done by ILM, seem to have the same problem all ILM movies have: a rubbery/plastic shine to all of the backgrounds and characters. Some other effects were good, such as the beavers, wolves or Aslan; but overall, it was more miss than hit.<br/><br/>As for the actual movie, there was nothing that jumped out from the screen that made me say, ""wow."" For those who haven't read the books, I feel most will just say, ""It isn't Lord of the Rings."" Personal opinion here: this movie won't have the same cross-over appeal that LotR had. <br/><br/>A few bright spots: The acting was extremely good. Even Michael Madsen did good voice work considering his inability to truly act outside of a Quentin T. film. The child actors were extremely well played and showed great range considering their ages.<br/><br/>Lastly, The film does great in establishing the world of Narnia and like any other first film in a series, does a great job introducing everything for those who didn't follow the books, but I just can't recommend it. <br/><br/>If I had paid for it, I would of felt disappointed.

"Carfreak1986","4","1","30","7 December 2005"," Advice to Narnia crew: Cast Rachel McAdams as the White Witch next time!
","I. My take on the 2005 film: I remember watching the 1988 version of this movie in class (I was in the 8th grade, spring of '00), and our teacher had us watch this. However, the villain was getting a little too cocky in the day (that would be Barbara Kellerman). Now flash forward 17 years later. The latest incarnation of Narnia doesn't stand up to its roots. The Narnia series are good books and can stop right there with Harry Potter (sorry, J.K.), but this movie was a LOT worse than what I remembered when I was 14. It tickles my funny bone when the White Witch gets defeated and screams somewhat like Glenn Close and Veronica Taylor (after falling into a pit), but I've never heard of Tilda Swinton before, which brings us to... <br/><br/>II. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch: ...this. Back in the days when people like Gary Oldman and Glenn Close played villains, they were nominated by various resources for best villain. But does Tilda challenge Gary and Glenn? Not quite--by an inch! From what I've seen in the trailers, she sounds somewhat like Pam Ferris from ""Matilda"" (1996) and Glenn Close of ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987). This isn't to say that Tilda is a bad actress and should NOT be playing villainous roles. Rachel McAdams could've did this better--just look at her in ""Mean Girls"" (2004), and you'll see what I mean by her going into Regina George mode prior to playing the White Witch. I'll settle for Tilda in this installment of the classic story, but in the next few years, someone more experienced like, say, for example, Rachel McAdams, should play the villainous role had the director decided to build a sequel to this film. Rachel McAdams is a sure-fire way to attract audiences, and Disney could've done THAT instead of hire the other actress that's 20-plus years older than her.<br/><br/>III. Closing Remarks The 2005 version of this film is not for the faint of heart. That doesn't mean that you should skip this movie. Sure, this movie has its flaws, disappointments, and whatnot, but a few actor changes (like I said earlier with Rachel McAdams as the White Witch) would make this a lot better, even Bam Margera (sorry--I couldn't resist) putting this on his favorite movies list. Until then, I expected better out of this film, and we only got 25% of it. Where's the other 75% already?"

Do the weird Calvinists that have usurped the title even consider an Irish-Catholic like me ""Christian"" these days? Inquiring minds want to know...so does the Weekly World News.<br/><br/>So anyways I'm a ""Christian"" and forget about it, really not going anywhere else with that...but it seems you have to mention what church you were raised in...if any...to review this.<br/><br/>That being said...watch the cartoon.<br/><br/>Like the books, the cartoon I loved when I was little. And, unlike the book, the cartoon has aged well into my adult years. It sort of has the Secret of Nimh quality.<br/><br/>The movie lacks it and one reviewer pointed out a lack of rhythm. I couldn't really put my finger on the distaste I held for the movie until I read those words ""lack of rhythm."" The cast does a decent enough job. Anna Popplewell and Skandar Keynes are certainly highlights and you can't really find one performance that is vile.<br/><br/>And I've never cared that much about the special effects. I mean, I was a little kid in the 80s, utterly nasty special effects are fine with me until it gets to look too computer. I'd rather see the strings.<br/><br/>So the whole acting and effects things, they aren't bad.<br/><br/>But the rhythm, the pacing, it's just horrible. It feels rushed and prolonged and there is really no fluidity to it. There is no clear Act I, II, and III.<br/><br/>It's not a roller coaster with ups and downs...instead it's just a stream of consciousness, trying to tell a familiar story with really no idea of how to tell a story for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>It makes it a horrible thing to watch.<br/><br/>It's a good film, but one that was put together by the boss you always get stuck with, that thinks he's funny, but really doesn't know how to tell a joke. Watching the movie feels like you are working with him for a week and have no co-worker to use as a buffer zone when he goes ""on a roll"""

"mjbset","4","0","1","16 August 2015"," Terrible just Terrible
","This is another movie that make the 10 point rating scale insufficient in my estimation. It was a good effort but it ended with bad results. The acting was poor. The story was rushed with characters like Santa Clause forced in for no reason. There are movies that I have rated as a 4 that are more enjoyable that this one. And there are other movies that I rated a 4 that clearly did not have the level of effort involved as this one. But at the end of the day this movie gives most children over the age of 8 with average intelligence the feeling that they have wasted their time. Luckily in 2015 most likely they are relieving their boredom by changing the channel. That being said it is not worthy to be purchased on DVD for more than 3 dollars."

","It's hard to fairly judge a book adaptation without having read the book so I am being as straightforward as I can by saying that I haven't read the book. My evaluation is thus entirely about the movie for the movie that it is, rather than for the movie as the adaptation that it was.<br/><br/>Clearly, this is no Lord of the Rings. I found that Narnia was a good effort overall to produce a family movie that would 'wow' kids and that parents could still enjoy despite its naive and purposely immature story, thanks in large part to the ice queen who has a strong enough presence to make the story interesting most of the way.<br/><br/>Special effects are very well done and colourful, and are adequate for the purpose.<br/><br/>The young actors did not impress me very much but I guess they fit the purpose of a family movie.<br/><br/>Back to the story, one thing that bothered me is how quick the early elements go by with no explanation whatever. You never get to know who that professor is or where the wardrobe comes from; you just need to accept that walking in that wardrobe leads to Narnia. Before you give up trying to figure those things out, half the movie has gone by and it's hard to get carried away.<br/><br/>Overall, we are obviously not dealing with a memorable movie here but still, if you have kids or a girlfriend who likes very light stuff, this could be a very good option as a way to spend family time."
"Smoky","6","0","1","21 May 2015"," Why did they cast Swinton?
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe could have been a nice little (almost) family movie. The story is not brilliant but OK, there are some likable kids as heroes - although they don't do that much heroic stuff - and there is a lot of magic and special effects for eye-candy. Without thinking too much about it you could just cheer for the kids and enjoy a happy end.<br/><br/>But then there is Tilda Swinton as the white whitch. Although she is stuck in some ridiculous wardrobe and with some borderline ridiculous dialogue, it takes about ten seconds of her mesmerizing performance to make you realize how mediocre all the rest is. When she is on screen everyone else pales in comparison and I found it near impossible to root for the heroes. In some scenes she also projects a villainy that for my taste was well beyond a PG rating. All together her presence was kind of a reality check which is not very becoming for a relatively flat fantasy story."

","Every year during the holiday season at the end of December, I search for a christmassy movie to watch. This has more to do with a cosy and magical atmosphere than actual Christmas spirit, which I couldn't care less about. Mostly I choose for something I've watched before; a Chaplin film, the original Tolkien trilogy or the Harry Potter series for example. This year I made the mistake to watch the three Narnia adaptations. What a mess! Just like Tolkien before him, C.S. Lewis was inspired by Christianity, but unlike Tolkien the Christian symbolism in Lewis' novels is not subtle, nor used as a mere background for the struggle between good and evil. The Narnia novels and movies are pure Christian propaganda. This makes them reprehensible because of that very fact, but as works of art or entertainment they aren't much better. You may forgive the awful childish acting in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe because it can be seen as endearing. You may understand the absence of blood in the action sequences because it is a necessity for an ""all ages"" rating. But as a director you can anticipate on those things. And not, like in this movie, give unbelievable lines to those young actors and make them go around slashing and stabbing without any drop of blood to be seen. Result: zero credibility. The first in the Narnia series doesn't even begin to compare to wonderful fantasy films like Stardust, Bridge to Terabithia, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings or even The Golden Compass (which was according to some, probably righteously, an atrocity compared to the book - but as a movie it stands head and shoulders above this Narnia crap). Given the epic imagery, soundtrack and dialogue it nevertheless aspires to be exactly like them. Unfortunately, the only thing epic about this movie is its fail."
"thomassbcampbell","1","0","3","23 November 2014"," Horrible Directing
","I hate to give this a review of 1 since the cast is good, the adapted screenplay fine, special effects OK though the animals are pretty fake, but Andrew Adamson is a terrible director. He completely ruined what should have been an excellent movie. For example in the space of one minute he cuts away to 45 scenes. I'm sorry but I cannot watch a movie one second at a time. Also due to the violence I would not recommend this for children. Have them read the books. They are delightful and the imagination far better than this junk. I believe there should be no director intrusion in movies, shooting fancy unnecessary stuff so that he can appear to look good. The best director is one you don't notice at all. I hope Mr. Adamson finds a more suitable career such as flipping burgers at McDonalds."

The big complaint I have is the annoying, dumb, bickering, whiny, and unlikeable kids especially Edmund. It makes it hard to root for them. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) looks like he's always on the verge of an evil plan. Lucy (Georgie Henley) is a yappy little thing. And the two older ones (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell) can't stop bickering.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton overplays the evil White Witch early on. She is so evil that it becomes unreasonable that Edmund couldn't see. It is idiotic. She would be better off playing nicer at the start. The good part is the world of Narnia. It does the job. It has the feel of a slightly magical otherly world that is still reminiscent of the real world. The CGI looks good. With all the different creatures, they look realistic enough."

","Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task, but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently, Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Unfortunately, Adamson's ""Narnia"" wasn't quite up to snuff.<br/><br/>I count myself among those who cherish ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" having read them as a child and having re-read ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion, this film adaptation not only falls short, but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.<br/><br/>Here are the general categories (including some specific examples) where I felt the film didn't deliver: Screen Adaptation - Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or cliché. Example: The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. (It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund - we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice!) Also, in the book, the mere mention of the name ""Aslan"" for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost, as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a ""fantasy"" movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch: in the book, the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. (They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.)"

","I was just rereading all my Narnia books, starting from ""The Silver Chair"", ""The Magician's Nephew"", ""The Horse and His Boy"", and finally ""the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"". This movie, which I had watched long ago, suddenly make me feel captivated again. The extra scenes do little to distract you from the story, such as war scenes. The actors are also well cast. Some details are observed: like the dead insect in the Wardrobe room. The faun's music is also sad and wonderful all at once. The special effects were rather cool. The music was also excellent. The fox was a weird but welcome addition. However, some parts are honestly weird. Lucy (the Valiant) is hardly the sort of girl to scream when she spotted the faun. Also, the faun's room is not very cozy but scary. When the dwarf attacked Edmund, it is also exaggerated. The argument between Susan and Peter was also abrupt and unreasonable. Also, why were there other frozen beavers? Their escape was supposed to be happy and relaxed, not frightened. Why is Tumnus alive and well to talk with Edmund? And the order of the gifts are wrong, it should be beavers first then Peter then Susan then Lucy. The Beavers got nothing, and the children got no feast ): The part where the wolves took Beaver hostage and caused Peter to act cowardly is retarded, Peter IS a hero, that's why he's High King, and not just because he's oldest. Stop dumbing the kids down! Edmund's journey was also unseen, and that's sad because that is where Edmund is redeemed. All in all, it started out well but ended like crap so we're left with a pretty horrible view of it."

","What impressed me the most about the film were the technical wizardry and colorful palette that went into the creation of the battle scene. For me, it was like a Frank Frazetta painting come to life - the White Queen in her chariot pulled by an improbable pair of white polar bears, joined in battle by an array of real and mythical creatures, among them a warrior Minotaur and creatures fashioned from the imagination. The clash of the real and the surreal combines in a magical way to lend an epic scope to the movie, elevating the quest of four siblings to fulfill an ancient prophecy beyond the Wardrobe.<br/><br/>Depending on where you begin your movie viewing experience, Chronicles may strike you as entirely original or oddly derivative of other works and other authors. No matter. Once the Pevensie children break through to another realm, we're transported along with them and share equally in their heartbreak and triumph. Not having read the original source books, I don't have that comparison to make, however in this case, it seems that the film will point me back to C.S. Lewis, every bit the imaginative writer as Tolkien.<br/><br/>Excellent performances here from an unknown cast of young actors who comprise the Pevensie family. I believe this was also my first look at Tilda Swinton when the picture first came out five years ago. Based on my reaction to this first picture in the Chronicles series, I look forward to subsequent installments of the franchise."

Even when this film is not as good as ""The Passion of The Christ"", it is still a pretty good film, with many Christian values, and that's why it deserves appreciation and recognition.

They attempted a very photo-realistic interpretation of the fantasy which I found harder to accept when it fell short (every time there is a transition between CGI and live film) than I would a more imaginative interpretation which would have more encouraging of suspension of disbelief (like the BBC version or other films set in imaginative fantasy lands such as Labyrinth.)"

","The series of Narnja works well for children and invites also adults to enjoy these stories of new heroes about love and peace.

The soundtrack is superb and the performance of the four children is very respectable. The story offers many elements to be a must see such as suspense, wonderful pictures, emotions and unforgettable magic moments but also some funny scenes.

","I haven't read the book, so I'm just gonna judge the movie.<br/><br/>This one to me is like a bag of wasted opportunity. It starts out nicely, more fairytale than fantasy. The first hour is everything that Harry Potter could never be.<br/><br/>And then someone stepped in and put the Lord of the Rings in Lewis' head. So all the magical atmosphere is tossed aside and this film just rushes through the motions.<br/><br/>With a lack of visual feedback hinting otherwise, I have to assume that all of this grand epic story takes places over the course of two days. Two days in which the four brats are declared long prophesied saviors, have their fair share of uncertainty and doubt, step up to challenge, meet new ""people"" who become family after 10 minutes and then lead their army into battle.<br/><br/>Because after all, this is no fairytale, this is quickly becoming a bad LOTR wannabe. The battle is ridiculous, but who cares.<br/><br/>And it feels totally weird throughout. These are four middle-class kids, who become noble generals. There is one scene that shows them train with weapons, but there is no conveying the sense that they are actually getting prepared. There's no explanation as to why the army would follow them, there is this prophecy thing but it never really transpires.<br/><br/>I was seriously considering giving it a 9, and then it slips badly to become everything the Lord of the Ring never wanted to be. Giving it a 5 is mighty flattering of me. But so am I, a grand ol' flatterer."

","What I have a problem with is this heavy-handed proselytizing, thinly- veiled as crossover entertainment with wide appeal and fun for the whole family, regardless of their beliefs. It is dishonest trickery of the highest degree, worthy of the White Witch herself, who lures one of the children into her castle with promises of attaining King-hood and all the sweets he could eat and instead holds him captive chained to a wall in an attempt to lure the rest of the children into her castle and to their death.<br/><br/>Plenty of other films and literature (especially prevalent in the fantasy/sci-fi genre) are influenced by the bible (new and old testaments) including (but in no way limited to): Superman, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Blade Runner, The Terminator, The Matrix and the entire Star Wars series.<br/><br/>Of course, if you acknowledge the work of Carl Jung or Joseph Campbell and the nature of collective consciousness symbolism, mythology and archetypes, then you also can easily recognize any of these stories, including the bible itself, as following this mythological archetype symbolism quite specifically and directly. And much to the credit of the above mentioned films and their filmmakers, even if their underlying intent was to have the audience consider the teachings and/or stories of Jesus and/or the bible, they were smart enough to see that people could make those connections or draw those conclusions on their own without having to pander, overtly preach and advertise their co-opting of holy scripture. They understood that the influences upon which they drew for creative inspiration were thematically universal enough to appeal to anyone, anywhere, anytime. <br/><br/>The Chronicles of Narnia, however - at least in this film version of it - the new testament context is so in your face, that it is preachy, exclusive and offensive to a non-believer such as myself.<br/><br/>This film was made to get out the word of Christ - To further brain-wash children into believing that unless they 'follow the fold', they will live out eternity in a never-ending winter without the joy of receiving presents once a year. Lest not forget to reinforce the images that those who do not follow the 'King of Kings' are both a) against him; and b) dark-skinned, hook-nosed, evil creatures of the underworld."

","In truth, I've never been a big fan of such fantasies, although I knew the general plot outline for the Narnia series. I've seen all three LOTR films, including the 1970s cartoon version (which was superior to the live action version), read only The Hobbit in high school, have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but thought the first three films in that series were superior to the vastly overrated LOTR trilogy in almost every way. As for Oz, I've, of course, seen the 1939 Judy Garland film classic, but only read the first two books of the several dozen in the L. Frank Baum series. I do, recall, however, an early 1970s cartoon film of one of the later Oz books that had Liza Minelli voice Dorothy. Yet, none of these film versions, at least, equal the current film version of the first of the Narnia books: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. In fact, if the book is anywhere near as good as the film then even Lewis Carroll's mighty Alice books and Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio might have to move over as the reigning titans of children's fantasy literature. Yes, I know many J.R.R. Tolkien fans will object to the LOTR series being classified a children's fantasy, but too bad. Narnia is superior in virtually every way to LOTR, and Lewis wore the children's tag with pride. This is the result of a good screenplay, which is very hard to do for kids, for most children's films lack that child-like wonder, as if the filmmakers have forgotten what childhood was like. Cinematographer Donald McAlpine captures that point of view in many of the child's eye shots of vistas and the whimsy on the children's faces. The only downside to the film is that, like many fantasies, you have to suspend logic. For example, why does Aslan need to wait a hundred years to bring an end to the White Witch's eternal winter? He clearly has the power to do so at any time, but 'The Prophecy' has foretold that it can only occur when the four children arrive. But, this is part of the suspension of disbelief that all such tales require. The score works well, and never intrudes on the film, as it too often does in the LOTR trilogy, and the film's credits end with a terrific song by Alanis Morissette. <br/><br/>I hope that this film does well enough that the remaining six books hit the screen, for with the amount of dreck being foisted at kids, these films will prove a nice respite. If only the Alice and Oz books are next on the film franchise conveyor belt, rather than Shrek 13 or Ice Age: Revenge Of The Neandertals. Click the heels of your ruby slippers along with me.

"JTurner82","9","0","2","27 April 2008"," Disney and Walden Media do C.S. Lewis right.
","The genre of fantasy has long been ignored for quite a long time in cinema (especially after a period of hit-and-miss entries in the 1980's), but now it has been heavily revitalized, thanks to the runaway success of both Peter Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER movies. Based on this, it is probably no surprise that another beloved fantasy literature series would get the big screen treatment. And what better choice than C.S. Lewis' enchanting CHRONICLES OF NARNIA? In a surprising collaboration between Disney and Walden Media, the first book in the series, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, hit the theaters in 2005, and went onto become both a critical and popular success. The film may not be a replica of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but that is hardly its purpose. All it has to do is bring this beloved tale to the screen with a touch of magic and heart, and thanks to the craft of highly advanced special effects and fine performances, it manages to do just that.<br/><br/>The story begins in World War II London, where four Pevensie children--Lucy (Georgie Henley), Susan (Anne Popplewell), Peter (William Moseley), and Edmond (Skandar Keynes)--are forced to live in the mansion of an enigmatic professor. During a hide-and-seek game, the children discover a wardrobe which turns out to be a portal to a mysterious magical world called Narnia, a land inhabited by talking beasts and mythical creatures. Unfortunately, this kingdom is under the rule of the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton), who has cursed the entire land to an eternal winter. Only the great lion king, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), and the children can put an end to her evil reign.<br/><br/>The story has been told several times before Disney's rendition. There was an animated feature produced by Bill Melendrez which aired back in the 1970s, and a three-hour long television adaptation courtesy of BBC. Both of these adaptations showed their age in production values, yet remained fairly faithful to the source material. For those of you who fear that Disney's acquisition of NARNIA means a ""Disneyfication"" of a classic story, DON'T. As with Jackson in LORD OF THE RINGS, director Andrew Adamsom shows tremendous respect for the source material, and does a first class job of transitioning it to the big screen without sacrificing its magic or substance. If you're expecting a totally literal adaptation, though, chances are you might be disappointed, because there are a few scenes from the book which are obviously shortened and/or altered, as well as some which were added in. However, none of these ""changes"" compromise the story in any way; the magic of Lewis' world is imperishable, and overall this adaptation is commendably faithful while adding to it in the same way that Jackson's LOTR did.<br/><br/>There are a few places where the visual effects, as produced by LOTR's Weta Digital in New Zealand, lack polish, but are otherwise breathtaking, particularly the talking animals (including a pair of gently funny beavers) and especially the climactic showdown. What ultimately makes this NARNIA are the sincere, believable performances courtesy of the excellent cast. Young Georgie Henley as Lucy, in particular, sparkles the screen with a radiant innocence and cuteness without being saccharine. Her siblings acquit themselves fairly well, too, although William Moseley's Peter is a bit on the wooden side. Liam Neeson has the perfect voice for Aslan, while Tilda Swinton oozes both evil and charisma as the White Witch.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the ages-old book vs. movie debate will last for eternity (in addition to comparisons to previous filmed versions), but this brand-new NARNIA is still most welcome. It doesn't have the depth or complexity of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it does have a special charm and childlike wonder which makes it a treat in its own right. It will be interesting to see how subsequent adaptations of the remaining books in the series will turn out."

","The movie the Chronicles of Narnia is a movie that has four children, two boys and two girls, with the names of Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter. The four children are living with their mother in England which is under attack so they move in with a distant uncle to stay until the war is over. The children are wandering the house, exploring when they accidentally throw a baseball through a window. The four go to hide and that is when Lucy finds the wardrobe. She ends up finding the other world on the other side of the wardrobe and meanders in, finding Mr.Tumnus, and this is where the children's adventures in Narnia begin. I think that the newest ""Lion the Witch and The Wardrobe based movie, the Chronicles of Narnia,"" was an excellent movie. I think this is true because of the good story line and graphics. I think that following along with the book is key, because the writers went through all his or her own time writing it. If you intend on making a movie about it, it should follow the book for the simple reason that you should respect the author. The second key thing that makes a good action movie even better is when it has good graphics. In the Chronicles of Narnia, there are many action scenes, which most know have characters that are not real and do things that cannot be done. But the good graphics allow your mind to explore and imagine without restrictions. I would recommend this movie to kids and adults of all ages, because even though the content isn't harsh enough to restrict a child from watching, there is a lot in the movie that a well-educated adult can understand and relate to. I highly enjoyed this movie and hope all of you that have seen it enjoyed it also."

","'Chronicles of Narnia' is one of the finest movies that I have seen in the past five years.<br/><br/>Yes, it's that good.<br/><br/>From directing, to story, to excellent acting and special effects, 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' captures the magic in C.S. Lewis' treasured novel that sparked a seven-book series. Tilda Swinton plays a pretty good witch, at seven feet tall symbolically towering over the other people and creatures of the land, and subtly portrays an arrogance for any creature below the White Witch with evil precision. Meanwhile, three of the actors playing the children do a good job, with the exception of the actor who plays Edmund. The actor who plays Mr. Tumnus does wonderful work. The movie expands the final battle from the book, which is welcome. A toned-down-from-FX battle between the White Witch and Peter is very well-choreographed. In addition, Liam Neeson was a great choice to voice the Narnia savior Aslan. <br/><br/>If other 'Narnia' films can be made like this one, then they are welcome as a fabulous interpretation of the C.S. Lewis series."

","'the lion,the witch and the wardrobe' was the first book that was read out to me in school.i was about 7 at the time and it transported me to a magical place and gave me a love of reading that has remained with me ever since(if you are reading this miss pilling please accept my heartfelt thanks).so when Disney decided to make this into a film i felt i had to see it.<br/><br/>so i gathered up my 10 nieces and nephews,aged from 7 to 14, and made it their Xmas treat.parents had the night off as we included pizza beforehand.it cost a small fortune but it was worth every penny as they were transported to the new land of narnia.everyone of them loved something about the film.my 7 year old niece loved Mr tumnus and my 11 year old nephew,who i'm sure will become a horror addict,really liked the witch and her evil stare.my 13 year old niece couldn't get over the illogicality of a lamppost in the middle of the woods.i wouldn't explain just telling her to wait for 'the magician's nephew'.<br/><br/>me,i loved it.i enjoyed the expanded battle scene,which in the book was very short,but here was well imagined.the acting i thought generally was very good,but Tilda swinton as the witch was perfect.<br/><br/>why 9 and not 10? well i thought a few of the voices did not sit too well on the animations.ray winstone and dawn french as Mr and Mrs beaver sounded odd and i couldn't like Liam neeson as aslan.also the dwarf ginarrbrik i struggled to understand a few times.a bit picky i know but hey its my review.<br/><br/>overall a great family film that does justice to a great book.recommended."
"InvisableMirages","6","0","2","15 October 2007"," They tried too hard..
","This movie is good, no doubt. But I think they all tried too hard to top Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other major movies that they just sort of bummed out.<br/><br/>The special and visual effects were tried to their limits. You can tell too easily that it's all computerized.<br/><br/>The acting could use some work. But for being young and having main parts, the kids did good.<br/><br/>The plot was well-done. Close to the book, that's my main thing. I love the books by C.S. Lewis and I was hoping to movies would be just as good. But this one feel short of my expectations.

"Ivan_Bradley","8","0","1","24 August 2007"," Beautifil visuals, charismatic acting, mawkish propaganda
","OK the CGI and visual continuity was flawed, but not enough to detract while in the suspension of disbelief mode necessary to enjoy storytelling.<br/><br/>Watching a book, reading a film, tasting a song.. all are enjoyed from a different critical perspective than that of dealing with everyday life. If you can't switch off your pragmatic uberself, you can't be entertained by fantasy because you'll be too busy looking for the cracks in the pavement to find anywhere to walk. SO - watching with my sceptical criticism chip bypassed - this is a hugely enjoyable film. The White Witch is one of THE most marvellous creations in the history of cinema. Gorgeous fantasy. Even the cutesy goat-boy living in the closet was superbly portrayed.<br/><br/>I perversely enjoyed the terribly, terribly stiff upper lip Britishness of the kids and the shiny-armoured pre-raphaelite England. Victorian fairy tales and heroic bronze statues evoking a golden age better-times period that never actually existed but which inhabits a world of alternative nostalgia that we all find ourselves wanting to believe in but which is no more real than the world behind any wardrobe.<br/><br/>Why perversely? The real downfall of the film is not in the continuity, the special effects, casting, acting or (ahem) wardrobe but is something so fundamental that while it IS all the pre-raphaelite imagery and ideology that stirs the emotions so positively, it also is that very pre-raphaelite imagery and ideology that blinds us. Ideology is elevated to undeserved importance. Ideology becomes everything. The criticism harks right back to the original book. The flip-side of the whole Elgar and William Blake Englishmess that I confess to enjoying in my suspended-disbelief world of an entertained film-watcher is a terrible mawkishness that betrays the pleasantry of fantasy in the real world outside of the entertainment medium.<br/><br/>The overwhelming Christian agenda which the film manages to amplify and throw into very sharp relief is utterly cloying. so much so that my 10yr old daughter pointed it out, unbidden and unprompted. It dominates and manipulates and is so-in-yer-face as to be embarrassing in its audacity.<br/><br/>The central problem to Lewis's type of Christian world-view is that it glorifies the nobility of sacrifice as the ultimate spiritual achievement while missing something extremely important. A self sacrifice, undergone in the absolute knowledge of resurrection is not a sacrifice at all. A real sacrifice is one where the outcome is hopeless and unknown. There is no bravery in a suicide-bomber's death or a crusader's riding into certain death if he KNOWS he will obtain eternal life as a consequence of passing through that particular, painful door. <br/><br/>The film, meanwhile, hard-sells us redemption and cosy - in fact smug - Christianity disguised as a fairy tale with a thin veneer of talking animals and sparkliness. The big lion knows he has a trump card up his sleeve so he can afford to string everyone along and get them all upset and bereaved right up to the point of rolling away the metaphorical stone, and this is spiritual dishonesty. This kind of emotional manipulation ( I'm talking about the character as written, not the cinematic direction) is seen as commendable by the writer, and yet it is morally bankrupt. It is the kind of brainwashing that prepares us to know our place and go to war to fight for the ideals of our ""betters.""<br/><br/>There is a lot of talk about destiny, and accepting it without question as a pont of faith. Whenever Christians run up against something which makes absolutely no sense, it is explained away as a ""mystery"" which meed not be looked at too closely by anyone who has enough faith. Having faith is the ultimate virtue. You do not need proof of anything, you need no evidence other than hearsay. Someone else says they had proof, told someone else who told someone else and eventually someone else wrote about it and that is proof enough for YOU. You are then told that you have to accept this apocryphal proof with none of your own and eventually you are conditioned to see your emotional reaction as all the proof you need. yes, this is faith. If the subject matter is different, it is superstition. Same thing.<br/><br/>Faith, of course, is the root of all human misery. This is not how lewis's generation tended to see things.<br/><br/>The protagonists, being of good Christian stock as all middle class British school children of their period would have been, have been schooled to believe in things which cannot be scrutinized on the say-so of someone else's claim to a better understanding than ours, and the story reeks of it. Lewis is careful to keep the ""real"" religious truth out of the story and relies on the allegorical setting to punch the associated values home. Just dial in new names at your convenience.<br/><br/>Duty. Destiny. Faith. Heroism. Sacrifice. Redemption. By Jingo, this sis the stuff that makes our Empire what it is today!<br/><br/>The theme is hammered home so unsubtly that, as I said, my 10yr old daughter was beginning to cringe after about the fifth or tenth biblical allusion. We did, however, really enjoy watching the film together and will certainly watch it again and recommend it to others to watch, albeit with the slight caveat about the heavy-handed theme."

"mOVIemAN56","7","0","2","18 July 2007"," It really has grown on me
","In the past 5 or so years numerous novel adaptations and family films have come out. Two of the most popular book series ever written, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, have been brought to the screen and gained considerable amount of praise. I, myself, liked both series of films but doubted that three in a row could be pulled off, especially how close all were coming out. Henceforth, I waited a long time to finally watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and when I first saw it, I was a tad bit disappointed but since then the film has grown considerably on me.<br/><br/>The story follows that of four British children during the Battle of Britain. Their mother, seeing it to be too dangerous to remain in London, ships them off to the countryside to spend time with a crazy uncle in a large but boring mansion. There the children try everything they can in order to pass the time. One day, the youngest, Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and falls into a magical land known as Narnia. Soon all of the children enter into the world and are brought into a battle with Aslan, a mighty lion, against the evil Jadis the White Witch for safety of Narnia.<br/><br/>After I first watched it I found the four children to be rather wooden. They seemed bored and not familiar at all with the books. They seemed just too boring to be enjoyable or at least main characters for the movie. After my third viewing my mind changed. I realized something, I'm not familiar with British children personality and even less familiar with their acting skills. Once I realized this I realized they weren't at all wooden and boring, they simply weren't what I was used to from child actors. I realized how strong of performances they actually gave, especially William Moseley who I now believed portrayed an amazing Peter.<br/><br/>The special effects for the film are tremendous. The visual effects department really out did themselves with this film. They generated amazing animals and creatures for the film that looked entirely authentic and believable. What also made the film is that not everything is computer generated. Most of the characters were in makeup and wore costumes, not lame CGI characters fighting. General Otmin had one of the most incredible looking costumes I've ever seen. I was highly impressed by the art department and effects department with the film.<br/><br/>The film is not without flaws. I found some parts to be rather dry and boring especially the early parts of entering Narnia. Don't get me wrong, the set was amazing and visually stunning, the dialog was just a bit bland. Skandar Keynes really did not give a good performance. The kid tried his best but it just didn't feel like he was into the movie that much. He had the same dull expression on his face and rarely seemed to be trying. Moseley did the best of the children actors but even his inexperience showed just a little.<br/><br/>Now the film does have several strong points. Tilda Swinton proves yet again she is one of the top British actresses out there and can do a variety of roles, including a pretty scary White Witch. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan (Aslan is CGI) is very good. Neeson shows he has some skill with voice acting. The Battle of Narnia, which is close to the end, is visually stunning and filled with amazing special effects and acting. I love battles in films and this fantasy battle was a rare treat. It was interesting to see animals doing combat (all staged and CGI, no animals were harmed making the film) and seeing the magic C.S. Lewis intended being brought to life with this film.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend the film for the lovers of the book. Some people may think it is a kids film and while there are many cute scenes and cuddly looking animals there are several frightening moments and some pretty intense battle violence for a PG film. There is virtually no language, there's a lot of cuteness to the film but also a valuable lesson to also be learned from it. I won't ruin the message though, you've got to watch it. Overall a very good film that could have been better but is still good as it is now.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars"

"zardoz-13","8","0","2","16 June 2007"," Family Friendly Fantasy Film
","The new family-friendly fantasy movie ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (*** out of ****) qualifies as ideal fare for children that combines dazzling state-of-the-art computer-generated visual effects with 'live' human characters in an imaginative, action-packed fable teeming with talking animals and an evil witch. Irish-born author C. S. Lewis penned this children's classic back in 1950 about a quartet of kids who entered a fanciful land of adventure through the portal of a wardrobe in an empty room. Basically, a wardrobe is a piece of free-standing furniturelike today's closetsthat serves as a storage facility, here a place to hang winter overcoats. Imagine stepping into a closet and finding a whimsical world on the other side where woodland critters as well as fairy tale creatures can speak and where a villainous witch battles for supremacy for an enchanted kingdom, and you'll have a fair idea what to expect from ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" <br/><br/>Earlier, in 1988, the British Broadcasting Company produced a TV mini-series version of ""Chronicles."" The people who made that 169-minute adaptation didn't deviate a notch from the printed page. Nevertheless, that largely faithful rendition suffered from shoddy special effects that amounted to the equivalent of a children's stage play with humans traipsing about in over-sized, idiotic animal costumes, supplemented with some cartoon-like animation that proved far from seamless. C.S. Lewis readers who demand literal interpretations of the acclaimed author's work would find this version, currently available on DVD courtesy of the BBC and Home Vision Entertainment, more to their liking. Although ""Shriek"" director Andrew Adamson and scenarists Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely have taken some liberties with their big-screen adaptation, their film version ""Chronicles"" sticks to the same essential storyline. Chiefly, Adamson and company have streamlined the novel's events and ramped up the drama without diverging from the source material. Indeed, in all but one episode of the movie, the filmmakers have actually improved Lewis' narrative and made it more palatable.<br/><br/>""Chronicles"" unfolds against the devastating aerial attacks launched by the German Air Forcethe Luftwaffeover London during World War II. Consequently, the Pevensie childrenPeter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucyare evacuated to the scenic splendor and serenity of the English countryside where they live with elderly Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent of the ""Bridget Jones"" movies) in his huge house with hundreds of rooms and passageways, presided over by a grumpy old housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne of ""The Frighteners"") who displays little patience for mischievous brats.<br/><br/>In one of the major changes from the novel, our heroes accidentally break one of Professor Kirke's stained-glass windows while playing a game of cricket and hide from the nosy Mrs. MacReady. In the book, they hide from her, because she warned them not to interfere with the tours that she gave of the house to spectators. Anyway, they conceal themselves in a magical wardrobe. Earlier, the youngest PevensieLucyhad discovered that the wardrobe opened onto a fabulous faraway land where she had tea and cookies with a faun in his mountain hideaway. Initially, Lucy's brothers and older sister dismissed her story as poppycock. Later, Edmundthe most treacherous of the quartetdiscovered that Lucy had not been lying. He found his way into the snow-swept land, only to encounter the wicked White Witch (Tilda Swinton of ""The Beach"") who promised him a kingdom and a crown if would deliver the other three into her custody. We learn later on that the evil Witch fears this quartet because they are fated to rule over the land after her demise. It seems that the dastardly Witch has imprisoned the friendly faun that Lucy initially met, so Lucy and her kin resolve to rescue him. Eventually, Edmund defects and reports back to the Witch. Predictably, the Witch refuses to abide by her bargain with Edmund and dispatches a pack of ravenous wolves to capture the other Pevensies. A family of beavers befriends the Pevensies and helps them elude the wolves by means of an escape tunnel under their beaver house. This escape tunnelbuilt conveniently to accommodate our hulking heroes (what beaver would construct a tunnel with humans in mind?) and a subsequent escapade on a rapidly flowing roller-coaster of a riverconstitute the other major departures from the Lewis saga. Eventually, our heroes join the forces of virtue, an army of animals and mythical creatures, such as centaurshalf man/half horselead by a majestic talking lion named Aslan. Incidentally, translated from Turkish language, Aslan stands for 'lion.' Aslan emerges as the White Witch's mortal adversary.<br/><br/>Unlike the low-budget BBC-TV version, director Andrew Adamson's 140-minute ""Chronicles"" benefits from superb computer generated visual effects. The lion appears as realistic as if it were actual flesh and blood. Actor Liam Neeson of ""Batman Begins"" provides a voice every bit as majestic as his visual counterpart. Although this yarn concludes with an epic battle between the Witch's legion and Peter's army, you won't spot a speck of blood and gore. Nothing in the PG-rated ""Chronicles"" should induce anxiety in the minds of the film's target audience: children age twelve and under. While ""Chronicles"" secretes a Christian message within its storychiefly Aslan's act of self-sacrifice, the movie never clobbers audiences over the head with its ideology. Similarly, C.S. Lewiswho penned his share of Christianity-oriented textsalong with high-brow literary tomes and science fiction outingsrefused to let his Biblical message overshadow the fantasy elements. Meaning, if you aren't looking of any religious propaganda in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" you'll never know it but still enjoy it."
"Nessy_Gliana","10","0","2","7 June 2007"," Best adaptation yet
","I love the Narnia books. They are very dear to my heart. So I was very excited when I learned a movie adaptation was in the works.<br/><br/>At first I had some minor worries, such as Georgie Henley's age, Tilda Swinton's blonde hair (in the books, the witch has black hair), the changes to the story, etc. Despite all of that I came out of this movie very happy and satisfied that justice was done to my beloved C.S. Lewis.<br/><br/>Georgie was perfect as Lucy. I know some people criticize her acting abilities but you have to keep in mind this was an eight-year-old girl who'd never done any major acting work before in her life. Given that, I thought she did a very nice job. I can say the same for the other actors as well. Tilda Swinton was a chilling and bewitching White Witch. Jim Broadbent, as Professor Digory was a bit whimsical, but nevertheless quite charming. James McAvoy did a great job as Tumnus with that perfectly clipped British accent. I never would have guessed that he was actually Scottish! And Liam Neeson made for a very warm and believable Aslan.<br/><br/>Allow me to digress for a minute and talk about the amazing CGI work on Aslan. That was something that bothered me in the BBC version-Aslan was stiff and static, not the kind of character I could be instantly attached to. Aslan in this version makes me want to shout ""KITTY!"" and run up and hug his fluffy head. (But he probably wouldn't like that... He's not a tame lion after all.) And he shows emotion and cracks jokes just like the human actors. It's obvious the writers tried really hard to make even the CGI characters real and believable. (I especially liked how they made the Beavers sound just like a real married couple!) For that I applaud them.<br/><br/>I want to take some time to address some other user's objections to the movie. First, the idea that the movie is clichéd. Nonsense. Narnia was written back in the 1950s and 60s. The ideas may be cliché now but back then they were fresh and original. (In fact, there was no such thing as a fantasy blockbuster back then.) And if you watch the making-of features you'll see that the creators tried very hard to avoid making their movie look like other fantasy movies. (Hard to do considering they shot several sequences in New Zealand, like LOTR, and even had Weta Workshop doing their props and costumes.) That was the reason they made the White Witch blonde. Second, Peter's inability to use a sword is actually quite realistic. He just got that sword a few hours ago, you don't seriously expect him to know how to use it right off the bat do you? And third, the idea that this is just a propaganda film to promote Christianity to children. Sure it is. Because everyone knows Lewis sat down at his desk and thought ""Hmm, how can I tell the story of the Gospel in an appealing way to young children?"" Not at all. It's a fantasy story first and a morality tale second.<br/><br/>Despite the story changes, this was still the best and most faithful film adaptation of the book I have seen. It was better and more exciting than I expected, and I applaud the creators for a job-well done.<br/><br/>Kudos to you!"
"liberalgems","10","0","2","2 June 2007"," The Perfect Antidote For A Cynical World!,
","I have to admit, The Chronicles of Narnia is an fascinating story that will stand the test of time! It's a true saga, like the Lord Of The Rings!<br/><br/>What moved me most was how each of the four children & teens grew, as individuals, and as a family unit. It's so easy to be selfish and only think about one's own needs. It's refreshing to see characters not only being concerned with each others well being, but also with the the community-at-large. One, which happens to be so incredibly alien, it takes a lot of courage to care!<br/><br/>In the world of Narnia, these four young people have real power! Their decisions have incredible consequences! One choice is to take risks, the other to retreat into safety and comfort. The adults in the audience, I'm sure, can identify with this tug-of-war. This quandary effects us all at some point in our lives.<br/><br/>Another theme addressed is War. The opening scene shows the bombing of London during World War 2. I knew someone who actually lived through this experience as a child. It left lifelong scars. In the very beginning we see train loads of children being evacuated to family, friends, or even benevolent strangers in the much safer countryside. I said to myself, this is what war is really about: desperation and separation. It brought tears to my eyes. If anyone had experienced what my English friend did, first hand, as a child, they would think twice before starting or supporting war, period! <br/><br/>While a war is fought in Narnia, this one is to prevent the collapse of civilization, at the hands of evil geniuses, just like in Lord Of The Rings or World War 2. Perhaps, if that was the standard the human race could agree on to wage war, then this ancient scourge would, indeed, finally become a thing of the past!<br/><br/>The filmmakers should be congratulated for bringing a fairly complex story to the big screen with dignity and inspiration. I'm sure C.S. Lewis would be proud! <br/><br/>P.S. I saw this magnificent film a second time on the big screen, and I'm glad I did! The feelings of elation and awe are much appreciated! Memo to Hollywood: Start making more movies which are uplifting and your bottom line will uplift, too!"

"math_drama","10","0","2","13 May 2007"," Wow!
","There are many reasons why I love the movie ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" <br/><br/>1. Mythical Creatures: I love stories about mythical creatures. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" has centaurs, fauns, unicorns, and talking beavers, horses, and lions. There were also a few mermaids who didn't have any part in the story, but they were my favorite kind of mythical creature. But, if I had to choose my favorite mythical creature that actually had a part in the movie, I would choose the centaur. I love horses, and it's amazing how there is a mythical creature that is a mix of a horse and a human. <br/><br/>2. Tilda Swinton: Although I have never seen Tilda Swinton in anything else before I watched the movie, I could tell that she has had a lot of experience as an actress since she was so good. Then, when I looked at her resume on IMDb, I saw that she was in so many movies and TV shows that it was hard to count. She has a fabulous performance as the White Witch in ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" <br/><br/>3. William Moseley: William Moseley may not be the best actor ever to live, but he was still good. I thought that he was really cute, and I liked the character he developed. He seemed to be a nice older brother who wasn't too grown up and acted like a dad. I just finished reading ""The Outsiders"" for school, and I didn't like the character of Darry because he seemed too grown up because he had to take care of his two younger brothers since his parents died. But Peter's parents didn't die, so when William Moseley had to act like an older brother, he didn't have to look too grown up. The part that I feel shows that Peter was still like a child was at the beginning of the movie when he was at the train station and he started looking at the soldiers, and Susan had to act like an older person and make him stop day dreaming to hand the woman the paper.<br/><br/>4.Overall story: The overall story was a good idea by C.S. Lewis. I read the book before I saw the movie, and when I found out that they were going to make a new movie for it, I was really worried that the filmmakers might ruin the story, because I saw a different movie of ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" and it seemed really fake and the acting was terrible. Although I was worried that the filmmakers would ruin the story, I was excited, because it looked like a good movie, so I was hoping that the story wouldn't be ruined. I was pleased after I saw the movie, because it was true to the book, and the production was excellent."

","I have been a fan of Narnia ever since I first read the books at the age of six, so needless to say I was quite thrilled when I learned that a movie adaption was in the works.<br/><br/>I went to watch Narnia opening weekend, and was overall quite impressed. The actors were all great, but Lucy and Edmund particularly stood out to me. The special effects were excellent most of the time, but there were a few moments where the effects were not as good as they should have been for a movie with such a large budget.<br/><br/>The movie followed the book fairly closely, but there were a couple scenes that were added for more drama at the expense of some scenes that were in the book. But, I think my biggest complaint would have to be that Narnia in the movie did not feel like the Narnia in the books. It seemed to me that the spirit of the book was lost in the adaption somewhere.<br/><br/>But overall, I'd say it is a great movie, and if you have not seen it, you definitely should."

","""The Chronicles of Narnia  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"": I've been spoiled. I've seen ""Lord of the Rings"", and you, Narnia, aren't a Lord of the Rings.

The special effects are pretty darned good here, and the story is well, VERY reflective of a number of things: 1) World War II in Europe, 2) the biblical story of Jesus, and, yes, 3) Lord of the Rings. C. S. Lewis, who wrote this story, went to school with J. R. Tolkien, who wrote ""Rings"". In fact, they shared ideas, and it shows. Good guys, bad guys (and gals  played by Tilda Swinton), twisted biological creatures who serve as the Righteous or Evil masses, sweeping landscapes, and in THIS case, a huge battle scene without one drop of blood (again, this one IS for kids). My wife and I enjoyed this one very much, and you will too, as long as you allow for it to be less than a fully adult story. Older kids would ADORE this. It gives kids all the power and glory they dream of having."

","A film with that is a special effects palooza, in strange fantasy world, with a core group of height challenged heroes; it is 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' right? Well 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' share more then a title that is so wordy neither cannot fit on any marquee. The film starts out in London during a WWII bombing. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent off to live in the country stately mansion of Professor Kirke. During an exuberant game of hide and seek, Lucy (the youngest) hides in an ornate wardrobe. Lucy discovers the world of Narnia and befriends Mr. Tumnus, a Faun (a man with a goat's anatomy below the waist). Narnia is in a 100 year winter by the designs of the evil White Witch that has crowned herself queen of all Narnia. Lucy ends up bringing back her siblings and they learn of a prophecy that has four humans (two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve) that are to topple the Queen. The Queen must kill the four-some to continue her reign. The Queen mobilizes her army (that looks not-so-surprisingly like the legions of the Orcs from LotR). The last 45 minutes recreates the battle in 'LotR; The Return of the King', but with almost no blood (Narnia is PG, Return of the King was PG-13). Both films find a 'lost and forgotten' army to save the day. The picture's special-effects blend animal bodies and humans torsos on numerous occasions and seamlessly. Additionally there are talking animals all over the two and half hour movie. There are a couple of blue-screen backgrounds that were notably not up to par but all in all a top quality show."

","Slow to start, boring in the middle, painful to end.<br/><br/>Big news everyone! CS Lewis was a friend of Tolkien and this film shows clearly that friendship does not affect writing skills for one, that marketing does not trick everybody in seeing a film or buying merchandise, and that when you want to express your religious opinions too strongly it does not make good fiction books.<br/><br/>The books have the same flaw as the film: story is boring. Have you seen the film? No? Don't and be sure you don't miss much.<br/><br/>Special effects are million dollar apiece, same quality in fact as LOTR, the cast did their best, really, they did, the story was simply too symbolic to be interesting any more, like a joke they explain to you is no longer funny.<br/><br/>CS Lewis expressed his renewed religious feelings in a fervent way and wrote plain uninteresting books, whose symbols are too close to propaganda to be attracting anymore. Adapting them to the cinema could only lead to a result where every moment is lasting too long."
"general-melchett","9","0","1","18 February 2007"," Good, but LOTR is still better...
","Narnia was a very good film in terms of all-round quality. It had the epic feel, the big budget CG and a screenplay that remained loyal to the text, creating the most epic realisation of Narnia that has yet been seen. While the world of Narnia has lots of spirit and is beautifully made, I couldn't help feeling that New Zealand's beautiful landscapes could have been used more. It is evident that a lot of the sets were either CG or studio-created, and while it did look good, it just didn't possess the natural beauty of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth. And the battles weren't quite as epic or intense as in LOTR, though to be honest, this is aimed at younger people than LOTR, although I'm sure everybody has heard of The Chronicles of Narnia and will delight in seeing this epic film that brings it to the screen once again. It has the emotion and the grandeur, but Narnia needs more natural beauty - it could have quite possibly been done in the UK, and let's be honest, NZ has far more in the way of scenery to offer. But aside from that, Narnia was another great adaptation of C.S Lewis's work - and one that definitely had me checking inside my wardrobe back home (you may be surprised to hear that there wasn't a fantasy world in sight...) 9/10"
"TheWildGoose","7","0","1","17 February 2007"," This was a good movie, but it could have been a great one.
","Although I am glad that this movie was made, and I certainly think the result is a more than adequate family film, I can't help but feel disappointed by the result. In making the transition from book to film, it feels like the filmmakers jettisoned what they thought were minor details of C.S. Lewis' original work, and replaced them with typical Hollywood-style action sequences.<br/><br/>While none of this was bad in itself, many of those ""minor details"" were, in fact, central to the themes and ideas of the book. It's not that things were changed that bothers me. Some of the additions made to the story were quite good. What bothers me is that certain things were changed or deleted that shouldn't have been.<br/><br/>For example, the initial encounter between Aslan and the Witch was meant to demonstrate Aslan's absolute superiority over the Witch, and her fear of him. She was terrified of him, mirroring the way that, in C.S. Lewis' world-view, evil is absolutely inferior to good.<br/><br/>The film, however, was interested in making the Witch seem like a ""credible"" villain, and took away much of her fear in that scene. It's a mistake. C.S. Lewis' point- that evil is much weaker than good- gets lost, and very little is gained from the change.<br/><br/>Similarly, in the book, the Beaver specifically states that Aslan is neither tame nor safe. Lewis put this in to mirror his ideas about God. The movie, in the interest of keeping Aslan's status as a Lion as a surprise, drops this element, opting instead for a few seconds of surprise for anybody who, say, didn't read the title of the film (are we really supposed to be surprised that Aslan is a lion when ""The Lion"" is right in the title?).<br/><br/>There are numerous other instances of this. Please don't misunderstand- I'm not some mad purist who can't stand it when the slightest change is made transitioning to the screen. I don't mind changes per se, it's just that C.S. Lewis was a very talented writer exploring some very complex themes, and he didn't include small details randomly or without thought. In a nutshell, I feel that excellent elements have been removed and replaced with merely adequate ones.<br/><br/>This is not to say that this isn't a good movie. It's an excellent family film, and certainly ranks head and shoulders above most the the garbage people take their children to see. It's a rousing adventure story, the visuals are magnificent, and Lewis' works shines through despite the misguided changes. This movie is entertaining to both children and adults.<br/><br/>This is a very good film. That's too bad, though, because it could have been a great one."
"stevemcgarry","3","0","1","9 February 2007"," Disappointing interpretation of a classic
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a classic fantasy book before the current Harry Potter mania and remains one today. I have fond memories of immersing myself in the world of Narnia benevolently looked over by the all powerful lion king Aslan. I had previously seen an animated interpretation of the story which was admirably done and enjoyable so was looking forward to seeing what could be done with the wonders of modern CGI.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was disappointed by the end result. The 4 key child actors were very wooden and seemed more intent on getting their proper British accents right than on making their characters believable. The CGI distracted from the story rather than added to it and looked very tacked on in a number of places, most noticeably the fox.<br/><br/>Compared to other recent interpretations of classic books, LOTR and the Harry Potter series, this movie falls far short and does not do justice to the wonderful source material. I'm not sure if there are plans to develop this into a series but, on this showing, I hope the producers decide to leave the other Narnia classics to live in our imagination rather than drag them kicking-and-screaming to the screen."
"vikingvampireparrot","6","0","1","7 February 2007"," Decent attempt but must try harder
","I came to The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe with some trepidation as I adore the BBC series that was done some years ago and did not think it could easily be topped by simply introducing some CGI. I was right.<br/><br/>However, in it's defence, it was better than I was led to believe it would be by other peoples responses to it. I think that if I had come to it fresh or just from reading the book I would have got on with it a bit better.<br/><br/>One of the main problems I had with the film was the children themselves. Now I always found Peter and Susan vaguely annoying in the book/TV series for being too 'goody-goody' so I wasn't surprised at my dislike for them. But Edmund had always been my favourite character by far and I found him detestable in this. And not simply in the way you are supposed as he is a traitor etc because, as I said, I liked his character in the book. Lucy I found a little too wide-eyed and vacant but she grew on me throughout the film. I think I just found her a little too young for the role, it made it a little unbelievable.<br/><br/>Now to the other characters. Good job with the beavers, they were spot on. Mr Tumnus seems to have been transformed from a likable if initially misguided character into a creepy slightly paedophilic figure which disturbed me somewhat. The wolves I found too 'cute', nowhere near as scary as in the TV series (yes, OK, they were more realistic (especially since some real!) but not terrifying like they should be). Dwarfs, ghouls, fawns etc all OK, didn't stand out as particularly good or bad.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton spot on as the white witch. Could not have thought of anyone better to cast in this role. She always has a menacing, slightly psychotic air which is perfect. Not convinced on Liam Neeson as Aslan, I thought a deeper, more authoritative voice would have been better but I got used to it.<br/><br/>Now I don't know how long the TV series was but this film felt far too condensed  it's a long time since I read the book but I got the feeling there was a lot missing, I just can't quite place what.<br/><br/>I also disliked the battle scenes, they seem to have fallen into the CGI trap of 'lets show what we can do and how impressive it can be' rather than showing specific parts of the battle with key characters in detail. There was a little bit of close-up but nowhere near enough to show the true intensity of a battle.<br/><br/>One thing I did like is that I found that they kept the whole Christian thing quite low key (I know others didn't think this from the posts on the message boards but I did). I never spotted this in the books as a child and when I learnt it as an adult it disappointed me greatly as I am not Christian and do not agree with Christianity. It ruined the books for me to a degree when I thought back over them and I thought they did a good job stopping it from taking over the film.<br/><br/>Here's hoping they manage to improve on what they've done so far and make Prince Caspian better  hopefully the children will have grown into their roles more improving that side and I'm praying (excuse the irony!) that they avoid the 'just throw CGI at them' approach for the battles.<br/><br/>Overall, well worth watching if you haven't seen the TV series, otherwise you may want to avoid if that lies close to your heart!"
"bassett_latoya","9","0","1","30 January 2007"," Narnia Rocks!!!!!!
","Like Harry Potter, this is one of those movies that I wanted to see ever since it hit the theaters but wasn't able to for a long time. In the meantime, my excitement continued to build to see this movie. Of course I have read the book a dozen times over again! The wait was well worth it, however! I wasn't disappointed. The reason for my rating score of 9 is because it took so long before we finally got to Aslan, who happens to be my favorite character of the book series and the movies, old and new. My favorite scene is the scene where the saintly and magnificent Aslan pounces upon the White Witch and tears her throat out, damning her world to damnation!! Let's not forget that this is a Walt Disney produced film and not the film of The Ghost and the Darkness staring Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas. So there is no film footage of graphic blood to show nor view. It took me forever to convince my mother to sit and see The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe along with me. I knew that she would adore it if I could only persuade her to watch it. And Aslan? Why, she absolutely fell in love with him!! My mother didn't know about the Christian/Jesus keynote of the story and she vowed that if Aslan died (and stayed dead), that she would no longer continue to watch the movie. I must also make it clear that a great justice was done for all of the CGI animal characters. They looked so beautiful and so real!!! Not to mention their voices!! Very well done!!!"

The fighting is just stupid. Susan gets a bow, but she only use it once, or twice. In the fighting scenes, good and evil doesn't have any character, so you wouldn't know which one to cheer at. I mean, it's just a lot of creatures that punches each other, and so on. The movie is long, but much of it happens too fast.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This is one of the better fantasy movies for kids, but if you're looking for something darker, yet not a violent movie, this is definitely the wrong choice.

I was quite delighted to see the children play the roles with passion and commitment, well done. only thing i wasn't happy about the lofted cover drive edmund hit to break the glass, i mean he should have come more on his front foot and gone for a powerful drive, oh well, perhaps in the next movie. Anyways, i think i will actually go and purchase this DVD for my collection. i cant believe that i waited this long to see this movie. oh well, damn my boss for making me work over time, i highly recommend this movie to all people that loved the book."

","""The Chronicles of Narnia:/The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is a perfect fantasy. It satisfies the adult thirst for entertainment just as well as that of the older child. It involves the adventures of four young siblings who enter a fantastic world of elves and witches and animated animals that engulfs our imagination. Georgie Henley plays the youngest of the troupe, Lucy Pevensie, who first witnesses the magical land of Narnia. Her initial adventure eventually ensnares the others. Skandar Keynes plays Edmund Pevensie the younger of the brothers, and he actually cinches the attraction for the older two. William Moseley plays Peter Pevensie, the eventual leader of this group of adventurers. And Anna Popplewell plays Susan Pevensie, the older and most attractive sister who is more like an assistant to Peter in their fantastic story. The music is essential and awe inspiring. The computer graphic generated animals were enough to fool me. Liam Neeson is the voice of the lion, Aslan, and he was the perfect choice for this entertaining piece. Tilda Swinton plays the White Witch and her piercing eyes and gripping expressions make her the most outstanding source of evil seen in cinema in years. Don't miss this movie."

James mcavoy did a wonderful job bringing the character of c.s. lewis's sensitive faun to life. it's just a wonderful movie, and i recommend it to anybody who enjoys harry potter, king arthur, lord of the rings, or any sort of medieval movie. in fact, c.s. lewis was actually a friend of j.r.r. tolkien's. but enough about tolkien. narnia is just a beautiful movie built around an amazing story."

","What a pity-full movie... The decors and landscape look like plastic and fake during the whole movie, and the acting is quite excessive (it reminds me of the first Harry Potter movie, but the special effects were great at that time). Quite too long, and too childish for me maybe, I am really happy that such movies like LOTR does exist, because it should be a good objective for studios! But Disney is doing another theme park again instead of telling us a good story with good pictures. It's a shame when we think that POTC where inspired of a Disney attraction and was done quite better (special effects, filming, acting and a good and simple story, just what we need of adventure to have a good time!)

","I loved reading the lion the Witch and the Wardrobe as a child and I thoroughly enjoyed the BBC TV series however I have to say that this film was one of the most sickly and insipid things it has ever been my misfortune to see. The CGI graphics for the creatures were years out of date and they just did'nt look real and in parts like when the children are standing on the mountain you can clearly see their standing in front of scenery which has been projected behind them.Indeed unlike the Lord of the Rings the whole thing looks completely studio bound. There's absolutely no sense of dramatic tension. Your never at any point scared of the White Witch (I know its a kids film but there should still be a few harmless fright) and scenes which should be emotional are instead laughable. When Aslan was sacrificed all I could think about was how good he'd look stuffed and sitting in my living room. I also hated the fawn Mister Tumlin. If I was King Peter my first royal decree would be to tell him to wear a shirt and keep away from my little sister on pain of death. All in a all a rotten film and a terrible waste of good source material."
"FirstWash","5","0","1","30 June 2006"," The violence, both emotional and physical, made this at least a PG-13 movie
","I read the book to my 7 year old daughter and she really liked it. The book does not focus on the violence and she was able to gloss over that and enjoy the magic and adventure of the fantasy world. The movie, however, makes all too explicit the violence implied by the book. So much so that when my daughter's first grade teacher proposed to show the movie to her class, we and several other parents objected (and prevailed). While some children may be able to handle it, parents should not simply assume this movie is o.k. for kids under 10 simply because it is rated PG.<br/><br/>First, the London bombing scene is pretty scary. Lots of flash/boom and tension about whether the characters will be hurt.<br/><br/>Second, the first time Edumnd meets the White witch, the dwarf flies out of the sledge and holds a wicked-looking knife to his throat. It's very unexpected and very threatening.<br/><br/>Third, the death of Aslan is very emotionally violent as hordes of hideous creatures do really nasty things to a beloved character while the little girls in the movie watch without being able to help. Not only is the physical violence of the killing itself potentially disturbing to the young mind, but the emotional violence of cruelty is also hard to take. Any movie that has such a serious killing scene in it should be PG-13. I find it hugely ironic that Prairie Home Companion got a PG-13 rating for ""risque humor."" The idea that humor is somehow more worthy of parental concern than is cruel violence reflects, to me, a deep confusion of values.<br/><br/>Fourth, the battle scene is pretty scary. Again, the forces of evil are represented by really nasty looking creatures, just waiting to inhabit a small child's nightmares. And the fighting and killing is strong stuff.<br/><br/>These are all the longish parts that are likely to stick in a child's mind. There are also other flashes of horror that could also disturb a young child: the 'death' of Tummus, whose face contorts into an awful expression of pain; the encounter on the ice floe, where the wolf is very scary---heck, my daughter cried during ""Piglet's Big Movie"" because she imagined the awful things that would happen to the friends IF they fell into the river---and here the ice damn falls and the children plunge into the raging river; the voice of the wolf fighting Peter.<br/><br/>I'm just saying you need to really know your child on this movie, much more than the innocuous ""PG"" rating would lead you to believe.<br/><br/>Aside from the mis-rating, I found Aslan's character terribly disappointing. The jaw and mouth were way unbelievable for me; it made Asland look too much like Tony the Tiger."

","I'd like the TV series better than the movie itself. Even though the effects were thousand times better than the TV-series, I think the TV-series got a whole a lot of charm than the Hollywood production. The effects were too overwhelming and a little too much, to actually care about them all. The characters are simply drowning in all the visual effects. I just lost interest in what was going on and I just couldn't keep up to the end 'cause I just didn't care about what was going to happen to them. The kids could get eaten by the bad wolf for that matter. I just couldn't believe their characters. I don't exactly what's wrong with the movie, basically everything. It's trying to be Lord of the Ring like but it just don't work. It just fit better in smaller production. But this is my opinion. It was just nothing that I expected it to be. The magic was gone."

","I watched the movie twice, first at a multiplex and next at a economic single screen theatre. May be I didn't notice how good the movie was the first time, but no,I found more faults and wished Peter'King Kong' Jackson had directed the film. Were it were not for the 10 minute war sequence, Narnia would have been one of the major disappointments of 2005. Especiallly when the plan is to bring out six more movies.Irrespective of the box- office collections it garnered, Narnia is below par . Andrew Adamson doesn't get the characterization right. It takes a while for Aslan to appear, and therefore, not much time remains for the character of the king and not a mere jungle lion to encompass the audience. When Aslan and the White Witch go inside a tent for a meeting , there is an awkardness, as we see a Lion and not Aslan. Similar thoughts occur in the war sequence, the children would be believably dead than so unbelievably skilled to fight war. A little bit of practice and they are ready to battle! Unfortunately Disney hasbagged the rights for the movies, as a result there will be no blood where blood should be, and mild violence. The dilemma for the producerswas the question of doing away with the christain influences of the story or retain it. The result is a ambiguous reference to religion. The father Christmas scene is a drag and could have been crisp. It seems a scene out of a TV series. The air - raids, and the following scenes, in the opening sequence, takes up precious time of story teling. It is a while before all the children walk through the wardrobe. When they do, screen time is running out for the other characters to come. The final scenes of the crowning and "" Long Live"" cries is again awkward, and unintentionally ironic. Although Narnia... like the Harry Potter series, will be popular, but not everlasting cinema. Prince Caspian(2008), the next movie in the sequel, is been directed by Adamson again, hope he realises where he went wrong last time. Of course there is always Shrek."

","I have to say that this was a disappointing movie. In complete contrast to the excellent Lord of the Rings series which I thought had nailed the visual imagery, a lot of this Narnia movie seemed off. I feel that the people making this movie must not really have been lovers of the books, were lacking in vital imagination, or both. The movie was soulless. It was not that the individual actors were especially bad (I enjoyed Lucy for example), but the casting and computer-imagery seemed to be seriously off. The Great Witch, the Beavers, most of the Penvesies, the Professor, even Aslan, these were not how this book lover at least (and I think others too) had imagined them. The tempo of the movie and execution of plot was also lacking in the necessary spark to get the viewer involved in the movie. I was looking forward to this movie, but it was a serious disappointment."

"Crap_Connoisseur","Null","0","3","25 April 2006"," Nice Lion... Shame About The Dreadful Children
","The Chronicles of Narnia is the best advertisement yet for birth control. Lucy, Edmund, Peter and Susan are perhaps the most annoying child characters in the history of cinema. All the Pevensie clan seem capable of doing in the first half of the film is to bitch, moan and bicker. The director doesn't help by insisting on repeated close-ups of their sullen faces. I wonder if Andrew Adamson made them drink lemon juice between takes in order to obtain those grim facial expressions. Someone should have called that damned Super Nanny to sort them out.<br/><br/>As unappealing as the children are, they can not be blamed entirely for the film's lack of excitement, imagination and heart. Make no mistake that this is nothing more than a poor man's ""Lord of the Rings"". CS Lewis' classic novel deserved far better than this lazy adaptation. I am one of the few people on earth who finds Peter Jackson's trilogy trite and boring. Nevertheless, it is hard to deny that those films (well at least the first one) had a sense of grandeur and majesty. These are qualities that are sorely missing in Narnia. The set design feels one dimensional and the use of blue/green screen technology is painfully obvious. Worst of all, the story feels rushed and forced. The sense of wonder that permeates each page of Lewis' book is nowhere to be seen here. A couple of poorly rendered CGI unicorns just don't cut it. Even the much hyped final battle scene looks like Peter Jackson's leftover footage from ""The Two Towers"".<br/><br/>The film does have good moments, they are just sadly infrequent. The film's greatest asset is Tilda Swinton's fantastic portrayal of the white witch. The Chronicles of Narnia picks up noticeably every time Tilda graces the screen. Her interpretation of the white witch is wonderfully evil without ever becoming a parody. A lesser actress would not have shown such restraint. It says a lot about a film, when one of the best performances comes from a computer generated lion. Aslan is a magnificent creation. If only the animators had been so meticulous with the cheap looking beavers and eagles. James McAvoy's turn as Mr Tumnus also deserves praise. His character's impact far exceeds his screen time.<br/><br/>It speaks volumes for our empty society that this film has been interpreted by some as having religious value. CS Lewis' book was a well concealed biblical allegory. This is just a tawdry attempt to cash in on the success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" at the expense of a literary classic. If you are looking for enlightenment hire ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" or even (I can't believe I'm writing this) ""The Passion of the Christ"". Those films might be as much fun as a car crash, but at least they were made with a more noble intention than to simply create a new movie franchise."

We have watched it an additional 8 times since purchasing it. WOW!! I will be watching for it to play again on a big screen. It deserves to be shown in all it's glory on a widescreen with epic sound.

"olivetreecanada","6","0","1","19 April 2006"," great story, bad pacing, uneven acting
","Georgia Henley and Skandar Keynes were outstanding as Lucy and Edmund Pevensie respectively; if anything Georgia carried the rest of the cast, who acted as if their source material was commonplace rather than one of the most beloved children's fables in twentieth century English literature.<br/><br/>Tilda Swanton exuded some evil as the witch, but not enough to make me afraid, particularly during the Stone Table sequence. Her portrayal was not nearly as fearsome as other evil villains we have come to expect from this genre (like Sauron in Lord of the Rings).<br/><br/>The CG characters (particularly Beaver) were awesome though Liam Neeson, from whom we routinely expect brilliance, was flat as the messianic Aslan. James McAvoy put in a fantastic part-CG performance as the nervous Mr. Tumnus.<br/><br/>All that to say that the momentum waned a bit at the 110 minute mark; it did not have the breathless pacing and richly veined detail of Peter Jackson's rendering of the Tolkien epic, much more tedious material. And from the director of Shrek we expect a bit more pop and a bit of humour along the way as well. ""Lion..."" was very serious indeed.<br/><br/>Let's hope the actors and Director Adam Adamson kick it up a notch in the next one (Prince Caspian); the Narnia chronicles have so much more depth than the Harry Potter books, but the Potter movies have excelled in the book-to-screen transition. The first Narnia movie was only good, not excellent. There is a large fan base out there expecting a higher standard."

""we need to make it for a larger focus group, hence the mild violence and language and easy-to-melt-characters"").<br/><br/>I hate (yes HATE) the kids. The actors who plays them really suck, and I am usually very, very tolerant (always looking for positive upsides to a performance), but this just is to much crap. The director does not make any kind of statement in his ""work"", and is pretty much non-present throughout the entire film. The Oscar-nominated special effects is not really that good, not ""A-Sound-of-Thunder-bad"" but not very special at all, with the small exception of Aslan who actually looks like a real lion whenever he does not speak. The voice of Aslan by Liam Neeson is not good (Liam is a great actor, but the voice does not fit... or maybe the audio-mix is just crappy). The one thing that makes it worth watching is Tilda Swinton as the Queen, and also some the set-designs.<br/><br/>All in all, two and a half hours of: ""When is the suspense ever gonna start!?"", and; ""When will the four disturbing children die already!"""

","Finally got to watch this last night and, while I enjoyed it, I was underwhelmed. I will admit, right off the top, that I enjoy the LOTR and Harry Potter books more than Narnia. Narnia is aimed at a younger audience, which I am no longer a part of, and are much preachier, which is to be expected.<br/><br/>The story was presented quite well, from what I remember from the book. The talking animals work well, although I felt that the beavers looked a bit cartoonish. The wolves were excellent.<br/><br/>Overall I was surprised at the lack of a WOW factor. There were no scenes that I looked back on as visually impressive. The CGI'd creatures were beautiful, and the flying ones I liked particularly, but good CGI is now a basic expectation of a big budget movie.<br/><br/>The characters are very two dimensional, although well played by the actors. Lucy's grin was annoying at times, but many 6 year olds are annoying at times, in real life. The Snow Queen was striking, the dwarfs were cool, but, in the end, I was left wanting more.<br/><br/>I will watch this again, I am sure, and I will go to the sequel(s), but this will never be a movie that I put into the DVD player myself.

The director keeps the story moving along at a good pace, as we are introduced to strange characters such as talking beavers and creatures that are half-horse/half-man.

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic movie. Worthy of a few awards? I would say so. Worthy of global praise? Well, it's not that great. Pretty much, C.S. Lewis's first children's novel has been made into a children's action movie. Adults all across the nation are saying that they would ""prefer watching Fellowship of the Ring"". Well, frankly, I found the entire LotR trilogy quite boring and too drawn out, and would much rather watch this one.<br/><br/>It follows the story of Pevensie children inside a large mansion while their father is away at war. They are playing hide-and-seek one day when the youngest, Susan, stumbles upon a wardrobe leading to the snowy land of Narnia. It starts out quite entertaining, and it stays that way for the longest of times. You see the White Witch, Mr. Tumnus, and Professor Kirke. And then...you meet the Beavers. Sadly, these horribly-animated creatures were not only annoying and slowed down the mood of the children's adventure, but they're also the reason many people consider this to be a child's movie.<br/><br/>Once the children arrive in Aslan's camp, however, the speed picks up again and the movie is A+ from then on. The most amazing part of this movie is the final battle. In my opinion, the Battle for Mordor looks like Mario Party compared to this epic conclusion. The most realistic CGI yet. Many people will say that they didn't like the ending, but it stayed true to Lewis's novel, so it's all fine in my book.<br/><br/>All in all, Narnia is a fantastic movie that will keep kids and adults entertained as long as they look more at the story and not the special effects."

This has been the case with other pictures as well, most notably Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"". To rate ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" depends on what one brings to the film. For a Christian who loves Lewis, it is a 10. For a Christian who does not know or does not like Lewis, it is a 7. For a non-Christian who likes Lewis (and I have known at least one orthodox Jewish woman who loved Lewis) it is an 8 or 9. For a non-Christian who does not like Lewis, it is a 6. For a non-Christian who does not know Lewis, it is a 7. For an insecure post-Christian, it is a solid 1. For a mythical dispassionate viewer, for anyone who remembers his or her own best childhood hopes, it is 9.

C.S.Lewis was an apologist for the Catholic faith and his story is filled with Christian symbolism especially the scene where Aslan is persecuted and humiliated by the minions of the White Witch and finally executed by her.<br/><br/>What more of a parallel can be drawn to the Passion of the Christ and his execution? When the stone table breaks that is the symbolism reflecting the destruction of the Temple at Christ's death and it goes without saying that Aslan's ""rebirth is the Resurrection of Jesus all over again.<br/><br/>Peter's reluctant heroism is a message to us all. Hold fast to the truth regardless of the popular train of thought and fight for what you believe to be right with every ounce of your conviction.<br/><br/>Edmond's greed and his manipulation by the White Witch shows us that when we seek after personal satisfaction and gain, there is always a hidden price involved that we, unfortunately, discover far too late.<br/><br/>This movie has stunning visual effects and is suitable for young children BUT I feel it is important that a parent watch it with the child(ren) and take time to explain the parallels between the scenes and their moral equivalent."

Finally, the first clips began to hit and I knew then that he had succeeded. Upon release of the film, I am proud to say that this is a near perfect adaptation of the first novel in the series The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. From the period setting to the special effects that are full of wonder to the epic grandeur of the tale, Narnia delivers in every respect. All the children, though unknowns, turn in fine performances and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan is inspired casting. His rich tones give a sense of greatness to the lion king. The best performance of the film is that of Tilda Swinton as Jadis. She is just purely evil. The only real complaint that I have about the film is that the cyclops and a few other background creatures look incredibly fake. After wowing with so many other things in the movie, was there not enough budget left to create a makeup that didn't look like a Halloween mask? In the end, however, I am left hoping that this series will do well and get to carry on with further installments."

","This major theatrical adaptation by Disney of THE LION, THE WITCH and THE WARDROBE is not only faithful to the book, but an entertaining adventure film in its own right. It stands right up there with LORD OF THE RINGS and the HARRY POTTER films. Four siblings are shipped off during wartime to a distant relative in the country, and quickly discover a wardrobe that opens onto an alternate world, called Narnia, populated by talking animals and mythical creatures like griffins, centaurs and mermaids. The ruler of Narnia, a wise and compassionate lion named Aslan and voiced by Liam Neeson, is being challenged by the evil White Witch, played by veteran British actress Tilda Swinton, who may be a new face to many viewers here. After various adventures involving a helpful faun, fox and beaver family, a pack of extremely vicious wolves and Old St. Nick himself, the children join Aslan's army and do battle with the witch and her gruesome minions. The final battle may remind you of the final battle in LORD, but keep in mind LION was written before LORD. The actors playing the children are adorable and believable as siblings, the actors voicing the animals are for the most part OK, the special effects are seamless, and the music works 90 percent of the time. My only real complaint is the night scenes were much too dark, to the point I literally could not see what was going on in some scenes. I wonder what the director could have been thinking. Anyhow, see LION. This big-budget version (there are two previous TV adaptations and a wonderful cartoon) would not exist if it were not for HARRY POTTER, but LION is head and shoulders above the Potter films."

","I went to see this movie a few days after it had come out with a friend of mine, without knowing anything about it. I was amazed! This film was gorgeous. I ended up seeing it 4 times in theaters. First of all, it follows the book very closely, something few directors bother to consider doing anymore(Harry Potter, anyone?). The characters, especially the four Pevensie children, were cast wonderfully. They truly acted as a family and I hope we'll see more from them in the future. Mr. Tumnus was great, as was the White Witch- perfectly true to both C.S. Lewis' and my imagination. Aslan was magnificent- I never doubted for a second that those children weren't talking to a real lion. It was shot beautifully, in New Zealand and the Czech Republic. The special effects were wonderful- all sorts of wide and beautiful shots. And of course, each one was accompanied by Harry Gregson-Williams' haunting and beautiful musical scores, perfect for the tone and feel of the film. It was really a treat, and each time I left the theater satisfied. I encourage everyone- children who love the books, adults, even grandparents- to go see this movie. It was a perfect realization of Lewis' magical world."

"sullibrandon","9","0","2","26 March 2006"," An Excellent Tribute to CS Lewis's Classic
","If anyone tries to tell you that this movie is boring, unconvincing, and has crappy special effects, don't listen to them. After reading a few of the user comments about this movie here on IMDb, one major trend I saw was that people thought that A, it was boring, B, it had bad special effects, and C, it was not a good adaptation. All 3 of these are completely wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, this film is anything but boring. The child actors chosen for the parts are the best choice in the world. These children play their parts to perfection, and they are completely believable as the Pevensie family. They are talented, believable, emotional, and they gel unbelievably well as brothers and sisters. I never once questioned their bond as siblings. They just....fit. Lucy's wide-eyed wonder when she first enters Narnia is magical...in fact Andrew Adamson specifically did not show the actress the set until that day...she was brought in blindfolded so that her expression of joy when the blindfold was taken off could be fully captured on camera. People's accusations for the boringness of the film are only due to the fact that the children take awhile to get to Narnia. If you are looking for a slam-bang movie with nonstop action, Narnia is not for you. It is a sweet, loving, tale with some mighty fine action in there, but with a core of four young kids in a foreign land, forced to become heroes by living up to the prophecy about them. I greatly respected the filmmakers choice to not try force the children into Narnia right away, without any back-story. The whole set up of the bombing in London, then the train trip to the house, then the hide and go seek game...it all worked perfectly to give the audience time to absorb, learn, and understand the characters of these children. Without this set-up...they wouldn't really be anything else than excuses to have action. The way the film works, with about an hour before any major action, is excellent.<br/><br/>As for the bad special effects accusation...this is simply absurd. The Chronicles of Narnia had some of the best special effects of the year, and the only picture that out-did it, I believe, was King Kong, whose special effects were mind-boggling. Nevertheless, Narnia's fx are a wonder to behold. They are so seamlessly integrated throughout the the film that everything seems incredibly real. The beavers, especially, are two of the most cute and believable CGI creations I have ever seen, including Gollum from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The wolves are also really well done. The final battle scene is perfect - the special effects pound at you for a good ten or fifteen minutes at the great clash between good and evil. Of course, the scale is nothing like Lord of the Rings, but Narnia is not meant to be a replacement for Lord of the Rings. It is meant as a tale in its own right....don't put comparisons on it that aren't meant or needed. For itself, it is a good action epic, and the special fx rival Lord of the Rings, even though the scale is not as grand. The greatest special fx creature in the movie, though, would be Aslan. Aslan is the most beautiful CGI creation I have ever seen on screen. Neither Kong nor Gollum, are beautiful, but Aslan is just that. He has just the ethereal, not quite real touch to make him believable as the Savior figure he is. His anger is mighty to behold, and his mane flows like the waves of the ocean.<br/><br/>Now for C - the accusation that the movie is a bad adaptation of a book. Making a movie out of a book is always tricky. You are never going to satisfy everybody, and you are never going to displease everybody. There are always some people out there who seem to think that a book is easy to translate into a movie. Well, here's news: It's not. Good movies made from books are few and far between, and for good reason: it's not easy making the transition. The screenplay writer/director has to make cuts, he has to NOT include everything. If everything in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wadrobe had been included, we'd be staring at a five hour movie. The director's and screenplay writer's ability to translate the book into a two and a half hour movie is admirable. And they did it while still maintaining the heart and soul of CS Lewis's classic. Some things had to be cut, and also - the movie is a movie, and should be judged as one. Movies are a completely different genre than books - there are things you can do in books which you can never do in movies, and there are things you can do in movies that you could never do in books. Narnia does an excellent job of taking a classic and making a perfectly admirable movie.<br/><br/>In closing, Narnia is one of the best films of the year. I highly recommend it - and don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you that it's a bad movie."

","This movie will suffer heavy criticism because of the enormity of the Lord of The Rings masterpiece. It is hard not to compare the two. Going into the film I fully expected a full force 2005 high-tech fantasy epic. This is what was promoted by the movie company. What I got was a kids movie. The movie itself was watchable but a huge disappointment. Zero character development. Zero thrills. The movie lacked everything needed for a good fantasy. The writers tried to cram too many events into a short time. What you get is an annoying stream of plot important events that all happen to quickly with no back-story. This movie is not for adults and barely for fantasy fans. Its too bad that the awesome Narnia books had to come to the screen as this lame kid flick."

"tomimt","8","0","1","26 February 2006"," A nice addition to the fantasy movie family
","There are two fantasy movie series which Narnia can be compared to and they are, of course, Harry Potter and Lord Of the Rings. Of those two I'd go a bit more towards Potter than LOTR, as the film clearly was aimed towards younger audience than LOTR. But what comes to over all appearance of the film it goes heavily towards LOTR.<br/><br/>My opening babbling doesn't mean, that Chornicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe would be a clear copy and mix of the two. The story elements are there: the growth of children to become heroes of Narnia, the fears of children in war. But the execution of the film differs, as Narnia relies on Christian thematics and morals in its story line.<br/><br/>I recently read the book before seeing the film, and I can say, that the book is more blatantly religious than the film, tough the main elements are present: daughters of Eve, sons of Adam, Aslan, the Judas theme etc., but they aren't so heavily underlined as they were in the book.<br/><br/>The story has gone under some changes, even tough it's pretty faithful to the book in general. It's just the fact, that the book is rather short and some things aren't explained. Lewis had the knack of just skipping some elements and going somewhere else. Now the film begins with raid over Britain, where we see the reason why the kids are sent away from London and the bombings of the German troops. There are some adventurous scenes added in the middle of the story, but other than that the film is pretty accurate display of the book.<br/><br/>The most thrilling thing in the film is magnificently made Aslan, voice by Liam Neeson. It's both real and surreal at the same time, just like the other animal characters of the film. But it's the Aslan who stands out the crowd.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised with the film, as I didn't expect to like it very much, but I did. I, at first, doubted the length of the film, as the book wasn't that long, but the direction, acting, special effects and over all looks of the film keep the viewer entertained to the end. A solid fantasy film, which will get a sequel very soon if the signs are to be trusted."
"DrLenera","Null","0","1","22 February 2006"," Fine fantasy adventure for all the family,and a worthy adaptation of the book
","Although sadly considered by quite a few to be just a kid's movie,a kind of juvenile Lord of the Rings {and mind you,what's wrong with that?},this is a terrific fantasy epic that may feature children as the protagonists but is certainly not childish. Whilst C.S Lewis did indeed write his books for children,the makers of this film adaptation of what is not the first but easily the best known book have carefully steered the film away being simply for children to it being a great film for all the family. Of course if you're the sort who would laugh as talking animals and the like,it's not worth you seeing this film,but do you hear many adults say,for instance,The Wizard of Oz is rubbish and just for kids?<br/><br/>Opening dramatically if a little discertainly with planes bombing WW2 London,the film proceeds at a leisurely place,introducing the young protagonists and us to the land and denizens of Narnia gradually,but the pace gradually gets faster and faster until the final battle,an eye-popping sequence featuring more mythical creatures than you can imagine.<br/><br/>Worried readers of the book have nothing to fear,the film is quite faithful and even,dare I say it,improves on the book at times. The children are characterised better,and a few sequences are added in the middle section of the story to bump up the pace. Only one major scene from the book near the end,where a spell is cast and 'things' come to life {I can't say more as I try to avoid spoilers} is disappointing and falls far short of it's potential.<br/><br/>The acting of the children is excellent,although Tilda Swinton gives the stand out performance as the scary but oddly sexy White Witch. The special effects are mostly great. I say mostly,because while the effects team have pulled off a few miracles such as with the talking lion Aslan {a CGI creation so convincing he cane almost be mistaken for a real lion},there is the odd element which appears to have been rushed,such as two instances of DREADFUL back projection {how could they?} and a scene involving a frozen lake and falling ice {one of the 'invented' scenes} which also suffers with poor direction. Al Adamson {of Shrek 1 and 2} sometimes shows his inexperience with live action,although he generally does an okay job.<br/><br/>While the action is conspicuously bloodless,there is quite a bit more darkness in the film than one might expect-very young kids may be scared by things such as the Witch's wolf servants,and the ritual killing of one of the film's characters three quarters of the way through is surprisingly disturbing. Some may even see disturbing sexual elements in the scenes between Edmund and the Witch who is trying to seduce him to what George Lucas would have called 'the dark side'.<br/><br/>Generally though,this is a fine fantasy adventure movie that certainly bodes well for any future films of Lewis' books and,despite complaints to the contrary,is no more 'Christian' then Lord of the Rings. Don't expect Lord of the Rings or,indeed,Harry Potter,and you'll find much to enjoy."
"showtime1419","5","0","2","14 February 2006"," A mediocre film on the heels of Lord of the Rings
","I read the Chronicles of Narnia as a child and was relatively unimpressed. After having seen the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in theaters, I felt a very similar feeling. Acting was somewhat mediocre - with the exceptions of Lucy and the White Witch, played by Georgie Henley and Tilda Swinton respectively.<br/><br/>The story is a weak point with dialogue in particular being a problem. Again, I was not very fond of the books, so if you are a fan, you may feel differently. My biggest problem with this film lies in the lack of explanation throughout the story. Even by the end, you know very little about major characters such as the lion, Aslan, or the White Witch. References to the laws of Narnia and ""deep magic"" also go largely unexplained. The ridiculousness of several events also erode the integrity of the story. Foremost among these is the fact that when the young children meet Santa, he promptly provides them with weapons as Christmas presents. I can just see the appropriateness of modern children hoping for Uzis and AK-47s under their Christmas trees. This event underscores the appropriateness of children going to war. As result, some of the action is also unimpressive because what can you expect from young children who have no training and seem extraordinary in no particular way? Apparently, any four kids could have stumbled through this wardrobe and saved Narnia.<br/><br/>The special effects do a lion's share (no pun intended) of the work in this movie, but they often seem weak from time to time and give off a cartoony feel. I will give high praise to the musical score which was grandiose and invoked continuous feelings of wonder.<br/><br/>In comparison to The Lord of the Rings films, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe looks weak. If you were a big fan of the book series you probably will still enjoy this movie, but I would describe it as overall mediocre."

Another brilliant casting was Liam Neeson (Spelling?) as Aslan.

","OK, was I drunk? or did Santa Clause pull weapons out of his toy bag for the children?? I haven't read the books, but it seems pretty clear to me that the purpose of this story is to harness children's tendency towards self-grandizing fantasy, and leverage it in support of what was at the time, the war effort against Nazi Germany. Like Plato encourages in the Republic, this story functions an allegory meant to teach children about the ""good"". The problem I have with this film however, is that I'm not sure the ""good"" that this film encourages really is good.<br/><br/>The film climaxes with children (after all learning valuable lessons such as remain loyal, keep faith, and be brave) leading the highly Chirstianized army against the evil authoritarian enemy. The shots of the children fighting in the war are grandiose and highly stylized. What erks me is that these are children, and that these are children in the movie theatre having their fantasies tickled by such depictions. While the books were written in the context of World War 2, the film, now being shown to American children, functions as excellent propaganda for soldier recruitment for the war right now. By fetishizing the notion of bravely fighting for the ""good"", the film clearly works in the favour of current armed forces who depend on similar myths in order to gather recruits.<br/><br/>This film should not be accepted uncritically, and parents should be concerned about the way children's fantasies are subtly being leveraged in support of war. Though sometimes there may be good reason for going to war, it is never the case that it is glorious. We are wise to remind our children of this, and should be careful not to let their fantasies pull them into something they don't yet understand."

","Expectations aside - lets just look at this movie from a technical aspect. The settings were lack-luster and Narnia seemed didn't look at all enchanted. The characters were weak and performances lame (with the exception of Lucy and Mr Tumnus). For 4 children to suddenly find themselves in a magical land they seemed to take everything in their stride and were pretty unfazed by the strange creatures and environment around them. When they were told they were part of a prophecy and were to become Kings and Queens of Narnia they didn't bat an eyelid or ask 'WHY??' or 'Who is this White Witch ... how did she become the ruler of Narnia ... Who is Aslan?' In fact none of these essential aspects of the story were explained to the viewers. A movie is a story that unfolds and should involve the audience ... if we're not informed then we can't really connect with the story. And please ... Santa gives weapons (of mass destruction) to Children!! hahaha The pace of the movie was way off ... slow to start and then too rushed, which didn't help with character development.<br/><br/>Is it just me or did Narnia seem like a tiny place ... there was no sense of scale.<br/><br/>Beaver's cockney rhyme really irritated me. I guess it's the Shrek 'laugh here' device that's supposed to be funny - but it was corny as hell.<br/><br/>There were two saving graces for me - the whole Mr Tumnus scene (beautifully acted with lots of subtle nuances)and the White Queen's gimp, well not him but his priceless line ""This way for the numnums!"" I laughed my ass off at that.<br/><br/>Anyway I was disappointed in general but I'm sure kids will love it for what it is - a pure Disney fantasy, but for me I'm sorry to say a poor adaptation of a classic book."

As a Christian I didn't see anything about it, except for the reference to Genesis, but that didn't explain anything to me, sorry to say that, but that's just how I see it.

","""Chronicles of Narnia"" is sweet and fun, and it captures that sense of wonder that's true to childhood in a way that many other, similar films have tried to do, but been unable to do.<br/><br/>I'm not a CS Lewis fan, and, given so-so reviews, I didn't expect much. The film charmed me, though.<br/><br/>Opening scenes were a bit slow and quiet, but the pace did pick up towards the end.<br/><br/>The production values of the film were excellent, from brief, early scenes depicting Nazi bombing of London during WW II, to the special effects in Narnia.<br/><br/>Lighting was lacking; Tilda Swinton was breathtakingly, marvelously, evil as the White Witch; she's in the same class, here, as Margaret Hamilton in ""Wizard of Oz."" But she's lit all wrong; her icicle crown never shines and sparkles as it ought. And she isn't given enough screen time.<br/><br/>I was really charmed and swept away by the magical animals of Narnia, the talking beavers, fighting bulls, etc. I've seen a lot of special-effects heavy films this year, but this one was the most fun, certainly more fun than the overdone ""King Kong."" Especially delightful was Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie. It's rare that I see a new star and want to become that star's groupie, following his or her progress. Georgie earned that kind of devotion and interest from me with her performance here. She distills the sweetness and innocence of a small girl, and yet she's interesting, more Haley Joel Osment than Shirley Temple.<br/><br/>Henley's chemistry with James McAvoy, as a faun, was instantly believable. You'd think that they'd been performing this couple in stock companies for years. I wish more on screen romantic couples had such great chemistry. I was put in mind of Judy Garland and Ray Bolger in ""Oz."" Aslan, the lion, voiced by Liam Neeson, was perfect. He was very beautiful, and imposing, and noble. A just gorgeous use of special effects.<br/><br/>The wolves, as the secret police, were very scary.<br/><br/>The White Witch's method of eliminating her foes, by freezing them, was beautifully handled.<br/><br/>Finally, I deeply appreciated the sense of childhood that pervaded this movie. It brought back to me the wonder that childhood can create (or discover), and the sense of children in the audience that the filmmakers exercised.<br/><br/>You can feel perfectly comfortable viewing this film with a child. It does not contain the kind of graphic images that many ostensibly ""child friendly"" films do contain, that can make a caring adult squirm.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand -- this film does treat complex issues in a profound way. It just doesn't use cheap sensationalism to do so, as too many movies do.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing. Some have voiced fear that this film will impose Christianity on them. That's nonsense. This film proselytizes much less than most politically correct movies, that jam their worldview down your throat and depict anyone who isn't onboard with them as Satan incarnate.<br/><br/>In fact, given that I haven't read Lewis' book, if I had not read the press coverage of the ""Christian controversy,"" I don't know that I would have made the connection.<br/><br/>Lewis was an expert in, and a great fan of, ancient mythology, from a variety of cultures. ""Chronicles"" contains images and motifs that go back to Norse mythology, etc. This movie is not going to convert you to anything, except maybe to an appreciation of its beauty, and its respect for, and love of, children and childhood."

There were some liberties taken to make the story a bit more ""gripping,"" but I felt they were all in the spirit of CS Lewis' story. And the movie hewed to the book to a remarkable degree.<br/><br/>All the actors were excellent, particularly the little girl who plays Lucy. The wonder in her eyes the first time she sees Narnia is so genuine. Lucy, as you may know, ends up being Aslan's favorite of sorts -- rather like St. John -- and with this portrayal of Lucy one can see why ( even though that facet doesn't really come out strongly till later books).<br/><br/>The transformation of Edward from self-deceived traitor to all-out knight of Aslan is wonderfully handled -- not just a two dimensional cardboard cutout by any means. He saves the day during a crucial moment in the climactic battle between Aslan and the White Witch.<br/><br/>Peter's character develops resolutely but a bit slower than I'd expected. But then, one does not grow from older brother to High King of Narnia in a day (though for some reason I didn't notice the term ""High King"" being used -- a small egalitarian flaw, if I'm correct).<br/><br/>And in Susan you can see both why she is known as ""Susan The Gentle,"" and perhaps the seeds of why she is no longer a ""friend of Narnia"" in the final book. Both are there, as her character is drawn in this screenplay.<br/><br/>Aslan is fantastic, voiced by Liam Neeson, one of my favorite actors. The Lion is mostly computer-generated, very realistically, and the voice is both magnificently strong and gently understanding. His ""resurrection,"" I must confess, brought me almost to tears of joy.<br/><br/>The other animals and mythological beings are created magnificently. The epic battle between good and evil is movingly, powerfully done. Lewis himself had described it in a few deft strokes so the movie maker's skill was set free to a great extent, and they acquitted themselves well.<br/><br/>There are a few things added to the book that, frankly, I think they could have done without. A courageous fox who does not appear in any of the books, appears to help the children and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver escape cruel pursuing wolves. He is noble and fine in his own right but I think he was extraneous to the movie.<br/><br/>There is also an entire added scene where Peter performs some desperate daring-do to escape the same wolves a little later on. He also almost kills Lucy in the process and the whole thing is a bit over the top. The movie is 2 1/2 hours and although it is exciting, that whole scene could have been cut out and the film shortened with no real loss.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a scene with Edmund and Mr. Tumnus imprisoned by the White Witch (which did not happen in the book) was a great addition, contributing to the motivation for Edmund's change perhaps more powerfully than the way CS Lewis wrote it.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie I will definitely go back and see it again, if I get the chance. I certainly hope The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe does well at the box office because I'd dearly love to see the other six books filmed as well."

","A very good combination of fantastic and realism A very nice told story And a very good quality movie excellent work Good Sunday movie. It shows a great work behind the scenes and the landscapes were absolutely wonderful. The white witch was very good contoured and realized. Her expressions were breathe taking. Also ""The Lion King"" :) was very good put into the scene. The small girl was very expressing and they demonstrated that they are a true family by the end. The story is breathtaking by it's fantastic nature. Since this is my very first comment i think it's a good one :))))))).

I really recommend this movie to everyone, and if you were thinking about seeing it, I think you should. I think the actors/actresses did a truly wonderful job considering that a lot of them have never been in a movie before.

"pclgpo","10","0","1","14 January 2006"," Electrifying! It exceeded my expectations.
","I first heard about the book six months ago and when I saw the movie last night, I was enchanted! The book, I understand, was written in the late-30s or early-40s, by the most famous Christian author of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Speaking half-facetiously, C. S. Lewis, the author, must have been on drugs when he wrote the book that this movie is based on. Regardless, this movie compares favorably to Tolkien's Hobbits. The fantasy world that Lewis created is similar to the one that Tolkien created. I mention this because it was an interesting coincidence to learn that Tolkien was a contemporary of Lewis.<br/><br/>I'm a relatively new (born again) Christian and as I learn more and more about Christianity, I encounter a vast and new sea of theologians and preachers. Their thoughts and opinions run the spectrum (of course) but this particular book, this specific one, stands out. I have not read the works of many other authors but I can confidently say that this one stands out.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. The characters and everything else was first rate. The plot is simple and is based on the usual theme of good versus evil. Make no mistake about it though. It is illuminating and entertaining at the same time. There was never a dull moment. I salute everyone who participated in the creation of this classic and thank Mr. Lewis posthumously!"

","I liked The Chronicles of Narnia, I think it was entertaining and magical, something that i find interesting is why so many grown ups went to see this film, then they want to judge it on their level, and that is not possible. We have to remember this movie is for children, and yes, maybe the story was not very deep and logical, but i think that for the kids level it was OK. The movie had it's funny moments, people reacted to it in the theather, so i guess they connected with it. The little girl Lucy was great. so was the witch. very cool the combination of all white with the black eyes without eyelashes. the battle was a little strange, and in the end I don't know why they needed those kids because they didn't do anything actually. if you notice there was no blood during the whole battle (again it is a children movie). It is inevitable to compare it with LOTR because you can feel the same atmosphere. (i fell asleep watching LOTR though it was boring and looooong) Aslan was very good, the voice of Liam Neesom is so soft, deep and warm and the lion was convincing. It is a story about the human nature. in general is it a great kids movie."
"Tar-Palantir","9","0","1","11 January 2006"," Symbols
","When I was watching this film I concentrated more to things behind the story than the story itself. Even it was perfect and better then ""classical"" present Hollywood films with predictable story. Symbols I've found:<br/><br/>The tree on the wardrobe. Tree - Yggdrassil was in Viking mythology the place of the Middle where heaven, hell and our world meet together. The tree symbolizes the gate. The mythology of the Middle we can find in many other religions - Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, etc. So that the tree symbolizes the gate.<br/><br/>Santa Claus. In our country little Jesus is said to give the gifts. In other countries e.g. U.S. there these presents give Santa Claus or anyone else. But in fact it is the same person. When Jesus was born three kings had come to him and gave him the three gifts. Gold, myrrh and incense. In Narnia there Santa Claus gifts actually three kings with three different gifts. The healing potion, the bow and the sword. In figurative sense these gifts are the same gifts but they are given back from Jesus to the kings.<br/><br/>There is also lot of Christian notation. Self-sacrifice and resurrection of Aslan, temptation of Edmund.<br/><br/>It is very good and unusual film. I'm gonna read the book."
"bigtron","7","0","1","10 January 2006"," Nice to see a childhood story brought to the big screen
","I read the book almost 15 years ago (for English class) and have forgotten most of the details. However upon watching the movie, i suddenly remember small details which brings back some fond memories of the story.<br/><br/>The movie however is simply an above average movie. The acting are good but not great. Tilda Swinton is quite good in a surprisingly limited screen. There simply aren't enough screen time to built char (especially with 4 main chars!!). Why Edmund would betray his siblings is a bit lost if based solely on the movie. Him being bewitched with Turkish delights also is not in the movie, the movie simply shows it as just another 'perk' if Edmund was to bring his brother and sister to the white witch. The CGI is good but not great, maybe because it was too clean to make the PG rating. Its makes the battle looks cartoonish which is a shame.<br/><br/>If they had made a longer movie and spent more time developing chars AND put in some blood and gore into the battle, the movie would be much better (ofcourse that would make is less of a kids movie and probably make less money for the studio) Nevertheless the movie is quite enjoyable and worthy to bring a wonderful childhood story book to life."
"esseff1975","5","0","1","9 January 2006"," Entertaining!
","THE CHRONICLES is an entertaining film for viewers of all ages, even those that are not familiar with the C.S. Lewis novel. Like LORD OF THE RINGS, THE CHRONICLES is a story filled with memorable characters, evil, good, and fairy tale. Due to its rating, THE CHRONICLES is hampered by its need to stay child-friendly and isn't able to hit the key moments in stride, i.e., the scenes of panic and fear are held back without the ability to visualize what would have inevitably resulted in a higher rating.<br/><br/>There are religious themes throughout the film, as in the novel, but the film does not hit you over the head with the theology and you don't ""miss"" anything if you don't have background on the themes of betrayal, redemption, etc.<br/><br/>Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan are four Pevensie children that are sent off to the rural areas of England during WWII when the blitz was threatening the future of the country. At the house, ignored by the owners, the kids play amongst themselves, and during one game of hide and seek, young Lucy discovers a wardrobe that allows her to enter an enchanted, wintery land.<br/><br/>Each child has a distinct personality. Lucy is the trusting, young, curious one. Edmund is the ""number two"", young and jealous, lying and deceitful. Susan is the older, yet shy and graceful. Peter is the unproven leader, assuming responsibility without earning or wanting it.<br/><br/>Entering the wardrobe, all four kids discover the land of Narnia, which has been cast into an everlasting winter by the White Witch. Their desire to return ""home"" is hampered by both Edmund's disappearance and a prophecy that four humans will enter the land of Narnia and with the help of the lion Aslam overthrow the Witch and return summer to Narnia."

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, was an excellent movie for children.

However, there wasn't one ounce of blood. Not even a drop. Which made the battle scene unbelievable.<br/><br/>Even Aslan, who tells peter to ""Clean your sword"", clean what?

","There are several things I wish to discuss.

I thought to myself, ""Go figure."" The Director and creators of this film did not set out to eclipse LOTR as the best fantasy film of the day. If you compare ANY fantasy film to LOTR it falls short. Bad comment. The same critic also said ""...the religious symbolisim is disturbing, and obvious."" To that I shall reply with the thing Liberals tell everyone about there crap filled movies ""DONT WATCH IT THEN!!!"" If it bothers you, nobody can force you to watch it. I just think that it is funny they say that to everybody else all the time, but then that comment doesn't apply when it is used on them. Hysterical.

"demz84","Null","0","1","4 January 2006"," Great Movie
","I have to say that this movie had the right actors for the job. Like some other guy said, that voice of Aslan was perfect and no one, I mean NO ONE, could've done a better job (that guy has been appearing in a lot of big films this/last year too). Lucy was perfect, I mean her facial expressions were priceless and Edmund was rather well too. I think they could've done a better job with the eldest brother though, just my opinion, but he pulled off a good enough job (just not up to par with Aslan, Lucy, and Edmund). And what about that white witch eh? when you see female villains they're usually not realistic IMO, but this one was perfect. Feminity mixed with cruelty - it was great! <br/><br/>For Christians you could see it as I did: Aslan represents Christ, the kids humanity, the white witch Satan and her armies his demons, and the ""great magic"" the law of the Bible in the Old Testament. Edmund represents all of humanity under the law, were guilty and have to die according to God's law and justice; however, Aslan representing Christ fulfills the laws requirements and dies for Edmunds treachery, but rose again from the dead (he even is in distress alone in a garden like Christ was in the Garden of Gethsemene). The battle clearly, IMO, represents Armageddon and how everything seems lost and Aslan comes just in the nick of time to save the day, like Christ will do, fits in with that. O yea, up till they go back home that represents the Millenial reign. For me it really helped spiritually, and I normally never put any credit into movies for spiritual things, but it did because it showed me how in the end Christ will have so much He will give to His followers and as we see clearly with Edmund Christians don't deserve it, but He gives it freely and lovingly. Whether or not C.S. Lewis meant the movie to be taken this way I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure from the little I know about him (BTW his book Pilgrim's Regressing is like John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, great book and enjoyed reading it)that this is the way it was meant to be taken.<br/><br/>From Wikipedia's biography on C.S. Lewis ""His most famous works, the Chronicles of Narnia, contain many strong Christian messages. These are often mistaken for allegory, but, as Lewis himself said, are certainly not allegory. Lewis is said to have stated that he wrote the novels when he wondered what it would be like if Jesus Christ was incarnated on another world or planet to save the souls of those inhabitants."" So as you can see it wasn't meant to be an allegory but rather a ""what if"" Christ had died for other creatures on another planet. All in all the Christian messages are there intentional or unintentional and I think in this case somewhat intentional but not enitrely. Whatever, I liked the movie. :)<br/><br/>I will be buying the Chronicles of Narnia books and read them and hopefully if they do make sequels they don't ruin such a great movie but enhance it. I haven't liked a movie this much in a long time, great great movie go out, get the kids, or even just yourself, and watch it."
"rchadwi@hotmail.com","9","0","1","3 January 2006"," Awesome Movie, Christmas or Otherwise
","Especially for anyone who read the CON series as a kid (as I did) this was an excellent adaption of the main book (there are seven total). Of course, as a fantasy series the visuals are a big component and this movie does a fantastic job of translating what one might visualize in their young minds to the screen. I've always thought that one problem translating fantasy or horror books onto screen has always been the iffy aspect of taking words, for which your mind conjures up it's own unique imaging, and translating them to a stark image based on the director's own imagination. Many times this simply doesn't work. Also, I have to say I am NOT a fan (typically) of CGI effects. Having said that, I've not seen a finer example of CGI and general fantasy imagery than this movie. The animals (who, of course, talk) are astoundingly rendered. The story is faithful to the book. The dialogue is very, very good. The acting could be better, especially (IMHO) the character of Susan. All the talk of religion and symbolism aside (C.S. Lewis was a devout Christian who rejected his faith and came back to it), anyone non-religious will find this movie a delight as well as those who choose to be fascinated by the Christ analogy. I'd rate it a ""10"" were it not for sometimes spotty acting. If you can see it on an IMAX screen, by all means do."

"FMACDONALD","10","0","2","3 January 2006"," To Sum This Film Up In One Word.....Awesome!!!!!
","The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is awesome! This movie is one of the ten best of 2005, plain and simple. Don't believe me? See it for yourself. This film caters to not only fans of fantasy but just to fans who love good film making as well. It has a great story, good acting and mind blowing CGI. Directed by Andrew Adomson (Shrek and Shrek 2) The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is actually the second part in a seven part series of novels the tell the story of four kids Lucy (Georgie Henly, Edmund (Skandar Adama), Peter (William Mosley), and Susan (Anna Poppelwell) who enter the world of Narnia, a world that's beautiful, magical, strange, mysterious, and scary all at once. There have been several adaptations of C.S. Lewis's beloved novel, the best known (till now that is) is the animated two hour made for TV film from the '70's. The plot is still the same as the novel. The four children, living in war torn Englad at the beginning of World War II are sent to live, as evacuees after their home is bombed by Germany, with a professor in his mansion. The problem is there are rules such as no touching things, no running, etc. etc. Basically no having fun. One day during a rainy day, the kids being kids break the rules and play hide and seek. Little Lucy finds a wardrobe that she decides to hide in, what she doesn't know is that the wardrobe is the gateway to the world of Narnia. Lucy manages to get her brothers and sister to come back with her and the four are then, unknowing to them, are caught up in the middle of a war between good and evil. Narnia is a land that has been cursed by The White Witch (Tilda Swinton, who seemed like she was channeling Emperor Plapatine from Return Of The Jedi and Revenge Of The Sith. The witch has made it winter for 100 years with no sign of having it stop. Them she meets Edmund, and she realizes that the prophecy of Narnia is true. The prophecy says that four humans will come to Narnia and aid Aslan, the true king of Narnia, in defeating the witch. This makes her panic. Soon The children meet Aslan, The Lion (voiced perfectly by Liam Neeson) and the war between good and evil begins. Narnia is great and Disney has what should be a pretty successful franchise on their hands. Adomason, who does such a good job with this film has signed on to do two more. Disney has announced that they will not be adapting all seven books but just three, all that has been announced was parts two and seven (The Final Battle). Now fans of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy that have this series pegged as the nest LOTR might be a little disappointed. Narnia plays more like a Harry Potter film than a LOTR film (This isn't bad thing by the way). The CGI is great, not LOTR great but then again it's not The Hulk either. The other thing that makes this a good movie (other than the CGI) is the acting. Usually i hate kid actors. I mean Jake Loyd was half the reason The Phantom Menace sucked, and while he wowed me in The Sixth Sense Haley Joel Osmet hasn't done anything to impress me since (A,.I.? come on). These kids are great as great as the kids from the Harry Potter films. Just like them these kids have studied the roles very well. Now for parents thinking this should be a 100% kid friendly film because it's under the Disney banner and rated PG, think again. The final battle is pretty damn violent and the meeting between Aslan and The Witch is very disturbing and could frighten young children, it's also a very sad scene. Like I'm sure most people do I ignored all the Christian references and just enjoyed the film as it was, a great movie. On a scale of 10 I give The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a 10. One of the best films of the year."

In the last battle when those eagles are dropping those rocks on the bad guys and then when the cheetahs and the white tigers clash I was astonished that Disney made it.. i mean there was actually death in that movie it was great I loved seeing people die in a Disney movie for once... except for the animal no no no no Disney couldn't let the animal die Aslan got brutally stabbed in the chest while having his fur ripped of by the weirdest things ever and then he rotted on the stone pedastile overnight and then in the morning he is back with a full mane of fur and he charges to save Peter who's can't even kill a witch with a sword when she doesn't even have one but what made up for that was the fact that the lion basically ripped the witch's friggin head off I was in awe at the sit... i mean there gonna have to start making Disney movies rated R soon. And the other part that I didn't like was the fact that they had spent like 10 years in Narnia and they somehow couldn't remember the wardrobe which is probably the biggest thing that's ever happened to them in their entire lives and then they go through it and become kids again which I didn't like and I read the back to the other series books of Narnia and it doesn't even look like their about these kids but all together I give it a ten for the new actors and actresses performances and for the death and violence and how Santa gives them swords and potions and arrows (I wish that we had that Santa}."
"Zeltaebar","7","0","1","2 January 2006"," It's no Lord of the Rings, but still good
","OK, so it's no Lord of the Rings, but is it good? I dare say yes. There are several strong performances, especially from Georgie Henley and William Moseley as the children Lucy and Peter and the magnificent Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. The effects are mostly of good quality, but there are some imperfections and logical flaws. When the movie reached its climax I begun thinking ""Oh no, It's a lord of the rings rip-off, only in a lighter version..."" But then, to my surprise, the final battle was a breath-taking, well-directed and well-played epic encounter which will rate among the top ten screen battles of all times for years to come! (of course below such battle scenes as we remember from Lord of the Rings: Two Towers and Saving Private Ryan but still...) Narnia is great fun and will probably be even more fun for children. The religious symbols are very strong however, and this makes me dislike some parts of the original story (which I consider to be inferior to this film) Especially the parts concerning ""heavy magic"" and ""sacrifice"" are hard to swallow for non-Christians, but still... it's a good movie!"
"squirrel_scales","6","0","1","1 January 2006"," It was OK, but the graphics were spectacular
","I thought the movie was pretty average. I didn't think the acting was the greatest, the characters often look like they are smiling when they are supposed to be crying. This is understandable considering the age of the actors and actresses, but it is still somewhat distracting. It also seems sort of a quick and dirty version of the novel, putting in the major plot points and leaving out some of the much needed background.<br/><br/>That said, the visuals were simply amazing! When I saw the griffin about an hour and a half into the movie I was instantly satisfied with the time and the 6 dollars spent to see the movie. They were astounding, that is all I can say. The other mythical beasts were also well done, looking much as I had imagined them, and then some.<br/><br/>All in all I thought it was a rather good movie, but it could have been much better done."
"dcldan","8","0","1","1 January 2006"," Good film
","Well, this film has all the things needed to be a good one. A fantastic story that never bores, good acting (unexpected in kids), beautiful scenario and spectacular Special Effects ( I suppose that the Accademy should not forgot this film.<br/><br/>It remembers LOTR, which is not strange, due to their authors were good friends, but in a difference with Jackson film, it is much more optimistic and lighter (not so dark). There are some scenes that are really well done, like most of the battles and the introduction of the character of Aslan, which represents perfectly the good and firm authority.<br/><br/>In addition I 've been well impressed by the acting of the White Witch, because it is really good! Its a perfect antagonism of Aslan and exhales a so great loathing aura that results surprisingly terrifying. This is remarked in the battle, where we can see her riding a war chariot pulled by 2 enormous polar bears, it is simply, impressive (This is the most evocative view of the movie). Despite this quality, here are also some details to be improved. We can see all the kids fight in the battle with a great quality, as veteran warriors, when teorically is the first time they use a sword of a bow, and in addition, we never hear about training or something like that, This is not bad, but it's a little incoherent. In the battle, we can see lots of warriors fighting, and the kids, with heavy armours and shields, are too less big, compared with the rest of the people that result a little pathetic, specially Edmund, who is specially skinny. It refocus into the idea that they should not be there... Finally, and this is only for the Spanish version: Someone could have chosen a better voice for Edmund? He is very annoying and every time he talks, he seems a crying baby, if the voice was better chosen, the movie in Spain would have been better, I am sure. To sum up: a very good adventures film, similar to LOTR, with great Special Effects and very entertaining. However, some people can consider it a bit childish (it is no t as dark as LOTR), I hope there is the second part soon."
"stuartsw1","5","0","1","1 January 2006"," Shame about the music
","The best part of this film adaptation is the opening sequence, which gives a context to the story that is vital to its sensibility, as well as a few visuals (watch for the broken picture of the father). The photography is splendid; I wish this story could be told without CGI, but it can't, and that ruins some of the photography. The score, however, is mawkish, prescriptive, and sentimental, and comes close to killing the joy of the story itself. And who had the bright idea to commission something from Ms. Morrisette for the final credits? Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, whoever it was. This mania for getting pop stars to write anthems for large budget films must stop. It's damaging to both fields of endeavour."
"kiddb23","10","0","1","1 January 2006"," Lovely!
","I fell in love with this adaptation of the book and was so relieved that the hype over it wasn't in vain. From start to finish it was captivating, with the characters, the musical themes, and the special effects pulling people into a world that literally and figuratively left stars in my eyes. The film carried on the major themes that made the book so popular--family and fraternity, the power of belief, betrayal and then forgiveness, sacrifice, and ultimately, the triumph over evil. If anything was left out or improvised, it was enhancing and not damaging--like the broadened role of the fox in the film. The Talking Beasts were endearing (my six-year-old-niece actually asked, ""Do all foxes have that voice? Can we go see the one in the zoo?"") and I appreciate the voice actors as much as the actual ones. There were a few details that I did take note of that made me wonder (it's funny--it's mostly about hair color! :D Like, isn't Edmund supposed to be the fair-haired one? And the White Witch supposedly has dark hair, or did I look at the wrong illustration?), though at the end of the film the changes hardly mattered.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to any and everybody. If you haven't read the book this is the best screen adaptation yet, and if you have then this film won't disappoint you."

","This movie is definitely worth seeing. It was great opening night and it was great the last day of the year.(cheers everybody) This is a movie that i recommend for those who have read the books to go and see, it is a very accurate portrayal of what C.S. Lewis spoke about in his legendary books. This series is one in which i will read to my children the stories of Aslan, Susan, Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and even Mr. Tumnus :) I am not really the type to go see movies in theaters but when certain movies come around i go and see them. well this was one of those movies, and twice at that.(tells you the quality of the movie) anyway. The visuals are a blend between reality and what computers are good at creating. The audio is perfectly tuned for the scenes, silent when serious and funny, and loud for transitional periods. Overall this is definitely the best movie I've seen in a while, and i look forward to seeing more of Narnia recreated and perfected from what i imagined."
"celinelovesyou","3","0","4","31 December 2005"," Where has all the magic gone?
","I think this movie's success is based mostly on people's love and nostalgia for the story and the book, rather than anything else. Although the special effects are very decent, the finished product seems half-hearted and childish - by which I mean it seems childishly executed. The young actors' performances are painful to watch at the best of times - in places I found some of the kids are down right annoying to be honest. For those who do not know the story well, and those a little older than 6 years old, it's really quite hard relating to the characters - the most endearing ones are probably the beavers and you don't see enough of them! Other family movies in the magical genre such as the Potter movies, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, have set a seriously high standard and for the Narnia movie, comparisons will be inevitable - unfortunately there's no way this film is in the same league. A real shame."
"lndc98","3","0","4","31 December 2005"," Time Capsule Containing Dated Material
","What if you opened a time capsule and everything in it was just boring? For me, this Narnia story had a very dated atmosphere and affect. I have a sense that C.S. Lewis really strained to create the story because it is full of clichés (for example, children becoming kings and talking beavers), but ultimately conveys no emotion or awe and even contains no humor. In this sense, it is quite different from ""The Lord of the Rings"" which, in all its extravagance, arises out of a story tradition invested with emotionally realistic concerns and content. The Narnia film is really a children's' film. Probably, children will absolutely love it, and I think that some adults will love it because their children do. I give it a ""3"" because of the visuals."
"rkjs689","5","0","2","31 December 2005"," Ummm ill stick with LOTR
","This new adaptation based on the book by C.S. lewis isn't really translated well here. The film (even though it was around 2 hours 40) felt very rushed, for example the big epic battle scene just ends when the Ice Queen woman gets her face bitten of by a Lion and then all the fighting stops and thats it. Another example is where a big thing is made of the kids receiving their weapons but Susan shoots about one arrow in the battle. Also at the start one minute we are in the Blitz in London next minute were through the wardrobe.<br/><br/>The characters are also not very developed for example the beavers are featured more than the Ice Queen and Susan (one of the sisters) hardly says anything. The children's acting is embarrassing Liam Neeson does do a good job voicing Aslan the lion though.<br/><br/>The directing isn't too bad and some interesting shots are used. The CGI is also top notch but with this the film makers forgot about the story.<br/><br/>This is definitely one for kids or people who like to look at pretty things rather than a real film."
"pultron","6","0","1","31 December 2005"," Disappointed
","I myself was really disappointed in this movie. Not because of bad acting or bad CG. The whole story was cheesy, yes it was. It was overly much Disney, seen this before with just a different setting. What made it different was because it was based on a book I didn't read.<br/><br/>The bad things; - Huge mighty battle's and not a single blood drop? I mean, why pull down the violence in a war? I guess Disney wanted to earn a couple of more bucks making the movie from 11 years age instead of 15. - The movie could be 'read' by a 11 year old. I can accept that a movie should be able to build up tension and people should be able to expect a lot of things because of implantation's (right word?) in the movie but things as the 'one drop medicine' explained several scenes before they were even shown. - Everything with the CG was great except the animation in some parts. I don't say that I can do it better (I never will) but sometimes the flow was 'too much'. I mean, every movement was too smooth. Not smooth frame-wise, just how they moved. Sometimes people and animals do stiff movements....<br/><br/>The good things; - Great render of CG, it really was. - The fake snow didn't look too fake for once! - The actors did a really great job. - Scenes, lighting and camera angles were well executed, at least for me.<br/><br/>That's what I though of it."

I saw a lot of classic scenes, the hero on a white horse, the wicked witch of the west trying to take over a kingdom, the snitch who was forgiven, the good wise character offering himself for sacrifice for the snitch...and so on. I thought that Lord of the Rings had set a standard (clearly for me it really did), and movie makers had learned a lesson from Peter Jackson.

However I thought it was simply yet another typical Hollywood big budget production, they've taken a classic children's story and made it into the trendy Harry Potter meets Lord of the Rings - the result...nothing we've not seen before. On the plus side, the actress who plays Lucy was excellent and in fact I feel she carried the other, not so talented actors (adults and children).

"Robert_duder","10","0","1","28 December 2005"," One of the greatest Fantasy Epics of all time!!
","To describe this film as beautiful doesn't even to begin to explain what it encompasses. The world that C.S. Lewis created in words comes to life in a vision that is just drop dead gorgeous. For me Chronicles of Narnia was so brilliant and epically told and was not made with just children in mind but rather for everyone. The actors in the film do an incredible job of going from mere children to heroes of this magical world. Although you might think that they would have rushed it (trying to fit everything from the book into the film) everything fits together so nicely and flows at a terrific pace considering the 2 1/2 hour time frame. It felt like an hour!! Chronicles of Narnia just stuns you and keeps you completely riveted to this fairly tale like world and story. While it is dark enough to keep you enthralled it has this wonderful spiritual undertone, the exact way in which I believe Lewis had envisioned his books and the film makers actually managed to keep that feel alive. It doesn't try to hide the spiritual significance that likely some won't get but those who are looking will still find it.<br/><br/>Newcomer Georgie Henley who plays the youngest and the first to discover Narnia is a delight to watch. She's adorable and has some terrific expressions and moments in the film. She will for certain be a familiar face in films to come. William Moseley who plays the oldest, protective brother Peter also does a great job of becoming the knight and protector of Narnia. Anna Popplewell as the eldest sister also does a great job. I must admit I was not an ""Edmund"" fan. That was the youngest brother. I know he was meant to have a bit of a mean streak in him but I never quite thought that Skandar Keynes performed as well as the other children in the film. But he couldn't possibly bring it down. Tilda Swinton plays the evil White Witch and plays a brilliant adversary to the Children and to Aslan and it's no small mention that her sheer image added to her character. She was downright disturbing to look at!! She is most certainly a memorable villain in film history.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Adamson who, up until now, has been telling his fairy tales on the animated screen front with Shrek and Shrek II performs his greatest film to date with this remarkable creation. This is absolutely sure to be an instant classic that will exist forever. The absolutely amazing CGI creations of animals and the voices that went with them created such amazing and real characters. The Beavers, the fox, and of course the incredible Aslan himself (voiced by Liam Neeson.) They created and treated Aslan like he was meant to be...a true King. From his introduction, to his death, to his resurrection, it was all done with such reverence. Normally not a CGI fan, but I wasn't bothered by the beautiful CGI creations in this film. The Battles in the film, no matter how ""toned down"" were still magnificent and thrilling and still not for the younger viewers as they still managed to be more than a little violent although in the end all the good live again with the help of a magic potion given to Lucy by none other than Santa Clause himself (although he is never named as such.) The film is just such a brilliant fairy tale, beautiful and enthralling and will draw you in for the 2 hours and never take a breath. You could watch this a million times over and never get bored. I think this is one of the best adventure films I have ever seen!! The ending for me was almost a little too cutesy but this truly is meant to be a wholesome, touching film much like C.S. Lewis intended his stories to be I am sure. You must see this, alone or with your family, it's beautiful!! 10/10"

","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was way too fast paced and movie did not really get deep into minds of main characters. Movie did not explain characters' reactions or decisions very well, hence not answering the question 'why?'. It is a huge mistake especially in this case, when there really are the right answers: in the book. Of course it is good to give the viewer a chance to think by him/herself, but when this is done and characters for first time act unrealistically or dramatically other way than the viewer thought they would do, movie becomes something that viewer considers... stupid.<br/><br/>As a whole, it was not a bad movie. It only was too quick one. Main actors performed well.<br/><br/>Animation was nice, though Aslan sometimes looked more like a cat from Pixar movie, rather than being a photo-realistic lion."
"heathscott","10","0","2","28 December 2005"," Powerful Truth to those who can see
","Why are people so upset about the Biblical content? C.S. Lewis was a Christian and it is his intent to have the Biblical Parallel. How can people be so offended by the fact that God loves them enough to die for them? Obviously religion has messed it up... let's make it straight... the religious powerhouse is not what Christianity is all about... forget the dos and don'ts and all that power hungry garbage. Just remember... God loved you while you hated Him (just like Aslan and Edmund)... enough to pay your penalty with His blood to spare yours. More than that... to have you at His side in the ruling of His Kingdom. Let love take you in... you'll begin a wondrous journey! Don't ask religion about God... ask God... and read the Bible for yourself:-<br/><br/>Ephesians 2:1-10 From Death to Life:<br/><br/>In the past you were dead because you sinned and fought against God. You followed the ways of this world and obeyed the devil. He rules the world, and his spirit has power over everyone who doesn't obey God. Once we were also ruled by the selfish desires of our bodies and minds. We had made God angry, and we were going to be punished like everyone else. <br/><br/>But God was merciful! We were dead because of our sins, but God loved us so much that he made us alive with Christ, and God's wonderful kindness is what saves you. God raised us from death to life with Christ Jesus, and he has given us a place beside Christ in heaven. God did this so that in the future world he could show how truly good and kind he is to us because of what Christ Jesus has done. You were saved by faith in God, who treats us much better than we deserve. This is God's gift to you, and not anything you have done on your own. It isn't something you have earned, so there is nothing you can brag about. God planned for us to do good things and to live as he has always wanted us to live. That's why he sent Christ to make us what we are"

I think over all the movie works but there are some minor problems with it. Such as acting. The acting for the most part was OK there was not really a stand out performance. Just a bunch of kids doing poorly. The effects though were awesome as was the great battle at the end (which I really enjoyed.) It is a great family movie (more so then the new Harry Potter or King Kong) and I think that is one main factor as to why this will ultimately do good at the box office.

","I just finished watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and I must say I came out feeling a bit let down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that I'm grown up and therefore expect more than a children's story. And don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film - but like I said, it's for children only(unlike the Harry Potter films which can be enjoyed by both children AND adults, including yours truly). And certain parts of the film reminded me too much of The Lord of the Rings, especially the battle sequences. Even some of the creatures in this film seem to come straight out of The Lord of the Rings (this isn't all too surprising if you know that WETA, the company that did the visual effects for The Lord of the Rings, also did it for this film). Overall, a 6 out of 10. Hopefully the next one will be more interesting and adult-pleasing."

The others seemed a little two dimensional. The beavers made everyone in the audience laugh.

"almonetts","8","0","1","26 December 2005"," A beautiful, yet flawed realization of a classic tale.
","Directed by Andrew Adamson; starring Tilda Swinton, Jim Broadbent, Georgie Henley and others; and based on the beloved classic series by C.S. Lewis.<br/><br/>I distinctly recall the controversy generated the day it was announced that this film was going to be made, knowing fully well that C.S. Lewis' believed that his material would have been reduced to laughs in the face of limited technology. However, it is pleasing to report that his concern takes a back seat. <br/><br/>The story focuses on the Pevensie siblings (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) who are sent away to a reclusive and odd scholar in the countryside, to escape the perils of war. As typical kids, they wander around the house, trying best to entertain themselves. A game of hide and seek eventually sees the youngest (Lucy) going into a wardrobe, which transports her to the land of Narnia. Immediately, the the audience is besieged by a beautiful wintry Zion of sorts and a host of colorful characters which populate the landscape. However, as we come to learn there is a reason by the land is in a perpetual state of winter and there is a prophecy held to be the truth across the land, involving the children. Narnia, is ruled by a wicked witch (played with such imaginative flair and passion, it's disconcerting). Tilda Swinton, again proves her mettle and is terrific in the role. The kids form alliances with several species (all talking animals of sorts) and come quickly to accept their respective roles and seek an audience with Aslan (the Lion) to assist in what quickly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br/><br/>I must admit in reading the books, I only caught onto the Christian themes very late (towards the very end of the first book). The movie dramatizes this to great yet still limited extent. Additionally, whilst the cast is led by the omnipresent Swinton, the kids (relatively new to screen) do not appear to remain in character from time to time. The strongest of the young cast is Edmund, a character that many would love to hate. Although his transfiguration on film is slowly progressive, we never really appreciate why he is that way; something which the book beautifully captures. This is one such ""lost in translation"" moments. Notably though, there are times when fans of the series can hear the beautiful words of Lewis captured on screen. Those who were also attracted by the distinctive British sensibility of the series, will also be a tad disappointed. <br/><br/>On the effects side, there are some really odd moments where you can easily discern ""blue screen effects"". One might wonder, that Director Adamson, would have done well enough to simply leave those scenes out. However, on the other hand, his deft helming of both Shrek movies, does give him a great foundation to produce the magic he finds on occasion. <br/><br/>While the movie never quite reaches epic proportions or cannot really be considered standard kiddie-fare, it does maintain a sense of wonderment and charm, which worked so well within the primary source material. Despite its flaws, the film is a beautiful realization of a classic tale and gives hope to the future development of the series for the big screen."
"profschiler-1","10","0","1","26 December 2005"," Well done, classic story with excellent production values.
","This is primarily a children's story and is an assemblage of disjointed images, each of which is appealing in its own regard and which eventually forms a sympathetic storyline. It is also, of course, allegory, which is annoying to many who like a strong political message in a movie, but object to any other kind of overlay. Nonetheless, the movie is extremely well done in retelling a story by C. S. Lewis in a manner that enjoys the textures and imagery instead of trying to come up with a new interpretation. Watch it and enjoy it. It will be a classic long after Kill Bill (and Kill Bill 2) have faded from memory. Sacrifice and redemption are at least as interesting as revenge and ruthlessness and much more appropriate fare for young people and refreshing for jaded adults, as well. Furthermore, thought they are Christian themes, they are certainly not ONLY Christian themes."

There was one noteworthy performance in the movie, its only bright spot actually, and that was Tilda Swinton and her turn as the White Witch.

","London is in turmoil during the war, with the Pevensie family abandoning their home. The four children; Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy are sent off to live with Professor Kirke. The house keeper Mrs. MacReady has strict rules, with the children finding it a very dull place. During a game of hide and seek, Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to another world; the world of Narnia. Soon Lucy meets a faun Mr. Tumnus, inviting her to tea and and reveals the implications of her presence. Lucy returns through the wardrobe to tell the others, with a lot of disbelief. Lucy unable to make the others believe, during the night goes back through, with Edmund not far behind. On Edmunds arrival, he accidentally meets the White Witch, who is eager to meet the rest of his siblings. Soon Lucy and Edmund have Peter and Susan in Narnia, but with their presence, Narnia is about to change. When two beavers take them into protection, they tell the Pevensies that there is a prophecy that foretells that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will come to Naria and end the eternal winter, ending the rule of the White Witch. On Edmunds meeting of the Witch, she promised him glory, so Edmund runs off to her castle. When the Witch is alerted to their presence, she keeps Edmund captive and sends off her wolves to kill the other Penvensies. With the three children needing help to save Edmund, they ask help from Aslan, the lion who once ruled Naria. Willing to help them, Aslan leads them and an army to fight back for the rule of Naria.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a magical, captivating film. As Lewis and Tolkien were contemporaries of their time and friends, its hard not to see similarities to The Lord of the Rings. Yet once you past this tiny stone, your transported into a world that is wholly different to Middle Earth. The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is more of a children's version of Lord of the Rings, yet it doesn't fall into the trap of being solely a children's movie. There are adults who have read these books and this is raised so it captures the adults inner child, while bringing a new generation of children into this celebrated book.<br/><br/>The World of Naria is a broad, sweeping place that is magnificently brought to the screen. The heavy winter snow of the forest and the plains are so captivating, that you get distracted by them. When the snow melts away you find a bright and warm world being released from the cold. The creatures of Narnia are a wonderful array of fairytale creatures and modern animals. Whats great is that Andrew Adamson didn't rely so heavily on CGI to create the creature; using a lot of puppetry in the mix to make a more realistic feel. Aslan is wonderfully created, perfectly integrated with a high level of realism.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson has done a huge leap from directing computer animated films, to the live action. While Adamson is great on the computer animated films, there are times his direction seemed to drop, as it is very different directing live action to CA. Though it only drops a few times, he has done a wonderful job at bringing this world of Narnia to life. His directing abilities really shine during the battle sequence, bring his eye of detail out. The battle was a spectacular sequence, with all the creatures doing battle. The acting was one of the weaker elements of the film. The four lead children while doing good jobs, didn't reach a performance that emotionally grabbed you. Though Georgie Henley as Lucy really takes your heart, she has so much talent for such a young girl. Tilda Swinton was really cold hearted as the White Witch, though i felt she could have gone further and brought an even more menacing performance, where ever word she said was just tainted with coldness. The voice talent of the creatures was also great. Ray Winstone and Dawn French do great jobs as Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe does fall short on the epic grandeur that it was aiming for, yet it doesn't fall short of a wonderful family movie that will captivate your imagination and bring that inner child back to life."

","Acting: Knowing that they spent several years looking for the right children for the main characters, it doesn't really come as a surprise that they're all amazing actors although in most of the cases if not all, this is the first thing they've ever done. Wonderful performances from all of them. As Lucy is the character that first leads us into Narnia though, it is the part they just had to get right for the movie to work. Georgie Henley does a great job of portraying the sense of magic this story is all about and you really see it in her eyes as she stumbles into the land of a 100 years of winter. All the voice actors also do truly remarkable things with their roles and Liam Neason did a surprisingly effective job with Aslan. It's a sad thing we never get to hear Brian Cox do the voice, but Neason is such a professional and as it turns out he is perfect for the role. I have to mention James Mcavoy as Tumnus also as he gives life to some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Tilda Swinton, doing the white witch Jadis as only she could have done, is now rightfully circling around in ""for your consideration"" ads. Give her an Oscar will you!? <br/><br/>Directing: SomehowAndrew Adamson was always the right way to go with this one as he's just as big a fan of the books as everyone reading this review. He really pulled it off, and made this into one of the best films of all time, one that will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>Digital Effects: I'm running out of superlatives here. This is some of the best, if not THE best work in visual effects history to this date. You just can't get a higher grade when you're making the audience watching the animals talk, not only believe that they're real, but also not thinking about that they're computer generated characters. This way, instead of concentrating on how lifelike the characters look, you can concentrate on what the character says and thus experience the full performance of the actor doing the voice. The voices, combined with the state of the art VFX makes these creatures, through the books already loved by hundreds of millions of people around the world, REALLY come to life. Watching Aslan walk among his people is like going to the Zoo looking at a real life animal. It looks that realistic. This is the movie upon people will be judging all future work done in visual effects.<br/><br/>Music: Being a fan of the 80's BBC TV series it made me a bit nervous the first time i was about to hear Harry Gregson Williams score. I mean, Geoffry Burgon's main theme for the TV series had since my childhood always been close to my heart. I was not to be disappointed though as the score for this film is so much more epic in scale than even Howard Shore's Lord of The Rings outings. It is every bit as magical as Narnia itself. This score shines in it's full glory in the most important of scenes. From entering the Wardrobe, meeting Tumnus and playing the Narnian lullaby to going into full battle with the white witch this is an epic score to be remembered. It is also already nominated for a golden globe together with one for best song.<br/><br/>Adaptation: The changes made for adapting the book into a film all come off natural and nothing ever seem out of place or order, they enhance the value of the film. The most notable scenes added being the conversation between Edmund and Tumnus in the dungeon and being attacked by Maugrim and friends on the frozen river. These are both so great and so well directed that they seem like they were written by the hand of C.S. Lewis himself. As for adding a touching opening of war-struck London and making the end battle longer and more exciting than in the book (and in your imagination) well that's something i think no one would argue with. Of course it had to be done. It is as natural as making the girls more active in the battle scenes. Some of the dialog in the scenes with Tumnus seemed a bit too modern the first time i saw it though, but i kind of liked it the second and third time i saw it.<br/><br/>Costumes: From the 40'ish clothes worn by the kids to all the armor worn i battle this film has it all. It really shows that they spent just as much time and effort on detail for this to come alive as they did in the lord of the rings productions. But it's done by the same people at Weta, so that is a given.<br/><br/>Makeup/Prosthetics: KNB FX? Ever ever heard of these guys? Of course you have, these guys are legends. The makeup and prosthetics for this film is every bit as groundbreaking as the visual effects. Howard and co. i know you wanted the centaurs in this film to be the centaurs upon all centaurs will be judged. Well you've done it! The same goes with all the other creatures.<br/><br/>End grade for this film is 10 out of 10 as it is the best film i have ever seen, and i would like to say that i hope the academy recognizes this as such, but as they generally go for drama in the best picture category it feels like kind of a stretch. However Return of the king got nominated and i think it's only true to say that The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe has every bit as much drama as that film."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","2","25 December 2005"," Does not compare to Lord Of the Rings or Harry Potter
","Andrew Adamson, the director (Shrek) should stick to animated films. The Chronicles of Narnia is a very limp film in his hands. The first hour of the film crawls at a snail's pace. The four children have to carry the film but they aren't interesting enough to do it. One plot point of the book is that the younger boy, Edmund, becomes bound to the White Witch and has to redeem himself in the end, but in this film all he does is accept some Turkish delight (candy) from the witch. Big deal. I thought the four kids were very unappealing.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is a battle after we meet Aslan, the lion, voiced by Liam Neeson who sounds exactly like Liam Neeson and to my ears I could never get past that.<br/><br/>It's fair to compare this film to other movies in the genre, namely the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter films. Narnia lacks the magical touches of Potter and the epic vision of LOTR."

"aehend","7","0","1","24 December 2005"," beautiful, great acting, soulless
","I'm a Narnia fan (have re-read all the books every 2 years or so for fifteen years now) and went to the movie excitedly and open-mindedly. It's hard to satisfy fans who know the stories so well and love them as they are: but Peter Jackson completely satisfied me with Lord of the Rings, despite the changes he'd made. So I was hopeful.<br/><br/>I was very struck, as others have posted, by how beautifully-made the film was. The acting and voices, too, were superb, as were all the effects and props. Yet I am completely dissatisfied.<br/><br/>Why? It seems the ""soul"" has been excised from the story. Why did the director (or screenwriter) make so many bloody changes that seemed to contribute nothing to the story, or even detract? For instance, why was Aslan's ""children why are you following me"" line changed to ""shouldn't you be in bed""? That seems a definite unimprovement, and was echoed by many other changes. Was Disney's PC squad on the loose, cutting out anything that seemed too religious? Regardless of the cause, all the deep spirituality and gravitas--the things which made the books spellbinding (and I'm not even a Christian, but rather a Baha'i)--have been removed or changed. Meanwhile, much angst was added that wasn't in the original story, such as Peter's repeated squeamishness, and all the too-dwelled-upon sibling stuff. And then the gorgeous Narnia that was created, including special new touches such as the phoenix, was flashed too briefly before our eyes.<br/><br/>I think this movie sapped the soul out of Narnia, despite the brilliant work done by nearly everyone involved. The culprits seem to have been story-monkeying, and a failure to allow us to experience what is truly enthralling about the Narnia story, including a failure to allow us to dwell long enough in what of Narnia had been brilliantly created.<br/><br/>Alas, with a salute to the acting, cinematography, and rendering, I sigh and go back to the books. The door is still open for someone to capture Narnia. I hope that by ""The Voyage of the Dawn-Treader"" and ""The Last Battle"" someone gets it right. Put the soul back in. It's not Christian, it's spiritual, and please leave it that way, gravitas intact."

I think even if you haven't read the books before you will still find the movie to be good, and you may even want to start reading the books. I hope that all of C. S. Lewis's books will be made into movies because I'm looking forward to them and sure they will be a great hit. The movie has a really good plot. It gets you really interested in it. It is very adventurous and exciting. Once you start watching you wont want to get up and leave for anything.

","This movie was amazing. I recommend this to anyone. The story takes place around the time of WWII. Showing the Germans bombing of England. Parent heartbreakingly having to send their children into the country to keep them safe. The scene at the train station was done very well. I heard many of the women weeping in the audience. The children arriving in the country really showed the difference between the bombed out imagery & the quiet countryside. Very well done. The imagery in Narnia was breathtaking, the acting was superb & the plot made sense. My family saw this & King Kong. We all decided unanimously that this was a much better film. The little girl was spectacular. Her eyes were so expressive many times they told the story. The Queen was evil but beautiful a perfect casting. Azlan really took your breath away. The detail on all the animals was done to such detail you weren't sure which was really & which were not. I would not miss this beautifully done drama. Take your family & watch with amazement."
"jdrogus","5","0","2","23 December 2005"," Narnia, for who?
","The special effects were great. The talking animals were the most real I've ever seen on the screen. Their facial features were fluid even when they talked--without being ""over-animated."" By far the best role in the movie was the White Witch (Swinton was a near perfect match for Jadis). <br/><br/>HOWEVER <br/><br/>WHAT audience is this movie for?! Certainly not for children due situations like the uncannily LOTR-like ""orks"" fighting on behalf of the White Witch. Anyone with a child under the age of nine or ten could not possible watch this movie comfortably as a result of the child's burying his or her head into their lap or asking to leave because its ""so scary."" Those ""orks"" are pretty damn scary and considering that 3/4 of the theater I was sitting in was filled with families of this nature got to be really annoying. Should they know better? How can they not?! We have come to be a slightly leery of Disney productions due to its more mature pieces such as Pirates of the Caribbean and what not and so that was not the issue. The issue is when McDonalds starts making happy meal toys out of it. Promotions such as these are what makes little kids come see the movie and get the crap scared out of them. However, once again, WHO were these people supposed to market for? There is no blood, the fight scenes exist but they are cheesed up so as not to scare a younger audience. This detracts from any sort of realistic experience of Narnia that a reader and rather avid fan of the book such as myself would hope to achieve through seeing this movie. Obviously it is exclusively for readers of Lewis' actual Chronicals. Anyone who has not read the book has no idea what they are in for and essentially sits through a movie of the little rascals meets LOTR and wind in the willows. Granted, anyone who knows Lewis' Christian motives understands that the events and characters all have deep and heavy symbolism attached to them. However, even for fans of the books,there were too many loose ends not covered in the film. A prime example is when Aslan is ""sacrificed"" on the stone altar. Obviously a crucifixion reference. However, he just gets up and changes the rules without there being the slightest hint or reference that there were so many intricate ""rules"" of Narnia that could be changed or reinterpreted to begin with. There were some glossings over but no one, especially as an outsider to the book would really know what was going on.<br/><br/>As I said before the best part in the entire movie was done by the White Witch. The children themselves were not marketable in acting skills or in looks. Bravo on the voice of Aslan, Liam Neeson was a perfect choice. The set, of course, was beautiful and the costumes were superb as well. I loved the faun. McAvoy was perfect for the role. I do not recommend going to the theater to see this movie. At best, I can see myself one day showing it to by ten year old when he or she is sick in bed with the flu and slightly too delirious off of Nyquil to piece all of the film together anyhow. That is quite possibly the only audience who could gain full satisfaction from this work."

","There really couldn't have been a worse time for 'The Chronicles of Narnia ' to be released in theaters in my opinion. It was released right on the tale of the much more elaborate 'King Kong' which will no doubt beat the hell out of it with box-office numbers. I really didn't know what to expect from 'Chronicles of Narnia'. In my mind it could have either been a really great action-packed, visually stunning film or it could have been a childish sappy-as-hell flop. Well, my thoughts after leaving the movie theater playing 'Chronicles of Narnia' were somewhere in between, but closer to the positive. 'Chronicles of Narnia' has real excellent special effects and action, but in a way the film takes itself way too seriously. There are parts so sappy they make you feel almost embarrassed to be in the theater, but there are parts so amazing from a visual effects stance that you can't take your eyes away from the screen. Although there are parts of 'Narnia' I didn't really get into it, I enjoyed it for the most part.<br/><br/>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' takes place during WWII. Four children, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skander Keyes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley), are transported out of England to safety to live with their Uncle the professor (Academy Award Winner Jim Broadbent - Iris). While staying with their Uncle, the kids discover a passage way to another ice-covered fantasy world (Narnia) in a old wardrobe closet. In the land the it is up to the four to save the good guys led by a gigantic, fierce yet wise and lovable lion, Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) from the evil White Witch who calls herself the Queen (Tilda Swinton - The War Zone, Broken Flowers). The film also features a lovable beaver who helps the kids (voiced by Ray Winstone - The War Zone, Sexy Beast), Father Christmas or Santa Claus who also helps the kids (James Cosmo - Trainspotting) and Mr. Tumnus, a half-man/half-goat (played by James McAvory).<br/><br/>Like I had mentioned previously the action and effects in Narnia are amazing to say the least, but the story kind of drags. I felt in my heart that the beloved children's story could have been adapted to film better script-wise. The acting is kind of a mixed bags. The adult actors are all fantastic - Jim Broadbent, Tilda Swinton, Liam Neeson, Ray Winstone and James McAvory, but the kids kind of split. Skander Keyes and Georgie Henley are the two-standouts of the kids who both give great performances, while the two older kids William Moseley and Anna Popplewell are to put it nicely ""less impressive"". Andrew Adamson's direction is surprisingly very good, with a lot of neat camera tricks and cinematography.<br/><br/>If you are into the action / fantasy films I can recommend 'Chronicles of Narnia', but only after you've seen the modern-day masterpiece King Kong (also in theaters). 'Narnia' is a film to take the little ones to and I don't find anything wrong with it that wouldn't be appropriate for kids 5 and up. Grade: B- (screened at Harkins Arrowhead 18, Glendale, Arizona, 12/19/05)"

","This truly was one of the most phenomenal movies of 2005. The acting, story, and special effects were GREAT. I saw it twice in the theaters, and hope to get the DVD, as soon as it comes out. There is also a video game, which I hope to get for Christmas.<br/><br/>First of all, I think the story was just unbelievable. The book isn't very descriptive, and the director and producers did a fabulous job illustrating the story and highlighting the main events. The color was unbelievable, and the length was perfect. The bombing scene at the beginning really gave the film a strong starting point. The story could have suited to be a bit more gory, but hey, how much blood and guts can you fill a PG movie with? Even for teenagers, the story was great.<br/><br/>The costumes and music were also great. The orchestra was wonderful, and the Narnia Lullaby was so pretty. The dresses and suits of armor that the Pevensie children wore was great. The cast selection was perfect. This was really a great movie."
"scullyfox","4","0","1","21 December 2005"," Disappointing
","I am a die hard Narnia fan so I am bound to be a little critical, but I went to see this film with an open mind as possible.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that the film doesn't even come close to the brilliant BBC series of some years ago, so if you watched and loved those you may be better off giving this film a miss and see if you can pick up a copy of the BBC version on DVD instead.<br/><br/>Positive points are the performances. I often find child actors a little too cutesy or unnatural, but there wasn't a moment I felt that during this film. Lucy Pevensie in particular was brilliant. Any stars I've given this are down to the cast.<br/><br/>Now the downers. This may not bother everyone, but the CGI effects were shoddy and inconsistent - as if the artists working on it had been comprised of a team of people who never met during the entire production. This was not quite as bad as the green/blue screen moments, however, which had all the artistry and subtlety of Peter Kay's Amarillo video. How on earth those scenes made the final cut, I'll never know. One particular scene has a painted backdrop which is similarly poorly finished, so it seems there were problems in many areas of production. It was like watching an unpolished version for a test audience - only it wasn't and we weren't.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this if clumsy continuity errors (of which there are too many to list here), poor attention to detail and bad computer work bother you. If not then the children's performances, Tumnus and Aslan will impress you and you may enjoy yourself. If you just adore the book and would love to see an on screen adaptation, try to get your mits on the BBC version."
"lyrabelacqua","5","0","1","21 December 2005"," Okay but not great (spoiler)
","I thought the ambiance was great, both before the children arrive in Narnia and after they get there; the casting of the children and other characters, looks-wise, was also excellent. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch was the best thing about the movie.<br/><br/>The efforts to provide psychological credibility were not convincing--perhaps the screenwriters should have focused on the plot and the pleasures Narnia offers, such as great food, more, as the books do. Peter and Susan were a bit wooden; Edmund and Lucy better. (May not be their fault--Edmund and Lucy have better parts.) Although much has been made about the decision to ""allow"" Susan to fight in the battle as an advance toward gender equality, I was bothered by the pervasively dismissive attitude toward women and the ""lesson"" that patriarchal order must be maintained at all costs. Mrs. Macready is needlessly bitchy; Susan is depicted as a whiner and a nag; Mrs. Beaver is insulted by her husband repeatedly and not acknowledged as the wonderful motherly and capable personality she is in the book--the books did not betray their misogyny so openly. Some of the things added to the plot, such as the direct pursuit of the children and the beavers by the WW and the entirely gratuitous icy river scene didn't do much for me; I wish, though, that more had been done connecting the beginning in London during the Blitz with the events in Narnia. <br/><br/>The conclusion was a bit choppy and too much time was spent on the battle, for my taste. Also too many echoes of Lord of the Rings (movie) there for it to feel original and independent."

There are several scenes I found quite irritating: First, the children get weapons from Santa Claus as Christmas presents. Secondly, in the Battle air raid is being applied as in ""real life"" - the Second World War.<br/><br/>Maybe this film is more suitable for kids and the American audience.<br/><br/>Acting was overall good.

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS (for the tiny minority who haven't actually read the books) <br/><br/>Even after seeing the impressive trailers for The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe over the past month or so, I still wasn't quite sure what to expect.<br/><br/>Were the kids going to be any good? Was New Zealand really going to be able to double up as Middle Earth AND Narnia? And could they really manage to stretch out a rather thin book into a two hour plus film? Thankfully, Andrew Adamson and the magicians with WETA have produced one of the best movies I've seen this year. And it's absolutely gorgeous. Although it lacks some of the grandeur of Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy, the results are actually much better at times - with Narnia becoming a more sumptuous, understated landscape than some of Tolkien's over-the-top world.<br/><br/>And, thankfully, the wonder of the book has been captured perfectly. The early scenes of the Pevensie children being evacuated from Blitz-hit London are heart-wrenching, while Lucy's first discovery of the world inside the wardrobe fills you with as much delight as you got when reading the book as a child. Then when the rest of the family discover Narnia as well....it just gets better and better.<br/><br/>Tilda Swinton is very good as the White Witch - displaying the right kind of frosty malevolence that the role deserves. Inspired casting has seen Ray Winstone and Dawn French provide the perfect voices for the beavers, while Liam Neeson lends more than enough gravitas to Aslan. And, thankfully, the kids are perfect choices for the roles. Instead of their slightly two dimensional counterparts on the Harry Potter series, the Pevensie clan are actually believable as unwilling visitors in Narnia. Peter and Susan are great as the elder siblings on the lookout for the younger sister and brother, while Lucy practically steals the movie at times. And it's nice to see that they managed to pick a suitably moody, sulky Edmund too.<br/><br/>A few minor quibbles aside (an American Maugrim for one, and the lack of real emotion during Aslan's sacrifice at the hands of the Witch), it's the kind of epic fantasy that was sorely missing last Christmas. At times emotional, beautiful and comical it's likely to delight young and old fans alike. Go and watch it."

","A very poor attempt at improvement for those of us old enough to enjoy the BBC version. My advice is read the book - the ""special"" effects aren't ""special"" (remember Blue Peter riding on Aslan?!?), and as with so many films they try to cram so much into such a short space of time that it becomes disjointed, loses all semblance of a story and becomes a producer's excuse to show off - which in this case pays off poorly. I can understand why it has received higher ratings: it is harmless, has morals and stirs up the warm glow inside all of us, but at the end of the day, it has been done better before (just not for cinema or DVD). Sometimes the beauty in the story is the understanding of the plot, of the weekly wait for the next installment, and the development of the characters; this film had none of these and I feel for all those people who rated it highly, as they had obviously missed out on the regular weekend episodes which chronicled Narnia when I was a child (And no, it wasn't that long ago, and yes, I didn't think I'd be catching myself writing those ""In my days...."" comments yet!)."

","""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" based on the C.S. Lewis novel has a long title, and is a great movie. It is one of the year's best. Director Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Adamson, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely bring to life Lewis's story of four children's journey to the fantastical kingdom of Narnia. This maybe Disney's ""Lord of the Ring""-- a wise selection. Director Adamson creates a visually stunning live action tale seamlessly incorporating state-of-the art CGI, and classic compelling storytelling. Adamson also keeps our focus on this story thread despite such distractions as talking animals and mythical creatures which are an integral part of the context.<br/><br/>During the beginning of World War II, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgia Henley), are sent to live with an eccentric relative Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) somewhere in the English countryside. Away from their mother, the children make the best of their situation. While playing their favorite game of hide-and-seek, the youngest Lucy enters the upstairs wardrobe, and finds herself in another world, Narnia. Lucy befriends Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun or half-man creature. From Mr. Tumnus, Lucy discovers that Narnia is ruled by the evil White Witch (the amazing Tilda Swinton) where it has been winter for 100 years without Christmas. Upon returning through the wardrobe, Lucy tells Peter, Susan, and Edmund. They do not believe her story. However, Edmund happens upon Narnia through the wardrobe, and aligns with the White Witch. The White Witch is aware of the prophesy involving the sons and daughters of Adam. Eventually Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all enter Narnia. They learn from Mr. and Mrs. Beaver that the White Witch's reign will soon end with the return of the legendary lion leader Asland (perfectly voiced by Liam Neeson).<br/><br/>Alsand is literally and metaphorically the messiah in C.S. Lewis's story. Edmund (Keynes), forced into loyalty to the White Witch, is the story's Judas. He betrays Peter, Susan, Lucy and ultimately Asland, unknowingly becoming the White Witch's pawn. The courageous and noble Asland gives his word to the malevolent White Witch in this epic battle of good and evil. Perhaps the difference in this parable, Adamson and Lewis offer the possibility of redemption for this story's Judas-- Edmund.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson is the great storyteller in ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" ""Narnia"" is an epic tale of sacrifice and redemption that beautifully captures the wonder and awe of children embodied in Lucy. Georgia Henley gives Lucy a great soul, innocence and courage. Her touching bond to the charismatic Asland (Neeson) is the heart of ""Narnia"". Tilda Swinton is a powerful dark presence as the White Witch. Swinton as the Witch is such a threatening force. Liam Neeson perfectly voices Asland. Neeson too is an amazing presence. His Asland is wise and noble, also hinting at great anger and great power. The clash of wills between Asland and the White Witch is compelling. Adamson's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is classic storytelling of a timeless story, well worth watching."

","This was a pretty awesome movie. They definitely should have put more Centaurs in it, though. It was cool to see a centaur fight a minotaur, but that was just at the big battle at the end. The whole movie should have been centaurs and minotaurs fighting. Centaurs are way cooler than little English kids. The lion, Azzlan, he was cool. The goat boy, portrayed by Justin Timberlake, was okay. The Ice Queen lady should take a shower, and use Pert Plus. This just proves that White Women with dreads are evil. Anyway, lots of ""blahhh"" stuff in this movie, with a few incredible fight scenes and tons of cool centaurs. ""King Kong"" is about 40,000 times better, so go see that instead.

","Very hard not to compare to LOTR and this just doesn't stand up to the comparison. Firstly in any medium this is much more of a child's tale than LOTR so perhaps the Disney treatment is more justified. But the translation to the big screen lacks a quality feel and Peter Jackson's direction, his dedication to the story in LOTR and to a quality product are nowhere to be seen. He really deserved the knighthood! So sadly we have wooden acting, 1 dimensional characterization, cheap special effects.<br/><br/>Looks like they did it for the money. Very sad.<br/><br/>C.S.

","I was so bummed when I finally saw this film. I had read the book as a child and absolutely was enthralled with it. I had wrongfully assumed that the movie would have that same kind of excitement and adventure for me. <br/><br/>The CGI was well done (Kong producers should have asked these guys for help!), the story was alright, the acting was exactly what I expected.<br/><br/>Story: My first question for the film would be...what in the world takes so LONG to get the story really moving? This IS the Chronicles of NARNIA right? Well I was afraid the actors would age on screen before my very eyes at the pace the first act was going. There was TOO MUCH (I know you don't hear that often) character development. I didn't ever think they were all going to get through the wardrobe. <br/><br/>Once they did the story picked up a little and it felt a little better from there. However it never had that adrenaline rush of excitement one usually gets from movies of this style.<br/><br/>As for the acting, hey they are kids, they did pretty darn good for kids. Not all kids are Dakota Fanning.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film only for families with children and for those who have not read the book. Why? Kids won't care that the acting is mediocre or that the first act moves like molasses. They will be happy with pictures of snow and hide and seek games. Why people who haven't read the book? Because if you have read the book you will be disappointed (assuming you have a pretty decent imagination) and if you haven't read the book and you are of adult age, you probably aren't going to read it now so you might as well see the movie."

"optisk","6","0","1","10 December 2005"," Enjoyable but not worth the hype
","After hearing my friends rave about this movie, i had to watch it for myself. Sadly though... the movie was reasonably enjoyable, but some what disappointing in my opinion. Firstly, the beginning of the film was far to lengthy and boring. How the kids happen to stumble upon the wardrobe is tedious to say the least. Over elaboration of the stupid games played, and how they all FINALLY end up in the closet can really bore people. Thankfully, the movie picks up pace and the cute animals are humorous and realistic. However, my major qualm about the film is it fails to remain sensible or logical in its own right. Even though The Matrix and The LOTR were far fetched stories, the plot was logical and believable.... On the other hand, this story is just basically random. The 4 ""heros"" actually didn't do much in the entire story. It was Aslan who gathered the troops, it was aslan who killed the ice queen, and all they were, were props! The girl only shot ONE arrow in the battle... Them being called kings and queens really doesn't make sense. Neo could do anything, frodo the ring bearer.... but these 4... nothing! Well, all was not lost considering that the final battle was rather enjoyable but still abit short. LOTR like CG for the final battle. One thing that i found astounding was that Aslan could just resurrected just because the ice queen didn't read the fine print..... overall, moderately enjoyable, but somewhat lacking in many ways....."

","Disney has proved time and time again that they can make the best children's movies. Over the past couple of years they have began to make adult movies (Pirates of the Caribbean, National Treasure) and now finally they have made a movie that children and adults can both watch together and both truly enjoy watching. The movie is rated PG and was obviouslly meant to be so, it could've easily been made a PG-13, but the books were written for children so the correct decision was made to make the movies for children as well. This movie could easily be ""The Lord of the Rings for Kids"". Both authors (C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien) were very good friends so it seems fitting that both of them would write two of the greatest stories ever, with one directed toward kids and the other toward adults. Being that this movie was PG, only the main evil character was developed, unlike Lord of the Rings where the extreme ""evilness"" of the orcs were brought out as well as Sauruman and Sauron's. The battle was done very well with enough action included to make fans of action movies happy, there were very few scenes, if any, where any one character gets completely destroyed, as there were in the epic Lord of the Rings' battles. All in all, the story was done nicely there was not, however, any attempt to explain how the wardrobe could do what it did or how it came into the professor's possession. I am told that the book does explain this. Overall a good movie for people of all ages to enjoy."
"asm65","8","0","1","12 December 2005"," Well done efforts pay off, I hope the next one is better
","Briefly, this is a good film, and a film that should do well with the audience and the box office. And, for more detailed reviews, please read the many others written by users here at IMDM.<br/><br/>Up front, I do recommend this movie, and I think it's well worth seeing, but it's not without its flaws.<br/><br/>And I think the flaws have to do with two things: Direction, and animation. The animation is of course superb, life changing, record setting, and all that, like so many reviewers are writing - but being truly critical, there are places here and there where it just doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm asking too much, and maybe if this film had been delayed a few years the problems for the animators would not have existed. To the point, in many scenes, just as I was relaxing into the scene, and really ""suspending disbelief"" and buying the scene, some character would move funny, and unnaturally, and that made the experience less than perfect - Sort of like trying to relax on a long drive, but every few hundred yards there's the unsettling feel and sound of another pothole, followed by easing back into relaxation until....wham ! another pothole. I started to look for flaws, which really isn't my nature, but it's what happened.<br/><br/>As for direction....for one, Andrew Adamson is a superb talent, but I have to report what I saw, and how I felt. And I'll do this by comparing the human acting in this film to that of Shadowlands, a film I admire greatly.<br/><br/>In Shadowlands, it all felt so real. Of course having Debra Winger and Tony Hopkins as centerpieces didn't hurt any. The Warnie character was superb as well. Compare that acting to some in this film - the Professor, the little ogre that was always around the white witch, Mrs. MacReady.....just a little overdone, I think, and unconvincing. Each time they were on the screen, I kept thinking their makeup etc. looked more like Little Theater than major Film. In Shadowlands, I felt drawn into the characters, and I especially admired the sensitivity, mannerisms, and believability of the Douglas Gresham character.<br/><br/>Funny enough, each of the four children characters in this film (Narnia) also, at times did this for me, especially the Lucy character, but in many cases when most or all of them were together, it just felt staged. And of course it was staged - this is film and they were acting. I just wish it hadn't been so obvious.<br/><br/>And I think all this added up to one feeling overall for me....the movie dragged rather than flowed in many parts, and that alone takes away from this being a top notch film in its own right. It will succeed with many people, and at the box office, and it was a very admirable job at bringing the book to film, but if this is to succeed as a franchise and live up to its potential, I think it needs to be viewed with the criticisms that I and several others have pointed out."

This movie well exceeded my expectations with seamless graphics and a stringent script which stayed directly with the novel version. I was amazed by the unknown acting talent scrounged up from our English and Irish neighbors. The movie is paced well, if a bit dodgy in the beginning. Having read the story previously you find yourself already familiar with the characters which might throw off a newcomer to the tale. I think that anyone of any age can take great pleasure from the movie. I can only hope and dream that this stays a success which will lead to the making of the other terrific tales written by C.

","Some suits at the House of the Mouse had this idea of bringing to film this fantasy epic on a mystical world, based on a well-known book series and have it done by a Kiwi director. That's great, but the problem is, this idea has been done already. Even though ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is actually a good movie, the concept is lacking in freshness.<br/><br/>There's not a second in the movie we can't shake off the sensation that we have seen something like this before, and better executed. It's also hard to forget Disney's marketing has more influence in this movie than its artistic merits.<br/><br/>The Jehovah's Witness-y side of the story is also a marketing element well implemented. People tired of getting hardcore Christan culture constantly shoved down are not going to be bothered by it, and Bible-Belt families will be delighted.<br/><br/>Again, this is a good picture. A great live-action debut by the director and a bankable new franchise for Disney to milk.

","Don't get me wrong I liked this film tremendously but I feel that it is possibly the only book in the series, except maybe for The Last Battle, that is actually epic enough to be made into a movie.<br/><br/>As for ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" There was something about the film as a whole that was lacking. It just didn't seem as epic as films that have proceeded it. I didn't fear for the lives of the main characters like I did in the LOTR trilogy. The musical score didn't uplift me during the battle scenes, nor soothe during the more tender moments, ie the death and resurrection of Aslan.<br/><br/>The rest of the series, although good, for me just seems to hum along on auto pilot until the last book in the saga.

The rest of the casting didn't matter to much to me. Everybody else did a descent job of acting. The scenes and the special effects were great.<br/><br/>Some of the fighting scenes near the end were good. There could have been more fighting, You show 100,000 soldiers before the battle but there is only 10 minutes of fighting?<br/><br/>Some points of the film annoyed me. A beaver that is named mr. Beaver (I might change my name to mr. human). The death of the lion: Girls are crying over a creature who they had just met and he comes back to life. I know the Christian elements of the story but the sacrifice itself and left dead would have been more effective to the story (I thought the whole table thing was a bit lame). The rescue of the youngest boy took thirty seconds. The end of the story annoyed me too. <br/><br/>Every time I try to complain about something about the story I just think that the story is for children 10 and under.

"Iron Talon","9","0","1","12 December 2005"," Like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" this movie is a good tribute to the Narnia Series
","There are many things in life that are risky. It could be argued there are few things more risky than to take a classic novel and turn it into a screenplay. We saw this with Lord of the Rings. There was a lot of excitement surrounding the news of not one, but three movies being made for this trilogy, but it was coupled with apprehension. Questions were being asked. Are these movies going to stand up to the novel? Are the changes that were made going to adversely affect the story? If you can't fit the whole novel in the movie, what are they going to leave out? All fears were gone after The Fellowship of the Ring was released. Peter Jackson did a superb job and gave a fine example on how a classic novel should be translated to film.<br/><br/>Fans of the Chronicles of Narnia went through the same experience and should find themselves with the same result. The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, the first book of the series, sets the bar for the other six. And it can be said with confidence, the bar is set pretty high.<br/><br/>Like LOTR, there is some license taken in the screenplay, which is by Ann Peacock, some of which, was needed to add to the story. For example, the first 10 minutes of the film aren't even in the book, but could be extrapolated from the first few pages of the novel. And, it was needed to give us the reason why the four children were being shipped off to the countryside to live with a recluse professor and a housekeeper desperately in need of anger management classes.<br/><br/>The story is about four children who discover a magical world hidden by a wardrobe that seems to be forgotten in a spare room. This land has been taken over by an evil witch and they find out their destiny involves the liberation of this fantastic country. We meet all sorts of fantasy creatures; fauns, talking beavers, minotaurs, centaurs, etc., as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>There is only one actor I could really recognize. That was Liam Neeson, who voiced Aslan, the true king of Narnia and a very large, hardly safe, but good lion. All of the others were relatively unknown, but did a very good job. The four children felt like siblings. The White Witch was great. She was evil, cruel, treacherous. Mr. Tumnus, the dwarfs, all of the human actors were very believable.<br/><br/>The animals, both natural, like the beavers and the wolves, along with the imaginary (fauns, griffins, minotaurs, etc.) were all CGI. To sum up how they looked in a word, especially Aslan, would have to be ""wow."" There was maybe one spot in the entire film where the CGI betrayed itself, and that was only for a half second. The human voices, mixed with the animals natural growls, barks, chirps, etc, were as important as the CGI itself. Both elements were a great mix to bring life and believability to each character. I believe there was a collaborative work between ILM and Weta Workshop on the creation of these characters, especially the centaurs, minotaurs, etc.<br/><br/>As most of those who ""read"" this know, this is an allegory. C.S. Lewis, the writer of the The Chronicles series, wore his faith on his shirt sleeve and it influenced all of his writings from the point of his conversion on. However, those who don't consider themselves Christians would still enjoy this film because, as with any good allegory, the parallels are left unsaid. But more importantly, it is a good movie. Cinematography, acting, plot, special affects, all elements of movie making are used to tell the story and it is told well.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, this is the first live action movie directed by Andrew Adamson. He has two funny movies under his belt, Shrek and Shrek 2, but this is his debut in a serious, live-action movie. And he did a very impressive job. If the rest of the book series is supposed to be made into movies, he has set a very impressive precedent. And, given how he did on this one, I hope he will be brought on board for the rest.<br/><br/>If one were to scale this, I think it would be fair to rate it a 9 out of 10. I found myself getting impatient with the story only once while I was waiting for Aslan to first appear. But a good story was made into a good movie that could be viewed more than once without risking boredom."
"joestank15","6","0","1","11 December 2005"," Pretty good, minus the Passion of the Lion.
","The Chronicles of Narnia - Based on the classic novel by CS Lewis. Four London children are sent to a professor (Jim Broadbent)s country home in order for protection during World War II. There they find a magic wardrobe which leads to a mystical land called Narnia, which is being ruled by an evil witch (Tilda Swinton). To defeat the Witch, they must join forces with Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), the lion God of Narnia, and the great battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Good things first. The film is well directed for the most part, though it could've been made more touching. It, in the wake of numerous Harry Potter films, Lord of the Rings, and a slew of mediocre epic wanna-bes, manages to keep the ideas of magic and grand scale battles interesting. The music and locales offer a different sort of character and charm from other movies. Swinton is drippingly evil as the Witch. Though she looks like Galadrial without eyebrows and dilated pupils, her character is radically different and deserves appreciation. The children are all earnest and cute and British, though they all have some points where I just wanted to reach into the screen and slap one or two of them. There are some adorable critters in the mix of everything. I loved the adorable little Beavers (voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French, one of my beloved British actresses) and the Fox (voiced by the charming Rupert Everett). Liam Neeson voices Aslan (Why is he always typecast as mentor figures?) with earnestly and authority. The final battle is pleasing to the eyes and the adrenaline of all, and manages to be satisfying in spite of it's PG rating. (On a minor note, why are all these experienced warriors so willing to be commanded by a couple of teen boys? Silly.) <br/><br/>Now on to the mediocre stuff. I found myself grimacing at the absurdity and spectacle of the sacrificing of Aslan. Really, what the hell is this? The Passion of the Lion? Disney already killed a Lion in one of their films, and they did it better that way. I haven't read the books, but I don't care if it IS in the book. The scene is just silly. I get the allegory. On the third hour the mice nibbled at the Lion's ropes, and he became alive again. Dumb. Another thing that concerns me, for a film that takes place during World War II and strives to show us the importance of sacrifice, Narnia is pretty lenient on letting ANYONE die unless they're bad. Good people don't die. And that's where the boys are separated from the men, and Lord of the Rings is placed a notch (well. several notches) above Narnia. War involves sacrifice. It involves pain, and Narnia glides over that like it's the glacier lake. Oh, and having a scene that shows Santa giving a 6 year old girl a dagger is just plain wrong. Excellent to take a child to, and alright for everyone else, Narnia gets a B."
"Trangor","7","0","1","12 December 2005"," Narnia - Very Good, Could It Be Better?
","First, the overall rating of the movie is good to very good. Narnia is true to the original story and well done. The production values are good and so is the acting. So there aren't any clinkers to trip up the audience as the story progresses. I do recommend it. I want to make this clear up front before I begin to criticize it since most of my disappointment stems from expectations. I don't expect others to have the same expectations that I had for the film.<br/><br/>However, Narnia has been on the horizon for some time, as has been the new Harry Potter film, Goblet of Fire. The difference is that with Potter I already knew what to expect  super design and production values, good to very good acting, and somewhat trying adolescent themes :^). With Narnia there was the hope that it might be entertainment of epic proportion. After all, the story lends itself to that end. It didn't seem to me to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>In the inevitable comparison between the Potter film and Narnia, Narnia comes up short. While there are equally stunning scenes in both films, the impact of Narnia is less. It is in the wonderment department that Narnia falls down. Watching the film, one has the thought that director is no Peter Jackson. The action flows, all the elements are there but the magnitude of the impact is not as great. The casting is good and I have no complaint there. The director has a good eye for faces and uses it in his film.<br/><br/>I was going to say originally that the film did not have enough inspiration or creativity in it. But upon additional thought it was clear that there is much to admire in the film. A lot of the sets, costumes, and makeup designs are superb. The integration of computer graphics and actors is well nigh seamless. Any inspiration that is missing seems to come in framing the shots or the storyline. In fact, if it was possible to have Jackson re-cut the film, he might make it twice as good. All the elements are there after all. It just seems to progress from event to event in a way that sometimes makes the story plod a bit.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see if Narnia does well and, if it does, where Disney will go with the series. One thing about the Potter franchise is that the films have been consistently good - something that moviegoers know happens but rarely.<br/><br/>There is the issue of whether the film is suitable for children. Although the gore is not excessive, there are lots of battle scenes. And the makeup/design of the monsters is quite good, certainly good enough to scare young children. I am guessing 8 and up would probably be fine. Anyone younger and the violence or monsters could be a bit much or the quiet parts may make them fidget rather than stare properly. Children vary, of course, but I saw one Dad with his 3-year-old there. This film is just too much for a child of that age.<br/><br/>All of this commentary is from the perspective of someone who has read the books. I know the significance of Aslan to the series and the import of the allegories. I find I can't guess the reactions of people who are not familiar with the series and it will be intriguing to read some of those reviews."

","After having seen the preview of The Chronicles of Narnia, I was left wide-eyed and brimming with excitement at the anticipation of a sequel.<br/><br/>Narnia is a well-cut, well-rounded film adaptation of C.S. Lewis' classic set of Chronicles. One of the many appeals of the film is that it is entertaining for all ages. It captures the imagination of both those who are young, and those who are still young at heart.<br/><br/>Lucy was exceedingly well-played by the very engaging Georgie Henley who shows ability far beyond her years.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film is nothing short of a modern marvel. The seamless Lion is truly unbelievable. The single best CGI animal I have seen to date. (Better than Jackson's King Kong.) Tilda Swinton plays an average White Witch. Nothing out of the realm of what was expected. William Moseley and Anna Popplewell playing Peter and Susan respectively, also did apt jobs. Nothing outstanding. I feel that James McEvoy's ""Mr. Tumnus"" was a far more entertaining and engaging character than that of Peter, Susan or Edwin. But then, it may just have been written that way by Lewis...<br/><br/>I think most would agree with me when I say that the Lion and Lucy stole the show."

","I must say that, as a huge fan of C.S. Lewis' books, I was a little weary when I heard the news of his most treasured book being made into a movie. Despite that fact, I eased up slightly when I heard that WETA (the people who made the CGI, armor, miniature effects for Lord of the Rings) was doing most of the work on it.<br/><br/>Watching the movie, I was surprised at how closely the movie followed the book. I mean, sure, there were moments when you thought ""I don't remember this"", but, hey, besides that, the movie was excellent.<br/><br/>This is one of the few Disney movies that I will actually want to watch again and and again. Great job!"

","I have been a fan of the Chronicles of Narnia since I was seven years old. Of course, at that age, I had no idea of the symbolic significance of the stories. At 40, and a practicing Christian, these stories have grown with me. I had high hopes for this movie, as well as some apprehension upon going to the theater. Could anything measure up to the magic of Lewis' written words.<br/><br/>The answer? Absolutely. Aslan was portrayed with all the power, might and mystery that could possibly be conveyed in the two-dimensional world of film. I believe it says something when a person can enter a theater already knowing the story and still be awed.<br/><br/>In ways, it was better than Lord of the Rings. Not one element of the story was missing. Nor was anything added. The film adaptation of this classic is as true to the original story as a film can get. I highly recommend seeing this in the theater. I am sure it will transfer beautifully to DVD, but the big screen has a spectacular impact. Especially the sound.<br/><br/>I'm not usually a fan of child actors, but the children chose to portray the Pevensie children could not have done better. Liam Neeson as Aslan was just perfect. Some (very few) of the CG elements were obvious to the point of mild distraction, but that was truly the films only ""weakness."" If you are a fan of the series, this will not disappoint. If you are unfamiliar with the story, this will be a treat beyond your greatest imaginings.<br/><br/>Finally, the story's Christian subcontext is a reassurance to believers, a message to non-believers and yet it, like the books, avoids the trap of being too didactic or preachy. This is an amazing movie."

","I went in expecting a good but child orientated movie what I saw must rank as one of the most wonderful films ever made. There is only two things that I had negative thoughts about 1) Some of the animation was a little unpolished; the wolves in certain scenes, and 2) The children were obviously new to it all and didn't have the presence of say Dakota Fanning BUT they were so full of zest, especially the youngest, you couldn't help but love them. Otherwise it was pretty much unfaultable! That being said It wasn't quite made in the scope of The Lord of the Rings BUT it was quite similar in parts and if you loved the lord of the rings (who doesn't?) then this is definitely worth seeing."
"james.p.taylor","6","0","2","12 December 2005"," Good fantasy, but not really an epic.
","Four children are taken away from war-torn London to the house of an eccentric professor in the English country side. There, during a rainy day playing hide and seek the youngest girl Lucy (Georgie Henley) finds a portal to a fantasy land, Narnia, in the back of a wardrobe.<br/><br/>What happens after that is a fantasy epic. The coming of the children marks the end of a long winter and the birth of a new age in the land. The White Witch (Tilda Swinton) has brought winter (but not Christmas) to the land and runs Narnia with the aid of her secret police.<br/><br/>I'll get the comparisons out the way first. This isn't as grand feeling as LoTR. Filmed in New Zealand using some of the same epic countryside the film feels like a huge set, it doesn't feel like any of it was set outside in the beautiful country. It's clear that the characters are mostly filmed against blue/green screen and that these days is a disappointment.<br/><br/>The acting from the four children is uniformly great. The voice acting from the animals is good and the CG effects bringing them to life is well done. Liam Neeson playing the father of Aslan does okay, but I felt most Hollywood leading men could have done the job just as well. Tilda Swinton starts off fantastically in her chilling seduction of Edmund (Skandar Keynes), but becomes dull in the middle. A little hamming as the villain can be forgiven, even giving the role a panto feel. She pulls it back for the Stone Table scene only to lose it again in the final battle.<br/><br/>To make the film rating lower (PG in the UK) the film is very sterile. The massive closing battle is relatively 'clean', little blood being spilt. Big as it is you never feel lost, you always know what's going on. Griffons spiral in beautifully, monsters clash with each other with bone crunching speed. The end, again is clean and comes with an abrupt speed leaving me feeling let down.<br/><br/>Andrew Adamson does well. There are a few lighter moments but his tone is too uneven and I found myself glancing at my watch to see how much longer there was until the action picked up again.<br/><br/>A good children's film (maybe a bit dark for younger children in places) and a good starting place for any further films, but could have done so much more."
"m4nea","8","0","1","11 December 2005"," Pulls through despite wooden acting...
","I must say, this film delivers as much as can be expected in this day and age. Most blockbusters are horribly contrived action-fests that try to excite us with their fancy special effects. This is a little different, but before I get to the good parts, the cons:<br/><br/>The acting is terrible and the script isn't great. If you don't like hearing action film-esquire one-liners, then try to block the twenty of them or so out of your hearing. If you are going to see four no-name actors delight you with their unexpected Oscar-worthiness, you will be SORELY disappointed. I think the best acting was done by Liam Neeson as Aslan, but as such you don't even see him.<br/><br/>Now, what pulls this through to an 8.<br/><br/>It actually follows the story to a T...some of the lines were right from the book, and that made me very happy. The special effects, despite some poor blue-screen, were unbelievable. Aslan was perfect...there were times were I thought it was a real lion (I know, I know...that is the dumbest thing I could ever say...I know). Also, just the feelings that the audience feels (if they are into the movie) are phenomenal. The scene containing Aslan's walk to sacrifice carries a power and emotion that I have been waiting to see in an adaptation of this book. (Those who haven't read it will be in great suspense at this point...the looks on some of the faces in the theatre were pretty amusing).<br/><br/>So, yes...as is often the case these days, ignore the wooden characters and enjoy the overall story and the beauty of Narnia and its inhabitants (and take the kids)."

","This movie was simply awesome. It can be a great date flick, children's getaway or it can allow you to rekindle lost youth. I don't always comment on films because I am so cynical, but this movie just melted me away. The computer graphics were breath taking and the storyline just kept you in suspense. The only weird out of place part was the World-War II scene at the beginning. But, I guess it needed to be done to link why the children were sent to the professor's mansion. I am definitely looking forward to another Narnia adventure. Unfortunately, I will most likely need to wait 2 years.<br/><br/>This is just simply worth watching!!!"
"cyrus_aman","7","0","1","11 December 2005"," Had me sold until the battle scene...
","I truly enjoyed Narnia for the first two hours of the movie. The casting of the children was perfect. The special effects, though spotty at times, were effective. I was drawn into the world of the book through the artistic medium of film. However, the illusion of belief was shattered during the final battle scene. In short, I thought I was looking at cut scenes from a new Xbox 360 game.<br/><br/>This would be fantastic if the scene was produced for a video game, but not for a big-budget holiday film. The polar bears dragging the ice queen's sleigh didn't look a far-cry (no pun intended) from the cgi Coca-Cola bears. Some scenes with the centaurs looked like a first-generation Xbox or PS2 title. Very young children will--most likely--not be distracted by these details. But everyone else, from teens to adults, will see it as a cheapening of the film.<br/><br/>Will I see it again? Most likely. Will I buy it on DVD? Probably not. I'm hoping that, if future films are produced in the series, the effects will be improved. The expectation of the average movie-goer has been raised dramatically (ala Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc.). If future Narnia movies do not meet (or raise) the bar previous films have set, they will not stand the test of time, nor the patience of the audience."
"try_gaviscon","6","0","4","11 December 2005"," the message was clear, but too much cheese
","Like everyone else, I had very high hopes for this movie. The movie stuck fairly close to Lewis's story. The stone table part was magnificent, and I think Lewis would've been very happy. Nuances such as Lucy and Susan's bewilderment of touching Aslan's mane were clearly there. However, cheese sank in from the very beginning as soon as the musical score came into focus. Contemporary music ruined the movies epic theme for me. As soon as I heard the Enya-esquire tribal sound coming out of the Cinerama's speaker system, I thought, ""Great. Disney's gone the route of other film makers... cutting a deal for that one pop star."" And I'm sure that their will be a number of other artists that will gain some monetary gain from all of this. Nothing but opportunistic BS. So, yeah, I thought the musical score stank to high heaven.<br/><br/>The children got a little annoying, and by the end, you really want to knock some sense into these characters. I think the director really settled for less with some of the scenes. It seemed as if the musical score (which already sucked to begin with) had to make up for the wretched bad acting; a combination which almost made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>But I'm sure you're kids will like it. The animals were truly amazing. They were actually the best part of the film, I thought. The beavers rocked. I could watch a whole movie devoted just to them. Cute, cute, cute!

"somf","9","0","1","10 December 2005"," Just one little gripe
","Narnia is far better than I ever hoped it would be due to the amazing effects and the wonderful Tilda Swinton, but here is my one problem with the film. I never new fully appreciated Daniel Radcliffe and his fellow Hogwarts classmates until today. Strangely enough I liked this better than any of the Potter movies (haven't seen Goblet yet), but I had a big problem with the male children and a lesser problem with the females. They simply were not up to the task. The boy who played Edward made me feel that I was watching a school play. He was quite awful. I have only read the Magician's Nephew which had a different set of children in the story. I hope the other 6 books are the same way. Let's put it this way. Dakota Fanning doesn't have to worry about losing any future roles to any of these kids. I found the Christian elements of the film were handled quite well also. This was a rendering of Lewis's vision and to downplay it too much would not be faithful to the story to overdo it would have made the film play like a Sunday School special. It was a difficult task and the filmmakers are to be applauded. Certain to make gobs of money. Would not recommend it to the very little ones. My daughter is a very bright 6 year old. she loved it, but she held on tight and looked away several times. Don't go any younger than a bright 6 year old. And if you don't have any kids go anyway. You're bound to enjoy."
"tda-2","3","0","2","10 December 2005"," Decent movie from a mediocre book
","The realization of Narnia is fairly impressive. Landscapes are portrayed nicely, and the scope of the world is felt. However certain areas (mostly the witches castle and dungeon) are so obviously artificial you want them to hurry up to the next scene, before you're pulled out of the fantasy world completely. The best moments in the film, come from Lucy's first venture into Narnia. Her encounter with Mr. Tumnus is well done and when he enchants her with his flute, the scene is fairly creepy. His turnaround is nicely portrayed and he stands out as one of the better actors in the movie. Despite the wonder of disappearing in and out of the wardrobe, you start to wish they'd go in for good and start the adventure. Mostly because it's tough to watch Peter and Susan act without any wolves or lions to distract you from their melodramatic expressions. Once in Narnia, the film begins to take off and is only slowed down in a few scenes that are unnecessary. THese scenes are not in the book and are the filmmaker's attempt to try to flesh out more story. However there are already places in the book that shouldn't be there, so adding more scenes doesn't help. The adventure is fairly face paced. Once meeting some well rendered beavers, they are attacked by fiersome wolves. THe wolf captain proves to be the scariest villain of the movie and offers some of the best CGI in the movie. (The witch might have been scarier if her hair wasn't gelled back like she was just riding a motorcycle, and she didn't have to cope with that stupid crown.) Anyhow the story goes along with the children meeting Aslan. Probably the best computer generated character since Gollum. Aslan gets a nice chunk of screen time and he seems more than capable of defeating any witch. I guess thats kind of the whole problem. Aslan was gone and now he's back. He brings with him spring, a huge army and brings back animals that were turned into stone. So who needs the kids? All they do is mess things up enough to get Aslan killed. (But that doesn't matter because he is reincarnated.And yes that is kind of like Jesus)Peter really doesn't do much. Sure he fights the witch, (with swordfighting abilities we never knew he had) but it's Aslan who get her in the end."

","I went into this afternoon's matinée with mild expectations. After having recently finished the seven book CS Lewis series, I wondered-often aloud-whether or not it would be possible to truly capture the magic of Narnia on the big screen. Overall, I believe this film is a stunning attempt at relaying all of the wonder of Lewis' magical world, but it falls short of satisfying those of us who were completely entranced by the literary version of the story.<br/><br/>Down to the very last creature, every bit of acting was superb, particularly Lucy and the White Witch. Peter was not quite as regal as I had expected, but then again, what young boy who has been thrown into a mythical world by walking into a wardrobe really is regal? I was disappointed that he was never referred to as the High King, elevating his status above that of Edmund-although Edmund does acquiesce to his leadership after Aslan's ""death."" I had hoped to be captured by real visual majesty ala the LOTR Trilogy. I was disappointed. But there was enough magic present in this opening volley that I will return on opening day for any sequels-and I have a sense that whatever nitpicking concerns I have for this first film will be long forgotten as the series moves forward. I continue to anticipate great things."
"cultfilmfan","6","0","1","10 December 2005"," The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe
","The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The With And The Wardrobe is based on the novel of the same name by C.S. Lewis. The film takes place in England during World War 2 and is about four siblings. There names are Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. To keep them safe from the war they are sent away to live with a professor. One day while playing in the big house Lucy discovers that if you enter the wardrobe you will enter a winter land called Narnia. Her siblings do not believe her, but finally they look for themselves and see that Lucy was not lying. The siblings make friends with the local creatures who tell them that the land is cursed by the evil witch Jadis who has cursed the land to always be winter time. The animals protect the siblings from Jadis and they are introduced to a lion named Aslan who shows them that they are the only ones who will be able to save Narnia from the evil queen. The end results in a battle between good and evil and the fate of Narnia rests on their shoulders. The film has good direction, good performances by the entire cast, good cinematography, good art direction and good set decoration. The film started out really promising and I thought I would quite like it, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I thought the film was well made and it is a good looking film, but mainly I had trouble with the film's pacing. As I mentioned before, when the film started out I found it quite interesting, but as it went along I felt it dragged and soon it became slower and slower to the point where I was getting bored with the film. I feel that if perhaps the film had been trimmed and edited a little better that this may not be the case. I felt the end (especially the battle scenes) just went on for far too long and I just lost my interest. The book that this film is based on is quite popular and I'm sure that many people will really enjoy this film. I say this because I' am personally very picky when it comes to adventure/fantasy films. Really popular films such as The Lord Of The Rings just do not interest me and I think that this is a film that falls in the same category. I 'am sure that many adventure and fantasy film fans will enjoy this movie and me not really being a fan of the genre will stick with my opinion that I did not like it. However I do feel that I could have liked this movie with a little better pacing and editing. But as it stands I can appreciate the direction and the way the film looks, but other than that this film was just not for me."
"fredman5555","4","0","2","10 December 2005"," Great effects but awfully tame on the action
","I must give this movie a great deal of credit for the effort on special effects. They took the time to make the non-existent appear totally real. This was a definite strong point! Unfortunately, the action level in this movie was severely debilitated. Word and phrases like, ""to the death,"" were brandished (perhaps to build up the feeling and the intensity), but when all was said and done, the actual portrayal of the whole book through this movie was rather like my describing the American Revolutionary War process as, ""the colonists dumped some tea, England got mad; then the colonists wrote a Constitution and the US became a country."" If you're expecting a dynamic and powerful movie, this isn't it! If, on the other hand, you want something lightly entertaining, but not terribly moving, you're right on track here."
"FilmSchoolWriter","8","0","1","10 December 2005"," A fine movie, but a let down. Definitely not as good as I had hoped.
","I've been waiting for ""Narnia"" to come out for about a month now. So naturally, I went to see it the first chance I got. It was sold out. So I went to a later showing (which was also sold out) and waited in line for a half hour to get in. I was disappointed by the movie. Probably not worth the $7 I paid to get into it. Sure it's nice to finally have a big screen adaptation of CS Lewis's book, but it could have been done so much better. Not to say this is a bad movie. (The amount of people gushing about how wonderful it is should cancel out that thought) But it's not an amazing movie. It's just a fine movie. An okay one. Allow me to explain.<br/><br/>The number one biggest flaw in ""Narnia"" is the casting. 3 of the leads should never have been cast in this movie because I can guarantee you that there are better people out there. Characters in point: Lucy, Aslan and the White Witch. Lucy is played by newcomer Georgie Henley. Yes she is very young, but that is no excuse for her to be a bad actor. Throughout the movie, she had this air about her that seemed to say, ""Oh! I'm doing this because Andrew Adamson told me to and I'm looking like he told me to look."" Chalk it up to inexperience, but that is no excuse. I was so sad to find out that Liam Neeson was doing the voice for Aslan. That was an AWFUL decision. Granted, Neeson is a very good actor. But he is not acting in this movie, he is giving the VOICE for a character. Everyone who has seen a Neeson movie or heard him talk knows that he has a very, calm, gentle and smooth voice that never really changes despite what's going on around him. It isn't the fierce or proud voice that was needed for Aslan. In my opinion, the voice over would have been better if given by someone who had a deeper, richer voice. James Earl Jones, perhaps? They need not have necessarily re-cast the role of the White Witch, but they definitely could have had Tilda Swinton show some more emotion. Yes I understand that her character is cold, but she is most certainly not devoid of emotion. In my opinion, Swinton's performance was very bland. This is not to say that ALL of the performances/voice overs were badly executed - because they weren't. Rupert Everett as the voice of the Fox and Ray Winstone and Dawn French as the voices of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver were quite good. As was James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. But it is Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell as the eldest Pevensie children that really shine. Skandar is quite believable as Edmund, beginning as a sulky young boy and ending as a quiet young man. Anna does a good job of playing the logical Susan. But it is William who doesn't let down at any point and in my mind, is the best actor in the entire movie. All of their performance's make this movie worth while.<br/><br/>My second, and last, problem with ""Narnia"" is that it lacks the spice of other book adaptations. ESPECIALLY those of recent years that are adaptations of other beloved series. Namely, the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Both of these series do a magnificent job of staying loyal to the books without being boring and they also do a good job of drawing you into the story. Yes we know that Harry doesn't get killed by Voldemort, but we are still on the edge of our seat, scared that something will happen. This NEVER happened in ""Narnia"". Andrew Adamson seemed to be saying, ""I loved this book as a child and I will not change any of this. Even if it would make my movie better."" There are many scenes that could have been cut out or sped up, but they were not and I actually began to grow BORED during the movie. Yes there are the clever moments (okay, clever MOMENT) like at the beginning, with the movie starting with the bombing of London. This drew you in, but you didn't really STAY IN.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a fine movie. Nothing special. And yes, there ARE religious undertones in this movie. GET OVER IT. Lewis made it that way and if you don't like the content, don't complain about it. No one is making you watch this movies and if you won't appreciate it, don't bother."

","I saw this at a special midnight preview screening. The place was packed to the rafters with not a child in sight.<br/><br/>The film is shot on an epic and majestic scale of 2:35 and every inch of the wide framing is packed with rabid detail. It looks gorgeous and the lighting is splendid, the costumes are colourful, the landscapes reveal wonder upon wonder, the creatures are stunningly created and the script moves along at a cracking pace. The Walpurgisnacht-esquire scene will creep out most people and I recommend any parents to be vigilant when it starts. This is a fairly provocative and terrifying orgy of violence that could well disturb many kids.<br/><br/>The major flaw is the uninspired score and the lack of escapist magic and charm. The four kids in the film are anemic and devoid of any real emotion. This hampers any connection or engagement with their characters.<br/><br/>I still prefer the old animation from the 1980's over this multi-million dollar venture.<br/><br/>Still, it's not all bad and there is much to enjoy and savour. There's even a sly reference to KING KONG and many nods to THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Take your kids and spend a couple of hours in the world of the Wardrobe.<br/><br/>Above Average."

That's not to say it was bad, per se, but there was nothing truly excellent in this film save the effects. As an adaptation from a novel, the film is, for the most part, very faithful. There are only a couple of changes made that I had a problem with, and these were tiny and did not distract. But at the end of the day, this film is just average. This review isn't all doom and gloom, there are some nice positives. As I stated earlier, the effects are top notch and I don't ever remember explicitly recognizing them. There is a lot of very funny humor. Tilda Swinton is magnificent as Jadis, the White Witch. And parents should not be afraid of taking smaller children to see it as the film is not scary or bloody to any great degree.

","Saw the movie preview screening on 6 Dec 2005. <br/><br/>Some quick bites: <br/><br/>This is a personal view : I never read the book so perhaps the characters would have been more endearing on the silver screen. Kids will probably love this movie but it didn't seem well-tailored for the adults (or perhaps adults who haven't read any of the books before). From the perspective of a clueless viewer such as I myself, I couldn't help but feel nothing of the plight of the foursome (in truth, Lucy was not too bad and was acceptable) and couldn't find much redeeming factors even at the very end. Perhaps with the hindsight of prior reading, I my change my views.<br/><br/>CGI's were top-notch especially Aslan who looked uncannily life-like.<br/><br/>I've always had a soft spot for fantasy-based movies and this was no exception. It had a fairly solid storyline although I must admit that some scenes could do with more brevity and moved the movie at a quicker pace.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Swinton's portrayal as the White Witch - she was totally in her element, fleshed out her character superbly and was truly a piece of excellent casting by the directors. Though suspiciously a bit like Kate Blanchett in style in LOTR, Swinton played the evil role superbly and was easily the star of this movie.<br/><br/>My kids will love it for sure. But just a 6/10 from me."
