","I normally do not like movies about sports. I love sports; just not movies about sports. That being said, this film was not so much about baseball as it was about a father and daughter relationship. It also touched on how technology has taken over the human element of scouting for players. This film is the complete opposite of Money Ball, where technology actually helps in building a team. Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who is struggling with his eyesight and the front office has doubts about whether or not he is still up to the job of spotting up and coming talent. Because of this affliction, Gus is a grumpy old man which actually adds a lot of humor to the film. His character kind of reminded me of the character that Eastwood played in Grand Torino. His daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) discovers that her father is having difficulty, reluctantly takes on the roll of caregiver and follows her father on his scouting adventure. Incidentally, she knows more about baseball than probably anyone else in this film. Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) is an aspiring sports announcer who was scouted by Gus years ago. The relationship that develops between Mickey (named for Mickey Mantle) and Johnny is fun to watch and provides some insight to Mickey's reluctance to develop a serious relationship with any man. Pete Klein (John Goodman) plays the mediator role that brings Mickey and Gus together. I really liked his unyielding devotion and trust to Gus. It was also good to once again see Scott Eastwood (Billy Clark) act alongside his father. They have acted together in several films, and it was good to see them spending some family time together. I think that the entire cast definitely made this film better and I am sure that it will draw young viewers to the theater. I do not think that this film was utterly brilliant, but it was thoroughly entertaining. There were aspects of the film that were totally predictable, but I looked forward to seeing it play out. Director Robert Lorenz may not have hit it out of the park (like he did with Million Dollar Baby), but I think that it is a definite triple play. I recommend that you do not sit on the bench and go out and see this film. I give this film a green light."

","""How the hell do you know I'm lucky to survive?""<br/><br/>Legendary screen icon Clint Eastwood returns in front of the camera since his hit ""Gran Torino"". No matter what anyone else thinks of him, I will always admire the man. He is one of my heroes. Who else can personify the action hero perfectly, become a gifted filmmaker, improve his acting ability as he ages AND be quite the jazz musician?<br/><br/>Mr. Eastwood may be old but he still has a commanding presence on screen. Granted, he might be the only leading octogenarian in Hollywood right now, but still, I digress. He is old. That is a fact. At the age of 82, seeing him play an elderly man losing his sight while bonding with his distant daughter makes it quite sad for me to watch. However, ""Trouble With the Curve"" is a breeze to watch.<br/><br/>It is not a baseball movie, although baseball is the basis of the film's story. Nor is it a depressing drama (Mr. Eastwood's favorite genre of late). It is a father-daughter bonding dramedy, with some great chemistry between Mr. Eastwood and Amy Adams as his estranged daughter. Justin Timberlake also arrives to lighten up the atmosphere even more, and his presence is welcome in the film.<br/><br/>Mr. Eastwood is not in the director's chair this time. His long-time producer partner, Robert Lorenz, makes his directorial debut with this film. Apparently Lorenz directs the cast with ease although it feels too by-the-numbers. But hey, there are much worse debuts. Judging from the breezy pace and the somewhat brisk editing and lively cinematography, it's clear from the get-go that the superb ""Eastwood touch"" is not evident in the film, even though some of Mr. Eastwood's key players are still here - cinematographer Tom Stern and editor Joel Cox - though the music by Marco Beltrami (not Mr. Eastwood nor his son this time!) complements the atmosphere pleasantly.<br/><br/>Look, this is not a great film. It's a pedestrian and predictable film, with Mr. Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, as well as an impressive supporting cast featuring John Goodman and Robert Patrick, phoning in the performances. Both Adams and Mr. Eastwood have acted much more superbly in better previous movies (""Gran Torino"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""The Fighter""). But it is funny, it is sad at times (Mr. Eastwood's heart-wrenching singing of 'You are My Sunshine' is forever embedded in my head), and it is easy on the eyes, ears and mind, a relaxing pleasure to watch. It is great entertainment. From all the big- budget blockbusters out in cinemas last summer, this is a joy. You'll walk out smiling.<br/><br/>Overall: 70%"

","Clint Eastwood has being a curmudgeon honed to perfection. How refreshing to see a mature actor creating appropriate roles, and not trying to be a plastic version of his - or her, for that matter in many cases - former self playing inappropriately younger parts. He is excellent in this movie. Amy Adams is, as in every film I've seen her in, a total delight. I never was a fan of John Goodman in his earlier years, but the older he gets and the meatier the roles he takes on, the more appreciation I have for him. And Justin Timberlake has a role absolutely meant for him. He is a sexy little hunk, no doubt about it, with personality to spare. Oh, I loved this movie! The exhilaration of baseball, the heart-tugging familiarity of family issues.this one has a lot going for it and I enjoyed each and every minute of it. It's as good as expectations built it up to be. I would advise you not to miss this one!"

","Just got back from seeing this movie, and I enjoyed it very much. <br/><br/>I'm not a person who follows sports, and even though baseball terms were thrown around, I had no problem keeping up with the story. The casting was phenomenal; each character was portrayed perfectly by the actors. <br/><br/>The story may be a little cliché, but it was enjoyable all the same. The plot is about a father and grown daughter trying to reconnect over baseball scouting. There is drama, laughs, and even a few tears along the way. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"StevePulaski","8","52","75","22 September 2012"," A possible pioneer
","It pains me to say that I've already heard many people say they will not be seeing Trouble with the Curve because of Clint Eastwood's ""antics"" at the Republican National Convention just a few weeks ago. Their loss. Not being able to separate the man from the actor is something that took me a while to do, but the way some do it now is childish and immature. I wonder if those same people knew Eastwood was a Libertarian/Republican when he was playing ""Dirty Harry."" Hard to believe it has been nineteen years since Eastwood himself acted in a film he has not directed. He lends the camera to Robert Lorenz, who assisted him in directing much of Eastwood's filmography, including Flags of Our Fathers and the acclaimed Best Picture winner Million Dollar Baby. Lorenz's captures screenwriter Randy Brown's simple but uplifting, intimate story of a man's devotion to a game and his brewing reconnection with his daughter he seemingly abandoned at a young age.<br/><br/>I'll catch you up; Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an elderly scout for the Atlanta Braves baseball team, who is becoming increasingly frail and ill-equipped with deteriorating eyesight. The Braves are losing faith in Gus's abilities, because in recent years, baseball has been run more by computer predictions and online statistics rather than physically sitting in the stands and scouting. Gus doesn't hold back on his hatred for computers, making them sound like limited fossils and being unable to predict more detailed outcomes. One wonders if he is mindlessly ranting or wouldn't even like a computer if he knew how to use one.<br/><br/>Pete, played by John Goodman, on a roll now with winning films, is Gus's close friend who is convincing the Braves' organization that despite Gus's poor eyesight, that he is an invaluable asset and needs to stay. He recruits Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to assist him in scouting a young prodigy in North Carolina, who currently plays for a high school team. Mickey's mother died when she was young and shortly after, Gus sent her to live with relatives whom she barely knew. During the scouting trip, Mickey winds up meeting one of Gus's friends whom he used to scout back in the day, named Johnny ""The Flame"" Flanagan (Justin Timberlake), for his one-hundred mile-an-hour fastball. We can see where this is headed.<br/><br/>We can see where much of the film is headed throughout its runtime but it's scarcely a burden because the warmth and bold character study on three of 2012's most interesting characters is a soothing and efficient one. Eastwood turns in the racism and foul rants he expertly utilized in Gran Torino for some nuanced anger as Gus, and as always, comes off as charismatic and effortlessly likable. Amy Adams does some fine work here, showing us that she is an up-and-coming female actress that is going under the radar, somewhat like Emily Blunt, and fearlessly plays the role of a woman in desperate need of answers, which her father will not give her. And Justin Timberlake continues to show is versatility and heart playing a totally different character from his last one and hitting every note properly.<br/><br/>It would appear that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin could have possibly started a new trend with sports films that was seldom seen before his film Moneyball, and that trend is centering a story around a sport but making the center the characters and not the on-field theatrics. Never are we truly consumed in the story of this young scouter, but we shouldn't be. And never were we truly gripped by the Oakland Athletics players in Moneyball - mainly because we never saw them play or were even formally acquainted with them. Both films center around the same sport, but ones' agenda is to show the gritter business side of baseball, while the other is the story of a father and daughter reconnecting with the sport in the foreground. With both films, it's needless to say, I'm all for this brewing trend.<br/><br/>Starring: Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, and John Goodman. Directed by: Robert Lorenz."
"BigBudde","8","58","87","20 September 2012"," Great Drama
","A great film for sports fans and non sports fans alike. Great drama and acting by Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams. They really make a believable father and daughter. Justin Timberlake was also good as a washed up pitcher turned baseball scout. It follows a story of a baseball scout (Eastwood) who is getting towards the end of his career, and scouting the potential number one pick for the Atlanta Braves. Eastwood is definitely getting up there but he can still act and plays this part perfectly. The film moves along good, and is enjoyable from start to finish. It has laughs, drams and some romance. Great for a couple or for the family. An added bonus if you're a baseball fan. 8/10."
"larrys3","5","24","34","26 December 2012"," Far Too Contrived and Formulaic
","With the talents of Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and John Goodman you would think you'd be in for a really good movie. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that was the case. It seemed the makers of the film went out of their way to make the film as contrived and formulaic as possible. With the various soap operaish plot elements and stilted dialog I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, especially in the final twenty minutes or so of the film.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's movie work, but I thought that the concept of him being Amy Adams' father was really far fetched. Grandfather maybe. Adams, as usual, lights up the screen whenever she appears, with her vivaciousness and charisma. John Goodman does his usual solid job as the Braves Director of Scouting, and Eastwood's boss. He tries to help Eastwood and shield him from the young ""vultures"" who want to put Eastwood ""out to pasture"" once and for all. Matthew Lillard is believable as the top young ""vulture"" butt-kisser who has no respect for Eastwood and wants to enhance his own career.<br/><br/>So with all this talent and what could have been a really decent story, why did the film makers have to take the predictable path at just about every turn? Oh well, just one man's opinion."

","I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan, and I really like Amy Adams. Justin Timberlake was decent and a likable guy in this movie, so what's the problem? The problem is the story or should I say lack of a decent story. This movie is so predictable that 10 minutes into it you will be able to figure everything out including the ending. I don't understand why Clint Eastwood would accept or take on this role, maybe it's because he gets to be the crabby, hard headed, cigar smoking, never smiling, snarling old timer like he has played so well in previous good movies such as Gran Torino, Million dollar baby, and The unforgiven. Regardless of why he is in this predictable, silly waste of time, the bottom line is that this movie fails in every aspect. This is not a baseball movie, it's not a drama, it's not a romantic comedy, it's truly a waste of what might have been, could of been, or should of been a potential excellent trip into movie magic. I didn't hate this one, but I didn't like it either, I suspect the reason I didn't hate it is because I really do like Clint Eastwood movies and I'll forgive him this one slip."

","In Atlanta, the aging Brave's baseball scout Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is near the end of his contract and the manager Vince (Robert Patrick) questions whether it is not the time for his retirement. Meanwhile the stubborn and grumpy Gus learns that he has problems with his eyes and need to go to a specialist but he hides the medical recommendation from everybody.<br/><br/>Gus's boss and friend Pete Klein (John Goodman) knows that baseball is the pride and joy of Gus and a retirement would kill him and asks him to travel to North Caroline to scout the promising player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill). Pete also protects Gus from the ambitious colleague Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard) that wants his position and to get Gus fired. Pete visits Gus's estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), who is an efficient lawyer that is disputing a partnership in the office where she works with her colleague Todd (James Patrick Freetly), and asks her to travel with Gus to North Caroline. Mickey is a great fan of baseball and has a great knowledge of the sport since she used to travel with her father when she was young, but she has a childhood trauma since Gus abandoned her with an uncle when she was a child. <br/><br/>In North Caroline, Gus meets the former pitcher Johnny (Justin Timberlake), who had an early retirement due to an injured shoulder and now is scouting for the Red Socks but aiming to be a broadcaster. When he meets Mickey, there is a mutual attraction between them. Along the days, Gus discovers that Gentry has problems with balls pitched in curve and he does not recommend the player to the Brave. He also tells Johnny about Gentry's problem. But when Phillip advises Vince to hire Gentry, Vince's decision affects the lives of Gus, Mickey and Johnny.<br/><br/>""Trouble with the Curve"" is a good movie with Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams about baseball and relationship. It is impressive the longevity of Clint Eastwood and how adapted he is to this phase of his life. Amy Adams is one of most delightful actresses of Hollywood. The story entwines drama with romance and sport and the result is an enjoyable movie even for those like me that are not fan of baseball. My vote is seven,<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Curvas da Vida"" (""Curves of the Life"")"
"seghers","4","16","25","26 December 2012"," Trouble with the Movie
","First, let it be known, I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan. From his Westerns including the amazing ""Unforgiven"" to his startling and touching directorial triumphs including Mystic River, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers, etc etc. Given his well-earned iconic status, I find it sad that he chooses the brain-dead ""Trouble with the Curve"" as one of his later appearances. The dialog I would put on a par with ""Expendables 2"" which is to say horrendous. Poor Eastwood, Adams, Timberlake, Goodman, and other fine actors are forced to spout ridiculous dialog that seems to have been written by a 10 year old. Watching the film, we found ourselves laughing at the dialog in in appropriate places, paying attention to how poorly made the film was, rather than even following the story. The story seemed to meander around, first being about Eastwood needing some player to start hitting to keep his job... but then they just drop that plot to make it be about something different... then at the end, they bring everything back together again, tying it into a ribbon without any further explanation or emotional investment earned. The baseball is terrible also. The home run hitter guy is obviously not an athlete, much less a ""five tool"" superstar. Other players, who are supposedly at the triple-A level, especially the narrow shouldered, bespectacled player who precedes the slugger in the batting order, are characters more out of ""Bad News Bears"" than a real baseball movie. The peanut vendor turned star situation is too ridiculous to even comment further on. The ending, as contrived as it is, provides a small amount of satisfaction, but even that is spoiled by Lillard's ridiculous overplaying of the villain, and more even more inane and pointless dialog. I hope very much that we see Eastwood in movies more deserving of the status he has earned. ""Trouble with the Curve"" hits a single simply through its stellar cast, but is thrown out trying to stretch it into a double, aiming for far more than the skill of the writers, editors and producer are able to deliver.<br/><br/>Everyone involved in this hollow and artificial shell of a movie should be more than a little bit embarrassed."
"valadas","7","3","3","13 December 2012"," That's life after all
","Do you like baseball?If you don't, don't worry because this movie is only apparently about baseball. Baseball here is a mere pretext to show life problems and troubles such as about someone who is at risk of losing his job for becoming ill, a lawyer that is endangering her position in a lawyer's firm for losing time in giving too much attention to his ailing father and the difficulties experienced by a young woman in finding a boyfriend. An old baseball scout is losing his eyesight and this puts his job at risk while his thirtyish daughter is very worried about that and wants to be more careful with him against his will since he is rather intractable. This puts her career at risk in the firm she works for because of the time she is losing. Besides that she has difficulty in finding herself a boyfriend (maybe for the same reason)despite the fact that she is very pretty. Father and daughter love each other deeply though very reluctant in showing it. The performers are very good mainly Amy Adams as the daughter who does a superb job. The images and dialogues are particularly revealing of what is going on. The movie is very good in what concerns sentiments, emotions and drama. It could be classified as very good if it were not for the easy, hazardous and random solution found in the end to solve all the problems and troubles."
"TheSquiss","3","27","47","4 December 2012"," Trouble with boredom! One tidy ending short of being stinker.
","I have nothing against Clint Eastwood. No, let's rephrase that slightly. In Squissland, Clint Eastwood rocks! I need only present Unforgiven as evidence and there's a huge canon of fine work to back that up.<br/><br/>Certainly he's acted in the odd turkey (Space Cowboys, anyone?) and even directed the odd embarrassment (stand up and be counted, Firefox), but generally speaking, Eastwood has been a perfectly respectable actor, a far superior director, has a fine taste in music and, his politics and my ineligibility to vote aside, I'd put my cross against his name for US President any day of the week except if he was up against Martin Sheen. Or maybe Morgan Freeman. Or Well, you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve, however, is not a film of which he should feel terribly proud. It's the first time he has acted in a film that he didn't also direct since 1993's In the Line of Fire (for Wolfgang Peterson) and, if nothing else, he should have learnt one important lesson from the experience: Don't do it again! For the first forty-five minutes, director Robert Lorenz clearly used the cardboard cutout of Clint from Million Dollar Baby; it snarls in the same manner, it moves the same way and it's even wearing the same T-shirt, just without depth, quality or conviction. It isn't remotely convincing and it's a huge relief when the real Mr. Eastwood finally arrives. It isn't a startling performance, in fact it's just a variation of the turns he gave in the afore mentioned boxing flick and Gran Torino, but then he is in his eighties and it must tire him out.<br/><br/>And on that subject, Mickey (Amy Adams) is his daughter? Really??? Apparently so. Gus is a senior baseball scout who is losing his patience as quickly as his eyesight, and his contract is about to follow suit if the young(er) pretender to his throne, Phillip (Mathew Lillard) has anything to do with it. Gus' virtually estranged daughter, Mickey, is a successful lawyer who is about to make partner. They don't like each other very much. Or rather, in good Hollywood schmaltz style, they do but they like to think they don't. Gus is sent off on another trip to prove his worth, his manager and friend, Pete (John Goodman) persuades Mickey to go along and help him out. At a crucial time in her career and at a critical time for the firm, Mickey agrees. Her decision is inexplicable other than that without it, there would be no film. Everybody loses. Except for Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a newbie scout, who falls for her. Predictably.<br/><br/>Why is it one tidy ending short of being a stinker? Deep sigh.<br/><br/>Well, Trouble with the Curve is too long, too obvious, takes far too long to establish itself, is poorly acted for the first act and is convoluted and depressingly trite.<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough, Mickey enters her father's house in the middle of the mother of all rain storms, and even comments on it, but has nary a hair stuck to her face nor a drop of precipitation on her skin or clothes.<br/><br/>And they dance in front of an admiring, encouraging busker.<br/><br/>And an entire crowd in a bar whoops and applauds a retort from Johnny in true, cheesy Roxanne style, despite them having clearly ignored the entire conversation prior to his comment.<br/><br/>And then there's the horrible sequence that jars completely and makes no sense until one reads the credits. To wit: Mother, son and daughter arrive in a bar in the background. Camera cuts to close up of them.<br/><br/>Daughter: ""I wish Dad was here."" Mother: ""I know, Honey."" It adds nothing to the film, is irrelevant to the action in the foreground and serves only to give a blatant cameo to the wife and children of director Lorenz! On the upside, it appears screenwriter Randy Brown provided a checklist of emotions to work through and we know the characters will be recognizable because they've been photocopied from countless other poor films.<br/><br/>You've been warned but don't let me stop you.

","Curve is a return to a more old-fashioned style of baseball film after Moneyball - but one that has some real acting and even a little sport's magic about it - and you can see both styles of film-making here.<br/><br/>Eastwood is more than watchable as the old dog of a baseball scout, Adams deliveries a great performance - she pulls off the difficult role of cute and ballsy with panache, and Timberlake is charming, but definitely Wahlberg would be first pick here, Justin struggles a little to get beyond romantic comedy to something matching the gravitas the other two bring (with a light touch).<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful relationship film with sports - not many films really look at grown father and grown daughter and work that through in mainstream cinema - Curve does, and the script is good.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like sports with more than just the sport this is well worth your time - it is one of my favourites of the year."
"lagudafuad","5","12","19","20 December 2012"," Eastwood is not the director here
","""Now get out of here before I have a heart attack trying to kill you."" That is my favorite line from the 80 something Clint Eastwood in this movie Trouble with the Curve. The movie is sport drama, that is kind of predictable and it does drag, that you can actually get up, go to the toilet get back and still not have missed anything. This is Eastwood's first acting role since 2008's Gran Torino and his first acting role in a movie where he is not the director since 1993's In the Line of Fire. <br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is Clint Eastwood; his years of acting and directing made it easy for him to flow with the other actors, and making him the principal person to look out for when you do decide to watch this flick.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about an old retiring baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) who is about to finish up his contract in 3 months, Gus eyes are failing him and his old time friend Pete (John Goodman) calls up his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to keep an eye on her father.<br/><br/>Mickey who is very busy, had to break away from her demanding work to go be with Gus and together they go scouting where they met Johnny (Justin Timberlake) a former player that Gus scouted out.<br/><br/>Not much of a big fan of Timberlake's acting, his performance in In Time (2012) is the best I have seen him in till date, here is just a supporting actor running around being a pest. The love story or romance perpetuated in this movie is too shallow, if this is how easy it is to fall in love, then I will tie myself to my wife everywhere she goes. (Note: there was no adulterous act in the movie)<br/><br/>The movie's high point will be the locations, the movie was filmed in various locations giving it the rich feel like you are traveling with a scout, and it does pull up the question of man vs machine, which will triumph. In the other baseball based sport drama Moneyball (2012) which starred Brad Pitt, machine seems to be the victor; here man seems to be the victor, so I guess the fight continues.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve, shows why scouts are always needed to help scout out talents, there can see things that your computer can, while the computer runs on statistics and calibration, the eyes and ears rely on fact and observation. Trouble with the Curve is an OK drama, but you have not missed much if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"Likes_Ninjas90","5","14","23","2 December 2012"," It won't tarnish Clint's legacy too much: it'll be forgotten before then
","Ageing baseball scout Gus (Clint Eastwood) doesn't believe in computers or statistics. He enjoys researching the old fashion way by going to games and watching new talent firsthand. However, Gus is struggling to take care of himself. He doesn't eat well and his eyesight is growing weaker, making it harder to observe the matches. With draft selections approaching, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is worried about an important scouting trip coming up. He can't afford for Gus to make any mistakes with selections so he employs some extra help. He tries to persuade Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter, to go on the trip with her father. Mickey lives a very separate life to Gus. She works in a law firm surrounded by men and has to work hard for any recognition. However, she knows as much about baseball as Gus does and eventually concedes when she realises her father's instability. Her relationship with Gus shares a bitter past, but she finds relief by coming to know Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a young scout who would have been a great player had he not succumbed to injury. <br/><br/>Trouble With the Curve is driven by a fantastic creative team, two experienced lead actors and a rising star - it's also nothing short of a misfire. The film is courtesy of Clint Eastwood's studio Malpaso Productions, but is directed by his assistant Robert Lorenz, the second unit director of films like Million Dollar Baby (2004) and Mystic River (2003). Positioning itself as a clear alternative to the sports science methods of Moneyball (2011), Malpaso is a fitting word. The name is derived from Malpaso Creek, which means ""bad step"" in Spanish. The script by first time screenwriter Randy Brown would have you believe that modern statistics in sports fall short of old school methods, like pure instincts and hands-on research. Did the old men that Billy Beane had to contend with come up with this? <br/><br/>I don't know a lot about baseball, but after watching Rugby League for seven years I've learnt something: stats do not lie. A recent article in The Sydney Morning Herald described the fallout between the NRL (National Rugby League) administration and Sports Data, a company outsourced to organise all of the games stats and player statistics. Sports Data is said to hold a very close relationship with the games most successful coaches, many of whom use this information to prepare for matches as well as recruitment. The article also predicted that without these vital statistics, the 2013 season would start in chaos. Why would any other sport today, including baseball, be different? What's shown here, like listening to the sound of the bat, is an outdated and impractical fantasy, argued unpersuasively. <br/><br/>The charisma of the film's leads adds a little more belief to the father-daughter side of the story. Amy Adams' form is first class, blistering with the same toughness and grit that Eastwood is best known for himself. They share great chemistry together and exchange some wonderfully comic verbal stoushes. She sarcastically says at one point in the film: ""It must be so rewarding being one of your close friends"". Although Eastwood is starting to look weary, he can still throw down the odd good line or two, like when he comments that his garage is shrinking after scratching his car. There are also a couple of scenes where his own sense of invulnerability, coupled with his ailing eyesight, provides some briefly tense moments. <br/><br/>Yet it's the script that lets the actors down again because it doesn't know how to develop the central relationship. Gus and Mickey fight, watch baseball together, and fight some more, right until an unmoving revelation is tacked on at the end. The lack of drama is compounded by Timberlake's character. He's very charming and funny, but if Gus is unconcerned about Johnny romancing his daughter, where's the tension? Mickey's relationship with Johnny itself is also very old fashioned and overly safe. He's laid-back, she's not, and they discover they both love baseball and go swimming in a lake together. Jumping in that ice-cold water is about as radical as this film ever becomes. With an overdose of pleasantness and few dramatic high points, the film becomes tedious viewing. Nonetheless, it won't tarnish Clint's legacy too much: it'll be forgotten before then."

","Trouble With A Curve casts Clint Eastwood as an aging baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves with both family and health issues. His family is his daughter Amy Adams who is a young attorney whom he hasn't seen in years. His health issues include macular degeneration of his eyes and a scout without good vision is handicapped in his job. My late uncle had that and I know how that eventually impaired him.<br/><br/>Clint's imparted a lot of his baseball knowledge to Adams and Braves GM John Goodman has asked Adams to accompany Eastwood on a scouting trip to the minor leagues before the annual draft to check on a prospect as the Braves have the number one draft pick in the National League. A lot of air is cleared in this trip.<br/><br/>Also Clint renews an another old acquaintance with Justin Timberlake who was a former pitcher that Clint signed back in the day, but who blew his arm out and now he's a scout for the Boston Red Sox who have the number one draft pick in the American League. Adams and Timberlake hit it off, but the road to romance is a rocky one. A washed up ball player and an upwardly mobile yuppie attorney are not a usual mix.<br/><br/>Though the film isn't quite of the level of Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, it's still a real treat for Eastwood fans. Like Million Dollar Baby the best scenes are Clint and Amy's just as in the other film his scenes with Hilary Swank his surrogate daughter. Timberlake also proves to be a capable actor.<br/><br/>Although Adams saves Clint's job with a gift of sorts, you know eventually he will have to quit. But like all other Eastwood characters, he's going to do it on his own terms. And she could have a nice career in a baseball front office as women increasingly are making an impact in all areas of the sport except the actual playing field.<br/><br/>Trouble With The Curve if nothing else proves Eastwood is a great judge of material that's still good for him and that takes into account his age. He's one productive 80 something when he's not involved in politics and talking to an empty chair."

Said grown-up child (Amy Adams) has no recollection of the molestation but can recite every baseball statistic known to man like an encyclopedia. Alrightee then, a few contrivances there, Mr. Randy Brown. But then we move on to the black and white characters so beloved of Hollywoodland.

And didn't really connect solidly with the storyline.<br/><br/>The entire final scene at the ballpark seemed like they just threw it together. Mickey able to bring in an unknown prospect?

"vinophilia-1","5","16","31","24 September 2012"," ""Curve"" Falters Down the Stretch
","I love baseball, and the thought of Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old baseball scout with Amy Adams as his daughter sounded great to me. ""Trouble with the Curve"" gets off to a great start -- unshaven Clint eating breakfast out of yesterday's SPAM can, Amy rattling off baseball trivia like it ran in her blood. Unfortunately, after developing these characters with great potential the script gives them nothing to hit with.<br/><br/>Clint plays a character named Gus, an old legendary baseball scout in the Atlanta Braves organization who is having trouble with his eyesight. His wife died when Mickey, his daughter played by Amy Adams, was six, leaving lots of father-daughter issues to resolve on film, as you can imagine. Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former ballplayer, was scouted by Gus but eventually traded to the Red Sox, who's mismanagement resulted in a torn rotator cuff and a short career. He feels he owes Gus for the chance he got and ends up falling for Mickey (naturally). <br/><br/>Right from the start, fluffy dialogue falls flat over and over again, leaving awkward silences and empty arguments. Amy Adams in particular seems to chafe under the poorly written dialogue. At times Mickey uses casual language with her peers that would never pass in a big city law firm. A romantic scene at a lake between her and Johnny breaks down, making it difficult to believe the romantic energy between them. Even during the critical scenes between Gus and his daughter, the dialogue goes exactly as every viewer expects it to, leaving us slightly self satisfied but not exactly entertained.<br/><br/>There are some lovely scenes, to be sure, and great footage of clogging in a local bar. Clint, Amy and Justin are always fun to watch, and they were entertaining in ""Trouble with the Curve"", but their warm performances could not compensate for a predictable script with awkward dialogue. <br/><br/>An airplane movie but nothing more."
"imseeg","9","2","2","15 October 2019"," Heartfelt, true to life and witty portrait of family bonds and good old American baseball. NOT suited for diehard baseball fans though...
","Beware: NOT suited for diehard baseball fans. Because this is NOT a straight sports movie at all, hence the many negative reviews of sportsfans, expecting a sports movie which it definitely is NOT.<br/><br/>What is it then? It is a great and witty tale about strained family bonds between a roughneck father (Clint Eastwood) and a resentful daughter (Amy Adams), who dont share any interests at all, besides baseball. But baseball only comes second in this story. Baseball is only the background in a story which portrays a father (Eastwood) who constantly snarls at his only daughter and neglects her. While the daughter (Amy Adams) still desperately needs love and attention from her father. And so it goes...<br/><br/>The dialogues about the arguing between father and daughter are true to life, touching and full of wit and undisclosed affection. Although father (Clint Eastwood) and daughter (Amy Adams) can not get along, they still love each other, they simply cant show it. Only baseball brings them together and this movie is about one weekend father and daughter spent together scouting for baseball talents in which many heartfelt, unspoken conflicts from the past come out in the open. Justin Timberlake provides for a budding romance interlude...<br/><br/>This movie has got so much charm, wit and lighthearted drama, that it is undeniably a winner. I've already seen it many times before and every time it touches me and lifts up my spirit. Highly recommended for any fans of either one of these 3 actors, because this movie is definitely a wonderful actor's gem!"
"zkonedog","8","2","2","5 March 2017"," Eastwood's Well-Rounded Return To Acting
","After starring in the remarkable ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2004, then following it up with the gritty ""Gran Torino"" in 2008, Clint Eastwood announced his ""retirement"" from acting, instead focusing on on directing/producing films. When the script for ""Trouble with the Curve"" came along, though, Mr. Eastwood decided that it was too good of a vehicle to pass up. Thus, in his return to leading-man status, the 82-year old thespian proves that his filmmaking (or film-choosing) instincts are as solid as ever.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Trouble with the Curve"" focuses on Gus (Eastwood), an aged baseball scout who relies on his eyes, senses, and gut feelings to scout the top prospects. The trouble is, his eyes are failing and his job is on the line. As such, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is concerned about him and gives a call to Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter. Predictably, the father-daughter duo do not share a strong relationship with each, and that is tested on a road trip together to scout the newest ""can't miss"" prospect. Along the way, rival scout Johnny (Justin Timberlake) teaches both parts of the duo a little something about each other and their lives.<br/><br/>When evaluating ""Trouble with the Curve"", there is one thing that you must do: Absolutely DO NOT try to compare it to ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Gran Torino"". It's not even so much that it doesn't measure up to those movies (although it doesn't), but rather that it takes a bit of a different tone. It is a bit more light-hearted and not nearly as ""life-or-death serious"" as those other flicks.<br/><br/>When looked at under its own merits, then, ""Curve"" is an excellent film that does everything it sets out to do. The plot is interesting enough to keep you invested, the emotion runs high throughout, and the acting is superb. Eastwood is his typical self, while Adams and Timberlake provide the much-needed camaraderie that a movie like this needs from time to time. The characters aren't quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more ""telling"" of emotions than ""showing"", generally speaking), but they are still engaging.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Trouble with the Curve"" is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together. All those themes have been done better in other movies, but having them all play off each other still manages to produce a cinematic treat. I hope Eastwood still continues to shine ON the camera as well as BEHIND it, but if this does turn out to be his final acting role, there is no reason to look back with any regret."
"kosmasp","7","2","2","22 July 2013"," Feeling and hearing it
","I didn't think Clint Eastwood would star in a movie he doesn't direct anymore. Actually I never thought he'd star in a movie period. Then again Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake are there to support him. And if you look at it closely it's more an Amy Adams vehicle. Still the daughter-father relationship is explored in major detail here. And it works for the movie as well, even if it sometimes feels a little clichéd.<br/><br/>I'm not that familiar with the game as most Americans are, but the theme of technology against human is not uncommon. And it shouldn't surprise when you have Clint in the movie either. There is drama and there is comedy, but everything is carried by the three mentioned performances. They are believable and if you can dig the story, you will like the movie too"
"classicsoncall","7","2","2","9 June 2013"," ""Is that it. Is that all you got?""
","Well I think Mr. Eastwood threw us all a curve ball this time. This isn't so much a movie about baseball as it is about relationships and coming to terms with advancing old age, and there probably isn't a better role model for portraying that realistically than Clint. One thing is sure, Eastwood isn't afraid to film himself in an unfavorable light. There's one scene where he's looking at himself in the mirror and he looks even older than his eighty two years; it was rather shocking to this viewer who has occasion to view a young Rowdy Yates riding the trail in 'Rawhide' every now and then.<br/><br/>Considering Eastwood's most recent work, ""Trouble With the Curve"" isn't going to rank up there with films like ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Gran Torino"". Those pictures had his directorial touch, a quality that's notably absent here. Character and story development seem almost secondary here, and even though the pace of the film progresses smoothly enough, much of it is predictable without any twists or surprises.<br/><br/>The thing that kept me off balance a bit here was the role of Bo Gentry. Considering the importance of his character to the flow of the story, I kept wondering why the film makers selected a non-athletic looking Joe Massengill to play the part. He had the annoying blow hard thing going well enough, but he just didn't look like a good ball player to me, even as he was hitting them out of the park. It didn't surprise me one bit when old Peanut Boy blew his doors off to end the story.<br/><br/>Baseball fans interested in the science of the game won't find this in the same league as ""Moneyball"", but if you're looking for a breezy picture to while away a couple hours this fills the bill well enough. There's definitely a nod to the youthful audience with Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake on hand, while John Goodman surprises portraying a generally sympathetic character trying to bridge the father/daughter divide between the principal players. If you lower your expectations from some of Clint Eastwood's other recent work, this will manage to entertain fairly well."
"TxMike","Null","2","2","12 February 2013"," Well-balanced baseball themed movie, Adams and Timberlake play well off Eastwood.
","I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s as a baseball fan, playing some ball and seeing teams like the Dodgers, the Cardinals, the Mets, the Giants, and the Colt 45s play MLB. So seeing this baseball themed movie with a veteran like Clint Eastwood was just a joy. There is little actual baseball playing here, the focus is on scouting. Embedded is the story of a man and the strained relationship with his adult daughter, a high-powered Atlanta lawyer.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is veteran scout Gus, who does it the old-fashioned way, he reads newspapers, goes out to see what prospects look like, and has developed a sense that allows him to ""hear"" clues. But old Gus is losing his eyesight, he stumbles over things, he gets angry, everyone around him senses something is wrong, but Gus is too proud to admit he has early macular degeneration. Plus the hot-shot scouts using computers for their scouting razz him about being out of date.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is one of my favorite actresses, she is very attractive and athletic, and always creates interesting characters. Here as daughter Mickey (named after Mickey Mantle) she must be a top-notch, hard-nosed lawyer pushing for partnership in the firm, plus be a capable, knowledgeable baseball person who has ""scouting"" instincts. She and Gus have not been on good terms for years, since her mom died when Mickey was 6. She always struggled with what she saw as Gus simply being an ""absent father"".<br/><br/>Gus may lose his job when his contract expires in 3 months, he has a critical scouting trip coming up, Mickey learns about his eye problem by pressing the eye doctor, so to protect her dad she takes time off a critical project of her own to join him on the scouting trip. This eventually affords them the opportunity to clear some things up.<br/><br/>One of the people she meets in Justin Timberlake as Johnny, an old friend of her dad's, he was recruited by Gus as a pitcher but his career ended prematurely from being over-pitched and he suffered shoulder injuries. So now he is scouting, and hoping for a promotion to on-air commentator for the home team.<br/><br/>While the whole story is straightforward and easy to follow, there is a lot of complexity and the movie is done very well. Plus the resolution in the last couple of scenes is very heartwarming. My wife and I both enjoyed it. Good movie.<br/><br/>I saw it twice, 4 days apart, and enjoyed it even more the second time.<br/><br/>A bit of trivia, there is a character, Rigo, who is working as a peanut vendor at a school baseball game. When he tosses a bag it seems that he has a pretty good arm. Later he becomes the subject of a ""discovery"" as a lefthanded pitcher. Jay Galloway, totally new actor, plays that role, he was chosen because he in actuality is a lefthanded pitcher in school.<br/><br/>(Of note, the young hitter Billy Clark, lonesome for his mom, is played by Clint's real-life son Scott Eastwood.) <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The hot-shot computerized recruiters drafted a kid who was a good hitter, but Gus and Mickey had determined he can't hit a curve ball (""Trouble with The Curve""). Meanwhile Mickey ""discovered"" Rigo, throwing outside her motel room, she put on the mitt and caught a few, ""listened"" for the right sound. She talked Gus's boss into giving him a tryout. He pitched against the new recruit, who failed to make even contact with any pitch, fastball or curveball. Mickey would give up her quest for law firm partnership and become an agent as a start to her baseball career."

","I am not into sports, really, and I am very picky in seeing sports- related movies; as for baseball, I neither comprehend the rules nor find the game attractive. But I have had my exceptions due to actors I like - recently Moneyball (because of Brad Pitt) and now Trouble with the Curve - because of Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>And again, I was not disappointed - the over 80-years-old man shows no signs of weariness, although he has been on top since 1960ies. All his co-actors are great as well: Amy Adams, John Goodman, even Justin Timberlake, whose songs are uninviting to me... And the plot is pleasant to watch, sports terms and nuances are explained, and the storyline has its twists in spite of several guesses and predictions. And there is no moralizing reasoning on important, at times painful issues - viewers are smoothly ""filled"" with the points and ideas the makers find important. <br/><br/>Well, the director and producer Robert Lorentz is no novice, being first and famous for his collaboration with Eastwood. And the result is another nice movie worth watching - even for no-sportsmen like me."

","This movie isn't about baseball any more than Star Trek is about how to operate a space ship. Baseball is merely the background, like music is in the back ground.<br/><br/>As in Eastwood's other most successful recent movies this is a story about relationships, the meaning of life and the bitter sweet of partial redemption.<br/><br/>So if you enjoyed ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""The Unforgiven"" and ""Grand Torino"" you will enjoy this movie just as much. The one dramatic element that isn't in this movie, that was in those others, is due to the script and not some failing by the director.<br/><br/>This was a great first time effort by Lorenzo. Clint Eastwood has some really, really touching scenes when he's not in his grumpy old man mode.

","They lost me as soon as they said, ""we can work out a draft-and-trade deal."" You can't do that in baseball. It's so basic. Not to mention that no player in the history of baseball has been drafted in the early rounds without at least 3 scouts viewing him. In today's game, the GM would also watch plenty of video. Further, no top 5 pick can be make or break for any scout. There is so much info on kids that highly regarded that 1,000 mock drafts from geeks on the Internet would have 4 of the same top 5 names and most in order. On top of that, a 17-year old wouldn't make it to the Majors for 5+ years. The aging scout (Eastwood) would be retired, if not dead prior to the Braves knowing if he panned out. All so silly on the baseball side of it all."

","I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. But I sure won't recall this movie when bringing up his best films.<br/><br/>Why? Well, first off, Clint basically reprises his Walt Kowalski role from Gran Torino...grizzled old warrior who refuses to accept the fact that he's getting old, has medical problems, and can be a hard man to get to know, even if you are an immediate relative.<br/><br/>The movie is so predictable it's ridiculous. You know Gus (Clint) will be proved right when he insists to his bosses, who of course think the game has passed him by, that their ""can't miss"" prospective first round draft choice, will indeed, miss. Like when he tries to hit a curve ball, hence the movie's title.<br/><br/>The phenom is an arrogant kid who is already talking about the mega endorsement deals he will be signing, all the women he will sleep with, and all the money he's already starting to make, selling autographs at $25 a pop, with the help of his father, who's as arrogant as his son.<br/><br/>You also know that once his daughter Mickey leaves her law firm - right on the cusp of handling a big case that if she wins will almost guarantee herself a partnership she's dreamed of - for a ""vacation"" to help her father see (yes, SEE!) this potential number one draft choice and add her impressions, she's never going back there.<br/><br/>Gus runs into an ex-player he scouted who now is a scout himself for the team that is picking right before Gus' team does. Surprise, surprise, this ex-player (Johnny) and Mickey become an item. Then partly based on Gus' sense that the hot prospect is not what he appears, Johnny advises his team to pass on the kid. Then Gus' team goes against his advice and drafts the prospect anyway, leaving Johnny to feel he's been set up by both father and daughter.<br/><br/>Then it gets even better...when checking out of the hotel she stayed at to watch this prospect, Mickey sees the hotel maid's kid (who never pitched in high school, and to boot, was the peanut vendor for the prospect's high school team) pitching in his street clothes and she ends up catching a few pitches herself, then calling Gus' boss to say she's found THE all time diamond in the rough, and that Gus' boss owes her for being sent to keep an eye out and help her dad.<br/><br/>The help involves allowing her to parade this kid onto the field while the team's prize prospect is taking batting practice. Right, teams do that all the time.<br/><br/>What do you think happens in the end, huh? The kid pitcher of course embarrasses the prospect, who couldn't hit his curve with a paddle. Gus is vindicated, his daughter apparently will become the next Billy Beane...and of course Johnny comes back and reunites with Mickey.<br/><br/>What an embarrassment this movie was. Possibly the worst movie Clint Eastwood was ever involved with."

That man, Pete Silver (played by Matthew Lillard) is determined to fire Gus even though he is completely unaware of Gus's failing eyesight. To Silver, a man who relies on statistics and equations over experience and first-hand observation, Gus is a relic of a time gone by. Gus is given one chance, scouting a highly-coveted player in North Carolina, to prove his value to the organization. Pete worries about his friend and so, behind his back, he contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams). Mickey is a lawyer on a partnership track in a prestigious firm with a pressing case on the horizon. She's been told that her handling of this case will determine the outcome of the upcoming partnership vote. Still, despite a strained relationship between the two of them, she chooses to go to her father's aide in rural North Carolina and work in her hotel room and over the internet. When Gus informs Mickey that his eyes are starting to fail him, she begins taking an active role in her father's scouting trip. A task she is well-suited for, after a spending a large portion of her formative years by her father's side on scouting trips. In addition to colleagues Gus has known for many years, there is Johnny Flanagan, a relatively inexperienced scout who Gus recruited into the major leagues and who later suffered a career-ending injury. Johnny (played by Justin Timberlake) thinks of Gus as a mentor and, separately, takes an immediate romantic interest in Mickey.<br/><br/>Now, many believed that 2008's Gran Torino would be the end of Eastwood's career, both as a director and an actor. Some who thought little of the film even took great joy in the very idea of Eastwood's retirement. I was not among them. I won't say this is better than Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby, it isn't. Still, it's an enjoyable film about the endurance of family that also manages to incorporate some timeless wisdom regarding the quintessential American sport. The budding relationship between Mickey and Johnny isn't given as much time, though that's probably for the best."

Along the way Gus reconnects with Johnny, a rival team's scout who has a friendly history with Gus, as Gus was the man who scouted him when he was a baseball player, and who also takes an interest in Mickey. <br/><br/>Though predictable and somewhat dramatically underwhelming, it benefits from Eastwood's grizzled charisma as he looks a in his 80's and lot trimmer compared to some of the performers in this film half his age. He may be the only octogenarian actor who has to play older than his age to be convincing. Added to that, his easy chemistry with a charming Adams benefits the film so much. Both do the best they can with the cornball sentimentality and cheesy dialogue which turns out great as this film is a stunning, beautiful surprise. Like the baseball diamond that features so prominently, we all know which base will be dutifully tapped next and that a home run for the characters is inevitable. It is a sports movie, a romance without sentimentality, and the emotional trauma of a family secret."

","Despite announcing his retirement from acting some years back after appearing in ""Gran Torino"", Clint Eastwood is at it again. This time around he plays Gus, an aging baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves who is concealing the fact that he is starting to lose his eyesight. Nonetheless he gets himself assigned to select their first-draft pick before (perhaps) being shunted into retirement by a younger generation who trust computers more than experience, knowledge, and intuition. Knowing that Gus is in trouble, his best friend (John Goodman) persuades his estranged daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to go on the road with him to North Carolina to help out. Mickey is a fanatic about baseball because it was her only way to connect with him during her childhood when he seemingly all but abandoned her after her mother died. The film then depicts how Gus and Mickey awkwardly try to rebuild what looks like an irreparably broken relationship. <br/><br/>The plot has enough twists and turns to hold the viewer's attention and subtly highlights the central theme of how rewarding, complex, and difficult real human relationships can be. All the principals are in top form, including Justin Timberlake as a former draft of Gus' who is shooting for a job as a sports announcer, but Amy Adams is especially good- she delivers a perfectly tuned and moving performance. The strong supporting cast are excellent also. <br/><br/>All in all this is a gently funny, unpretentious, and well-acted human drama with a big beautiful heart."

","I thought this was going to be just another sports film but it isn't, its about an ageing baseball scout with ongoing eyesight problems and the strained relationship he has with his daughter, and its excellent viewing. Eastwood may be in his eighties now but he still has a massive screen presence. He and Amy Adams really do have chemistry and both are absolutely believable as father and daughter. Amy takes time off work as a corporate lawyer to help look after her father, and as she tries to unravel the reason for her troubled upbringing, so her own character begins to mellow and the start of a romance begins with Justin Timberlake. Not your typical Eastwood action flick, but a really good story nonetheless with top acting from an excellent cast. well worth watching"

Shows what style and experience can do with a relatively mundane script, and turn it into something worthwhile, no, it's not Clint's greatest, but if he were never to appear in front of a camera again, it would be a worthy swansong!

","Do I watch Clint Eastwood movies? Not really. He's pretty much the gruff neighbor we never want to deal with in every movie. But could that screen persona work in a dramady about an old grumpy man? It sure did. After the heaviness of Gran Torino, it's great to see something he's involved with that's a little more relaxing. Does it still have some moments that give you a lump in your throat? Yeah, it's Eastwood, so yes. But Amy Adams was, for me, the very best part of this movie. Her character is a tough businesswoman, whose crustiness stems from her father, obviously. But she has issues to work through. And I know she won't win an Oscar for *this* film, but my goodness were my heartstrings pulled by her performance! There's a good mix of comedy and drama for a balance, I thought. Although it's really and truly only going to appeal to a lot of older folks, I certainly think it'd be enjoyed by younger people as well. (I know I loved it.) What I enjoyed about it: Amy Adams was the best part for me. I loved her performance, and felt for her character very much. Elsewhere, it was funny and sweet despite a few uncomfortable moments, story-wise.<br/><br/>What I didn't enjoy: The heavier dramatic/thematic moments brought down the fun factor, but not too, too much. Also, Matthew Lillard's character was just such a jerk, it marred a few scenes until you just wanted him to go away and never come back.<br/><br/>So give this a try, I really liked it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is a terrific movie with top-notch performance by Clint Eastwood who deserves an acting Oscar for his authentic portrayal of an aged, but still gifted, scout for a professional baseball team who refuses to rely on computer stats to judge new talent. Despite the onset of losing his eyesight, he retains the energy to travel around small-town America to view young talent and confidently judge whether they can cut it in the big leagues. <br/><br/>But, he is a grumpy old guy with a troubled past, which is where his relationship with his daughter, expertly played by Amy Adams, comes into play when she takes a break from her hard-driving law job to ""be his eyes"". Their relationship has a lot of baggage, however, so there are many great father-daughter scenes of frustration and misunderstanding. These are believably played by Eastwood and Adams, and made me care about the characters and become totally engaged. Our whole family loved this film.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is brilliant in his ability to project toughness with vulnerability."
"secondtake","4","5","9","17 September 2013"," Trouble indeed--with the movie, with the writing and direction most of all
","Trouble with the Curve (2012)<br/><br/>It might be that Clint Eastwood deserves credit for growing old less than gracefully, stumbling a bit, his eyes fogging, and insisting on being a chauvinist even with his talented daughter (played by Amy Adams). His role here is not especially attractive, though it does carry the typical touch guy attitudes that are essential to his character (and seen in other recent movies where he stars such as ""Gran Torino"").<br/><br/>However, this small, predictable tale is not directed by Eastwood, and I'm amazed to hear myself say I wish it had been. It would have lifted it up a little, at the very least, and this needed all the help it could get. Several stellar actors and a theme as warm and fuzzy as apple pie are wasted here in what is a simplistic, linear, disappointing exercise. <br/><br/>So who is here? Wow, take John Goodman and Justin Timberlake as secondary characters. Both play ""themselves"" to a large degree, Timberlake squandered the most by making him a restrained pretty boy and little more. Throw in Adams in her main role, a bit hampered by some lame writing but chipper enough. She is meant to be damaged goods from a bad childhood, and has put career (as a lawyer) over happiness. You know this will crack one way or another.<br/><br/>And then Eastwood as the driving force even as he is supported, almost literally, by these other three. As a legendary baseball scout with a ""feel"" for the game, including its sounds and subtle hints of talent and flaws, he is the opposite of the main character in ""Moneyball,"" Billy Beane, who used computers to assess baseball talent. Unfortunately, ""Moneyball"" came out one year before this one and is a first-class movie top to bottom, making ""Trouble with the Curve"" even more insufficient. You might even think this was a cheap try at cashing in on the interest in the theme.<br/><br/>The fact is, the theme--judging baseball talent in human ways--is only superficially explored, and then mostly in the last part of the film when the other themes have taken front seat. These other aspects are equally thin, however--an obvious and thin romance, a reconciliation between daughter and father (with no real work, just a need to fill out the script), and finally a redemption in the old ways of baseball. The end to the movie, which I hardly need to disguise, is pure, sappy, stuff that makes even ""Field of Dreams"" look complex and realistic.<br/><br/>Skip this one. If you like baseball, you'll want to skip this one even more. I love the game and found this belittling and cheap. And a lousy movie."
"zardoz-13","10","6","12","28 September 2012"," One of Clint's Best!!!
","Clint Eastwood provides another variation on his grumpy old man act in freshman director Robert Lorenz's ""Trouble with the Curve,"" a captivating saga about an aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout whose contract is up for renewal. This PG-13 Eastwood epic is one of the few where Clint doesn't brandish a firearm to solve his problems. He does have a scene in a southern bar where he threatens to slash a drunkard's throat with a shattered beer bottle for getting fresh with his grown-up daughter. The rest of the time, he grimaces, squints, and carries on like a crotchety old man. As it turns out, he is cast as an old man with ailing eyes and an attitude. Part of his attitude emerges from doing things the old-fashioned way. He scouts players by attending games in Podunk towns galore and listening to the sound that the baseball makes as it breezes through the air. Comparatively, ""Trouble with the Curve"" pits Clint against younger guys who prefer to base their scouting decisions strictly on the statistics that they juggle on their laptops. Basically, this movie concerns the generation gap and the difference between the way men conduct business with either first-hand information or second-hand information. ""Trouble with the Curve"" amounts to the baseball rebuttal to the Brad Pitt movie ""Money Ball."" Although you know what is going to happen before it does in this pleasing but poignant picture about baseball scouts, ""Trouble with the Curve"" has a lot of balls and throws them in a variety of ways. Amy Adams co-stars as Clint's adult daughter who has spent most of her life away from her single father living with relatives. Part of the conflict occurs between the two have been apart so long that they don't function together well when they are in each other's company."

","If you live in London and read the Evening Standard best ignore what their s0-called critic said and read instead the great reviews on IMDb. It's clear that there was insufficient cgi, S&V, all-round gore and body count for the Standar's cretinous critic. Time the Standard deep-sixed this cat and hire someone who knows his ass from third base movie-wise. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to be troubling the judges at Oscar time and/or the Festival circuit but then Robert Lorenz isn't Joe Wright; he's a first-time director who realises that most audiences want entertainment not pretentious dross. In short this is our old friend the feel-good movie, sadly in decline of late; if you want to BE pretentious you could call it a Rom-Com with attitude. It's less about baseball than about relationships, father-daughter, man-woman, and it delivers on both. I doubt if I've ever seen Amy Adams give a bad performance and she doesn't break the streak here. Eastwood too is ageing like Jack Daniel's. I'm not saying it'll hold up five, ten years down the line but right now it's a triple play."

My only concern is that Eastwood seems to be playing the same characters over and over again in his old age, I'm not sure if he's getting typecast or if he is just genuinely playing himself.<br/><br/>Amy Adams puts in the performance of her career and rises to the moment, often outperforming against the far more experienced Eastwood.<br/><br/>There is a certain magic quality about baseball and this film captures it well, the passion, the tradition, at times you can almost smell the leather of the catcher's mitt.<br/><br/>This is a movie about family, the human spirit and not so much about sport. If you're looking for crowning moments, championship wins and all American heroes then you've come to the wrong place.

","Clint Eastwood is back, and this time he decided to take a break behind the camera and appear in front in his first acting appearance since 2008's Gran Torino in Trouble With The Curve, a nice family drama that has its flaws but knows what it's talking about when it comes to family and baseball. Wow what a long sentence.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Gus, a baseball scout who neglects his vision. He's on thin ice, and if he screws up his next recruiting job, then he's fired. His estranged daughter Mickey (the lovely Amy Adams) is a bit frightened to talk to him, and she doesn't really connect with him due to their past. But she feels that she must help him on this, so she joins him on his scouting trip, and the two sort of try to patch things up. Throw Justin Timberlake into the mix as a former baseball player who's becoming a scout who forms a spark with Mickey.<br/><br/>TWTC is a bit of a cliché. The story might have been done before. First time director Robert Lorenz, who usually produces Eastwood's movies, didn't take the best of notes that he could've. But I am not saying that the movie doesn't work. It does, and well. It's difficult finding actors more enjoyable than Eastwood, Adams, and Timberlake.<br/><br/>Eastwood does here what he did in Gran Torino, and it works. Nothing is more delightful. Adams is just such a wonderful actress and you really can't take your eyes off of her. The moments that the two of them share are the best, and luckily, there are plenty of them. This movie is real, and if not on par with some of Eastwood's directorial efforts, it's still satisfying.<br/><br/>I was charmed by the chemistry that the two leads shared. They do such a good job of playing a father/daughter pair that click. It's a nice movie, and though you may see some of it's plot points coming a mile away, you can't deny the movies charm.

While away, she meets a young scout for the Red Sox (Justin Timberlake).<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable as Clint plays a man perhaps too much like himself. Amy Adams was magnificent as the shunned daughter in what amounted to an improbable film. The movie spends time to develop character for a plot that lacks the action associated with Eastwood films. A heart warming film for Eastwood fans. Worthy of a view and might make for a decent date night film. Border line chick flick.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb. Some spicy language. No sex or nudity."
"SimonJack","7","1","1","15 November 2018"," One of the better baseball scouting films
","""Trouble with the Curve"" is one of the best movies made to date about baseball scouting. There have been a few over the years. But as with sports films in general, those are mostly on the high end with lots of glitter. This film shows much more of what must be the mundane life of scouts who drive from town to town and stay in mom and pop motels. They do this week after week to watch and check out ball players.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood stars as an aging scout whose future looms as one in retirement. He doesn't want to quit, and has wisdom in spotting players strengths and weaknesses. That only comes from experience. His job in scouting a possible first place pick for the Atlanta Braves is being challenged by a younger, whiz-kid computer jockey who goes by the stats of the electronic media.<br/><br/>Eastwood's Gus has a daughter whose upbringing was dysfunctional. But Mickey has made good in a legal career. For many years, her dad took her on scouting trips, and she is a baseball nut as well. Now she leaves her work with a big case facing her, to be with her dad. One can guess where this will go, with romance entering the picture.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable and satisfying sports movie and family drama. It's one of the first films Eastwood has made in a number of years that he didn't also direct. His roles of an older man, which he is in real life, have become predictable in his impatience and irascibility. That's beginning to wear a little thin."
"MovieManChuck","Null","1","1","16 August 2018"," A very entertaining Clint Eastwood baseball drama.
","3/4<br/><br/>The Trouble with the Curve tackles issues in the sport of baseball untouched in film up to this point, even in similar movies such as Moneyball (2011). It gives a more desperate feel to the corporate and scouting life in the MLB. The struggle at hand is the top job in the scouting office, parallel with the open bench on the Atlanta Braves.<br/><br/>One thing I really like is the title: The Trouble with the Curve. It is a double-entendre of sorts: an aspiring MLB player having trouble hitting curve balls, and the protagonist losing his periforals. It centers around Braves top-scout Gus Lobel, who knows the dynamics of baseball in-and-out. They want to replace him with a youngblood yuppie scout because he knows his way around modern technology and baseball databases, all due to his waning eyesight. The story is an emotional ride about reclaiming his normal life, as well as his relationship with his estranged daughter (played by Amy Adams).<br/><br/>While the script is creative, there are moments where it drifts lazily. While it never fails to pick itself back up, this movie has its own troubke with the curve. It makes for a very finely preformed, entertaining, movie that feels a bit predictable.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to fans of true-story sports movies. It sheds light on some topics other movies in the genre have passed over, and it captivated you in the process."
"tomjtleslie","8","1","1","4 July 2018"," Wonderful return for Eastwood
","I had previously read that Clint Eastwood had retired from acting following his wonderful performance in Gran Torino. Many were displeased, perhaps, especially after such a great last showing for him, but I was among those who felt it was a good thing. I always liked the man's acting, but after such a long and terrific career, I felt the old man had earned the right to hang it up if he wanted to.<br/><br/>So when I heard he was returning for this film, I thought it odd and a bit troubling even. Had they tricked a senile old man into doing something he didn't really want to do, against his better judgment? Why ruin a good career with a potentially mediocre baseball movie, especially after going out with a bang like Gran Torino. Better to just leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>And I heard the reviews. Not great. Just okay. I felt bad. I won't watch it, I said. I'll boycott. And I didn't watch it for many years, but finally I turned it on one day when I was bored and hungover and it was drizzling and gloomy outside. And boy, I'm glad I did. It made my day so much better and it really was great to see the old man back in action, doing what he does best. I'd like to see him back for many roles to come. Even if it is just another baseball movie."

"jasoncalloway","8","1","1","3 February 2018"," Better than expected
","Have to say that I am truly shocked that this movie was not talked about like it should have been. Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood, is a baseball scout nearing the age of retirement that is struggling with old age and staying relevant in the business and to be a good father to his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams). This is not your standard sports movie that focuses on winning and losing, it rather is a film designed to show a theme that somethings are hard for a reason. The editing used in this film creates a story of pros and cons between technology and hard work, as well as, the hard decisions that a single father had to make.
 I love baseball and I was expecting a little more of it throughout this movie, but like all other Eastwood movies, I was sucked into the drama packed storyline in this movie. Between the struggles with Gus's age, technology trying to replace scouting experts, the tattered relationship between and father and daughter, and the reluctance to enter a relationship, I found myself watching closer and closer. I imagined this movie to be a lot like Money Ball but was sadly mistaken. Between the up and coming actors, Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake (Johnny Flanagan), and the well-established actors, John Goodman (Pete Klein) and Clint Eastwood, the acting was on point and very believable. Director Robert Lorenz did an amazing job of piecing together a few different plots into one cohesive film. The motif and the seldom used blurry camera view were instrumental in showing the viewer that although some things seem to be apparent, sometimes you have to dig deeper to find the answer. 
 All the plot points that I identified throughout this movie fit into my thematic ideas that somethings are hard for reason and that you have look beyond the obvious to find the answer. It was amazing that Robert Lorenz was able to take these three very different plots and convert them into one cohesive movie was amazing. This is a must see and will keep watching till the end. If you think that it is just about sports, your wrong. This would be a great compromise for the couple that wants to watch a movie that will keep both of them entertained."

","I liked this one quite a bit even though it borders on predictable and Clint Eastwood portrays exactly the same hard headed, grumpy old man character he did in 'Gran Torino' and 'Million Dollar Baby'. Amy Adams is likable and engaging as his daughter and there is also a more than decent back up cast in Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Robert Patrick, Matthew Lillard and George Wyner.<br/><br/>This is not so much a baseball movie as a drama following Gus Lobel, a veteran talent scout for the Atlanta Braves whose eyesight (and ability to pee) is failing him. The front office begins to question if he has become to old to continue and an upcoming scouting job could be his last.<br/><br/>This brings in his estranged daughter who reteams with Gus, putting her own career in jeopardy while hoping to finally get some answers from dad who (in another cliché Clint storyline) can't let go of the past.<br/><br/>We also get a lukewarm romance between Adams and a former pick of Gus's turned rival scout named Johnny (Timberlake).<br/><br/>As a whole this was unchallenging and predictable but also heartwarming and charming in an old fashioned movie sort of way.

","A nice feel good film. Nothing too special, but entertaining enough for a couple of hours. I'm not much for Sports films, but this had a lighthearted feeling and a reconnecting with your family story at its core. So, surprisingly enough for me, it held my interest.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is known for being the image of the though Western Cowboy, but here is less though than you might expect. He does a nice job of showing something I've rarely see from him in films, a vulnerability and some great emotional moments. It was a touching aspect to this film and it reminded me of what good of an actor Eastwood can be. Maybe he has been typecast as the cowboy too often? I think he is great in Westerns, but it was very nice to see him do something different.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is cozy and it feels very much warmhearted in some way. But, of course, it has a fair share of clichéd moments. You can pretty much guess what's going to happen while watching it. There are some comedic moments that fell a little flat and a few subplots that could have been skipped. Towards the end it felt convenient and I thought the filmmakers could have dared to make some twist to make it stand out more.<br/><br/>What made the movie work was the warmhearted feeling throughout and it has some good intentions, I can tell. I wish it would have avoided some convenient story beats. There's a scene were Eastwood tells an emotional story and it was delivered in such a touching way that it will stick with me. So, I'm not gonna forget this movie.<br/><br/>If you don't feel like watching something too exciting or hard hitting, then this movie is harmless enough to be enjoyed during a cozy afternoon."

","Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams as father and daughter attempt to connect in ""Trouble with the Curve"" from 2012.<br/><br/>For those who criticized the baseball part of the film, asking if the production had a consultant, etc., I will say that the baseball was what Hitchcock called ""The McGuffin"" - an excuse for the real story.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Gus, an Atlanta Braves scout who has been in the business for perhaps too long - he has macular degeneration and glaucoma - maybe - but he won't see a specialist. His daughter, Mickey, is a lawyer heading for partner in a high-powered Atlanta firm. It's scouting time again, and Gus' boss and friend Pete (John Goodman) is afraid he isn't up to it. There is a newcomer to the team administration who uses computers to choose players, and his eye is on a kid named Gentry. <br/><br/>Nervous, Pete calls Mickey and asks her to go with her father to North Carolina and help him. Mickey is in the middle of the case that will make her partner, but she goes out of a sense of duty. Also, she wants her father to talk to her and explain why he abandoned her for much of her childhood. As a result, she pushes everyone away, including a scout they meet in North Carolina (Justin Timberlake) who is interested in her.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully acted if predictable story about healing wounds and communicating, something that is difficult for an old- fashioned father to do. Clint Eastwood is an irascible character similar to his role in Gran Torino - he brings a lot of humor to the part as well as some powerful dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Amy Adams looks for all the world like she's 28 - she was 38 when she made this, playing a 33-year-old. She brings a poignancy to her performance as a workaholic and vulnerable young woman.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable, and I shed a few tears besides. Highly recommended."

","I just have to see anything with Clint Eastwood. Throw in some other great actors like Ed Lauter, George Wyner, Bob Gunton, Robert Patrick, John Goodman, Justin Timberlake, and a few others and you have a pretty powerful cast. Kudos to the casting director Geoffrey Miclat for selling this project to so many stars.<br/><br/>The basic story is fine if predictable. The director didn't do anything to hide the fact that it is a predictable story. I felt Robert Lorenz didn't make any attempt to adjust the story board, or perhaps he was responsible for the mess. The story rambled on a bit, was scattered, and lacked depth. A bit of the interaction between Gus and Mickey was quite good, the rest of the video was flat and juvenile. <br/><br/>I give it five stars for the actors and acting. 3 stars for cinematography. And one star for direction. Lorenz has worked as an assistant director on a number of great films. Perhaps that is a role he should stick to.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve is worth a watch.

Other than Clint Eastwood, I am not a big fan of the other actors, except John Goodman. But I have to say Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake did a good job. I enjoyed watching them and changing my mind! A sweet story about life, about a dad and his daughter and about a game that takes so many people away from loved ones. This is the kind of Clint Eastwood movie that we'll miss someday when he's not making movies anymore. IMO, he always makes movies that are likable and ""nice"" to watch. Whether spaghetti westerns, cops/robbers, or everyday life movies, Clint Eastwood has a signature style in movies and movie making.

","""No game in the world is as tidy and dramatically neat as baseball, with cause and effect, crime and punishment, motive and result, so cleanly defined."" Paul Gallico <br/><br/>The Trouble with the Curve is that there is no ""curve ball"" in the script, which seems almost computerized from the baseball-cliché app. However, for those who couldn't get enough of crusty Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino, he's back for more curmudgeon as Gus, an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves who eschews sabermetrics and all such scientific analysis in favor of old fashioned gut work, especially hearing the sound of a ball hitting a glove and a ball hitting a bat. First-time director Robert Lorenz, a producer for many Eastwood films, makes sure the heroic Eastwood hero follows the formulaic plays so long a part of the Eastwood game.<br/><br/>Difficult Gus doesn't much abide his accomplished daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), whose bid for partnership in her law office is a sign that he may have done something right, not that he would ever talk to her of his feelings about anything. She accompanies him scouting out a potential star in North Carolina as she sees how his eyesight has deteriorated and could need help.<br/><br/>But Gus, in vintage Eastwood style, accepts no help, and so the story slips into formula with Mickey romancing a former star, Johnny (Justin Timberlake); a young Braves scout, Philip (Matthew Lillard), getting his comeuppance, and the world improbably going everyone's way at the most contrived, vapid, and neatly tied together conclusion in baseball film history. In other words original material is absent, Moneyball looks like Citizen Kane next to this froth, and both films share a similar combat between the old scouts and the upstarts with their computers. In Moneyball the metrics win out; in Trouble the gut does its job.<br/><br/>But then, in most Eastwood movies, with him as director or just actor, the bullies are humiliated and the old guys win the match. The young women, e.g., in Million Dollar Baby and Trouble, gritty though they are, learn and win largely because they're Clint's protégés.<br/><br/>Baseball is never like that except in the movies."

","Trouble with the Curve is, after all, a ""baseball movie,"" and, as such, it is not good. The lead actors make the movie watchable, despite the hackneyed and predictable story. Some, out of respect for Eastwood, I suppose, will give this film a passable rating, but it does not deserve it as a whole.<br/><br/>Not only is the film predictable, but it absolutely abounds with cliché. The hot-shot baseball prospect Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill) is a jerk. The hot-shot (young) computer-savvy scout Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard) is an even bigger jerk. Mild-mannered prospect Billy Clark (yes, his name is Billy!) can go five-for-five if only he can see his mother again. The big-shot law firm partners are really good ol' boys.<br/><br/>The story is so predictable, that, as each subplot emerges and is wrapped, the viewer will be absolutely amazed that no twist occurs, no fake, not a single original turn. The story simply unfolds as one would expect in boring fashion.

This is not a film. It is a Disney flick all the way. I thought the beginning was OK and the baseball seemed semi-realistic. But when the final stanza rolled around, it became unrealistic, predictable and sappy. Perhaps part of my dislike for this movie comes from the fact that I know a thing or two about the ins and outs of scouting professional sports, but even an amateur would be able to tell the ending of Trouble With the Curve was unrealistic and clunky. Of course everything turned out happy and the ""bad guys"" get fired or fail miserably. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie, especially if you're a baseball fan.

"DamnYouGoogle","7","3","7","7 October 2012"," Clint is old and mad about being old...but its still hard not to like him.
","We get it Clint you can play a good crotchety old man. Luckily fr the viewers of Trouble with the Curve its the best crotchety old man in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve is the story of a widowed, aging, and of course blinding baseball scout on one last run because ""The man"" is now nor longer using the scouts as much as they are computers putting people like Eastwood out of their jobs. Amy Adams plays the loving but distant daughter of this scout still wondering if why her father left her after her mothers passing almost 3 decades before hand, while having the loving instinct to give up her job as partner in a lawyers firm to help her father along the way of his swan song.<br/><br/>There isn't much here that hasn't been seen before man is extraordinary at his job blinding or not, daughter finds a love interest in a baseball player that was once scouted by Eastwoods charter now hoping to be a scout/announcer (played admirably by Justin Timberlake.), daughter secretly knows A LOT about baseball too (this is not a spoiler trust me)., and Eastwoods former darftee (still Timberlakes character) is still a friend but also a scout thats team has the pick before Clints (I know this might be a little confusing for non baseball fans..but its sort of a base ball movie.) Okay so the good is the Performances top to bottom the people that need to be subtle are subtle and those that need to be over the top are over the top. I myself grew up in a baseball family (my father worked full time for a Double A club for a long long long time) so I can assure you its accurate when it comes to scouts and their ways, its beautifully shot. It is always important that the massive grandeur of the baseball field is felt while filming in a real stadium while the homey feeling of backwoods Southern American high school baseball leauge is also right on point due to great camera work.....and finally, Clint Eastwood yea I know I said the performances already BUT Clint is in a league of his own (get what I did right there? lol puns are funny) and he still holds up on the silver screen. No this isn't as good as his performances in Gran Tarino or Dirty Harry but with age he hardly misses a step, his seems spunky and weak at the same time and its just amazing to watch a vet work. Walking the tight rope as an aging actor is a hard thing to do and sometimes we just give former stars passes for being former stars even as their acting skills diminish for whatever reason, but Clint earns respect from his performances and no pity is needed for the man. He is still A list and Trouble with the Curve shows us that.<br/><br/>Okay so the bad. Obvious side love story is obvious, obvious premise is obvious, and obvious outcome is obvious...but those things don't ruin movies with the story given to them the cast, director, and crew do a very good job and salvage something that could be hum drum into something worth watching...at least for Eastwood and Baseball fans.<br/><br/>I recommend giving it a viewing it'll probably one of the stronger wide releases until ""Rush out the art projects so we can get an Oscar!"" season starts in late November."

Clint Eastwood plays an aging baseball scout in a world where those that really know him, take a what you see is what you get and care about it, attitude. So there must be a reason(s) for them to feel that way and respect him for what he is. I really liked the way they developed the characters and the plot. Although it was somewhat predictable, I must ask you, does anything ever turn out exactly the way you hoped it would? You will not be disappointed, especially if you like Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, and John Goodman. The characters surrounding them also helped to keep it real. There is a reason baseball (and other sports) scouts are valuable to their sports. There's also a reason that character, or a lack there of, matters. If you don't get that by the end of this movie, you probably never will."
"TheUnknown837-1","6","3","7","1 October 2012"," If you are going to see ""Trouble with the Curve,"" see it for the acting
","I'll probably never grow tired of Clint Eastwood's presence in the movies. Whether he's standing in front of or behind the camera (or both), this 82-year-old master has produced some of the most indelibly entertaining performances and films in recent memory. So, as you can imagine, when I heard a year ago that Mr. Eastwood was coming out of acting retirement after a brisk three years to star in ""Trouble of the Curve,"" I was ecstatic. He's not directing the film this time around, but he is taking the lead role, and we get him all his veteran-cloaked glory.<br/><br/>If his character had not been gunned down at the end of ""Gran Torino,"" one would assume this were a sequel to that film. For Mr. Eastwood is essentially playing the exact same character: a gruff, widowed, profanity-spitting old man with an extreme reluctance to come to terms with his age. At one point in the movie he answers the phone saying ""Who the (expletive) is calling me at this time of night?!"" He's even tripping over furniture in his house, swearing up a storm later, just as he did in ""Gran Torino."" This time, however, he's in Georgia, and still working as a talent scout for the Major Leagues. If only glaucoma and a shorter attention span were not coercing some younger folk into pushing him out of the picture. He's got it worse than Henry Fonda did in ""On Golden Pond."" And just like Henry Fonda in ""On Golden Pond,"" Mr. Eastwood has an estranged daughter who now makes a last-ditch effort to find common ground with her father.<br/><br/>It is a shame that ""Trouble with the Curve,"" despite all that it has going for it, is most of the time an underwhelming movie. The cast is tremendous. Amy Adams plays the feisty daughter with a hidden love for baseball, and the supporting cast is populated by talents such as John Goodman, Ed Lauter, and Bob Gunton. So there's a number of interesting people working with this winner of a premise.<br/><br/>I do not want to drag the movie through the mud too much, as it is a first time directing and screen writing job by two different people. The director, Robert Lorenz, has produced some of Mr. Eastwood's films, but never handled the creative input behind the camera until now. And, according to my research, screenwriter Randy Brown has never worked in Hollywood before. This is a first-stab effort from both of these men, and their efforts are visible. Mr. Lorenz has a subtle style admittedly in need of more experience, but very promising. And Mr. Brown shows that he has imagination and can dream up some witty dialogue. Unfortunately, their lack of experience still shows through all of the gleams like rocks in a swimming pool. One of the reasons why the movie never fulfills its emotional goals is because both the director and screenwriter chop of scenes at the ankles before they can get along. The build-up is fine, but just when a sequence starts to near its pinnacle, it comes to an abrupt halt. One of the key subplots of the whole movie (it explains why Mr. Eastwood has distanced himself from Miss Adams) is explained through clumsily staged flashbacks that pop up at the most random order. And the big secret revealed near the end is not so shocking to make it seem worth the long wait.<br/><br/>The scenes between Mr. Eastwood and Miss Adams come the closest to working. Both give excellent performances. Mr. Eastwood repeats the grouchy-old-man motif very well, and Miss Adams convincingly bounds back with a lot of feisty, free-standing reactions. Very often, it's more her movie than Mr. Eastwood's. Unfortunately, there is also a very drippy love story that is attached. It is the least interesting element in the movie and yet is given so much attention by the screenplay. Miss Adams's love interest is played by Justin Timberlake, an actor I have very seldom been impressed by. His performance is not particularly good, as he fails to produce any sense of charisma or warmth. After all, Miss Adams's character is supposed to be a career-minded woman who has wandered away from relationships over a 35-year lifetime, so we would expect somebody exceptional to finally capture her heart. Somehow, I'm not convinced an obnoxious jibber-jabberer who can quiz her about baseball stats would really be the one to do it. So perhaps Mr. Timberlake is not due too much blame; the character is simply not interesting. Whenever manipulative piano music played while the movie-couple shared a two-shot (or went skinny dipping, go figure!) none of my heartstrings were tugged, as I did not care whether or not these two got together at the end.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, ""Trouble with the Curve"" does not know the right way to end. The movie wants to show some insight into what goes into Major League talent scouting (the computer programs, the executive decisions, the sudden try-outs, etcetera) but the way the movie chooses to wrap itself up is utter cornball; a twist that comes completely out of nowhereor left field, if you will. Granted, the twist is hinted at a couple of times earlier in the movie, but the screenplay does not give these two or three moments enough of an impact to make the resolution effective.<br/><br/>If you are going to see ""Trouble with the Curve,"" see it for the acting. As for the rest of the movie, while it did not satisfy me, it is not insufferable. It is not a remotely bad movie; it just did not mean a whole heck of a lot to me when it was over. Unfortunately, Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, and the game of baseball were not enough to win me over."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Combining my two favorite things in life (excluding family), baseball movies always give me pause. It is impossible for me to watch without analyzing the baseball (which rarely comes across well on screen) and often looking away in disgust. Fortunately, this one is as much about clogging as it is baseball. Baseball is merely the setting for this otherwise quite conventional family drama.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Gus, an aging old-time baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. Gus has his way of scouting and it doesn't include computers or any other aspect of ""Moneyball"". He believes in what he sees. Therein lies his biggest problem. His eyesight is failing at a time when scouting newcomers are leaning on sabermetrics. It's Gus' last chance to scout a hotshot prospect before the team offers him retirement.<br/><br/>Gus' boss is played by John Goodman, who guilts Gus' estranged daughter into making the final scouting trip with her father. The problem is that Mickey (Amy Adams) is a rising star attorney with a shot at firm partnership. Predictably she makes the trip. Matthew Lillard plays the new wave scout who believes only in what the computer metrics tell him. It's a clash of old vs new.<br/><br/>On the trip, we meet Johnny ""Flame"" played by Justin Timberlake. He's a former phenom scouted by Gus, who later blew out his arm. Johnny is now working as a scout and hoping for a broadcasting career. Adams and Timberlake have the necessary cuteness to offset the gruffness of Clint. See, everybody learns life lessons and baseball from everybody else. For those wondering, Gus named his daughter after Mickey Mantle. She should just be glad her name isn't Seven (that's for Seinfeld fans).<br/><br/>Clint had previously announced that Gran Torino would be his final acting job. We can only presume that this is a favor for his long time producer, and first time director Robert Lorenz. Lorenz runs Malpaso, Eastwood's film production company. Eastwood plays a similar role this time out, as he is grumpy and lonely and growls a lot. He also tosses out a few funny quips and doesn't shy away from displaying the many downsides to aging.<br/><br/>You have probably figured out that this is a corny, predictable, mainstream film. You should also know that it is entertaining enough and easily accessible, though I presume the baseball theme will keep many away. My only real issue is that the lead characters are just ""too"". Clint is too gruff. Amy Adams is too earnest. Timberlake is too eager. Lillard is too dastardly. This makes for a pretty simple movie with no twists you won't see coming way ahead of time. That is, unless you have the same vision problems as Gus.<br/><br/>OK, I'll finish with this ... Clint obviously respects empty chairs more than coffee tables. One he simply argues with. The other he gets violent. (an early scene) www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com"
"napierslogs","6","4","11","29 September 2012"," One great character, good comedic chemistry, but many simple turns
","""Trouble with the Curve"" starts with Gus (Clint Eastwood) and his curmudgeonly ways going about his job as a baseball scout. The jokes about being old and losing his sight and getting up to pee in the middle of the night aren't very funny, but the introduction of John Goodman as his boss and best friend, and then Amy Adams as his daughter Mickey, help heighten the level of jokes.<br/><br/>Gus is off to North Carolina to scout the next home run-hitting phenom; Pete tells Mickey to join him since he's concerned about his health and abilities. The good news for the majority of people is that this movie is not about baseball, it's a simple family dramedy. I would have liked more baseball, but I also would have liked accurate baseball. No professional team (in this case the Atlanta Braves) is going to send only one old, partially-blind, disrespected scout to draft their number 1 pick. But that is better than the Boston Red Sox who sent one immature, inexperienced, junior temporary scout to draft their number 1 pick. That honour went to Johnny (Justin Timberlake) who is really only there to be the love interest for Mickey.<br/><br/>The next problem with the film is the very simplistic approach to the supporting characters. The young prospect is a douche-bag and the title tells us why we're supposed to not like him. The fellow scouts are douche-bags because they believe the opposite of what Gus does, so obviously we can't like them either. The one ""twist"" is clearly telegraphed with an otherwise pointless scene and added sound effects to make sure we don't miss the significance.<br/><br/>But the film is still able to add an overall warmth and humour to make it enjoyable. This is particularly through Amy Adams. She was delightful as a young career woman struggling to come to terms with her relationship with her father and figuring out what makes her happy in her life. She and Timberlake may not have the best romantic chemistry, but they do have great comedic chemistry, and I would trade for that any day.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out why Mickey was described as being smart when none of her actions indicate intelligence, but there is generally no requirement for smart characters, only likable ones, and she is likable. She had an effortless versus put-together sexiness mixed with her tomboy nature that made her very appealing. But one character does not make up for an ensemble relationship movie."

","Spoiler for Million Dollar Baby. I am an Eastwood Fan.<br/><br/>I think he's a terrific director. Even his minor films are above most other directors.<br/><br/>I don't think you can properly review this film without considering Million Dollar Baby. Eastwood and Morgan Freeman dominated that film, but the actual emotional star was Hilary Swank who won an Academy Award for her performance.<br/><br/>Eastwood works well with women, no question about that. Even at his age, there is something magnetic about the way any woman and Clint Eastwood interact on the screen. In Million Dollar Baby, his tough exterior covered a marshmallow interior. Hilary Swank's character caught on quite quickly and Morgan Freeman always knew it. When asked to help her commit suicide, it was only his love for her that allowed him to do it. She was the daughter that should have been answering all his letters. All his principles up to that point told him that what she was asking was wrong. All his love told him that she was right and he did what she asked.<br/><br/>This film is quite different. His daughter was estranged. But she was very forgiving about that estrangement. So Eastwood has looked at this Father/Daughter relationship from two different angles. This one actually had the daughter present. She gave him her best shot and Amy Adams was just the girl to do it. She's smart, articulate, careful to listen before she speaks, emotional and very well balanced between what her head knows and what her heart feels. And she can express it fearlessly. Amy Adams is very very talented: there is nothing that she cannot express. Any father would be proud of her as Eastwood was.<br/><br/>John Goodman was terrific in a very straight forward cameo roll. He was convincing as a friend and as a sort of Dutch Uncle.<br/><br/>I took one point off for the music at the end. It was appropriate, but very jarring especially since we were quite mellow from the last scene.<br/><br/>This is a new kind of sports film. I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone. I'll likely watch it again."

","This had all the makings of a very good movie. 3 solid stars in likable roles, good performances, and a nice storyline around baseball. What could go wrong? While they didn't take up more than a few minutes of screen time, the segments with the ""5-tool can't miss prospect"" were horrible. The whole Bo Gentry part of the movie felt like a bad after school special, topped off by the ridiculousness of the scout following him. It makes me wonder how a director or producer could watch that and not re cast and re shoot that whole part of the movie. Somehow those two minor roles cheapened everything about the movie and the good work of Adams, Eastwood, and Timberlake."

","I really enjoyed this movie despite its rating. I don't like baseball and really don't care for sports-related movies unless the move is about auto racing. The reason I watched this is because I really enjoy the acting of Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams. <br/><br/>In the movie, the problems between father and daughter, and why he did the things the way he did when she was a child are important to her--but he didn't realize the effect it had on her. He doesn't understand that the choices he made affected her, and she doesn't understand why he sent her away to live with other family when she was so young after her mother died. Then there's the budding relationship between Mickey and Johnny. If I go any further, I will have to issue a 'spoiler alert,' so I will end my review here."

","""What are you all staring at? I'm not a pole dancer.""<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood (Gus) as a baseball scout. A moody old grump who seemingly only has eyes for baseball. He is getting older and his eyes are getting dramatically worse. So his best friend (nice guest star by John Goodman) asks Gus's daughter to assist her father. The new generation in the club where Gus is under contract, tries to relieve Gus. Matthew Lillard, of course, plays the role of the annoying smart ass.

The poor father-daughter relationship, which is actually the main subject in this film, is of course fixed in the end. The pedantic nerd is obviously put in place and sacked. The lawyer who squeezed himself in a devious way in place of the daughter so he could lead a groundbreaking case, fails and the daughter finds her prince charming in the course of the story. So predictable, but for once not disturbing to me Perhaps a sign of my good taste (Just kidding), but it was only at the end that I knew the other scout was Justin Timberlake. All in all, he delivered an excellent performance here and briefly the words ""maybe a bit of acting talent"" came to me. In this movie he was more convincing than in ""In Time"" and he's anyway more palatable than 50Cent in whatever movie. Amy Adams played the role of teenage daughter, who has more baseball knowledge than it would seem, and is also fun to look at. And Robert Patrick has the honor to interpret the most satisfying action throughout the film : sack the sneaky Philip.<br/><br/>Conclusion : a beautiful entertaining romantic drama.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"
"rtp4242","4","2","4","3 August 2013"," Movie Review: Trouble With The Curve (2012) Don't Fall For This Pitch
","Gus (Clint Eastwood) is an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is losing his eyesight from macular degeneration. Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams) is a lawyer, whose workaholic personality has her in line for a partnership at her law firm. Mickey tries to maintain a relationship with gruff old Gus, but he keeps his distance, just as she keeps her distance from perspective suitors. Gus has two months left on his contract as a scout, and the Braves ask him to go to North Carolina to scout a can't-miss prospect named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingil). The Red Sox have sent a scout, Johnny,(Justin Timberlake) to scout Bo. Johnny was a big-league pitcher until he ruined his arm. Now his last shot at glory is being a good scout which may lead to a job as an announcer. Mickey comes to North Carolina a few days later to help scout Bo with her ailing father. Johnny approaches the emotionally distant Mickey socially, but she seems disinterested. What does Gus think of the hot prospect? Does he resolve his issues with his estranged daughter?<br/><br/>I found Trouble With The Curve disingenuous and insincere. When I think of my favorite baseball movies, Bull Durham and The Natural to name two, they seem to revel in baseball lore. Bull Durham contrasts the dreams of minor leaguers to make it to ""The Show"" to the vision with a grizzled veteran, who's been to the big leagues and wants to go back, and does so with a lot of laughs. The Natural evokes an almost mystical vision of the mythic skills of a an aging veteran, just the histrionics of Roy Hobbs hitting a home run into the light tower and watching those lights exploding, the music, the magic bat, it all plays into the mythology of baseball, from farm boy to legend. Trouble With The Curve is just a series of clichés about baseball that are so obvious and so ham-handedly delivered, that it is obvious how the plot will unwind and how it will resolve itself.<br/><br/>I like Clint Eastwood a lot as an actor and director, and have for a long time, but he's gone to the grumpy curmudgeon well once too often. I compare this movie unfavorably to Gran Torino, Eastwood plays the same grumpy old man character, but that character is a lot more unpredictable and the resolution of that plot is a lot more satisfying. One more thing, the idea that the short, overweight Bo Gentry would be on any scouting list is an insult to even a casual baseball fan.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays tough girl again, but this time the acting seems staged she is clearly uncomfortable with the baseball lingo, and she even seems uncomfortable with Eastwood. The romance with Timberlake does not work, and she has no chemistry at all with Timberlake. Timberlake is an awful actor, who has no natural cadence when he tries to act. The guy has a look on his face that says,"" Look at me, I'm cool."" Trust me, his acting is not cool. The pacing is slow and the movie is long, and in the end, this movie is not worth the effort it takes to watch it.<br/><br/>Trouble With The Curve.

","Review: Speaking as a big Clint Eastwood fan, I did find this movie to be quite disappointing and boring in parts. Clint is playing his usual miserable self alongside his daughter Amy Adams who puts in a good performance for what she had to work with. Justin wasn't bad as the love interest, but his acting style seems to be very one dimensional. The problem with the film is the storyline which was a bit bland for a Clint movie. There wasn't anything that made it exciting or different from other baseball movies, but there is a touch of wit which will make you chuckle. I expected more to be honest. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After Clint Eastwood announced his retirement from acting after making Gran Torino, there was a lot of people who shocked and upset, but this was the wrong movie to pick to come out of retirement with. I was surprised that I never heard anything from Hollywood about this film because of the big cast, but after watching it, I can understand. I just hope that Clint comes out with another movie soon because this is definitely not the one to be remembered for.<br/><br/>Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $49million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there baseball movies with a bit of romance and drama. 4/10"

","Caught this one tonight on HBO. I'm usually appreciative of Eastwood's efforts, so I kept waiting for this to improve ... but it didn't. I might've liked it more if Clint hadn't looked more like Amy Adams's grandfather instead of her father and Justin Timberlake hadn't looked at least 10 years too young for her. I had real trouble believing the men in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Adams was fine, though; I'm usually not a fan of hers (she's been way too perky for my taste in too many roles), but she hit just the right note in this role, highly believable as a woman holding her own at work and in the world, fending off asshats who resent competent women in the office and in her private life. Hard to believe, but I watched the rest of the film after the first 20 minutes for her, not for Clintwood. Who'd have thunk it? Otherwise, baseball fans would probably dig it, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Take a pass."

Frustrated by feeling that her father abandoned her, Mickey abandons her pursuits temporarily when her father's eyesight is becoming a major problem.<br/><br/>The baseball scouts are an odd kind of entity, with each one trying to outdo the other in the baseball prospects along the way.<br/><br/>This film is even more than about the game, it's a woman's discovery of why her father really left her, her falling in love, the hopes, aspirations and attitudes of prospective players, as well as their dreams."

"RainDogJr","5","2","4","16 December 2012"," Average movie; watch instead ""Gran Torino"" or ""Moneyball""!
","This is one of those Hollywood dramas where every single problem, and believe me there are quite a few, gets solved literally during the last 10 minutes. TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is basically three things: a Clint Eastwood picture about aging and parenthood problems; a bland romantic thing that involves Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake; and a movie about baseball. <br/><br/>Let's write about Clint first. In that recent directors talk from the Hollywood Reporter, which had Tarantino, Ang Lee, Affleck, Van Sant, D. O. Russell and Tom Hooper, there was an interesting discussion about aging. Tarantino said that filmmaking is a young man's game and that when a director ""loses it"" is mostly due to aging; later he remarked that Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris was his favorite 2011 film, after D. O. Russell brought Woody Allen to the aging discussion - it was really great stuff with a variety of points of view. The case of Clint is quite strange for me. Aging was becoming a great thing for him; in a period of 5 years (2003-2008) he made only solid films, and he was already in his seventies. And now, only 4 years after GRAN TORINO (a personal favorite), he is out there, without a recent great film, bitching against Barack Obama and coming back from acting retirement for an average movie he didn't even direct. <br/><br/>The curious thing is that he came back from retirement to do the same role that we, or at least I thought was going to be his last. Here we have an angry old man who lost his wife and has problems with his daughter (played by Amy Adams) - sounds exactly like Walt from GRAN TORINO, right? I believe by now I have given too many words to Clint; after all this is a performance that will be soon forgotten - a main role that feels like a minor, unnecessary one, if that makes sense. <br/><br/>Now, let's bring the romantic side of the picture. Adams and Timberlake finally getting together inside a lake in the middle of the night? Silly stuff, I know. The curious thing is that both are huge baseball connoisseurs, so Adams' character it's like the dream girl for the baseball nerd. Speaking of the quintessential American sport, well, it's simply impossible not to think in the infinitely superior MONEYBALL while watching this. Clint's character Gus is the kind of scout that Brad Pitt would have fired - an old school scout who couldn't care less for the technology that now is part of the game. <br/><br/>It's average stuff too and I believe a baseball fan won't find much here, aside of some dialog that refers to players and games - it's a pretty boring baseball movie, where nothing happens until the ending (and it's material that's too obvious to really care for). So yeah, don't waste your time with this and watch instead GRAN TORINO or MONEYBALL! <br/><br/>*Watched it on 16 December, 2012"
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","4","10 December 2012"," Anti-Moneyball
","¨Anybody who uses computers doesn't know a damn thing about this game.¨<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve is this year's response to Moneyball claiming that the experience of scouts can't be replaced by a bunch of computer programs and numbers. It is kind of the opposite of what happened in last year's movie starring Brad Pitt, but in my opinion both films worked really well. I believe that a balance must be found in both systems and that there is no right or wrong way to approach this. Moneyball explored the baseball concepts a little deeper; Trouble with the Curve on the other hand focuses more on the father and daughter relationship. I am not a big baseball fan, but I enjoyed these movies quite a bit because they had a lot of heart. This film might be predictable, but it's hard not to fall for the sentimentality it brings along and the broken relationships it tries to restore. This is Robert Lorenz's first film as a director, but he has had a lot of experience working with Clint Eastwood as his assistant in most of his movies. Lorenz uses some of the same techniques and trademarks of Eastwood in this film so it is kind of like if you were watching one of his movies. The screenplay was written by Randy Brown, and the film stars Clint Eastwood (it has been a long time since he has acted in a movie that he didn't direct). Eastwood's last film as an actor was Gran Torino, and he has a sort of similar role in this movie playing his usual old grumpy self again. Trouble with the Curve is a good film, but not as great as some other Eastwood films (Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby). <br/><br/>Gus (Clint Eastwood) is a baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves. He has had a long and successful career with the club, but some of the managers think he's getting too old and his contract is about to expire in three months. Phillip (Matthew Lillard) one of the General Manager's assistant is a firm believer in the numbers that his computer program gives him, but the other assistant, Pete (John Goodman), is a friend of Gus's and defends him. Gus has a talent for scouting good players; the problem he's facing now is that his eyes are failing him. Despite the problem, he tries to hide it from everybody and continue to go on as if nothing is wrong. His wife passed away years ago and he had to raise his daughter Mickey on his own. Mickey (Amy Adams) is now in her 30's and is becoming a successful lawyer, but her relationship with her father has always been distant. Pete figures out that something is wrong with Gus and asks Mickey to accompany her father on what could be his last scouting assignment to North Carolina. Gus has to scout a promising player there named Bo (Joe Massingill) in case the Red Sox, who have the first round pick, pass on him. The scout from the Red Sox happens to be Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former player who was scouted by Gus himself. Johnny ends up falling for Mickey during their stay in North Carolina, although there are several other issues she wants to resolve with her father first.<br/><br/>The performances in this film didn't blow my mind, but the story does have a lot of heart. It's hard not to fall for the characters in this story and despite the fact that the film is very predictable and formulaic it was still a very satisfying experience for me. Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood shared some touching scenes together. Eastwood seems to always explore this father-daughter distant relationship in most of his movies. You don't need to be a baseball fan to enjoy this movie because it deals more with these relationships than with the game itself. Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams share some scenes together as well adding a little romance to the story. Trouble with the Curve has a little bit of everything: sports, romance, and drama so it is one of those rare films that the entire family will enjoy.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","This was really boring and mostly uneventful. The chemistry between Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood helped save it somewhat, while a particularly satisfying (yet cliche) ending redeemed things too.<br/><br/>The Justin Timberlake part of the storyline was filled with a lot of cringe and just seemed rather irrelevant to the rest of things. The film explored a lot of a rocky father-daughter relationship - baseball just happened to be the backdrop to it all.<br/><br/>There were a few too many characters to dislike. The main baseball character was hard to watch, and while things paid off towards the end, it took far too long getting there. This felt like a 3 hour film. Perhaps baseball fans who understand many of the references and names-dropped will enjoy it more.<br/><br/>I'm glad Clint Eastwood has since starred in The Mule because this would've been a fairly pedestrian and bland way for him to go out. He plays the typical gruff, masculine Eastwood character here - with majority of the film's humour relying on it a bit too much.<br/><br/>By all means, give it a go if you're a die hard Eastwood fan and into baseball. It has a heart which ultimately rises above some of the blandness, though it's not a film I'll watch again."

","It's great seeing Clint Eastwood for one last time (apparently) with the starring role in a film, even allowing for the fact that it wasn't a commercial success. It's even better seeing him interacting in scenes with Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake, both well cast and I'm sure more than happy to be on the screen with a living legend. There's also an attractively strong support cast including John Goodman, Robert Patrick and Eastwood's own son, Scott. It's just a pity that the story they are collectively given to work with, couldn't have been stronger and more believable.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I just couldn't believe a major league baseball franchise would be employing a visually-impaired octogenarian, as one of their (if not the number one) talent scouts. Clint in real life is one fit unit, but he really does look all of his 80+ years in this movie and he just doesn't fit the part. Even the oldest of his group of peers, looked 20 years younger than him. Granted the movie is at pains to tell us that his increasing blindness is only suspected by The Braves, but that whole thread just appeared pretty silly to me, especially with the narrative playing the whole thing up with car damage etc. On top of all this and the constant talk of renewed contracts, his place generally looks like a dive. Surely this ""important talent scout"" is not just being paid peanuts. The inference from Phil (the ambitious bean-counter) is that the club can't afford him.<br/><br/>Amy Adams's Mickey is welcome, but she comes draped in the familiar lawyer raiments of over-worked and under-appreciated associate being used and essentially abused by her nasty group of male partners. I'd love a dollar for every time this trope has popped up in a lawyer inclusive movie. And yes, it was deemed really important, that every lawyer we see in the movie, should have their face buried frequently in their mobile phones to the point of total distraction, observed by Eastwood's Gus, on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>It is refreshing that the sports component of this baseball film for once doesn't include a slow-motion game climax. But at the same time, I found it hard to believe the whole thread about the Bo Gentry character being a number one draft prospect. The guy didn't even look anything like an athlete. The batter/pitcher showdown was of course very predictable.<br/><br/>Before he passes from this mortal coil, I, more than most, would love to see Clint Eastwood, leave one last acting legacy to accompany his widely appreciated directorial skills. But it's not going to happen with lightweight, unrealistic tales such as Trouble with the Curve is, pleasant, (almost family) entertainment though it may be, in a non-threatening way."

","Some of the reviews call it formulaic, predictable, etc. You aren't expecting a tragedy, are you? While its ending is non-tragic, the plot is not predictable and formulaic. The protagonists do reach quite a low level, such that you wonder how they can be raised out of it, or whether they can. After all, Eastwood has been in movies in which heroes die, even though the movies are not tragedies.<br/><br/>There are many ways to get out of the valleys in this film, and it is not easy to predict which path it will take, even if you know before-hand that all of the protagonists make it all the way up the mountain. You need to watch it to discover whether its all of its protagonists make it out of the valley.<br/><br/>The biggest fault of this film is that it portrays its antagonists to an extreme level.

","Clint Eastwood plays a curmudgeon. Hasn't he been doing this for about a decade now. I'm not saying he is bad at it (Grand Torino, for example), but it would seem that the quiet spaghetti western guy, the stranger in town, is perpetually ticked off. He has also taken on the role of the guy who won't let anyone in on his demons. He breaks things, yells profanities, intimidates, not in the cool way he used to, but because of inner pain. Still he is pretty good. My problem with this is as a baseball movie. It is pretty much about scouting and the intricacies of that profession. Eastwood has been a top scout but is taking abuse from the young guys with the computer printouts and databases who think they can see into the soul of a player much better than he. Because of his snarky being, his daughter, who has become a top drawer corporate lawyer shows up to take care of him. She is really doing him a favor because he is nothing but horrible to her. Of course, he is covering up all kinds of issues. He lives in fear that his macular degeneration will bring an end to the one thing he lives for: scouting young players. We also have Justin Timberlake, playing a scout for the Boston Red Sox and who was signed by Eastwood. He blew his arm out and has taken this job. He develops a relationship with Eastwood's daughter and this complicates things somewhat.<br/><br/>The problem with this is that the plot and direction are so pat and romantic. Despite the gnarly scout, everything is kind of schmaltzy. The camera work is over the top in a sort of National Geographic way. There are lots of contrived shots for effect. John Goodman who is really a ""good man"" in this is fun to watch, but even he is a bit much. I'm very picky about baseball movies and this one left me a bit uninspired."

He sent her away because he doesn't think he's good for her. (We find out why toward the end.)

There's a hot shot #1 pick who everybody wants in the baseball draft.Everybody but Clint. A sabermetric geek working for the Braves, Clint's team, is trying to convince management that his computer is the way to tell if a player is any good, and the Clint's way of doing things is old school. There are some romantic twists and turns along the way, But it comes down to the baseball draft. Clint advises the Braves to go one way.But they go with the Sabermetric geek's recommendation. Clint says the kid can't hit the curve.<br/><br/>Daughter is helping Clint with his scouting and finds someone who can prove him right. Again, kind of a routine storyline here. She shows up with a kid from the ghetto who pitches like Koufax and Randy Johnson and Gibson all in one. Blows the stud hitter out of the box. Why? Because he can't hit the curve. Or anything else for that matter.<br/><br/>It's your classic feel good tale of redemption. Mildly entertaining. But EVERYTHING resolves itself like it's a Mary Poppins movie or something. And while I really kind of enjoyed it because it was about baseball, had Rachel Adams, Clint and John Goodman in it, I can't put this baseball movie in the Field of Dreams or Bull Durham category. Maybe a little more detail to the on field scenes. A little better explanation about why Clint sent the daughter away. And I think more detail about what goes on in upper management of a baseball team might have made it a bit more satisfying for me.<br/><br/>All that said, I think if you like the game, you'll enjoy the movie. So I recommend it for that reason. I'd probably watch it again too."
"jbaby-baby039","6","0","0","9 June 2013"," Another standard Hollywood plot
","Trouble with the Curve is a story of a daughter getting back to terms with her father and the story of the father proving modern technology scouts wrong. It is a heartwarming story that makes it hard for some of the audience to hold back tears. It makes you leave the theater feeling good but once you dig a little deeper into it, it is just another one of Hollywoods overused plots. The ending of the movie is also obvious from the beginning and they didn't develop some characters enough. Bo Gentry, the top prospect everyone is talking about, plays as just a plain jerk to everyone, including a peanut vendor in ONE scene. The peanut vendor, who Bo dubbed him the name 'Peanut Boy' comes back and pitches against him in the end, in which Bo isn't able to get a bat on any of his pitches. Now this scene could have been a lot more heartwarming if they would have developed 'Peanut Boy' into at least a minor character. He only appears in one scene prior to everyone finding out he was a great pitcher. If you were in the bathroom, just happened to not be paying attention, or even just watching the movie, this little gesture Bo made to the peanut vendor, would not even register in your mind. Only the audience with a keen memory would remember this scene. Overall, the movie did have it's moments, but we have all seen similar movies before."

","""Anybody who uses computers doesn't know a damn thing about this game."" Gus (Eastwood) was at one time the best scout in baseball. He is starting to get outdated as computers seem to be the new way of evaluating player talent. He is also starting to lose his eyesight and it makes it harder for him to see what a player can bring to the team. The problem is that he doesn't believe any of that. This first and foremost is a good and entertaining movie. Eastwood once again plays himself and once again it works. Amy Adams however steals the movie and if any one could be Eastwoods kid in a movie it is her. It was probably just my wishful thinking but I was hoping for this to be more of a baseball movie then it was. The movie was really good but it was more about Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship then baseball. That isn't a bad thing but I was hoping for another ""Moneyball"" type movie.

"DICK STEEL","10","3","8","3 November 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Trouble with the Curve
","It's been some time since Clint Eastwood was last seen in front of the camera in a film that he didn't have directorial responsibilities for. Known for the minimalist way in making his films, here his credits lie in producing, and focusing his energies on portraying the grumpy old man that his character Gus is, putting in a memorable performance which had Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman being able sparring partners to bring out the brilliance in Trouble with the Curve's characterization, set against the backdrop of the US Major League baseball drafting season.<br/><br/>It's OK if you don't have any clue about the game, because it's not a prerequisite to enjoying the movie. You just need to know the basics of the batter needing to connect with the pitcher's ball, as the film's game focus hinges on the promising young player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill), who seems to be living up to the promise that got every club excited and talking about, save for Gus who needed to take a second, closer look as a baseball scout making recommendations for his club on who to sign when they're down the pecking order of say, the Boston Red Sox. It's old school versus new school that fantasy sports game players will find familiar, where players' statistics on a computer try to become the de facto method on player selection, trying hard to substitute the actual getting out there to closely scrutinize a player over a period of time over a series of games against a myriad of opposition.<br/><br/>Game aside, Trouble with the Curve, written by Randy Brown, is actually a father-daughter story, about the paths taken by either party on a route to reconciliation and reconnection, and this forms the emotional centre that is so powerful given its relevance as well to today's society. We feel that our aged parents are often too backward in today's society, and given their age, eventually we'd feel a moral sense of obligation and responsibility to live up to when they need our help, especially when a medical condition sets in. This may also mean taking some sabbatical from work, or trying hard to multi-task work-life issues, staying connected through modern technology, and plainly just juggle through life, work and personal expectations all thrown in the same direction. This is something anyone today can identify with, and one of the key aspects in the film that you'll connect and gravitate to.<br/><br/>For Gus, as a scout, having to slowly lose his sight means not being able to keenly observe the players he needs to for a recommendation. It's like a musician losing his hearing, or a chef losing his sense of taste. Being a stubborn man, much against good advice from everyone such as good friend and colleague Pete Klein (John Goodman), he sticks to his own ways, until Pete had to persuade Gus' hotshot lawyer daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to spend some quality time with Gus just so that she can, in a way, take care of him and render assistance. After all, being brought up in the game, she's no pushover when it comes to any aspect of baseball.<br/><br/>The story arcs expand to include Mickey's own demons of being emotionally unavailable since she's married to her job, and on the verge of being made partner for the hard work and hours put into the firm. It's easy to pin the blame of being brought up without a parent and thinking economic and personal success is the only key to acceptance, and perhaps nail down the treatment of modern day relationships where people can be physically together, but not connecting on an emotional level. Justin Timberlake stars as the obvious game changer to Mickey as Johnny, a one time red hot pitcher until an injury permanently ruled him out of the game. Now trying his luck as a scout / punter wannabe, he too reconnects with Gus, given that the latter had scouted him before, and some of the best scenes in the movie consist of a combination of any of the trio, if not all of them, sharing the screen together.<br/><br/>Randy Brown's story is sharp and full of subtle humour, self-deprecating at times, which suits Eastwood's style really well, since he flits his voice from edgy to whispers, or getting it just right through grunts of disapproval. It's remarkable for his age that Eastwood is still very much involved in filmmaking and acting, producing a fantastic filmography in recent years, and like wine, is vintage with age. I blame Man of Steel that kept me thinking how Amy Adams would be like as Lois Lane here, since her character is truly a go-getter in the corporate world, while Justin Timberlake just showed that he's growing from strength to strength as a serious actor despite actually coming into the limelight as part of a 90s boy band. Those of us old enough to remember Robert Patrick will see him in new light here as a slimy baseball club executive who thinks he's too smart for others, while John Goodman rounds up the ensemble cast that's full of gravitas for this drama to work.<br/><br/>The ending might be a little bit of a fairy tale, but I suppose this is the season for feel good movies to come light that little hope at the end of the tunnel. It deals with the feeling of having some good shine out of what may seem like a hopeless, lose-lose situation the characters find themselves in, so some may fault it for its convenient wrap. Still, I'd highly recommend it for its all round good performances that brought out the realities and challenges in relationships of today."
"DarkVulcan29","6","3","9","27 September 2012"," Eastwood and Adams are wonderful, but it's bad pacing that brings the film down.
","I know the this film was not meant to be fast paced, but the times when the pacing was so slow, the scenery became more of a character then the people. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are great and believable has father and daughter. So was John Goodman and Matthew Lillard are also good in there supporting roles.<br/><br/>But the baseball parts are kind of dull. Justin Timberlakes character was just written has a love interest for Adams, although they give some background about his character, but he is just there for Adams nothing more, there chemistry felt forced. The movie is not terrible, but seriously dull, it's because of Eastwood and Adams that i'm not giving it a lower rating. Last years Moneyball was not dull like this."

","How refreshing... you mean that there are folks who have lives in sports movies other than the athletes? You mean that there are father/daughter relationships that are not perfect? What an idea! I will admit that I was really frustrated with Mr. E for his RNC antics, but decided to check out this movie anyway. I will also admit that when he was tossing furniture in one of the opening scenes, I got a little nervous, but I kept my seat to see a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>The complex relationship between the father and daughter confused me at times, but I cannot say that the same is not true about my own parental relationships. All of the characters that you were supposed to love, you loved. All of the characters that you hated to like were cool as well. And, definitely, I hated ALL of the characters that I was supposed to hate.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Trouble for anyone - it really caused me to take a closer look at my own desires to climb the career success level, parental relationships, and dependence on technology.

"moh_hamade96","5","2","5","10 January 2013"," intensely dramatic but not emotional gripping
","An intensely dramatic sports movie, centered around a little sport in America known as baseball. A tale of a wrinkly baseball scout well preceded his career peak and may face it's end as his contract faces expiration. Aiming to prove that there's still some oil in his tank, Gus played by the always capable Clint Eastwood, intends to scout the high school player eligible for first pick in this year's draft.<br/><br/>On the way, he is forced to indulge in his daughter's presence, Mickey, played by the lovely Amy Adams, who's on the verge of nailing a partners position at her firm! Risking all that, Mickey accompanies her father in his baseball adventure but her presence later is seen as an assistant in the scouting procedure. Little did they know that a white knight awaited them there, scouting for the red sox that have in their possession the precious number one pick in the draft. A knight, namely, Johnny played by Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>An ""emotional gripper"" does not hit the nail with this film. It was most certainly gripping, feeling the heart beats accelerating as time elapses on this 111 minute movie. However, this film had the ability to reach heights of drama, heights that could certainly be reached by utilizing a treasuries talent possessed by Clint Eastwood. They have shown moments of grumpiness like table throwing or car crashing that have been experienced in the initial moments of the movie. It was obvious that the screenwriter was introducing us to his grumpiness but not consistently keeping it a factor; Showing poor character profiling. let's not take anything away from them, but it was simply and bluntly not enough! There were moments where I contradicted my thought of the approach taken by the screen writer Randy Brown. He has shown moments where he inherited a simple grumpy, Gus, like the table banging scene in the dinner. And he has shown a free, and blunt character like in the scene where he breaks the ice between Mickey and Johnny and bluntly suggests to go on a date. This fluctuation in character profiling is common in human beings but at what heights to go is what determines the fluctuation's effective resemblance of life. Gus is a grumpy father who has experienced a near to complete, sexual assault on his daughter, that resulted in her being sent to her aunt's in her childhood. Therefore, that would result in a ""unnacurance and too much forceful acts"" on who she dates. This was shown initially with the guy in the bar but afterwords it was not shown with Johnny. In the end Randy brown has reinforced the obvious, his debut as a screenwriter has resulted in too many rookie mistakes.<br/><br/>Randy brown has shown too many typical, cliché moments that are somewhat dull. The chain events, the outcome of results all seems to be in a manner that he intended and wanted to. It's is not within life's capabilities to offer results soully based on what humans desire, in life some obstacles arise and problems occur that we do not overlook nor envision, but it is the choices we make that destroy those obstacles. That is what I always say on screen writing, the authenticity of the script is how well it resembles life and how obstacles coherent and not artificial. In this film the outcomes where crystal clear that they where what the writer wanted, not where life intended them to be. The outcome of the baseball player's faults set by Gus to be proved correct in the end. The outcome like Phillip Sanderson being fired, Gus getting offered a new contract, Mickey offered the partners role, Johnny and Mickey end up together. No obsolete obstacles were set; it is these outcomes that remind us, movie viewers, that what we are watching is a movie. That is a fault despite its truthfulness. A movie should be so lifelike that we should forget it's a movie and be so gripped to its events, to its characters, as if we were sitting silently in a car stalking their every move! The acting crew is what I haven't found trouble in, hardly the best aspect of the movie. The Clint, Amy, Justin trifecta worked so perfectly together and could feel the spark and chemistry between them. Amy Adams related well with her clothing, reflected her elegance and presence in a baseball match so remarkably. Clint Eastwood, you ask? Nothing to say really, as proved by his character that he still has some fuel in his tank, Clint Eastwood proved that his tank is full and ready to roll! Justin Timberlake was effectively portrayed the least, yet adhering to his charm and knowledge of baseball so well, an encouraging performance by him.<br/><br/>Not long ago baseball movies and sport movies made their debut in the Oscars. Not so surprisingly it wasn't trouble with curve and nor will it be. Moneyball nailed a total of 6 Oscar nominations, a sport movie similar to trouble with the curve. So what's the difference, what makes money ball special. What does money ball have that trouble with the curve doesn't? Simply, consistency! Money ball has developed a loophole-free character profiling of brad Pitt's character. Indeed there a fluctuation in his character, but they jumped up and down within the allowed space of his character! Gus's character had more space, but wasn't utilized properly. Moreover, the chain of events were not set according to the screenwriter's likings and dis-likings because this was a true story the life like effect development was that much required to put an effort to, because it's already there, to be frank.<br/><br/>In the end it was an entertaining 111 minutes, if you're looking to test your knowledge in good movies, this would do the trick. If you're looking for a dramatically gripping roller coaster this is NOT your movie."

He knows a lot about baseball and has a good heart."" To older audiences, the storyline may be predictable and even familiar, but Trouble with the Curve has plenty of heart throughout to give it its own life strength. And, Anthony says, ""The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams, who plays Gus's daughter, Mickey, work very well together."" Trouble with the Curve Reviewed by Anthony Aranda See his full review on video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HaUEBtMf9s Trouble with the Curve is great and funny. It is kind of like an older movie meant for older audiences, but I still think it is great. This movie is about a man named Gus who is a baseball talent scout but he is losing his sight. He is old-fashioned and always relied on his sight and a feeling to pick good baseball players. Without his sight, he doesn't know how to scout, and even though he is having trouble he won't ask for help. His daughter comes to help him anyway and they have a good time together, but bad things happen, too. The main characters in the movie are Gus and Mickey. Gus is played by Clint Eastwood and Mickey is played by Amy Adams. Amy Adams is in another movie that my little sister loves, called Enchanted, and I also really like her in The Muppets. My favorite character in this movie is Gus because he is a good man that people should trust. He knows a lot about baseball and has a good heart. The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams work very well together. He kind of seems like a grumpy old man and she is kind of sweet. My favorite part in this movie is when Mickey meets a new guy who can throw a really good curve ball and, since she really loves baseball, they become really good friends. I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because my brother says that the movie was a little too old for him and he's seven. The movie also has some inappropriate language and situations that are too old for kids under 10."

","Okay, so Clint Eastwood's Gus is very familiar. Take away the racism and he's the surly yet endearing old-timer from GRAND TORINO – but this coot has a pretty good job. As a baseball scout, an aging, or rather, aged Gus is losing his sight, but he still has a way of picking the best players: although it takes time and he doesn't need a computer. He passes this inherent talent to daughter Mickey, played by blue-eyed pixie Amy Adams, joining him on the road to help out (but what she really wants is closure from a rocky past).<br/><br/>The best moments occur whenever Gus and Mickey sit down at random small town bleachers to figure if a new prospect lives up to his reputation. Throw in Justin Timberlake's rookie scout for a little romance, in an old-school courtship with Mickey, who, like her father, is used to going alone.<br/><br/>It's a comfortable film about baseball and especially father/daughter bonding, and the parallels between the two leads are right up front: both have to keep working (Mickey's a lawyer) or they'll be replaced. The problem with this curve are the side characters, all either really bad or really good, and the ending piles on so much comeuppance for the jerks begging to be punished, you'll feel the writer forcing applause from your knuckles.<br/><br/>But despite the clichés, and some corny dialog, this is a pretty decent little trip. Just don't expect a home run.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

"firefalcoln","1","2","6","20 August 2015"," Everyone is a sterotype and everything makes no sense
","This movie almost seems to exist in attempt to DE-legitimize Moneyball. However, Curve is so bad that it only cemented Moneyball as being anything but similar to terrible.<br/><br/>Here's what happens: Clint Eastwood plays a stereotypical old baseball scout who cares only for old-school baseball knowledge and thinks typewriters are scary new technology. He is losing his vision, can't drive and wants the 1950s back. And despite alienating his daughter, he is hero of the story because his ancient baseball thinking, within their fiction, is always perfectly correct to make up for him being otherwise completely unlikable and wrong. In reality, no baseball philosophy is close to 100% correct all the time. Eastwood's daughter(Adams) is a lawyer who hates Eastwood on the surface because he didn't care for typical responsible or girly interests like her. She is roped into helping her dad out because she hates him or loves or who cares. The real confusing character is her love interest through the movie, played by Timberlake, who is (no joke) a former pitching prospect who never made it big due to injury, asked to prove himself as a good scout for evaluating one player in order to become a Red Sox play by play broadcaster. Even those who know virtually nothing about baseball must know that this makes no sense. It turns out that the player both Timberlake and Eastwood/Adams are evaluating is the definition of stereotypical entitled sports jock. His lines of douchbaggery are laugh out loud bad and on the nose. His character at one point insists another player gets hit by a pitch so he can bat in the 9th inning. Douchebag threatens his teammate by saying his at bat has future major endorsement deals for douchebag at stake. Of course the jerk player also is projected by Eastwood and Adams as being unable to play in the big leagues because they think he will fail against real competition particularly the good MLB curve-balls, despite having great current statistics in high school(this concept actually isn't too unrealistic, but the movie lacks a sense of reality because everyone evil is bad at playing and evaluating baseball and every good is a perfect baseball analysis or player. They convince Timberlake not to draft the stereotypical jock player either, but The organization that Eastwood reports to(the Braves) ignores their report and drafts him anyway, make Timberlake thing he was manipulated into making a bad decision. Shortly after this disaster draft, Adams sees a kind young kid(who was bullied by the drafted jock earlier in the film) pitching to a friend. She immediately sees him as a future MLB pitcher and somehow is able to convince the Braves to sign him despite the kid never playing at a competitive level and her only being the daughter of mistrusted decrepit scout. What follows is the new pitcher and hitter facing off and the hitter failing.<br/><br/>Eastwood and his daughter are revealed to be brilliant. Adams and Timberlake reconcile, the end. The movie is really more like an irritating unrealistic feel good chick flix with some baseball and Eastwood playing baseball scout version of the same old character he has played the last 10 years.<br/><br/>The story just fails to spark an ounce of the interest of Moneyball because the story is constructed to show that good analysts are those who see past statistics into a player's heart. Good players on the field are always good off the field, and bad people are those who are self centered entitle jocks or young analysts who trust statistics. If someone knows anything about baseball, they will see these characters as the complete unbelievable agenda driven stereotypes and that they are. Almost every scout in real baseball uses a great deal of both new age statistics and old school scouting tactics, and this movie didn't even conjure this common scouting value as an option.(in case you think Moneyball displays no middle ground either, it's important to remember that moneyball took place earlier when new age statistics weren't commonly used by scouts like they are now. The depiction of the jock player is the most blatant example of an unrealistic one dimensional character. He really is portrayed like a sports star from an SNL skit. Moneyball doesn't stick perfectly to the book, but it is a much closer depiction of a story which is both more interesting and based on truth. Also moneyball's humor is on purpose and displays the subtle realities and often poignant qualities of baseball's unreliability."
"BobbyGuerrieri","5","2","6","5 October 2012"," Doesn't Live up to the Expectations
","'Trouble with the Curve' starring Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams is about an aging baseball scout, Gus, who is beginning to lose his eyesight. He doesn't want to tell anybody because he loves his job and can't imagine no longer being able to do it. However, Gus' daughter, Mickey, finds out about his eyesight and wants to help him. But Gus left Mickey to live with an aunt and uncle when she was only 6 and they have not a had a good relationship ever since. What was already bound to be a dramatic week is made even more dramatic by former Boston Red Sox pitcher, Johnny (Justin Timberlake), who becomes a love interest of Mickey.<br/><br/>The problem with 'Trouble with the Curve' is that it suffers from identity crisis. It doesn't know if it's supposed to be a romantic movie, a drama, or a comedy. Of course it's possible to combine the three, hence the term 'dramedy' and 'rom-com', but 'Curve' completely separates the three which makes for some horrible pacing. You'll feel as if you're on a roller coaster, and every time you start moving steadily, you come to a sudden stop.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's performance was great. I think it helped that he could devote all his time to acting, and not directing as well. Justin Timberlake, even though I didn't think his character should have been in the movie at all, was also very good. Unfortunately, Amy Adams' performance failed to impress me. We know that she can be a great actress, but throughout I movie, it seemed like she was uncomfortable in her role. Her performance in 'The Master', which I have yet to see, must be a very big improvement from 'Curve', since she's getting a lot of Oscar buzz.<br/><br/>I don't know if this was the writer or the actors fault, but everything in the movie was over-dramatized. Especially in one scene (early on, so it's not really a spoiler) where a man puts his hands on Mickey at a bar. Gus, in defense of his daughter, pushes the man off her and threatens him. And Mickey is mad at him for it! First she complains that he was never there for her, and now he is, and she complains about it! It made me feel even less sympathy for Mickey.<br/><br/>Another part of the film that I really didn't like was a scene that takes place a little more than half way through. I won't spoil it, but the scene was very uncomfortable and took most of the fun away from the movie. While it does help explain some things, I'd definitely rather them have explained in a different way, or even just left it unexplained.<br/><br/>The only thing that made me almost forgot all the negatives about 'Curve' were the last 15 minutes. Gus and Mickey had more chemistry, it was dramatic and funny at the same time, and the humor didn't feel out of place. The characters seemed more real and emotional. In most movies, the first few scenes are interesting, and the rest is disappointing. 'Trouble with the Curve' is the exact opposite.<br/><br/>Even though the closing scenes are great, the rest of the movie isn't worth sitting through to get to the end. If you want to be impressed, show up to the theater an hour and 15 minutes late. You won't be disappointed. However, if you're looking for a nice family drama with good laughs and character depth, skip this one for sure."
"Robert_duder","8","2","6","1 October 2012"," Dawdles a little but still a solid and well made drama centering on the characters
","I was thrilled to hear Clint Eastwood was coming back to the big screen again. The man can do very little wrong in my eyes. Yes, like many, I was more than a little disillusioned with one of my idols due to his antics at the Republican National Convention but he is still an icon of Hollywood and a legend on the big screen. Trouble With The Curve is a sports drama that revolves all around the characters. The sport takes a back seat to the multiple emotional levels and relationships between our key players. Its well written and the characters are easy to watch. The film definitely is slow in the middle at times and spends a lot of time getting to the point in some cases but it all comes together in the end with a really terrific feel good ending that ties up all the loose ends. The romance in the film is well done and my only complaint about the ending was there was really no resolution to the romantic conflict in the film. It was just sort of too neat and tidy. Many will certainly find the film slow and some may even say it is ""boring"" but I prefer to think of it as methodical. It doesn't rush and keeps its pace consistent and the actors are good enough that it will entertain fans of drama.<br/><br/>Its nice to see Clint Eastwood is kidding himself with his roles. His role as an ageing and very crusty baseball scout suits him perfectly. He's lost at getting old and losing the only thing he's ever been passionate about and good at. Its sort of a subtle role for him, he doesn't particularly stand out and yet it is a role his fans can respect. The cranky one liners and the growl we all have come to love, this isn't one of his legendary performances but its a solid one nonetheless. Amy Adams is terrific as his intelligent and self reliant daughter. Adams and Eastwood have solid chemistry together and their banter often keeps the film extremely watchable. Adams is a delight to watch and she is certainly one of the best young female actors out there right now. Justin Timberlake is the former ball player turned young hot scout. His character is fun and light and the least intense of all the characters. He is really strictly there for the romance angle with Adams but they are actually really great together! He also delivers his usual charm and energy to the cast which is always welcome. Supporting performances by John Goodman, Robert Patrick and Matthew Lillard are noteworthy and make the film fun.<br/><br/>Robert Lorenz had a big task in front of him being the first director to direct Eastwood in something like twenty years or close to it. However, he's also worked with Eastwood many, many times as second director or various roles. This is however his directorial debut and I think he did a great job. Baseball was always the backdrop but it never took anything away from the characters and their developing relationships. However you look at it, if you like dramas then you'll enjoy the film. If you expect a fast paced film then it won't be for you. The performances are good, the story is well done and its entertaining. That's all you can ask for. 8/10"

","'TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood returns to acting (after saying he was retiring with 2008's 'GRAN TORINO', but almost no one ever really retires in Hollywood) and appears in the first film he hasn't directed since 1993's 'IN THE LINE OF FIRE'. It is directed by his buddy though, Robert Lorenz, who served as an assistant director on most of Eastwood's films since 'IN THE LINE OF FIRE'. It's Lorenz's first time as lead director and it's also the writer's first feature as well (Randy Brown). The film is about an elderly baseball scout who might be forced in to retirement if his daughter can't help him out. Amy Adams plays his daughter and the film also co-stars John Goodman, Matthew Lillard, Robert Patrick and Justin Timberlake. The movie is a little cheesy and predictable at times but it does work as an emotional drama at times as well thanks largely to the lead performances.<br/><br/>Eastwood stars as Gus Lobel, a once great baseball scout who's credibility is now being questioned after failing to keep up with modern changes to the game. He also has vision problems that he keeps a secret until his daughter Mickey (Adams) calls his doctor and finds out about them. Gus is given one last chance to scout a potential recruit in North Carolina and one of his boss's (and buddy), Pete (Goodman), asks Mickey to go with him on the trip to keep an eye on him. A former recruit of Gus's named Johnny (Timberlake) is also in North Carolina scouting for another team. He develops a romantic interest in Mickey who uses the time with her father to better understand past neglect from him.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty predictable for most of it's duration and there's definitely nothing new or unique here. It's clichéd and some of the jokes seem a little forced but as a drama it does work when it needs to. Eastwood is as classic and likable as he's ever been, despite what you may think of him as a person (with his recent political debacle), he's still a very likable and charismatic screen presence and he hasn't lost any of his movie star qualities with age. Adams really brings her A game to deliver the emotional punch the film needs and Lorenz's directing is adequate. It's a shame they couldn't get a better actor than Timberlake to round out the cast but Eastwood and Adams as the film's two leads don't disappoint.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q"

","Trouble with the Curve (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Charming if incredibly predictable film has Clint Eastwood playing a baseball scout who comes up with some health issues so he's joined on a scouting trip by his daughter (Amy Adams) who has her own personal troubles. Soon the two are trying to heal their somewhat troubled past while the daughter also deals with a new guy (Justin Timberlake) after her. TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE certainly isn't going to win any major awards and while you'll see every curve coming from a mile away there's still no denying that the cast is wonderful and you really get caught up in everything going on. I think what makes the film so memorable as the three stars and their great performances. Eastwood could obviously play the cranky old man without any trouble but he also manages to really shine in some of the more quiet, tender scenes. Adams is also extremely good in her role as the daughter and I thought she and Eastwood had some great chemistry. Timberland is also very good in his supporting role and there's no question that he and Adams have a real spark together. Their mini love story is something that was very predictable every inch of the way but it was still incredibly charming. We also get nice supporting performances from John Goodman, Matthew Lillard and Robert Patrick. I did have some issues with the screenplay including some rather stupid scenes of making fun of Eastwood's age. This includes a really stupid sequence of him trying to get his car out of the garage and there's a scene with him in the toilet, which was just rather lame. Again, every cliché is touched upon here and I'd say there's nothing that happens that's going to surprise you but the power are the three stars and they make this worth watching."

","The movie Trouble with the Curve is a story about an aging baseball talent scout Gus played by Client Eastwood. Gus has built a reputation over the years of recruiting many talented players for the Atlanta Braves. An older man who, set in his ways, Gus is unwilling to change his style to fit with the recent technological changes in how baseball players are recruited, which relies mostly on computer technology. His nemesis is a younger manager Phillip, played by Matthew Lillard, who is convinced that Gus is ready for retirement. Pete, played by John Goodman, a longtime friend of Gus' enlists the help of Gus' daughter Mickey to keep an eye on Gus on an important scouting trip. Mickey, played by Amy Adams, who has not always had a good relationship with her father, is resentful that she has to take on the task of watching out for him. Amy is a driven and focused career woman and is competing for a partnership in the law firm where she works. She also has a nemesis, another lawyer who takes advantage of her absence at work to take her promotion as a partner. While on the scouting trip in North Carolina Gus and Amy meet up with another scout, Johnny, played by Justin Timberlake, was a former Major League baseball player, who was recruited by Gus. The theme of this movie centers around the three main characters and the conflicts they are experiencing in their personal lives. Gus had to raise a young daughter on his own after the death of his wife, and Amy is having to deal with resentment toward her father because he sends her away to live with distance relatives when she is younger instead of raising her himself. She feels abandoned by her father but does not understand the true reason behind his actions. While Gus and Amy are not close, their personalities are very similar. Driven and controlling individuals, they keep others at a distance for fear of being hurt or rejected. Johnny, who ended his Major League career due to a shoulder injury, is the catalyst that eventually draws Gus and Amy into a closer relationship helping them both realize they can open up to one another, in doing so Amy realizes the sacrifices her father made for her long ago. In the end, all the characters grow through their experiences with one another. A transition is made between father and daughter, and Gus sees that the time she spent with him in her youth on recruiting trips was beneficial to her, and Amy can again be involved in something she loves with her father."

Clint was his usual self and has been pretty much been playing the same role since ""Million Dollar Baby"" (an excellent boxing film by the way, but I digress) while Amy Adams wasted her talents on a poorly written and poorly directed film.

His overall performance was what is expected but that play-by- play call of a famous HR in the bar was really poorly executed and it made me cringe.

The villains are a bit too broad. Lillard is going overboard a little especially at the end. Basically he needs to shut up after he gets beat. The movie sets up a few things way too neatly.

The plot is very engaging, because there's always something dramatic going on. Gus and his daughter have an ambivalent relationship, and I'm so glad to see closure towards the end. The ending is very satisfying because of closure on several subplots. It delivers emotional elements and engages me a lot, especially the relationship between Gus and his daughter, the health of Gus and whether Gus can keep his job.

It's nice to see Clint Eastwood take another starring role, especially after when he said Gran Torino would be his last. As a baseball fan, this is a good movie. But as a lover of cinema, this is also good in ""cinema"" terms.<br/><br/>This is the directing debut for Robert Lorenz who worked with Eastwood in many of his films. Clint plays Gus, an aging baseball scout who is tasked to scout this big-time prospect for the Atlanta Braves. But his vision is rapidly declining, so his friend Pete has asked his estranged daughter, Mickey to keep an eye on Gus despite his stubbornness.<br/><br/>If this is truly Eastwood's last acting role, it's a good hurrah. It's not his best role, but the grizzled actor reminded me much of his role in Gran Torino. Amy Adams, as always, is perfect in her role. Justin Timberlake is decent, not great. I really liked Matthew Lillard as the computer sleazebag and totally different than his usual roles.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun movie to watch and passes as good escapism. It's not the kind of drama that will win awards, but it's one that will play with your emotions and is sentimental to a fault.

"FlushingCaps","7","1","2","23 October 2013"," Entertaining Drama in Baseball Setting
","Since so many reviews here have detailed the plot of this movie, I will skip much of that. I wish to argue with the folks who claimed this was predictable.<br/><br/>I also wish to suggest you ignore the review from the person who thought the high school kids being scouted were supposed to be ""Triple-A"" professionals, one step from the majors. To miss that fact reveals that person missed a lot.<br/><br/>I guess it was predictable that the stars, the father and daughter, who we are told at the beginning are not close, would become closer. You couldn't have this movie in any way if that weren't true.<br/><br/>It was surely predictable that the young scout, Johnny, who was signed years ago by Gus (Eastwood), who came across as a likable fellow right from his first scene where he stops to watch some kids playing baseball and gets caught up doing a pretend broadcast of a home run (he wants to become a baseball announcer), and who seems to like Mickey (Amy Adams) right from meeting her, would develop a relationship with her. But, as with any romantic movie, you don't know if it will continue or not.<br/><br/>As for Mickey's job at the law firmshe was insisting she'd be back for the presentation, that, thanks to computers, she was working on most of the time she wasn't trying to help her father. Since her firm was in Atlanta and her dad was scouting this kid in North Carolina, she certainly could fly back for the big meeting and then return to help her father. Anyone claiming they knew just how her position at the firm would be resolved cannot be telling the truth because the movie doesn't make it clear—she's ""thinking about it,"" I believe was the line, with only the suggestion of an alternate path. If you can claim you knew just how that issue would end, I'll use the Casey Stengel line and call you ""Clara Voyant."" The issue of the hot shot prospect was whether Johnny's club, the Red Sox would draft him right before Gus's Braves could. I agree the title suggest that the young hitter might not be a good draft pick, not in the first round at least. But I certainly did not know if 1) the Sox would pick him and then regret it, or 2) if the Braves would pass on him, listening to Gus (and Mickey), or 3) if the Braves would ignore Gus and go with their computer guy. I don't see how anyone would claim it was ""predictable."" Or, let's say, out of 100 people we might have found about 33 who predicted it accurately.<br/><br/>My issues with the movie were that they made Gus too grumpy and his relationship with his daughter too estranged. The big reason why he did what he did when she was little, came as a very definite surprise.<br/><br/>I would have made this film less bitter and more lighthearted. I thought the actors did a fine job, and want to commend John Goodman for a far better role than anything I've ever seen him do, although in a supporting role.<br/><br/>If you develop interesting characters, the audience wants to see how various issues are resolved. That they know (can guess) some of the plot developments is not a problem. There are plenty of things that aren't predictable. We cared about these characters, even grumpy Gus and that's why this was an above average film."
"ntitus49","9","1","2","19 September 2013"," Trouble with the Curve theme review
","Trouble with the Curve is a great sports movie with a true love story. This movie takes place in Georgia and North Carolina. This story is about a baseball scout that seems to be past his prime, and a daughter that he doesn't have a relationship with. Gus (Clint Eastwood) is about to lose his contract if he prove his worth to the Atlanta Braves, his attempt to save his fading career he is scouting a potential 1st pick in the upcoming draft. With new found battle losing his sight, his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) takes a risk at losing her potential dream job as a partner within a giant law firm to go on the road to help her dad and rekindle a lost relationship. Gus' close friend, Pete (John Goodman), puts his career on the line to help Gus by betting he will make the right choice with the first pick in the draft.<br/><br/>During the scouting trip Gus meets with a young scout that he scouted for the Braves in the past. Johny (Justin Timberlake) threw out his arm early in his career and is now vying for a position as a scout for the Boston Red Sox. During Johny's trip to North Carolina he meets Mickey, immediately is amazed by her beauty before he knows whose daughter she is. This adds to the dramatic/sports theme the movie portrays. Johny and Mickey seem generally interested in each other as long as Mickey and Gus' relationship is going alright.<br/><br/>Gus and Mickey's relationship is very complicated due to the lack of attention and communication, but the one thing that grounds their relationship is baseball. The major scene that explains that is during the last game before the draft when Gus is listening to Bo Gentry's (Joe Massingill) at bat when he discovers that he has Trouble with the Curve. Mickey wasn't speaking to her father, but orders her to get closer to watch and listen to Bo's hands during his at bat. Upon discovering that his hands ""drift"" he calls Atlanta to try and get them to pass because of his inabilities to hit the curve. The dramatic event in this part of the movie is Mickey and her relationship with Johny has grown, as well as her relationship with her father. During this time Gus convinces Johny to pass on Bo in the draft. Phillip (Matt Willard) convinces the CEO of Atlanta Braves, Vince (Robert Patrick) to not listen to Gus and draft Bo. During this part of the movie Johny, Mickey, and Gus go their separate ways because of betrayal of each other's trust.<br/><br/>Mickey stays behind in North Carolina where she convinces Pete to take a chance on her recent finding of a no-name pitcher who can throw a curve ball that falls off the table. Mickey gets Pete to allow for a one-time unofficial tryout that is ultimately to save her dad's job. During the tryout with Bo and the hotel pitcher, he throws a curve and Bo misses continuously. This leads to Phillip losing his job, and leaves Gus with the option to renew his contract. Mickey loses her chance at becoming partner, but gains interest in becoming involved with baseball and her relationship with Johny.<br/><br/>I think that this sports themed dramatic film shares similarities with Secretariat. My reasons for this comparison are the struggles that the families are going through with each other and their common ground is their passion for sports. The risk in the movie is similar due to the fact that the main characters Gus in Trouble with the Curve, or Penny (Diane Lane) are underdogs with something to prove. While their passion is for their respective sport they are trying to maintain or build healthy relationships with their families. I think that these two movies have great stories to tell because of their true love for both the game and family."

","As a big Eastwood ( Gus), and baseball fan, this film is my type of film. What makes it different it was unpredictable, starting with Amy Adams ( Mickey), as his estranged daughter Mickey. She is a lawyer ( in an all male law firm), who goes on a scouting trip with him, because his eyesight is failing, and the Atlanta Braves ( the team he has worked for), do not know if he can do it anymore. They go on the trip to scout a star High School hitter,( Bo Gentry), to determine if the Braves should draft him with the number Two pick in the Draft. Adams is excellent and gives the best performance I ever seen her in. Another treat is Justin Timberlake ( Johnny) a star pitcher who gets injured and becomes a Scout. I have seen Timberlake in a couple of other films ( ""Bad Teacher"" and "" In Time""), and he acted like a robot, here he actually showed he has a personality. What I like is how Gus and Mickey really learn about each other ( particularly how Mickey has baseball in her blood, like he does, and only became a Lawyer to please him ( he did not think places like cheap seats and pool rooms were appropriate places for her ( although that is what she likes)). On to the story: Gentry, is an arrogant self-centered creep who treats everyone around him like dirt. There is one scene where he has the peanut man throw him a bag of peanuts, but he refuses to pay. Gus by hearing, and Amy by seeing determine the guy has a hitch in his swing, and has yes, "" Trouble With The Curve."" and Gus recommends not drafting him. However, Phillip Sanderson ( Matthew Lilliard), an arrogant computer geek who does not see the human side of people was Chief Scout for the Braves. Out of disgust, Gus left a motel where he and Mickey were staying and headed back to Atlanta. Mickey then asked the maid ( Norma Alvarez), where he was but she did not know. She was getting ready to leave until she heard a ball hitting a glove and she saw a left-handed Hispanic kid named Rigo Sanchez throwing to his brother Carlos ( they are the maid's kids). She put on the glove and he had him throw to her. He had a power fastball and an even better curve. Mickey then called Pete Klein a top Braves employee and a friend of Gus who requested she go down and scout with him ( John Goodman in a very different and well done performance), and she told him to fly the kid and family up to Atlanta, and pointed out you owe me. He then brought them up, and when she was at the park with the family, Gentry, ( who Gus rejected), was taking batting practice, and she told him to face him. He laughed because he recognized the peanut man who he put down earlier. Needless to say, he struck him out three times ( and made him look pathetic particularly on curves). People were comparing him to Sandy Koufax and Randy Johnson and the Braves signed him and fired Sanderson. They wanted Gus to remain but he said ""I will think about it"" and Mickey ( on Gus's advice) will represent Rigo, and she quit the law firm. At the end Johnny was outside waiting for Mickey to begin a life together. The final surprise is Eastwood walking away and not dying ( which would have ruined the film). Basically I loved the film 10/10 stars."

","Possibly Eastwood's last movie, this could be a solid conclusion of his acting career.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve is a good-at-best baseball drama with a star-studded cast and an interesting story. It succeeds for the most part, but a couple of flaws bring it down from what could've been an Oscar-nominated or -winning drama with Eastwood as its front man.<br/><br/>The flaws include: - A clunky script and illogical moments. - Clint Eastwood's character almost never redeeming himself. - Repetitive, annoying fights between Adams and Eastwood's characters. and some more.<br/><br/>Ill say the positives first. The cinematography and shots I this film were up to par: never going beyond, but never going backwards either. The acting was good, setting the standards for a movie of this caliber. The cast had a lot of Hollywood greats such as Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, John Goodman, and Justin Timberlake. I liked Timberlake the most, the only male character in the film to actually have the where-with-all and be completely sane. ;-)<br/><br/>That being said, the film lacked many good qualities. The script was clunky and never seemed to fit in at the right moments. Of course, Eastwood had his one liners (""What are you fellas staring at, I'm not a pole dancer.""). But there was just constant fighting, and repetitive lines of dialogue between Eastwood and Adams. He would grunt, she would yell at him for not being there for her as a child, blah blah blah. The first time was acceptable, but then it just got plain tedious. And after about a minute of talking to him, she would storm out of the room, and then they would be shown together the next scene like everything was fine and dandy. There was never any redemption of Clint Eastwood's character until the very end, as if the first 45 minutes of the movie were a waste. And Justin Timberlake's character was very good; the guy can act! And even though he was a relief for the whole movie, he didn't get enough screen time to outdo the mess that Eastwood and Adams made throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Even though it seems like I had a million things to complain about, I still recommend this movie. Why? Because, flaws aside, it meshes together baseball, Clint Eastwood, a good cast, and enough family drama to compete with the Kardashians. <br/><br/>HandHStudios Rating: 6.7/10"
"rmax304823","6","1","2","27 June 2013"," What is past, or passing, or to come.
","It's a movie about Clint Eastwood, baseball scout for one of the major league teams, sent to North Carolina to bid competitively for the services of an arrogant young slugger. He's joined by his estranged daughter, Amy Adams, who grew up with baseball but has just been offered a partnership in her law firm back in Atlanta.<br/><br/>Will the managers take Eastwood's advice to pass the slugger up, or will they go with the statistics and hire him? Eastwood is going blind and can hardly read his own name, but his knowledgeable daughter serves as his eyes. (Clintwood has his own ears and can use them instrumentally.) The firm wants her back in the city to make an important presentation to a client, and she's working her butt off to polish it up, but she feels that Dad needs her here in the sticks. Will she abrogate her professional responsibilities and see this conundrum through with Eastwood, who keeps telling her to beat it? It's all very tense.<br/><br/>Eastwood's later work has always been leisurely and here it's even more so, with its focus on father and daughter, and baseball and jobs important subjects but minor. There are plenty of scenes in which people sit around and talk over bottles of beer. There really isn't much baseball involved, and practically nothing about the way a scout exercises his skills. Dad hates computers and all that robotical crap. He can tell whether a boy can hit from the way the ball sounds when it whops into the catcher's glove. But how he does it, how he can tell, remains a mystery.<br/><br/>Amy Adams' performance isn't bad. She's kind of cute, with that upturned nose of hers. And she's of a proper age to play Eastwood's daughter, in her early thirties, a graduate of law school, and an established career. If she were ten years younger it would make us wonder about Eastwood, who has aged quite a bit in the past few years, since, say, ""The Changeling."" It's not just that he LOOKS older. His voice has been reduced from an aging gargle to a hoarse whisper. It's depressing to see him soldiering on and yet it evokes our sympathy for the character -- and for Eastwood. ""An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick, unless Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing For every tatter in its mortal dress."" Eastwood handles the role as an angry egotist in professional decline, but it's quietly moving. It's not a great movie, not exceptionally good, but, in a way, it doesn't have to be."
"bluesman-20","Null","1","2","9 June 2013"," Solid Clint Eastwood film.
","I've been a Clint Eastwood Fan since I first saw him as Dirty Harry in The Enforcer. After that I saw Every Eastwood film I could get my hands on. I was 8 when I saw the Enforcer. just to let you know I've been a Eastwood fan since the mid 70's and I've seen everything he's done. Some great some good some not so good but still entertaining.<br/><br/>Trouble with the Curve falls under the good category. Eastwood shows his age flexes his acting muscles and makes a solid hit.<br/><br/>The Story follows Legendary Scout for the Atlanta Braves Gus Lobdell. Gus has seen it all knows everything about Baseball and is considered a Legend. Truth is Gus is also seen as a dinosaur. In this Brave New world of Computers and stats and the internet Gus is seen as highly out of touch. He still uses the same methods he used back in the 50's. To Gus it's a game of watching and paperwork and waiting to see what develops. The game has moved on past that. To them computers are the wave of the future to Gus it's the human touch. He feels a computer can't tell you the simple things. Like why a man has a slump when people feel he's finished,all the player needs is to see his family. Or the man has a problem affecting him. Gus can feel that out. A computer can't.<br/><br/>So When a rookie player named Bo Gentry comes across the radar for the Braves and the Red Sox Suddenly the push is one to sign Him. The Sox get first pick so it's very important that Gus not screw this up. But Gus is 82 years old and going blind. not to mention he's not very likable. So when his daughter wonderfully played by Amy Adams is asked to help her father and find out what's happening with him. Mickey is understandably upset she's got a big court case coming up with a partnership hanging on the line. and Her estranged father isn't doing so well not to mention he's not talking to her or anyone else about his health woes. Mickey is told that if Gus can't do his job he'll be fired after his contract with the braves expires in three months. So Mickey goes with Gus and meets Johnny a former player turned scout . Johnny is loyal to Gus who had given him his big break. The game isn't important actually it takes the back burner as these three now form the main focus of the film. The Ending is highly unlikely in this day and age. But it feels like that old Hollywood ending full of magic and disbelief. They don't make them like this anymore which is a shame. It's a good solid film that makes for worthwhile entertainment. Here's to Hoping Clint Eastwood makes more films as a actor ."
"christine-705-717153","6","1","2","7 June 2013"," It's tough to follow home run with a double. And that's what Trouble with the Curve is. A double.
","I was irritated with Clint after his ridiculous performance at Mitt's ridiculous convention, and I was worried that my feelings would affect my experience of seeing him in Trouble with the Curve. But I should have had more faith in my own ability to put such feelings aside because when the lights went down and he showed up to play a failing baseball scout who has spent a lifetime following the game, I forgot all about empty chairs and silly monologues.<br/><br/>Clint is so bad in this movie that his embarrassing convention performance a few weeks ago has now been completely overshadowed by his stilted, half-assed performance in this movie. There is a scene early on in which he has just gotten out of bed and is going to try to pee. His plumbing is working like an old man's—nothing is happening. He talks to it, and while I'm sure that scene actually plays itself out in real life across the world in many languages, Clint has no clue how it works. Then there is his failing eyesight, which causes him to run into things and trip and fall into grandstands. It's played so badly, so inauthentically, that you can almost hear the director saying to him, ""trip here Clint.""<br/><br/>And what a shame it is, because the character of Gus Lobel has legs, and it needed the kind of performance that Tommy Lee Jones gave in Hope Springs. The character of Gus reveals a lot about the inner workings of men in their twilight years who have wrestled with hard decisions alone, without input from the people who were affected by those decisions. My dad is a Gus Lobel, and when I thought about the character after the movie, I softened my attitude toward some of the decisions my father made that affected me so very much long ago, decisions that seemed at the time to have been made without any consideration for my opinion. It was a gift, but I didn't get it from Clint's performance.<br/><br/>Then there is Amy Adams, whom we all love. You are not allowed not to love Amy, who plays Gus' brilliant daughter Mickey (Mickey, by the way, is just too contrived a name. Quit using her name to shove who she really is down my throat). Mickey is struggling to play the role of a trident lawyer, but her true joy is the game of baseball. I love how she demonstrates her knowledge of the game at the moment most likely to give it a large landing. I don't mean to sound petty, but the trouble with Amy in this film is her hair. I can't see past it. It's really long and very wavy, and takes over the screen whenever it is on camera, which obviously is whenever Amy is on camera. My Aunt Nancy said when we were leaving the theater that all she could see was Veronica Lake. Here is a quote from Veronica Lake that says it all. ""I will have one of the cleanest obits of any actress. I never did cheesecake like Ann Sheridan or Betty Grable. I just used my hair."" And so it goes. Her performance was lost in her hair. Alas.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake, who plays Gus' adoring discovery and the smitten wannabe boyfriend of Mickey, really needs to stop trying to take up more creative space than he is due. He is a great singer, and an even better performer on stage. He needs to quit being greedy and stop trying to be an actor as well. You only get so many talents. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>A shout out to John Goodman, who is always great playing the same cranky man's man who has real soul underneath. I'd love to have lunch with him sometime. Bet he's got tons to say.<br/><br/>The movie is better than my whining here. There is a message in it, and the ending has the rah rah we Americans love to see on the screen, but it isn't developed enough. It's one-dimensional and too predictable, and the truth is that even if it had been done better, the real problem is that it follows the movie Moneyball, which was so damned fabulous that any baseball movie would pale in comparison. It's tough to follow home run with a double. And that's what Trouble with the Curve is. A double."

","This movie is cliché ridden, foreseeable, there were some bad dialogs and still I liked this movie because of the characters.<br/><br/>Still, the story is paper thin, this is not a very creative movie and I would not suggest this movie to everyone as the best movie ever. But I fell in love about how this story is told. It is slow, it has great pictures in it, lovable characters. When the credits roll, you just feel good about it. <br/><br/>I always rate movies about their ability to entertain. There was not one minute when I had to watch my clock, it felt very short and so it gets a good rating. Because this is what entertainment is all about, isn't it?"

","Watching an Eastwood movie is not only good, it's a pleasure, an honor and a very rewarding experience. Eastwood belongs to greatness, so, as you can see, I'm a huge fan! Being said that, I was sad and miserable when Eastwood announced that Gran Torino would be his last effort as an actor. Thank God he returned for this one!<br/><br/>As most of Eastwood's characters as an old man, they all have something in common: they look for retribution. That was the main point in Gran Torino, as also in Unforgiven and other films. And that is the main point here, but not as dark as his other characters were. Despite that, I liked it very much, well, being crazy for Eastwood's work, I may not be the very right person to tell you. But I think it's still a strong performance nevertheless.<br/><br/>Other actors (yeah, in an Eastwood movie they are just that, other actors, sorry!) are also nice and do their jobs fine. John Goodman was good, Amy Adams was nice. And Justin Timberlake was just... well, being himself as always. Nice direction, good pacing, and that's just about right, check this one out!"
"AvidClimber","7","1","2","15 April 2013"," Trouble with the Curve — A tenacious daughter and a grouchy mule-headed father
","Trouble with the Curve is a father-daughter movie.<br/><br/>The acting is solid. You're quickly taken by the story and the characters who are well developed. The setup is quick. There's no lingering at any stage of the well paced scenario. The story is diversified, rich, and vibrant. The cast is scintillating. Clint Eastwood plays yet an other grouchy old man, but even grouchier, and plays it once again very well. Amy Adams is sweet and lovely with a demanding presence on screen. Justin Timberlake act as hot as he usually does with a role that fits him very well. John Goodman complete the cast of friends with an other good performance. And finally, you just want to slap Matthew Lillard, as the over confident ass hole.<br/><br/>However the ending is weak. It should have ended before the boardroom with a simple closing of the chapter on the field. The way it was done is too sugary, and tying all those loose ends treats the audience as a simple minded pink-flavor junkie.<br/><br/>There's also a number of big clichés concerning the father-daughter relationship, as well as the workaholic, the hot new thing (and there are no less than three of them), and the quickly slipped in discovery of the unknown superstar.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."
"sddavis63","3","1","2","24 February 2013"," To Me, This Totally Missed The Mark
","I came away from this thinking that so much more could have been done with it. There was a potentially powerful story here about the troubled relationship between a father and daughter and their attempt to reconnect. The father and daughter were played by actors for whom I have a very high regard - the veteran Clint Eastwood, and I've been enchanted with Amy Adams ever since I saw her in ""Enchanted."" And they were both very good in their roles - Eastwood as the dad, an aging baseball scout with failing vision who's nearing the end of the road and Adams as his daughter, who's on the fast track to becoming a partner with a major law firm. The story has Gus (Eastwood) being sent to scout a high school baseball phenom and Mickey (Adams) going with him to help him out. Theirs is a distant and troubled relationship. The question is ""why?"" And the problem is that not enough focus is put on the relationship and its history and on their reconciliation. Other than portraying their distance from each other, maybe 10 minutes of the movie explores the background of the relationship. That was a missed opportunity. It could have been a powerful story, except that the writers clearly aren't satisfied with this being an emotional roller coaster of a ride through a troubled father-daughter relationship, and they want us to think of this as a baseball movie. And that was a problem.<br/><br/>Gus was a scout. I get that. But the behind the scenes machinations going on in the Atlanta Braves organization (supposedly) didn't strike me as believable. If you want to see behind the scenes baseball portrayed, watch ""Moneyball."" It does a much better job of that. Then there was the high school baseball phenom Bo Gentry (played by Joe Massingill.) As far as I was concerned, he should have been no more than a minor backdrop. The only thing relevant about the character was that Gus - for all the limitations age had brought on - was still able to scout him properly. He couldn't hit a curve ball. Aside from that he really didn't matter to the story, so why keep going back to him? I didn't care at all that he was an arrogant, obnoxious, self absorbed jerk. I don't know why that had to be stressed as much as it was. I don't know why there was a need to have the young Red Sox scout thrown into the picture. OK. I do know. For whatever reason, there needed to be a potential romance for Mickey. Why did there need to be a potential romance for Mickey? I really don't know, except that Amy Adams is cute, and I guess Hollywood figures that a character played by someone as cute as Amy Adams needs a romance. But I really didn't care about her relationship with Johnny (Justin Timberlake.) Adams' time would have been better spent in more powerful scenes with Eastwood than in fluff stuff with Timberlake. And the closing scenes where Mickey brings in a curve ball throwing phenom (Jay Galloway) she's discovered and gets him a tryout with the Braves, setting him up against Gentry in a workout struck me as just plain dumb.<br/><br/>There was some potentially good material in this, and there were two great actors who could have done a lot if that potential had been used. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the whole movie suffered as a result, becoming bogged down in too much baseball at the expense of where the real meat of the story was. (3/10)"
"doctardis","8","1","2","21 February 2013"," Undiscovered Gem
","This was the third movie I watched on a plane, and was shocked to discover how good it was. This is a really good movie that should have gotten more attention. I suppose it got lost in all the noise around the Twilight movie series ending and the Presidential election. This is a timeless movie about fathers, daughters and baseball. You do not have to like baseball to like this movie. It is closer to chick flick, but is it much better then those. The characters are brought to life with great performances by Amy Adams and Clint Eastwood. These are not cookie cutter characters as is true in most movies. And there are strong supporting characters played by John Goodman and Justin Timberlake. This is worth seeing."
"kcrider91","9","1","2","9 February 2013"," A feel good movie for any person; sports fan or not
","If you've ever watched any Clint Eastwood film you'll be in for a shocker.<br/><br/>The last time I saw Clint Eastwood in such a powerful and diverse role like this was when I was sitting there watching him in Grand Torino and Heart Break Ridge. <br/><br/>If your looking for a movie that hits all the right chords to create a beautiful melody this is the movie for you. It starts off like any classical Eastwood movie; slow, but not in a bad way. As we gain a knowledge of what kind of person Gus is, a stubborn old man who will not ask for help, we meet his daughter Mickey. Mickey is an accomplished lawyer who is trying to get her big break at a the law firm of her dreams. Gus's baseball scouting contract is coming to its end and the young gun, Phillip, at the Atlanta Braves is trying to get him fired. <br/><br/>Mickey is asked by Gus's friend Pete to keep an eye on Gus because somethings wrong with him. Mickey is reluctant to go because of her history with her father. This history is explored through out the movie but doesn't really develop until the end.<br/><br/>As Gus and Mickey travel around Caroline to scout a big name in recruiting, Bo Gentry, they meet Johnny Flanagan. Johnny is one of Gus's old recruits that threw his arm out playing in the major league years back and is now trying to get a job announcing for major league games. As Mikey and Gus travel around Johnny is fallowing the same recruit them around as a scout and instantly falls for Mickey and flirts with her constantly. As the story progresses the tension between Mickey and Gus becomes apparent and nether are really ken on fixing it. <br/><br/>Johnny and Mickey's relationship starts to heat up and Mickey starts to really fall for Johnny.<br/><br/>As the MLB draft comes up Gus tells the Braves not to take Bo because of a simple hick in his swing that keeps him from hitting curve balls. Mickey asks how Gus knows this and he said you can hear it, you just have to listen for the pitch. Phillip tells the GM not to listen to an blind old man but to trust the computers and take him. Johnny tells his team to pass because the Braves will not take Bo and they can have him later. The GM, however, does not take Gus's advise and takes the player. This cost Johnny his job and he blames Gus and Mickey. Out of distress, Mickey starts to push her father for answers of why he left her. This is were we get the whole story of Gus and Mickey's past and the tension that runs between them.<br/><br/>As Gus goes back to Atlanta without Mickey to try figure out what happened. Mickey stays at the motel and as she walks around she hears something. She watches a young man names Rigo Sanchez throw a wicked fast ball. She asks to she his curve ball and she hears it. <br/><br/>Now the action really picks up. Gus tells the GM he made a mistake and when asked how he knows he says because he can hear it and Mickey saw it. Gus is about to get go into retirement when Mickey brings Rigo down to the field to pitch to Bo. Sure enough Rigo throws a fast ball that Bo can't even get a bat on and When Rigo starts to throw his curve ball Bo is know where near close to hitting it. Phillip then is fired, Rigo is asked to play Major League Baseball with Mickey as his agent, and Gus is asks to stay on as a scout but says ""maybe."" <br/><br/>As they leave Johnny shows up and he and Mickey make up and the movie ends.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge baseball fan. In all honesty I find it extremely boring, but this movie changed that I see now the athleticism in the pitchers and hitters that play this sport. It is a great sports movie and has the right taste of drama to keep you on the edge of your seat. If your a Clint Eastwood fan this will not disappoint. If your a baseball fan this will not disappoint, and if your looking for a heart warming story to watch for the night this is it! I love this movie and will continue to watch it when ever possible."
"MartinHafer","7","1","2","23 January 2013"," Quite enjoyable and original
","While this is billed as a Clint Eastwood film, the star of the film seems to be Amy Adams--who seems to get more than her share of screen time. Regardless, it's an enjoyable and original film--and one worth renting.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays a cranky old man--much like the guy he played in ""Gran Torino"" but without the race prejudice. He's definitely a crusty old guy and has a habit of pushing away those who should be closest to him--particularly his daughter (Adams). However, now that he's in his 80s and his eyesight is failing, he really has no choice but to ask for help--but he's just too darn stubborn to do so. So, his boss (John Goodman) takes it on himself to call her and let her know that he's in need of help--especially if he wants to keep his job as a major league scout for the Atlanta Braves. As for Adams, she's a crazed workaholic who wants to be made a partner at her law firm. But she also KNOWS she should help, so for the first time in years, she takes a bit of vacation time to meet her dad in North Carolina--where he's scouting a new hot prospect. Not surprisingly, the film has a lot to do with family and reconnecting but it also is about learning to slow down and enjoy life--something which Adams doesn't seem to know how to do--particularly when she meets a nice young guy (Justin Timberlake--who is really growing into a good actor) who is interested in her. Where does all this go? See the film.<br/><br/>My score of 7 was a tough call and I almost gave it an 8. I think my reason for ultimately deciding on a 7 is that, to me, this seems much more like a rent it than go to the theaters to see it sort of movie. The acting is nice, the story unusual enough to merit watching it and there is a wonderful relaxed quality about it that you often don't find in Hollywood films. On the downside, the ending did seem a bit unreal...but still quite enjoyable."

Honestly, we don't mind too much but it is getting somewhat old as he's the same character in different clothes. However, this is Mickey's story and she has to deal with Gus, who abandoned her years ago. Gus is one of those people who cannot express love and caring.

"JohnRayPeterson","7","1","2","20 December 2012"," Perfect title, once you've seen the movie
","The film is classic recent decade Clint Eastwood; since 1997, Eastwood has been playing cantankerous over-the-hill characters in each and every movie, all of them. So, it boggles my mind when viewers, especially after reading the storyline of this movie, expect to see anything but what he can deliver, and deliver with the precision of a Swiss watch. It snows in winter, there are heat waves in the summer, sports games haven't changed much in decades and neither has Clint. Of course, there is that thing he did at the republican convention this past September, but that has nothing to do with the price of tea in China either. He's 82; how many of us can still deliver solid work by that age. Bravo Clint.<br/><br/>The movie has a good cast of pros, even Justin Timberlake got off with a more than decent performance. I'm too bias to speak at length about Amy Adams; some of my previous reviews have probably made it clear I like her. She has an important role in this movie and I was not disappointed by her. I had some difficulty buying in on the premise that an accomplished attorney (her role), poised for partnership in a big firm, would practically drop one of her biggest cases to go on the road with her dad; but thankfully, the script covers that apparent gaping flaw with a most plausible reason, one that more than explains the direction the story takes from that point. As in all of the movies in which Clint has picked to act, the characters developments play the most important part. The story follows a well orchestrated direction, designed to bring an impact ending, which of course it does; you can always expect a big finish and you'd have reason to complain if there wasn't one.<br/><br/>It struck me that the baseball back-story was coming from a completely different direction than that of the 2011 hit Moneyball; it nonetheless works and works well, thanks to Matthew Lillard's performance. If he has a part in a movie, rest assured, you're going to hate the character; I wish he was given a part going the other way, just once, to see if he could do as well. The switch would certainly play the element of surprise; but producers aren't always ready to take that sort of risk. Loved John Goodman; how can you not. Now here's an actor who has played a variety of roles, and you can't hate him even when his character is despicable (In The Electric Mist). This movie, like Clint's two previous ones, moved me; thankfully, I was prepared. Don't expect another Million Dollar Baby; be realistic and enjoy."

Everything about this movie is formulaic, predictable and manipulative. None of the characters has any depth - they are all cardboard cutouts. Every plot development can be seen coming a mile away. All that's missing is black hats and white hats to mark the good guys and the bad guys. I take some consolation in the fact that Eastwood's contribution to the flick was as actor only. If he had had any input into the script or the direction, I am sure the results would have been better. As it is this movie is almost unwatchable."

","There are some good moments here, and the concept has potential; old time scout battling the new computer age. However, Clint Eastwood, as usual, is brutal as the central character. He has now turned completely into Grumpy Old Man, and hasn't departed from that role for several years; still whispering and squinting his eyes, and under-acting to the point of absurdity. At times, Eastwood barely seems alive on screen, an animated corpse whom the audience is supposed to love, in spite of his gruff, unemotional, unaffectionate personality. <br/><br/>Eastwood's unfriendly old man persona is just one of the clichéd, overdone aspects of this film. How many times has Hollywood featured an old guy that is too proud to admit an illness, unwilling to show his feelings for his children, and too stubborn to change his ways? Wouldn't it be refreshing if Hollywood produced a movie about an old guy who didn't cuss, wasn't angry, was emotional and affectionate to a fault with his family, was religious and not obsessed with sex and had no stubborn streak? <br/><br/>Other parts of this film revolve around the film industry's hackneyed political correctness. Gee, who could have predicted that the arrogant young prospect would be white? And who could have foreseen that the humble and lovable ""peanut boy,"" as the white jerk hotshot derisively calls him, would be Hispanic? And, more importantly, be a truly super pitching prospect who humiliates the white jerk in his practice debut? <br/><br/>Amy Adams plays another oft-seen character, the strong, self-assured young woman who can outdo the boys at anything. It's actually amazing she didn't punch out at least one white guy during the film. If you enjoy the overrated Eastwood, you'll enjoy this film. If you have little patience with clichés, predictability and political correctness, you should look elsewhere for entertainment."

","Although I won't rate it as unwatchable, I would never recommend this film. <br/><br/>Clint has become a one-dimensional character in his later years. How much range is there to crotchety old man? Between the gasping whispers and hoarse-voiced vitriol, there is not much else there. Amy Adams brings nothing to this. She can't even be bothered to bring her cute to the front and give us something to watch. Flat, vague, misdirected, and bored, she left me waiting for something, anything to latch onto to make me care about this character and the story. I don't think Justin has much of a future in films unless his next project is just amazingly directed. He was so shallow as to be nothing more than eye candy for the girls who are forced to watch this with their boyfriends.<br/><br/>John Goodman is always solid but even he couldn't rescue this snooze- fest. I kept waiting for something that I knew viscerally wasn't going to happen. Just the optimist in me, I guess.<br/><br/>From the very beginning I felt that I had seen this film so many times before. Father estranged from daughter, daughter has grown up emotionally unavailable (which they felt they had to blatantly point out), father and daughter are forced into a situation requisite with a bonding moment, rejection, reconciliation, reconstituted love, yada, yada, yada. Oh, and hook it all up with a catchy folk song: You Are My Sunshine. <br/><br/>Whether it ended up on the cutting room floor (most likely with running time at 1:54) or Lorenz thought he was slick, there was no explanation or reason why JT showed up at the end to rescue Amy's love.

Gus, we are told early on, doesn't put any stock in those newfangled computer programs that all the other scouts use because a computer can't tell if a kid's got heart, and so on....Gus's friend, played by John Goodman, realizing that something's up with Gus, recruits his daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), a workaholic lawyer to accompany Gus on the trip. Mickey has her own issues, stemming from her dad sending her away to temporarily live with relatives after her mother's death, and as Justin Timberlake's character, a former pitcher, puts it, when the two get going, they're as good as the Kardashians. Will Gus save the day? Will Mickey realize there's more to life than making partner? Will she end up with the guy whom she initially gives the brush off? Only if you've never seen a movie before, will you be unable to figure this all out, and even then, you might anyway.<br/><br/>In the movie, Mickey describes her ideal guy, and she points at her head, then her heart. This movie's got oodles of heart, but not many brains. The three leads do an excellent job, even with a weak script, but it's predictable from start to finish.

The storyline has Clint losing his wife when his daughter is 6 years old. This creates a dysfunctional family relationship which is realistically portrayed in the plot by the actors. The real surprise here is Justin Timberlake. While his role is clearly support, he shows some real acting skill. While he is no Eastwood yet, there looks like from judging this one that Timberlake has made the right move here as he shines in his role.<br/><br/>Some very good support in this as John Goodman, one of the most under rated actors in movies is solid in a very good supporting cast. The movie does drag a bit in parts, but at least it does not stop, it just slows down like Eastwood has at this age.<br/><br/>Eastwood is a Baseball Scout, Amy Adams is his daughter and an attorney. John Goodman is the General Manager of the Braves. Timberlake is a scout for the Red Sox. While the results here are not something new and unique, they are solid entertainment."

","Despite not liking Mr. Eastwood's recent appearance at the Republican National Convention (Really, he used a chair as a prop and pretended it was President Barack Obama and imagined he told him to do something to himself?), I decided to watch his latest movie with my movie theatre-working friend because I still like his acting work. And as an elderly baseball scout who might be losing his bearings, Clint can still bring the charm and the chemistry when performing with the likes of Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, and especially, Amy Adams as his daughter who can be just as stubborn as him. An added benefit to me was when both Eastwood and Adams, separately, were thinking of better times when they started singing the song, ""You Are My Sunshine"" which was a tune my late dad frequently warbled during his lifetime (though he always skipped the part that went ""When skies are gray"") even before we moved here to Baton Rouge in 1975 and eventually discovered it was co-written and sung by a former Governor of our state Louisiana named Jimmie Davis. Really, all I'll say now is I recommend Trouble with the Curve."

But if you're expecting another fantastic Clint Eastwood film that'll win more Academy Awards, then this is not that. <br/><br/>I'll talk about what I thought worked first.

Amy Adams played the role of Mickey, Gus's daughter well and I really believe she was the best possible choice for the character. Clint Eastwood of course gives a great performance as Gus, the lead character. Eastwood and Adams pull off the father/daughter dynamic well and Timberlake and Adams also pull off the romantic chemistry. The romantic plot between them is very well placed in the film and it's good to see. <br/><br/>The main thing I didn't care for about this film was the feeling of average that I got after it was over. I walked away feeling that it was between alright and pretty good, a 7/10, and that's not awful of course, but I was hoping for better. <br/><br/>This is a film I only recommend if you know what you're going into and you don't expect to get more than that."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Ten minutes into this movie, I was thinking oh boy, this is clunky, forced and simplistic. But as it progressed the character development began to take shape. Not stellar by any means, many characters were stereotypical and the scenes used to illustrate those traits werefunctional. The story was about a veteran baseball scout, think anti-Moneyball, who is matched up against a scout who only looks at statistics and whether or not a MLB team should draft a certain player #1 in the draft. The secondary storyline was the veteran scout's relationship with his daughter whom he gave sparse time to during her childhood. The story and dialog for the most part grew on me and as the father/daughter relationship began to take center stage it helped the movie. You also end up easily rooting for certain characters if you let yourself enjoy the film without picking apart the small details that aren't critical. Although, one did bug me. Where the daughter who apparently used to play baseball, was able to catch a top prospect's best fastball and curveball with ease. With that much time away from playing, those skills wouldn't immediately be finely honed. Anyway, fun sport drama with decent emotion and some cliché moments."
"Screen_Blitz","6","0","1","21 September 2017"," Here lies a sports drama starring Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams doing their least remarkable roles
","Clint Eastwood has established himself as a major Hollywood icon for the last six decades since the inauguration of his career. Even he falls victim to some less than remarkable roles whether he is working in front or behind the camera. This sports drama starring the aging star, pushing his 80s, in the lead role sees him putting on a good performance in what is nonetheless one of his weakest entries in his career in front of the camera. With his previous on screen role being the grumpy Korean War veteran in 'Gran Torino', Eastwood has struck the screen once again with Oscar nominee Amy Adams on his side, a movie dealing with the politics of major league baseball. It is only too bad the film falls short of emotional impact and drives with a story that is criminally underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, these are two of the Hollywood's most talented actors working on screen. That justifies how reasonable it is to believe they would collaborate on something more rousing. It comes to show the most golden stars are not always the winners. This film follows Gus Lobel (played by Clint Eastwood), an aging, widowed baseball scout struggling with his eye contact, who crosses paths with his estranged daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams), a lawyer who is on her way being promoted to a higher position. Despite their dysfunctional relationship, she becomes his partner-in-crime on a scouting trip to North Carolina to recruit players for the Atlanta Braves. During the trip, they struggle to come to terms with their past relationship. <br/><br/>Director Robert Lorenz does not have the film drowning in a total loss, there is still a small amount of grace to be admired in his execution. The film has its heart in the right place and lightens with a little charm and occasional humor to sugarcoat the mood. But when it comes to evoking interest in its story, that is when it leaves you desiring for something of a higher option. What transpires throughout the picture is a mixed mag of sappy family drama and the anxiety of fighting to make ends meet in the corporate office outside the baseball field; similar to what transpired in 'Moneyball', only this film lacks the dramatic coercion that made that film is hit. When the tackling on the family dynamics between the lead character and his daughter including the questioning of his abandonment during her childhood; the story is heart-filling enough, though it eventually loses its emotional steam. Don't expect anything of a tear-jerker. When shifting its focuses on Mickey with her work dilemmas, it gets plodding and uninteresting, not to mention cheesy. The best thing the film can walk away with is, of course, a strong performance by Clint Eastwood, playing in usual grumpy old man persona. As for Amy Adams, she is fine no less. Her chemistry with Justin Timberlake however, certainly doesn't sizzle in the way it wants to be. Sure, they have their moments, but they're definitely nothing special. John Goodman as one of the baseball managers and Gus's best friend is fine too as is Matthew Lillard as the antagonist drafters of the baseball team. Are they memorable roles though? Not Really. <br/><br/>Trouble with The Curve is a fine sports drama with a little bit of charm to experienced, but nonetheless sees Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams acting in arguably their least remarkable roles in recent years. The movie is not necessarily a dud, especially as it will likely attract the attention for those who have fandom for major league baseball. On the other hand, there are better and more admirable options in the roster of baseball movies."

","Trouble With the Curve (2012): Dir: Robert Lorenz / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Matthew Lillard: Sports drama that relates baseball to that of family and relationships. Clint Eastwood plays a baseball talent scout whose vision is going. Amy Adams plays his daughter, a lawyer who is struggling to merge ahead in the company. She is convinced to accompany her father for a few days to observe his condition. Her father is reluctant to connect especially since after his wife died, he abandoned his daughter to relatives. The story behind this is explained deeper eventually. First time director Robert Lorenz has worked with Eastwood in various films. The concept is there but the payoff is formula, predictable and sometimes corny. It even features the umpteenth drunken guy in a bar who hits on the female and gets roughed up. The best aspect of the film is the chemistry between Eastwood and Adams. He is gruff and often humorous in his denial of his sight condition but he proves his talent when his hearing becomes a strong point. Adams is wonderful as a career woman struggling to connect with her distant father. Justin Timberlake as a would be announcer is buried deep in a lame romantic subplot, and John Goodman is flat as Eastwood's long time friend. Matthew Lillard plays the standard underwritten rival that will get his encounter with karma in the conclusion. This is hardly one of Eastwood's best films but it features a touching theme of reconnecting and offering forgiveness when those curve balls peel forward. Score: 6 / 10"

But he already is a cranky old man, so it put him over the top. <br/><br/>Luckily, we were watching at home, and since it was so obvious, and not very serious to us, though ever-so-serious to the characters, it became sort of participatory, where we would boo and mock and cheer. So we got some fun out of it.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing. The movie revolved around the love of baseball that united all of our heroes. So, maybe Squint wasn't making a bad tear–jerker, far below his usual subtlety and skill, maybe he was using a movie to create a baseball-watching-like experience!? That would be pretty awesome.

","The ageing star of Gran Torino said that the 2008 film would be his last acting role, so it was a surprise to everyone when he returned four years with for this film, that also had an impressive list of supporting stars, and it looked like a nice simple watch. Basically ageing Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is the baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, but he is nearing the end of his contract, team manager Vince (Robert Patrick) thinks it may be time for him to consider retirement, and meanwhile the grumpy Gus has developed problems with his sight, he hides this from everyone. Knowing baseball is Gus's pride and joy, and that retirement would kill him, his boss and friend Pete Klein (John Goodman) asks him to scout promising new player Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill) in North Caroline, and Pete also wards off Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard) who wants Gu fired and to take his position. Gus's estranged daughter Mickey Lobel (Amy Adams) is an efficient lawyer who works alongside in the office with colleague Todd (James Patrick Freetly), she is in with a chance to get a partnership, but Pete asks her to travel to North Caroline to try and reconnect and help him any way she can. Mickey has a passion for baseball herself, and since childhood when she used to travel with her father she has a great knowledge of the sport, but she has been traumatised she since he abandoned her when she young and left her with an uncle. Also in North Caroline is former pitcher Johnny Flanagan (Justin Timberlake) who since getting a shoulder injury has had an early retirement and has become a scout himself for the Boston Red Sox and is trying to become a broadcaster, Gus and he has a friendly history, and when he meets Mickey they are mutually attracted to each other. Over the next few days Gus struggles more with his eye sight, which at one point causes a bad car accident, but after recovering he continues his job and sees that there are problems with Gentry trying to hit the ball pitched in curve, Gus does not go into much detail but is not recommending the young player to be on the team. Vince is advised by Phillip to hire Gentry for the team anyway, they are unaware of his ""trouble with the curve"", but Mickey, who is officially in a relationship with Johnny, sees the opportunity to show them the problem with Rigo Sanchez (Jay Galloway), originally a baseball food vendor, who proves a skilled pitcher, with the ability to throw balls at high speed, including a curve. The staff realise Gus was right, they show intent to sign Rigo (with Mickey possibly being his agent) and downgrade Bo's player status, Phillip is fired for his remarks, Gus is given an extended contract, Mickey realises she is much more enthusiastic about baseball and shows signs she will quit the law firm, Johnny waiting for them approaches and he and Mickey embrace their love and kiss, and Gus gives a faint smile, lights a cigar and walks away. Also starring Bob Gunton as Watson and Scott Eastwood, Clint's son as Billy Clark. Eastwood as usual is great being grouchy, using bad language but also being a likable father figure, Adams gives a good performance as the daughter reconnecting with him and enjoying her favourite sport, Timberlake proves again a terrific actor being the love interest of the daughter, and the supporting cast members do well also. The story may be a little predictable at times, probably more so with the baseball stuff, but the father and daughter relationship works well, and the mini romantic element is nice to watch as well, all in all it is good sports drama.

A movie premise based on a plot hole a mile wide is on some shaky ground to begin with. It doesn't help matters that every person who disagrees with him about retirement conveniently turns out to be an incompetent a-hole.<br/><br/>The film still has some nice moments and takes us moderately deeply into the universe of baseball scouting and going somewhere new is always interesting. At the same time, a more realistic film might have made us feel like we were actually experiencing the life of a baseball scout.<br/><br/>The film's other strong points are Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake. As someone who is not in the camp that Timberlake has previously displayed any acting skills, this is Timberlake's first role in which he could legitimately be called an actor.

","Yeah, it has Clint Eastwood in it in the trailer so I thought he directed this movie as well. But he is not in the director seat this time but is the main protagonist in this. It's a watchable movie but far from being great as Clint Eastwood's past movie or the one's he directed. I can't really think of anything that remotely made this movie stand out all that much besides it having Clint Eastwood in it. The movie is about recruiting baseball players and the relationship between other characters. But it doesn't seem to focus on baseball all that much or how the recruiting process works and when it came to the character relationship development. It's done in a very cliché and generic manner and is easily forgettable. Justin Timberlake's character didn't even have to be in this movie. His character didn't really add anything to the movie nor take away anything. I didn't like how they incorporate how a person's brain and heart can beat any calculations from a machine kinda deal. When it comes to these types of movies I recommend ""Moneyball"" over this. This one just seemed a bit too generic, cliché even when it came to the acting and dialogues and drags at times.<br/><br/>5.8/10"

","Quite simply, a nice little film. Themes of dealing with aging parents, relationships and life priorities played out in the world of high school baseball scouting give this film an appeal beyond just another baseball movie. The script in the end was a bit too predictable for my tastes, and the Sanderson (Eastwood nemesis) and Bo Gentry (the ""next"" Albert Pujols) characters were especially poorly written and acted (IMHO). Timberlake on the other hand, was quite good as the washed out ex Red Sox pitcher/minor league scout. But any film wherein the majority focus is on Baseball, (and features trivia questions concerning the 1975 Red Sox/Cincinnati Reds WS), while projecting Eastwood over about 80% of the run time, is worth a watch. Except for a few minor expletives, a pretty safe film for the whole family."

","In 2008, actor-director Clint Eastwood had stated that GRAN TORINO would be his final acting role. But four years later, he's back in the acting role again. That's not all, this is the first movie Eastwood has starred in which he has not directed himself since Wolfgang Petersen's IN THE LINE OF FIRE (1993). And believe it or not, TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE is first ever baseball movie for Clint Eastwood. As interesting as it may sounds, the movie turns out to be nothing more than a clichéd-ridden, old-fashioned baseball drama that we have seen countless times before.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, a veteran baseball talent scout for the Atlanta Braves who likes to do his job the good old-fashioned way when comes to picking great players rather than relying on computer technology. But his stubbornness to keep up with the 21st century trend is about to cost his longtime job, especially he has to compete with his rival -- a cocky and tech-savvy young scout named Phillip Sanderson (Matthew Lillard) who believes that using computer technology to scout great players is the future of baseball. Not only that, Gus is also suffered from an old age and his eyes are stricken with macular degeneration and glaucoma (a condition where his vision becomes blurry). So Gus' old friend and colleague Pete Klein (John Goodman) quickly convinces Gus' attorney daughter Mickey (Amy Adams) to go help her old man when he has to travel to North Carolina to track the players of minor league team Grizzlies for their first pick in the upcoming draft. At first, Mickey claims she's very occupied with her job since she's on the verge of making partner at her firm if she can win a big case that's been assigned to her. But not long after, she begins to feel responsible for her old man and decides to help Gus after all. Once she's in North Carolina, she meets another young scout named Johnny (Justin Timberlake) where they slowly fall for each other as well as subsequently learning the truth from her old man that why she's being sent away to boarding school when she's a young kid.<br/><br/>First-time director Robert Lorenz, a longtime partner to Clint Eastwood who used to work as an assistant director or producer since THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY in 1995, directs TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE in an economical style similar to Eastwood's directing pattern. If one day Eastwood decides to call it a quit for directing movie, I can say Lorenz can be his next successor. But for now, Lorenz still has a long way to go to become as successful as the Hollywood legend himself. His direction is strictly by-the-numbers, and most of the times the whole movie feels like a made-for-TV movie. Working from a screenplay by Randy Brown (another first-timer), the story is also awfully formulaic from start till the end. And as a baseball drama, fans of the genre might find this a crashing bore because the movie takes too many leisure time establishing the love-hate, father-and-daughter relationship between Gus and Mickey.<br/><br/>But thanks largely to its above-average cast, TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE remains surprisingly watchable. Clint Eastwood is no stranger for playing a curmudgeon role. His performance as a cranky old man with a sharp sense of sarcastic humor may have been too familiar but always entertaining to watch for. Amy Adams is engaging as the tough but vulnerable Mickey. In fact, she steals the limelight out of every actors involved here (and yes, that includes Eastwood as well) with her irresistible, yet remarkable performance. At the same time, she can be sweet-natured enough to share a brief but wonderful chemistry with Justin Timberlake, whose own performance is quite likable.<br/><br/>The upbeat finale is particularly where the movie gets interesting (the one involves Mickey finally picks a great player that can save her old man's job). It may have been too brief, but it's good enough to end the movie with a satisfying payoff."

","TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE (2012) *** Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, John Goodman, Jason Timberlake, Matthew Lillard, Robert Patrick, Chelcie Ross, Raymond Anthony Thomas, Ed Lauter, George Wyner, Bob Gunton, Jack Gilpin, Clifton Guterman. Hit-and-miss baseball melodrama with crusty Clint as a grouchy elderly major league baseball scout whose fading eyesight may hinder his chances of his continuing career, unless his estranged daughter Adams (acquitting herself nicely with some pep and spunk), a career oriented attorney with eyes on a promotion to partner, will accompany him for an important prospect. Directed by longtime Eastwood collaborative Robert Lorenz the film mistakenly adds Timberlake as an ex-player turned scout who slows things down in an unlikely romantic pairing with Adams but isn't the only thing making the movies putter along (some editing here and there could've helped and the screenplay by novice Randy Brown is bush league at best. But it's always a pleasure to see Eastwood have some fun along the way even if his aging grump is getting a tad long in the tooth. At best a standing triple instead of a grand-slam."
