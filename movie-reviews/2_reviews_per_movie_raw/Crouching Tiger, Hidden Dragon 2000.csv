","As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood.<br/><br/>
The casting of CTHD is perfect. No disrespect to Jet Li, but Jet Li would not make Li Mu Bai into what he should be: noble, wise but weary. Chow Yun Fat conveys the unspoken feelings of Li Mu Bai in a way I can't imagine anyone else can. But he's known for his acting, Michelle Yeoh was known for her fighting skills. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. The scenes between them are heartbreaking. Zhang Zi Yi is a true discovery! What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. She ran from looking innocent, haughty, feisty to loving and distraught. She made the complex Jen a real flesh and blood believable human being. Chang Chen made a perfectly sexy and charming bandit.<br/><br/>The scenery and the photography was beyond belief. The majestic landscapes of China match my imagination when I read all the beautiful Chinese poems of the Tang and Sung dynasties. No wonder those poets could come up with those masterpieces. They sure had the best inspiration. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast-as-lightening action wonderfully. The shot of Jen gliding over water just lodged in my mind. The soundtrack is also excellent. Tan Dun used different instruments to match the different locales. He mixed in Central Asian music in the desert sequence and Chinese flute in the Southern China scenes. Yo-yo Ma's cello in the main theme makes me want to weep everytime I hear it.<br/><br/>The storytelling was also done expertly. As a romantic-at-heart, I love the desert romance between Jen and Lo. It's one of the most charming and believable love stories that I can remember. Most people gave credit of the fighting to Yuen Wo Ping. I'd give kudos to Ang Lee. I've seen Yuen's martial art films before, but they're never done in such an imaginative and artistic way. The artistic vision has to come from Ang Lee.<br/><br/>To sum it up, three cheers for Ang Lee! You not only fulfilled your childhood dream, you fulfilled mine too. It's such a pleasure to finally see a wuxia novel be done right. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
"Larry-17","10","191","237","16 January 2001"," Magical Romance...
","There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""<br/><br/>In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.<br/><br/>What a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger..."", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia!"") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.<br/><br/>In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called ""wire work"" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of ""Crouching Tiger..."", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of ""Matrix.""  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...<br/><br/>At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.<br/><br/>Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.<br/><br/>And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.<br/><br/>The center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the ""Luke Skywalker"" of the piece, if you will...though ""Crouching Tiger..."" has everything the ""Star Wars"" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.<br/><br/>By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the ""Full Peckinpaw,"" if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.<br/><br/>There are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!<br/><br/>I won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Just go see it."
"fault","Null","22","24","13 August 2004"," Important, in a way.
","What people who aren't Chinese and who don't know much about Chinese culture fail to understand, is that the warrior mythology portrayed in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero has its roots in a particular genre of fiction that has been around much longer than television or film.<br/><br/>Having grown up reading a bunch of these stories of epic fantasy, I remember being surprised when I went to watch CTHD in the theaters, and saw the audience break out in laughter at the flying stunts. I suppose the concept probably does seem ridiculous to foreigners.<br/><br/>The whole deal with the flying is this:<br/><br/>In the stories, the world of ""Giang Hu"" mentioned in CTHD is the unconventional part of society in which the characters that practice high transcendent martial arts exist. ""Giang Hu"" literally translates to something like ""lakes and rivers"", which kind of is a cultural allusion to the fact that most of these people wander a whole lot participating in great duels of swordsmanship and all kinds of tragic drama.<br/><br/>One of the forms of transcendent martial arts is ""chin guon"", which translates to something like ""the art of lightness"". It's a skill that these warrior folk develop from a young age using various methods that make it so they can move as if they were light as a feather. I think the idea is that they're trained so that they progressively have less and less of a perception of their own weight, and thus they can run up walls and fly across rooftops in style. <br/><br/>There's another type of martial art which involves transmitting ""chi"" (spiritual essence or whatever you want to call it) through your hands or fingertips and into the pressure points of others, either doing them harm, rendering them unable to move, or restoring some of their strength. <br/><br/>If you don't understand that it's another culture's fiction/mythology and can't get over that it defies known physics and medicine etc., well, too bad.<br/><br/>At the same time, look at acupuncture. Millions swear by the benefits of acupuncture. Hell, my father had a stroke that paralyzed half his face and went to four separate doctors. They couldn't do a damn thing. He then went to an acupuncturist and after two sessions the paralysis was gone. Conventional medicine still has no idea how acupuncture could possibly work, yet a lot of doctors will accept it as a viable option. Who the hell knows, maybe once upon a time in China people could fly.<br/><br/>I find Chinese warrior mythology pretty interesting, and the problem is that these novels do not translate well. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried. A lot of what goes on in them has a lot of cultural relevance and wouldn't be readily understood by certain people who have Western sensibilities. Hong Kong and Taiwan have for a couple of decades produced a lot of television shows that portray these stories, but they're mostly pretty cheesy like American soap operas.<br/><br/>Which is why CTHD is semi-important as a film. It's the first film to expose a lot Americans to this facet of Chinese mythology, and I hope it's not the last."
"j30bell","10","213","280","22 December 2004"," Beware of cheap imitations
","Crouching Tiger is Ang Lee's take on the Wu Xia tradition of film making. Wu Xia, for those not familiar with the style, evolved out of popular Chinese fiction. It contains formulaic elements such as honourable warriors, powerful swordswomen, powerful swords, and often magic and mythical beasts. Possibly, it has a parallel with sword and sorcery pulp literature  and even Western romances.<br/><br/>Although he grew up in Taiwan, not Hong Kong or China, Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film. When he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.<br/><br/>Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colours are rich, the light dances and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerising action.<br/><br/>Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.<br/><br/>At the heart of Crouching Tiger is the relationship between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai is looking for a way out of the Gang Ho (Warrior) lifestyle  he joins a monastery, as a route to enlightenment and peace, but cannot cast aside his unrequited love for Shu Lien (another warrior). On the brink of declaring their love for one another, Mu Bai's Green Destiny Sword is stolen, and his arch enemy returns. He must temporarily put aside his feelings to recover the sword and bring his master's killer to justice Seeming to take a fair chunk from his previously directorial role, Sense and Sensibility, Ang Lee weaves a story which tragically juxtaposes the loving and giving but repressed relationship of Mu Bai and Shu Lien, with the fiery, wilful and destructive passions of Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) and Lo (Chang Chen). The result, for me, was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Some critics have suggested that the characterisation is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.<br/><br/>In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth  and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.<br/><br/>Quite simply, Crouching Tiger has everything. It is beautiful, breathtaking and deeply moving. 9½ /10"
"gisele22","9","142","186","15 February 2001"," Extremely Captivating Film
","I just saw this film today.  I was totally captivated... when it was all over, and the credits began to run, it took me a couple of seconds to realize where I was.  I didn't want to get out of my seat.  And once I got out of the theatre, I couldn't even talk about it for an hour or so.  I kept running the details over and over in my head.  It's rare that a film has such an impact on me.  The cinematography was stunning.  The special effects were beautifully done.  The characters' moves were effortless.  The acting was wonderful.  I really think that Michelle Yeoh should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I thought that the effects and storyline complimented each other brilliantly.  There were so many different layers to the plot.  There were many things that couldn't be explained with dialogue that were expressed in the characters' faces.  This film had lighthearted moments, heartwrenching moments, romantic interludes, inspirational sentiments, wonderful plot twists, superb acting, beautifully done fight scenes, never before seen special effects...it had it all.  Some scenes may have been a little over the top, but it's *fantasy*... and yet, after a few brief moments, it somehow became completely believable. That's how much this film draws you in.  This is a one of a kind film; there is just no comparing it to any other.  It transports you to another place and time.   I highly recommend it."
"The Mogul","10","89","116","30 December 2000"," A wondrous mythology, a cinematic masterpiece.
","I gave a wry chuckle when the opening credits pronounced Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a Sony Cinema Classic in the year of its release. However, I too would not have hesitated to brand this film such. It is a cinematic masterpiece that left me in silent reverie at its conclusion.<br/><br/>The film's story unfolds amidst the ancient temples, bamboo forests and painted deserts of nineteenth century China: a sensual, mystical landscape that, at our first high-angle glimpse of Peking takes on a dizzying scale. This world is inhabited by the Wudan, spectral warriors from legend who effortlessly leap between rooftop and bamboo tree, a device which elevates them to a plane divorced from our parochial middle-class values without the loss of their intense humanity. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an ode to the human spirit that transcends genre; it is at once fantasy, romance, historical epic and thriller, enriched by a subtle humour.<br/><br/>At the film's heart are four compelling performances. Ziyi Zhang, is enchanting as the wilful Jen Yu, daughter of a government official, who aspires to the code of the Wudan. Her destiny is entwined with those of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), disciples of this enigmatic clan, and of the desert bandit Lo (Chen Chang) by the theft of an arcane sword, Mu Bai's quest for revenge and the fulfilment of a powerful yet unrequited love<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat possesses an hypnotic screen presence in his portrayal of this regal master, who displays an unparalleled heroism untainted by western cliché as the film travels inexorably toward his shuddering death-blow. This resonates long after the credit sequence has run and you've marvelled at how few stunt artists were engaged to actualize the film's thrillingly beautiful fight sequences. These are not the idle distractions aimed at a boyish mind we find in other martial arts films but rather a transcendent form of dance. Their exquisitely honed choreography rivals that of Graham Murphy and Twyla Tharp.<br/><br/>Star of these sequences is the four hundred year old Green Destiny sword that exerts a powerful metaphoric presence on the film. It is a sensuous artefact that sings when struck, punctuating Yo-Yo Ma's haunting cello solos, a feature of the immersive soundtrack.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film of titanic proportions, with all the pageantry of Kundun, minus the ponderous pace, and without a trace of the cloying sentimentalism which infected Titanic's impoverished narrative. Li Mu Bai's final words are a more fervent declaration of truth than any to have graced the screen before.<br/><br/>After all that, I can offer no further commendation except to say that this is the latest greatest film of my now seemingly hollow existence."
"therickster-2","10","112","179","29 March 2001"," The most beautiful film ever made.
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, quite simply, a stunning film and a real breath of fresh air in a genre that was previously somewhat stagnant. Kung-fu films were on a very steady decline, with only Jet Li making a valid effort to change things around. It comes then as a great relief that Ang Lee decided to do what he did and put an entirely new slant on the genre.<br/><br/>Tacky dubbed dialogue is out of the window and we're back to the films original Chinese language subtitled into English. This adds a lot more to one of the films main themes, culture. While we as the Kung-fu loving public have grown used to storylines generally involving the hero's lost mother/brother/pet goldfish, Crouching Tiger... eschews all of these stereotypes and sets about creating a really authentic atmosphere.<br/><br/>I won't bother rehashing the story because if you haven't seen the film yet I want you to go in with as little knowledge as possible. If you don't know what to expect, I can't recommend Crouching Tiger... more highly. Lee's directorial style is simply a joy to behold, and every minute detail is treated with a respect most directors simply don't have. Now, the part we've all been waiting for. I know what you're thinking, ""It's all very well having a great story but what good is it if they're all going to mince about like fairies?""<br/><br/>Well, I'm pleased to tell you that these guys kick more ass than you've EVER seen before. The fight sequences are stunningly choreographed and the 'flying' looks spectacular. While a big thing has been made of Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi's treetop battle, the one for me is between Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien and Ziyi's Jen. Both instances, both in the courtyard and the dojo are, quite frankly, the most astounding displays of martial arts I have EVER been lucky enough to witness. While Bruce Lee can certainly do the real thing, and he is without doubt the original and best, Wo Ping's sequencing of the fight scenes is truly revolutionary.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies."

","Less than half an hour into the viewing of this masterpiece I knew this would become one of my favorite films - of all time. Only in my wildest dreams (quite literally, this movie has touched me on a personal level) have I visualized such fantastic and precise choreography, so captivating that to take your eyes away during the intense confrontations is to deny yourself the essence of what makes this film so wonderful.<br/><br/>With an artistic license unprecedented, the action scenes are entirely unbelievable but purely the work of a fabulous imagination. The magical settings and the colorful characters fit well into the plot but you will take away the breath-taking martial arts sequences."

","As a film student living in Toronto, I look forward to the Toronto International Film Festival every year.  Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".<br/><br/>Being of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.<br/><br/>Being an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!<br/><br/>Okay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.<br/><br/>All in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film."

It is simple and very different from what I am used to here in the States. Visually it was one of the best movies I have ever scene. From the effects matching the tone of the movie, to the locations and the colors used in those locales. The fight scenes were very cool. I love good fight scenes and I love swords. This movie pulls off both very nicely. Since I have watched this movie, I have watched many other Asian films and I find them refreshing. The movies are more story driven with a heavy emphasis on tones. I might watch this movie this weekend now that I am thinking of it. Really cool movie especially on a rainy night."

","Chinese martial arts films had found a market in the West during the Kung Fu boom initiated by Bruce Lee in the early 1970s But ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrifice <br/><br/>Ang Lee was an astute choice as director The location shooting was on the Chinese mainland and the actors came from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as China Instead of the Shaolin school of martial arts favored by Bruce Lee, Ang Lee opted for the more spiritual form of Wudan; brute force is replace by scenes of balletic grace as opponents climb up walls or flit through tree-tops<br/><br/>The widespread success of the film is a firm indication that Chinese culture is making its mark"
"kirsten tan","10","67","110","9 July 2000"," Truly Exceptional
","The show was fantastic. It is one of the best, if not the best Chinese swashbuckling show. With that simple and to the point assertion let me continue with my review.<br/><br/>The kungfu choreography was marvelous and beautiful. With Yuen Wo Ping as the martial arts director, things can hardly get better. I dare say that the kungfu movement in this show was definitely more varied and graceful than his other works, for example, the Matrix which obtained such raving reviews. Even when compared to his other Mandarin titles, like Last Hero in China, this show stands out. In other movies, you get the feeling they're merely fighting it out, but for this one, there is a genuine fluidity. The aesthetic and artistic direction is definitely top-notch. Although there were times things were a little overdone, that will not compromise the overall quality of the show.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent as well. Chow Yun Fatt and Michelle Yeoh were fine as the constipated middle-aged `we're a little old but we still love each other' couple. The scene at the end was absolutely heart breaking; so subtle and yet absolute racking. As for Zhang Ziyi, she was perfect as the slightly brat-ish aristocratic daughter of a governor, who's yet to find what she really wants in life. From blithe to confusion to angst to despondence and then despair, there is a character journey which she succeeds in portraying. And all this while, yes, she somehow manages to stay likeable. Its pretty amazing if you consider she's still in acting school.<br/><br/>This must be one of the better adaptation of Chinese `Giang Hu' Novels. Usually, they're so badly adapted they result in one hodgepodge mess of a conglomerated movie. This one has an exceptional script which is easy to follow and not merely as inane as having only good versus evil. Here, our protagonists have their own personal battles to overcome and their own personal devils to defeat. And if any of these sound boring, it isn't! It's one of the fastest 2.5 hr movie I've watched. The ending is also one of the classiest and most beautiful I've seen.<br/><br/>This show is cinematic poetry. The music score compliments the Kungfu sequences well; the lyrical dialogues emerge charmingly.  Everything fits in so darn perfectly. You have to concede to the fact that Ang Lee is undoubtedly a visionary and amazing director.<br/><br/>Even if you don't give a damn about any of the above, this show is a visual treat. Go watch the show for the scenery, the martial arts, the actors. The bottom line is to go and watch it because you will rarely find a better one. 9/10.<br/><br/>Yes yes, i'm a groupie and if u watch it, i think u'll become one. :DD"
"slokes","10","40","65","9 January 2006"," 2000: Year Of The Cat Fight
","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of two Ang Lee movies I've seen. One, ""The Ice Storm,"" takes place a couple of towns up the parkway from where I live. This one is set half a world away, yet watching it makes China feel closer than New Canaan. I have a feeling a lot of people get a similar sensation.<br/><br/>Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is tired of kicking butt; he only wants peace, and perhaps a new start in life with the woman he loves but keeps a wary, correct distance from, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Matters are complicated with the theft of a great sword, the Green Destiny. Lien's investigation quickly centers on a bored rich girl named Jen (Zihi Zhang), who hides her skills under embroidered gowns but is ultimately as much about rebellion as Lien is about conformity. When the two women square off, sparks will fly, literally. Yet Jen has goodness in her. Can Bai and Lien save her from becoming ""a poison dragon"" in the service of her murderous master, the Jade Fox?<br/><br/>I never really got into martial-arts movies, probably because of the culture gap but also because until recently they didn't get much respect from critics, at least here in the West. That was already beginning to change by 2000, but ""Crouching Tiger"" was the clear tipping point, Oscar-nominated for Best Picture and praised to the skies for its beautiful cinematography and gravity-defying fight scenes.<br/><br/>Those fight scenes are amazing, each in a different way. One resembles a dazzling lyrical ballet on a lush bamboo forest; another is a grand goofy bar fight which is played for laughs. The best fight is between Jen and Lien, a cinematic centerpiece every bit as great as Rick and Ilsa's last scene on the tarmac in ""Casablanca."" No doubt it got PC points among Western critics for featuring two women in battle, it also is a nice way of bringing out the central tension in the film's deceptively simple narrative, which is that between cultural obligation as embodied by Lien, and individual happiness as sought by Jen.<br/><br/>Earlier in the film, Jen lays her cards out on the table for Lien, with whom she hopes to be friends: ""I'm getting married, but I'm not happy about it,"" Jen says. Lien's wooden reply: ""I've heard. Congratulations."" Much later on, after Jen has run out on her wedding and stolen the Green Destiny, Bai talks about taking Jen as his student, to save her from being corrupted by evil. ""What if her husband objects?"" asks Lien. Bai gives her a look which says it all: What planet did you beam down from? She's Patty Hearst now, and about to become Darth Vader. Her husband's wishes are the least of our concerns.<br/><br/>Not to Lien. While oddly liberated by her single status (which in turn is due to her self-restrictive attitude about being in mourning for a long-dead fiancé), Lien is the cultural touchstone, or rather millstone, of this drama. She and Bai are clearly meant for each other, but she resists. Oddly, while this puts her at loggerheads with audience expectations, Lien is also the movie's most empathetic character, more so than the remote Bai or spoiled Jen. As played by Yeoh, Lien offers us a passionate center who both embodies the code she and Bai live by, and betrays that code's limitations.<br/><br/>Getting all that on screen is a great triumph for Yeoh, and one I needed to watch the film more than once to pick up on. She's so remarkable in her fight scenes and running up and down walls (yes, I know wires were involved, but even so the athletic skill necessary to sell such action is impossible to imagine) people miss the consummate acting of her performance, the aware inertness of her eyes, the expression of sad longing that she allows to poke through her bland facade. Chow is great, too, and Zhang beyond that in a star-making performance of beauty and rage, yet I wouldn't feel the warmth I do for this film without Yeoh inhabiting so much of it, not just body but soul.<br/><br/>The DVD which I found for under $10 has not only both the dubbed and subtitled versions of the films (which are radically different, and both worth viewing as they bring out different aspects of this deep film) but a funny commentary track by director Lee and co-writer James Schamus, which is remarkable in and of itself for its tone. You'd think they were Joel and Crow having at a Roger Corman flick on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for all the potshots they take at their masterpiece.

","Fans burnt by George Lucas' ""Phantom Menace"" found solace in Ang Lee's cosily straightforward ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". The film was greeted with a shrug in China (it was a flop), a country desensitised to wuxia tales, but Westerners loved it. Probably because ""Tiger"" is basically ""Star Wars"", with its own assortment of bounty-hunters, Jedis, Sith Lords, princesses, rogues, warriors, villains, henchmen, Yodas, fairy tale romances, teachers, masters, apprentices, chosen ones and much vague talk of destiny, fate and ""light"" and ""dark"" sides. When he's not indulging in super choreographed action sequences, Lee's aesthetic is also very Lucasy, which is to say, very John Ford, very David Lean, very Kurosawa, with clean lines, big open spaces, and simple but careful shot selection. What's strange is the film's budget. The film looks like it has the budget of one of those big, state backed Chinese or Stalinist productions, but ""Crouching"" was made for about fifteen million dollars. Lee gets a lot of mileage out of his budget.<br/><br/>Martial arts fans abhor ""Tiger"". It's too geared to western tastes, too watered down, and China's been churning out similar wuxia for decades. Why should this one get all the credit? But Lee does put his own spin on the material. His film is more sensual, poetic, graceful, romantic, has a mysterious beauty, and is more delicate than is typical of the genre. His female characters are also given a bigger role than is customary and his action at times seems more like expressive dance.<br/><br/>Repression, restrictions, strict moral codes and self-control are an obsession with Lee. With ""Hulk"" we had a scientist who struggles to curb his anger, his ""Taking Woodstock"", ""Wedding Banquet"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" revolved around characters repressing their homosexuality, while ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Lust Caution"", ""Ice Storm"" and ""Woodstock"" again all hinged on either repression, free expression or the inhibiting of desire. In ""Crouching's"" case – the title itself refers to ""one who has hidden, suppressed talents"" - we have a stifled three-way love between characters called Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Jen Yu, all of whom are prohibited from desire by strict moral/social codes, feudal customs and warrior traditions.<br/><br/>The rejection of these codes is perhaps why the film was shunned by China (and is so popular with western women). Chinese mythology, Taoist philosophy and the hokey ""mysticism"" of Asian martian arts films (akin to ""Star Wars'"" ""The Force""), all stress an esoteric mode of detachment, a form of denial characteristic of Eastern thought in which the world is seen to be illusory and detached cogitation is seen to be the path to enlightenment. Lee, in contrast, is trading in a more genteel, Western sensibility; a kind of romantic humanism where one is called to ditch Eastern stoicism and embrace the ""reality"" and ""meaning"" of human attachments in this life. This tug-of-war is epitomised by a trio of conversations located in each of the film's three acts. In the first, characters called Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who we learn have long had feelings for each another but have denied these feelings to pursue the demands of a Wudan warrior lifestyle, discuss the fact that Mu Bai, when meditating, reaches not ""the bliss of enlightenment"" but ""a place of endless sorrow"". For Mu Bai, passions cannot be extinguished and only serve to increase the pull of desire. Mu Bai's conflict – the way clinging to personal affection is contrary to his Wudan ways of detachment – can be found even in Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels, only there Lucas has some monastic ninja kid literally moan about the way his calling prevents him from losing his virginity (""Me want make sexy time but Yoda say no! Wah Wah Wah!"").<br/><br/>The second conversation occurs at the film's midpoint, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien finally touch. ""Shu Lien,"" he recoils, ""the things we touch have no permanence. My master would say there is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real."" Shu Lien then brushes aside his Taoism with direct, naive realism: ""Not everything is an illusion. My hand is real."" <br/><br/>It's in the third conversation that the film breaks away from your typical martial arts movie mysticism and repudiates Wudan philosophy. Here, Mu Bai is dying and Shu Lien urges him to meditate: ""Free yourself of this world. Let your soul rise to eternity. Do not waste your breath on me."" ""I have already wasted my life,"" Mu Bai responds. ""I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side, as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you."" Contrast this with the countless marital arts movies, or even the ""Star Wars"" franchise, which end with the ghostly spirits of dead warriors, monks and masters hovering contently over the living. Mu Bai is given no supernatural reprieve, no higher plane of existence. He just dies. The film then ends with the recounting of a mountain legend in which a young woman must paradoxically ""float away and never return"" if she wishes to ""return"". The whole film hinges on a similar paradox: acting on a desire one desires not to have. It's the paradox of Buddhism: continually desiring to eliminate desire, whereby satiating desire is impossible and it is ultimately desire which blocks the road to desirelessness. This is contrasted with a more Western hedonism, where the hedonist attempts the cessation of desire by ""giving in"" to them all.<br/><br/>Beyond all this, the film resembles the works of King Hu, Ozu and Ichikawa, the latter two only insofar as it contrasts straitjacketed older generations, and their societal obligations, with oppositional, younger generations. The film's ending suggests that a character called Jen sacrifices her life/love so that Mu Bai and Shu Lien may finally be together.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Worth two viewings."
"tedg","Null","13","19","17 January 2001"," An Ambitious Attempt, Not Consummated
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is one of two best mainstream directors working today who has deliberately worked in different styles, genres, artistic philosophies even. (The other is Ridley Scott.) Here he tries to inject art and majesty in a common vehicle. To remain true to the vehicle, he must use a thin story (though with numerous threads) and an understated acting style. I think this understated focus on faces helps make the subtitles more palatable than they would be otherwise. They are also larger and higher than normal, so one's eye doesn't have to jump so much from face to word. There's no question that this film was conceived with the western reading eye in mind.<br/><br/>Lee pumps up the skeleton well enough with grand vistas and wonderful sets. The vision is surreal, which befits the mythical drama. In this and several other ways, he greatly surpasses the `Star Wars' feel. I must say that the final cave/warehouse was too theatrical -- it just didn't fit the rest. Some of the mattes are annoyingly fakey. The bambootop fight was ungraceful. But those are relative nits.<br/><br/>What I wanted in this film was a whole new level in choreographing the CAMERA during fight scenes. I know this is a hot topic among directors just now, and think he is quite up to the challenge. He has already shown mastery of the inside, emotional camera, and the notion of bringing this to dance excited me. He teases with some spectacular camera movement, but it is always in a conventional frame. Guess he wanted to sell a lot of tickets instead of reinvent the medium.<br/><br/>What I mean: with the fights, you have several characters, the two (or howevermany) fighters, the swords, the viewer and the camera. In a good film, some of these will merge. In a masterful production that merger will shift so that the camera is the sword, the viewer, then the fighter. (Here, the green sword IS a central fighter.) But add to that the complication of the idiom: each fighter and weapon is actually just a token for the master. Each fight is a battle between invisible characters, whose perspective the camera can also take.<br/><br/>Lee plays these fights too safe, and it really annoys because he shows us ever so fleetingly what he can do. Sometimes, the camera is the sword, sometimes the master, but in teasing glimpses only. He's concerned with making sense, and that requires sticking to convention. Maybe as he gets older, he'll do this again, but with more multidimensional vision, more enlightenment, less concern for the general viewer.<br/><br/>But check out the fight scores. This drummer knows the dimensions we're talking about, because he follows Lee's camera when it leaves the body. Cool.<br/><br/>This film also has the sexiest literary scene I've ever experienced. (And that counts the lush ""Pillow Book."") It will be worth owning for that 15 seconds alone. Watch Jen's calligraphy, obviously done by a master. You won't ever forget it now that I've pointed it out. Watch the subtle camera movement. The whole of `Quills' in a few seconds! That reading eye again."

This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent. The fight scene's are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer.

","If you like martial arts flicks, you just have to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's so incredibly good, it made me fall in love with Asian cinema.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's Oscar-winning magnum opus succeeds where most similar movies failed: to keep the personal, intimate story and the awesome, huge action on the same level, never letting one prevail on the other. The beautifully choreographed duels are exactly as important as the dialogue-heavy intermissions (or maybe the fights are intermissions). Think Lawrence of Arabia, only with small fights in the forest instead of massive combats in the desert.<br/><br/>The locations where the characters fight are a crucial part of the film's greatness: never has a duel looked so beautiful as when two people follow each other jumping from tree to tree, their movements so gracious and the combat itself so elegant and bloodless. It's like The Matrix in terms of visual delight, but more poetic.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect as well: Chow Yun-Fat is excellent in the unusual role of the retired warrior who is reluctantly forced back into action, Michelle Yeoh is of good support as his would-be love interest, and it's no wonder Ziyi Zhang has become one of the most wanted actresses in the world. She's astounding, playing such a layered character so well at such a young age.<br/><br/>Beautiful and tragic, it's something you just have to see. As soon as you possibly can."

","After watching this movie I felt both puzzled and disappointed. As a matter of fact,being a couch potato I usually admire martial arts films when they are life-like and plausible (e.g. Jackie Chan films, Bruce Lee films and Jet Li). The stunts of that film were very much artificial: characters seem to be dancing, not fighting, and it's very disconcerting to see people perform tricks obviously suspended from thin lines. I believe such awkward glorification of the characters' mastership only does them wrong, as it looks funny and destroys the intended effect. If the whole story is meant to be a fairy tale, then let it have more attributes of such, then flying and water-skimming won't seem so ridiculous. The female parts were much better than that of Chow Yun Fat, at least they were capable of some emotion and he was ""too far gone on the way to perfection"". The only thing I liked is the jump of Jen in the last moment of the film and the legend about making wishes come true."

Their adventures lack any discernable logic and their personalities are so frigid it is hard to feel any compassion or antipathy for them as they each examine the crossroads at at which they find themselves.<br/><br/>The critics are calling it sublime, exquisite and subtle - I fear I must disagree. It couldn't seem to decide if it was a love story/tragedy, an action/martial arts adventure, or a wispy parable (about the getting of wisdom versus the getting of knowledge). I felt like I was watching ""Monkey Magic"" on Prozac, or ""GI Jane"" on magic mushrooms - without a compelling soundtrack, plot or acting, the majority of the movie takes tself far too seriously, presumably to impress the arthouse crowd, with the only enjoyable snippet of the movie, for me, when it briefly lightens up in a bar full of beefy warriors. 1 (awful) out of 10 for me....."

","Nothing I can say about this film will do it justice. Forget that it's in Mandarin, you will anyway after a few minutes of watching. Much has been made of the fact that the lead actors were not native speakers of Mandarin, but the fact that they learned their dialog and were able to emote within the tightly confining inflective structure of the language speaks to the amount of skill, effort, and dedication that went into making this masterpiece. And yes, the main characters can fly, so it isn't exactly cinema verite', but we accept far more from movies that do far less to convince us to do so. What CTHD is is a stunning, epic telling of a beautiful Chinese fable that rivals any in Western culture.<br/><br/>Try to remember the first time you heard about King Arthur and Camelot; it's chivalry and gallantry, the characters larger than life. Recall the epic and tragic story arcs of heroes whose literary personas evolved from the greatest traditions of Western culture. CTHD has all of that and more. For Camelot fans, there's even a magical sword. When it is stolen by a mystical warrior of dazzling skill, the quest for its return leads us through a story that contrasts the formal beauty of feudal China with its danger and brutality.<br/><br/>The majesty of this film comes from Taiwanese director Ang Lee's masterfully controlled and yet lavish treatment. Lee is decidedly Taiwanese in his approach, which, for those who have missed the last half century or so of history, means that it will weave Eastern and Western sensibilities into a truly global worldview. It is a tragedy that Lee went on to direct the dismally disappointing Hulk, an overblown effects-laden stinker. It is best we forget that and remember him for this quintessential and epic creation. The ethereal fight scenes have been compared to The Matrix, but that is a huge disservice to CTHD. Even Matrix, with is wheezing spiral into itself pales by comparison against the rapturous beauty of Lee's masterpiece. <br/><br/>The ending takes a bit of thought to embrace, and a knowledge of the Asian theme of heroism through sacrifice is essential to understanding it. If you know anything about China in the twentieth century, you will know that all individual glory must end in sacrifice to larger goals. The final scene, delicate as a flower yet as powerful as any warrior, uses this ethic to beautifully meld the seemingly disparate story lines into a glorious and tragic, in the literary sense, climax that will leave those willing to invest the thought to grasp it utterly breathless. No writer in western history has built a more satisfying legend of heroism, nobility and spiritualism. CTHD launched a series of cheap imitations, including the sadly inferior Hero and House of Flying Daggers, which are both excellent films in their own right, but practically a television movie of the week remake when judged against the rhapsodic beauty and majesty of CTHD."

","First, I don't think it matters that there are subtitles and the language is Chinese. The story is strong and moves along smoothly. The fighting scenes are worth watching alone. The actors are choreographed to dance and fight with you just wanting to see who defeats. The story is also told with great costumes, art direction, and scenery. The stars of this film are Asian actors and actresses who don't get enough work in this business. While the subtitles might throw you off, it's not hard to understand what's going on by studying their actions, movements, and facial expressions. If Ang Lee had the actors talk in English throughout the film, I don't think it would have lost much value to me since I'm not Asian or Chinese or the audience. I believe that this is one of the best foreign language films of the last decade and it was awarded an Oscar for Foreign Language Film. Although I don't think Ang Lee cared about awards in making this film, this film has female characters who are both strong and equal to the male characters in the film. The females sometimes steal the scenes from the men. It's nice to see women portrayed as strong, equals than emotional inferior characters. They are equally adept at the fighting scenes and they give their all to those scenes. When you think of Ang Lee's other films, nothing could really master the beauty and uniqueness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

","With the amount over-zealous hype surrounding this film, one would expect something of grand design. Sadly, that's all it is, over-zealous hype. Possibly the most over-hyped film since Star Wars: Phantom Menace. As I sat in the theatre watching this I couldn't help but laugh heartily at the defying gravity antics that only made me want to start singing, ""Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can."" Yes, it is that bad. Two women sitting in front of me kept shooting dirty looks my way, but really how could anyone take this absurd movie seriously? In fact, Jade Fox (the film's remorseless ""bad guy"")merely alters the hairdo and for some strange reason no one recognizes him. I suppose everyone is blind, and dumb. And that's what this movie is, dumb.<br/><br/>First, the acting is on par with every other absurd ""action,"" gravity defying kung-fu film. Nothing special, period. The script is littered with the most inane dialogue, again like most films of this type. Really, had it been dubbed the pathetic reality of that would be more noticed. The story is, again, on par with every other film in this genre... tinged with a little spaghetti western thrown in for good measure. So, in reality there is nothing special about this film. Nothing!<br/><br/>Ok, so perhaps some people will find the gravity-defying antics some sort of brainless entertainment for two hours. I didn't. The action scenes are well choreographed, but when they begin to toss their hands in the air and take off like Superman, crawl around on bamboo tree tops like somekind of monkey, crawl up walls and skip across roofs you just can NOT take it seriously. It's just comical to the extreme. And really, it is so very obvious that these people are on wires, you can practically see them (and in a few scenes, if you pay close attention, you can).<br/><br/>This film is too absurd to be any good, too serious to be campy or fun and just doesn't work at all. With the boxoffice booming on this, I can only imagine a select few people are seeing it over and over and over, and in the process tricking their friends into seeing it too.

The desert scene could be cut in half - they chase, they stop, they chase some more.  Why?  That's a question you'll be asking yourself throughout this film.  But don't expect answers.  Characters move from pointless scene to pointless scene for the sake of having combat, and that isn't even very special.

I don't care how common this is in Chinese films, its absurd, and the film deserves to be slammed for it.  And this is no slap against China per se - We Americans have our share of absurdities and if we put them in our films we deserve to be slammed for them too.<br/><br/>You'll laugh throughout this film when the filmmaker wanted you to cry.

Even the screenplay, a rare treasure considering the film is thought of as a Kung-Fu film, adds to the poetic feel of the movie. But finally, the true secret to this masterpiece is the tranquility created by the visual/audio combination. With one of the best scores ever, that sets a very relaxing mood, it complements the visuals of the film beautifully. Between the stunning on location scenes and the authentic sets, the art direction is flawless. And the key to the stunning visuals is truly the cinematography. As the music builds, you feel the perfection of the shot is building, and even the overall film. Even without the great plot, strong acting, and poetic screenplay, surely the score complements the cinematography in a way that is artistically unmatched. This film is sublime.

","According to the hype around Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, its creators have produced a miracle: a martial arts crossover hit, simultaneously a substantial foreign language drama for discerning art house audiences and the greatest martial arts movie of all time. Although Crouching Tiger falls short of such (probably unattainable) perfection, it is enormously fun, and manages to be one of the more interesting films of recent years. Though nominally set in the Qing dynasty, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is loosely based in a Chinese martial arts movie tradition that pits outlaws against heroes in a timeless ""long ago"" analogous to the American cinematic Old West. As the film opens, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), the greatest swordsman in China and famed disciple of the Wudan martial arts system, has realized that the years spent fighting outlaws and striving for enlightenment have left him lonely and unhappy. He is on the verge of renouncing his life as a warrior to try to find happiness with his beloved friend and former comrade-in-arms Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). As the film opens, he commits to the custody of longtime friend Sir Te his legendary sword, the beautiful, invincible Green Destiny, and is on the point of proposing to Shu Lien, who clearly shares his feelings, that they make a life together. His plans are interrupted by the reappearance of old foe Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who betrayed and murdered Mu Bai's master and stole the secret manual of Wudan's techniques. Resurfacing in Beijing, Jade Fox has become the governess of Yu Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), the daughter of a prominent government official. Slated for a loveless political marriage, Jen longs for any escape-into the remote deserts of her former home province; into an imagined world based on adventure tales, drawn from the real lives of warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien; into the arms of her secret love, a dashing barbarian bandit named Lo (Chang Chen). Her secret restlessness makes her vulnerable to manipulation by Jade Fox, but what makes her dangerous is her other secret: she is a martial arts prodigy of enormous potential. Half-trained by Jade Fox using the stolen Wudan manual, Jen has much of the technique but none of the Taoist philosophy; but even in this state she is a match for our heroes. Fascinated by the Giang Hu world (and her taste of it in her interlude with Lo), inspired by meeting Shu Lien, tempted by the now-idle Green Destiny, and poisoned by the influence of Jade Fox, Jen is a loose cannon, a menace to all those around her. Li Mu Bai, the embodiment of the Wuxia ideal, naturally wants revenge upon Jade Fox for her crimes against his master and his school; more than this, though, he wishes to take Jen as disciple to be Wudan's first female student - largely because without Wudan discipline she will surely become a villain far worse than her mistress. Shu Lien also comes to feel a sisterly affection for the young prodigy. Setting aside their personal needs, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien take on Jade Fox in a struggle over the girl's fate, as the chaos swirling around her threatens to ensnare them all. True to its title, which names the animal pair most commonly representative of the contradictory and complementary principles of yin and yang in Taoist and Buddhist symbolism, the movie concentrates on the interaction of opposing forces. The consequences of impetuously pursuing one's desires contrast with the loss and regret that are the reverse of restraint and duty. The naive certainty of youth is weighed against the ambiguities of maturity. Jen's coming of age is juxtaposed against the mid-life conflict within Li Mu Bai. All of the main characters much decide when to fight to control their lives and when to acquiesce before forces that cannot be altered. Speaking of performances, I bow down to Michelle Yeoh. She simply shines as Shu Lien -- a humble warrior with strength, compassion, intuition and hundreds of other notable attributes. I cried for her during the end of this film. Not because she has the most beautiful finishing move or roundhouse kick, but because she is a damn fine actress and she made my heart ache for her. As she did in to James Bond in Tomorrow Never Dies and even Jackie Chan in Supercop, she almost steals the show again here. As Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Chow and Yeoh smolder with their characters' repressed passions. The actors incorporate the spirit of swordplay in their performances and alternate between slow, taut exchanges and lightning flashes of intense emotion. They likewise maintain character through their fighting sequences, in which Yeoh's Shu Lien moves with confident virtuosity, and Chow's Li Mu Bai, the accomplished master, needs to use only the sparest, most efficient techniques. These mega star veterans of Hong Kong and Hollywood fearlessly play up their maturity, imbuing their performances with an exquisite sense of loss; the curious result is that they have never seemed sexier. Zhang Zi Yi is ravishingly pretty as the confused and tormented Jen, and her background in dance helps her execute dazzling fight scenes and wire work. Comparisons to established Chinese actress Gong Li may well be justified, however; Zhang's performance, failing at times to arouse sympathy, makes her seem more cold and spoiled than anything else. Martial arts fans will be thrilled to see women's action pioneer Cheng Pei Pei's return to the screen as Jade Fox in her first role as a villain. Chang Chen, whom American audiences may remember from Wong Kar-Wai's wistful Happy Together, makes a dashing and likable barbarian Lo. Fans of Ang Lee's Taiwanese family-focused dramas will appreciate Lung Sihung's short but memorable appearance as Sir Te, patron and friend to Shu Lien and Mu Bai."

I think the greatest impression I have from these two films is a strong and warm feeling of humanity and frailty seen through an epic dimension similar to that of Akiro Kurosawa's last films, with no signs of coyness and no cloying sentimentality - Ang Lee has a straightforward approach to human suffering that can appeal to anyone, anywhere, as well as a sense of humour that gives the audience just the right degree of distance without any feeling of estrangement.<br/><br/>Having been a Kurosawa devotee for most of my adult life (I'm in my sixties) I was greatly relieved when, after seeing Crouching Tiger..., I could lean back and know that the Japanese master of the cinema at last had a true and worthy successor. Brokeback Mountain confirmed this impression fully.<br/><br/>And I'm sure that together with many other cinema-goers I can look forward to his next venture, convinced that whatever subject matter, setting and era he might choose, we can expect something truly original and spectacular (in the true sense of that word) and at the same time an intimate and personal experience..."

","The film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" follows an interesting plot line set in ancient China of honour, love, and heroism.<br/><br/>I find it to be one of the visually most stunning films from the 2000s, with smooth direction, costume design, choreography, and especially the director of photography does a stunning job og conveying the beauty of China through stunning and complex cinematography.<br/><br/>I will recommend this in terms of story as well. Also it has some more subtle choices of conveying emotion that I was really fond of. The film provides an in-depth view into the China of the past.

"xiaolianmantou","Null","2","2","18 December 2018"," Film Review: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
","Martial arts films are often enjoyable but they are seldom great art. Now, to everyone's surprise, Ang Lee, director of a number of excellent films, has made a martial arts film called Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The result is a masterpiece.
The film belongs to a type of Chinese story called wuxia. These stories tell of nineteenth-century martial arts masters with unusual abilities. Wuxia films are popular in China, and they are now popular in the west too.
The story takes place in the early 1800s in China. A man and a woman, Li Mubai (played by Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Xiulian (played by Michelle Yeoh), both masters of the martial arts, are in love with each other. But Xiulian had a fiancé who has died. Because this fiancé was a good friend of Mubai, Mubai feels that he cannot marry Xiulian. When someone steals Xiulian's sword, Mubai and Xiulian try to get it back. The action takes place on Peking rooftops, and in places as far away as the deserts of western China. As in the old wuxia stories, characters leap through the air every now and then, with beautiful, graceful movements, while audiences shout in surprise.
Unusually, it is the female characters that interest us most. Brave, good and strong, Xiulian is the character we care about most. Beautiful Zhang Ziyi plays the part of Yu Jiaolong, a young woman who is not as good as she seems. The fight scenes between Jiaolong and Xiulian are some of the most exciting moments in modern cinema. But one cannot forget the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat, who is as good with a sword as he is with a gun. His romantic scenes with Yu Xiulian are very moving, as their eyes show all the love that they must not express in words.
Films like this rarely reach the cinema. Go and see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It will make your heart leap with excitement at its beauty."

","I went to see this 5 times, I was living in Toms River NJ at the time and the closest theater was at the other end of the state in Princeton, 50 miles away. So I went back once a week to see it 4 more times, that is how much I loved it.<br/><br/>
This film has so many meanings on so many levels only the most astute viewer would be able to capture them all on one viewing. <br/><br/>Two things stand out for me here:<br/><br/>The camera dances. I saw this film before I saw ""Ride With the Devil"" and the camera dances there, as well. Lee makes his camera an extra, unseen character, who can go where we can't. Compare this camera to the boring, stationary camera George Lucas liked to use over and over in his prequel trilogies. Now imagine a Star Wars lightsaber fight in the hands of Ang Lee.<br/><br/>The other thing is how Lee will let the scenes breathe with nature in the background. A couple of instances come to mind but consider the first main fight scene. Right before the battle starts, Lee cuts to a shot of a tree with the moon behind, and hundreds of bats take flight. That's the eye of a master film maker at work."

Whats wrong with having physics defying fight scenes? We can have fantasies with huge monsters and trolls and magic spells and wizards, and films with huge aliens attacking the earth, ones with genetically altered spiders biting teenage boys, and films with ancient egyptian mummies waking up and sucking the life out of people. Why can we have those entertaining yet unrealistic flicks which i'm sure a lot of people loved, but those same people hated this movie because of the flying. Why cant you get your head around it!<br/><br/>For those enlightened few who can, well done. I'm sure you enjoyed this masterpiece of cinema as much as I did. OK, so the script wasn't as fine tuned as it should have been, and the story did lag a bit in a few places, but the actors gave it their all, and its stunningly shot. I've never seen china look like this. OK, maybe its because its a fantasy (hear that Philistines? Its a FANTASY? That means its not outside the rules for them to fly! In fact I think for a fantasy its incredibly restrained and down to earth. You dont see no magical creatures or spells or wizards and witches in this flick!), but it still looks absolutely beautiful. And the score? Highly deserving or its Oscar. Some people couldn't really appreciate Tan Duns subtle mix of chello and haunting tunes, and very true, its not for everyone. But I felt it was amazing how one instrument could convey every extreme emotion portrayed in the script, from happiness and remembrance to love and loss, it was a musical revelation, and it suited the film perfectly.<br/><br/>And Lee's direction was spot on, and partnered with yen Wo Ping, the otherwordly fights were simply spectacular. While i've seen better fights, i've never seen them performed with such Daring abd Bravado before.

"LeJoe","Null","14","27","12 January 2001"," Flying People, Disappointing Film
","I was very impressed with Ang Lee's 1997 film, The Ice Storm, but I'd been avoiding Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon since I first saw previews for it weeks before it opened. Then, because of unexpected circumstances and a slightly aroused curiosity, I recently found myself in line for a ticket with a couple of friends. As I predicted, in spite of some accolades from various critics and others, the film just didn't work for me. One of the things that bugs me about this movie is the fact that it utilizes very natural, realistic settings, characters and events with two glaring exceptions: people flying through the air and a lack of displayed passion between two of the main characters. As far as the flying thing is concerned, the film just isn't whimsical or fantastic enough to have characters breaking into Peter Pan gymnastics at the drop of a hat. Here is a very real and beautiful environment with people leading essentially believable lives punctuated with kung fu histrionics; yet every once in a while they fly around. Granted, the flying sequences are stupendously handled and somewhat fascinating, but they're just a bit too over-the-top for the overall tone of the material. Another important aspect of the film that deflates its potential impact is the alleged passion between two of the main characters. Action man Yun-Fat Chow plays Li Mu Bai, a warrior ready to retire his prized sword. His love interest is an equally agile Yu Shu Lien, played by Michelle Yeoh. Supposedly they love each other and always have. You know the drill...one of those long-standing, unrealized love affairs that seethes under the surface for decades. Yet their mutual chemistry and passion is not obvious enough to be engaging or captivating to the viewer. It's not until the very end that we finally get a strong sense of their mutual love. Perhaps it's better late than never, but in this case, one isn't quite sure. As much as anything, their late burst of passion almost underscores how much more they could have displayed in previous scenes. Complicating matters, it appears this tendency is caused by a combination of factors: the material, the actors' abilities, the direction and possibly even differences in perception from a cultural (East/West) standpoint. Another debilitating element of the film stems from a somewhat convoluted plot. Li Mu Bai's decision to retire his sword is an important step in his character's development. Especially important is the location of his sword's resting place, or in other words, who has  possession or control of it. The problem with this premise is that the sword floats around quite a bit. One minute it's in one person's hands and the next minute it seems to belong to someone else. An important character in the film is Jen Yu, played by the small but mighty Ziyi Zhang. As a troublesome young aristocrat engaged to be married, her motivations are foggy or confusing at times. She seems to flip-flop from demure and sweet to deadly and nefarious, then back again. Even the man she eventually seems to fall in love with is subjected to her schizophrenic mood changes. As with most contemporary films, the cinematography is stunning, enhanced even more by the beautiful backdrop of China. In fact, someone said China is the real star of this film, and I'm tempted to agree. To be honest, I wanted to like Crouching Tiger a lot more than I did, and I admit I'm unfamiliar with Chinese mythology and literary works.<br/><br/>It could be that in its translation and because of cultural differences, it's the kind of film with a potentially uneven appeal and impact-level."
"orion560","1","28","62","28 January 2001"," The best movie of the year? No! The most overrated movie of the year...Yes!!
","This movie is extremely overrated.  I can't understand how it could possibly have climbed so high in the IMDB movie ranks.  The highly regarded action sequences were usually met with laughter and giggles by the audience thanks to the exaggerated and overdone flying and superhuman jumping.  The story was OK...it certainly wasn't worthy of the praise bestowed upon it by the critics.  The story lacked dynamics...it seemed pretty convenient that the fight scenes came along to salvage a dip in the storyline.  The characters evolved very little through the movie.  The emotional scenes didn't grab me..or the audience since it was evident that most people were laughing at the ridiculous nature of the fighting. I can't say anything more specific without giving away things.  Basically, this is how I feel about CTHD:  Action scenes B-, Story C-, Acting B, Music B+...Overall entertainment value B-/C+. I think I'd rather see a Jackie Chan movie than CTHD again.  Now that's where you turn for great martial arts action...it's REAL!  CTHD really didn't live up to the hype.  It certainly does NOT deserve to be in the Top #250 of IMDB's movie rankings, which should be filled with the likes of su ch movies as Godfather, It's a Wonderful Life, Citizen Kane, Braveheart, Gandhi, Schindler's List, etc...etc...How in the world did CTHD get up there??

The story started developing and I said to myself, ""this is going to be good."" By the end of the movie, I was saying, ""what a stupid movie!"" That is, I was saying this in between my laughing spurts.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of 'THE PATRIOT' because it tried to make you feel bad. It tried to seem like such a tragedy when there was no tragedy at all. The Patriot was a much better movie, though. However, I'm still laughing at the last line of Gibson when he kills the British commander Tavington. Tavington said, ""It appears your not the better man!"" Gibson, ""No, my sons were."" Ha Ha Ha, I still laugh at that one. This movie CROUCHING TIGER, SQUATTING DOG has worse dialog if you can believe it.<br/><br/>For a little while, the special effects were cool, but quickly got old and unbelievable. When the two females were fighting in the beginning, they were jumping/flying from roof top to roof top. This was great! Couldn't have been better.  But, in the middle of the film, Chow Yun-Fat and Jen were fighting and they were hovering. Give me a break! If they can hover like that, why don't they just live in the clouds or why don't they just fly when they travel? This seemed like a bad cartoon. And what was the deal with all the flash backs?  This movie has a 35 minute flash back that goes no where! It ends up hurting the movie and making the ending even more stupid.<br/><br/>***************SPOILER**************<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, after the hero has died to save Jen so she could be with her love because he couldn't be with his, Jen kills herself!

This is not a tragedy, this is a comedy!<br/><br/>**************END OF SPOILER********<br/><br/>This is a bad movie. Make no mistake about it. People who have rated this high did not understand the movie, but didn't want to look stupid so they gave it high marks. Character development? NON EXISTENT.  Very static characters.

Third writer=""Yeah, but..but.. we need to have flying; lots of flying!"" Fourth writer=""..And no plot! We have a masterpiece!"" This movie is a 'piece' all right.<br/><br/>It is a disgrace to IMDB to have this movie rated among and above such movies as 'THE GOD FATHER', 'THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION', and 'FORREST GUMP'.

"Movie-12","8","12","23","18 February 2001"," One of the most stirring and dazzling martial arts films ever made. ***1/2 (out of four)
","CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French: ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a stirring, sweeping, engaging, and action-packed epic achievement in filmmaking; it is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time. It demonstrates martial arts is not about fighting or daring stunts, but about personal achievement, honor, and dignity. The villains in this kind of story are almost always people who use their artful abilities for evil or selfish completion. The heroes are overcome by duty and achievement, and often defy limitation of physiology and mental solicitude. This movie confirms those ideas in such a method that we cannot take our eyes off the screen even for a second.<br/><br/>	Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a massive giant over movie landscape of previous attempts to portray the art of martial arts in a meaningful voice. Jackie Chan is the most popular of today's martial artist actors, but I cannot figure out why. Jackie Chan's movies are stupid, contain thin and distant stories, and almost regularly fail to engage or provide anything but a few shallow laughs and dozens of action sequences. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the perfect tool for me to express my resentment with Jackie Chan movies. <br/><br/>	""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" does contain such absurdities as seen in Jackie Chan productions; there are sequences where the characters defy the laws of gravity, glide over rooftops, rush up the sides of walls, and leap from one house to another. These scenes are so much more convincing than Jackie Chan aimlessly scampering down the sides of lofty structures, though. Why? Because what happens is in the spirit of the characters' convictions and possibilities. When Jackie Chan does these stunts, he does them simply because he can. There is no realization in mindless action, but there is in such sheer physical grace of the scenes in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""<br/><br/>
	The fight sequences can also help determine the difference between this movie and ""The Legend of Drunken Master,"" ""Shanghai Noon,"" ""First Strike,"" ""Mr. Nice Guy,"" or any other recent Jackie Chan action frolic. Chan uses fast-paced fighting to provoke laugher of disbelief, but the scenes are not defined within the context of the plot and are always contrived and feel forced. Like the scenes in Jackie Chan films, long training hours went into preparation, and they are beautifully choreographed. But the unique content in that separates ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" from other films of this genre is the great depth and rhythm of how they connect with the story.<br/><br/>Unlike Chan films, the script and character motives are not just clotheslines for senseless action, but are idyllic, ethereal and meaningful to advance the story. Chow Yun-Fat, who finally redeems himself after some extraordinary failures, co-stars with Michelle Yeoh, whom both are experienced martial artists. Yun Fat plays a warrior named Li Mu Bai who vowed to avenge the murder of his master done in by the evil Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei). This villain also stands between two characters' affectionate feelings for each other. She has arranged for the capture of a soulful sword one belonging to Li Mu Bai's master, and only Li Mu Bai can return it to its rightful owner. <br/><br/>	Screenwriters James Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Kuo Jung amazingly capture the deep sentiment of the human love story, which is not the usual hokum, but touching and uplifting. Ang Lee allows for an unusual long but necessary flashback that is more of a separate story than a sequence. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh dazzle on screen as they master the delicate martial arts techniques. The fight sequences are so enticingly photographed, the sheer image of the characters battling on screen acquires unmatched escapism. Before watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" first examine the qualities of a Jackie Chan production, the overwhelming achievement of this film will be even more apparent. You may never look at martial arts films the same way again."

In this spectacular movie, the Director is so innovative that I can never go back to the newer American-style movies. If you have your doubts, just watch this movie with an open mind. Women have the power. All the men.. are just a sideline and have their limited use to the power of these women. I gladly agree that Women have and need the most power in modern society. In this film though, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are sexy, powerful, inspiring, controlling, dynamic in their interactions and pure magic on the screen. <br/><br/>Ang Lee has created a movie that will be held as a standard, not only for Martial Arts films, but all future romance films from this day forward."

Certainly, it was much more realistic than the common one-punch knockout so easily accepted in action films today. The incredible cinematography and heart-wrenching main theme were only prologue to an even more incredible story, one of love and hate that combined with angst and hope and heartbreak to form a web that the viewer, if one is of any feeling and emotion at all, could not help but be tangled in. Those who have less-than-stellar appreciation for this outstanding cinematic masterpiece mainly complain that they were anticipating something other than what this film gave them, but have little issue with the film itself not delivering well what it delivers: the consummation and pain of new love contrasted with the heartbreaking tragedy of love that endures only through a veil of tradition and honor."

So I went to the cinema hoping to watch another Kung Fu movie. Oh boy, I was wrong. This movie is a masterpiece. I have watched it several times ever since. It is so special. It is not about Kung Fu.

"paul-nemecek","10","3","4","2 July 2018"," An Ang Lee Masterpiece
","Critics have bemoaned the lack of quality in the films turned out in the year just past. With the exception of a few epic films like Gladiator and The Patriot, Steven Soderbergh's two films Erin Brockovich and Traffic, and some lesser known ""art films"" like Billy Elliot and You Can Count on Me, quality films have been in short supply. The really notable exception to this year's drought is Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>I saw this film over Christmas break in Washington D.C. To say that the audience was captivated would be a significant understatement. On two separate occasions the audience burst into applause in the middle of the film. They don't make them like they used to, but once in a while they make them even better.<br/><br/>This may seem like an odd film for Ang Lee whose previous credits include Sense and Sensibility. What makes this film exceptional is that it combines the sensibilities of the romance film with the sensory ecstasy of a ballet. This film is frequently compared to The Matrix and the martial arts choreography is done by the same person--Yuen Wo-Ping. At many points the choreography is closer in style to the kinetic grace of ballet than to the rough-and-tumble action of the traditional fight scene.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those films that has something for everyone. This is a traditional hero's quest where the central characters are trying to find a stolen sword that has great symbolic meaning for the characters. Unlike most Westerns or Samurai films wherein women are little more than moveable props, the women here are strong central characters in their own right. Romance is really at the center of the film and Ang Lee handles this part of the story with the same graceful unfolding that made Sense and Sensibility such an excellent film. Like The Matrix there are meanings at deeper levels where we find Jungian shadows, Yin and Yang, and almost anything else you want to look for.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has already won a number of awards including Golden Globes for best foreign language film and best director. Look for it to feature prominently in the Academy Award nominations. It may well become the third foreign language film in the past decade--Life is Beautiful and Il Postino being the other two--to be nominated for best picture. Whatever its destiny at the Academy Awards, this is clearly one of the best films of the year and is definitely worth a look."

The archetypes seemed too basic.<br/><br/>I love Chinese action films, and this wasn't one.  This was a drawn out love story with a subtext of action.  The uninitiated might believe that this represents Chinese Action well.  To them, I'd reccomend the John Wu film, ""Hard Boiled.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the character story was too drawn out.  The singular jump to the past was confusing because of its length combined with its singularity.<br/><br/>
If I had to guess, I'd say this is a classical Chinese story set to film. This is China's ""Braveheart.""  Therefor, without the cultural investment, we are left somewhat dry.<br/><br/>All this said, the film is universally enjoyable.  What it lacks in action, it makes up in emotion, and vice versa.

If you can ignore the horrific events depicted and either don't understand or care about the film's disdain for the realities of physics, anatomy, or medical science, then this movie might be for you.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have the handicaps of both education and conscience and therefore expect more from a film than a stylized adrenalin rush."

","In what can only be described as one of the most breath-taking and original movies in years, Wo hu zang long is sure to pleasantly surprise and intrigue any viewer.<br/><br/>Woefully typecast as a ""kung-fu"" movie, Wo hu zang long is a complex, deep, and thought provoking drama/love story, set against the beautiful and mystical lands of ancient China.  The main characters, of which there are several, are all wonderfully portrayed.  The complex motivations and interactions of the cast is a long overdue contribution to recent films, and any viewer will feel themselves hanging onto their seat as the plot twists and turns.  Bitter enemies reconcile, and the certain future becomes very uncertain several times throughout the course of this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Wo hu zang long is amazing.  Clearly, this film was crafted rather than made, as even the most banal conversations are shot from pleasing angles, views, and shadows.  Action is heightened, characters are emphasized, and nothing is missed by the camera.<br/><br/>The action sequences of this film are nothing short of amazing.  The marathon fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi is one of the best showcases of martial talent ever captured on film.  Yeoh in particular demonstrates an awe-inspiring level of skill in her art.<br/><br/>Wo hu zang long will leave no one dissapointed at the theater this year. Even the most crazed action fans will be pleasantly surprised by it's depth, as will the ""please not another Kun-Fu movie"" crowd.  Do yourself a huge favour, and see this movie on the big screen, as it was meant to be seen."

","How this movie could be nominated for Best Picture is astounding. I guess it shows how weak the field really was. First, the good parts. The direction was very good, as was the cinematography. It was a beautiful film to look at, and the martial arts scenes were well edited and choreographed. The Bad Parts: plot, acting, story, martial arts. The plot has huge holes in it. Perhaps it loses something in the translation. Without giving anything away, why does Jen walk up the long stairs near the end when she can fly? Why doesn't Li just kill the bad guy when they first meet? The ending: I walked out of the theatre scratching my head going ""huh?"" There is no exploration of the character of Jen. She is simply a spoiled rich brat. And any transformation that she may or may not have had is not built up over time. It just happens. Or maybe she's just a spoiled brat who didn't get her way. The acting is difficult to judge fairly, since the dialogue was in mandarin and I don't understand it. But it was typically wooden, which artists might want to call stoic. The martial arts were ridiculous. While it was well choreographed and well performed, flying through the air? I kept waiting for Obi Wan to say, ""use the force Li"". Some people have equated it with ""The Matrix"". In the Matrix you could suspend belief because it wasn't real, it was virtual reality. Well here on terra firma the laws of physics still apply. If I were a producer, I would just make sure I filmed a movie in China with elaborate costumes and sets, and I would know I would have several invitations on Oscar night."

","Before I begin, I must point out that I like samurai and martial arts movies. So I didn't watch this film with a negative mind set.<br/><br/>This movie is neither good nor bad--it has some of each aspect. First the bad. While MANY loved the bizarre and over-the-top action sequences (complete with wall walking and flying across the trees), I didn't. It only served to obscure the good writing, photography and acting. Many praised it, but it just seemed a little dopey--sort of like combining a kung fu movie with a Sylvester Stalone or Disney pic. Second, few films can match the hype surrounding it. By the time I saw it, my expectations were too high. I do like some of the old-time Hong Kong kung fu movies--in these films with cheesy special effects and over-the-top action, such excesses are to be expected. In a big-budget and more Western-oriented film, it all just seems out of place.<br/><br/>Now the good. It was a visually stunning movie and generally kept my interest. That's really about it. Maybe you'll like it, but I was left feeling amazingly flat and unimpressed."

Being a chinese, I might have been proud of it because it won in Oscar, had I not seen it. Heaven knows what story is the film telling. And the scenes in it seems so unreal. How on earth can such a film won Oscar? By the way, I hope they will stop making chinese style action films. I've seen  too many of them, and you foreigners will soon grow tired of them."

The action is perfectly timed, always relevant (Except perhaps the teahouse scene, but that was damn good fun!) and always eye-poppingly good.

But these people are unable to experience escapism and enjoy this movie to the full."
"voidmind","1","11","24","30 December 2003"," A Witless Waste of Time
","Crouching Dragon, Whizzing Tiger is one of the most asinine movies I have ever seen. Full of itself and the overwrought, throwaway ""wisdom"" of the characters' cherished Wudan art, the film grates without relent.<br/><br/>The melodramatic fools portrayed in the film spend more time running their fatuous mouths than they do at any actual attempts at ""fighting,"" to use the term very loosely. Particularly annoying is the silly galumphing about in the air that some of the characters do when they aren't flipping around in the dirt missing each other repeatedly with flailing, ineffective blows.<br/><br/>Further, their weapons are practically useless in most combats, due to their vast inability to even touch flesh with them, much less pierce it. With all this supposed training, couldn't their ""warriors"" be taught to use a damn firearm? A few well-directed shotgun blasts would dispatch the wallowers in short order. Ang Lee needs to take a cue from Tarantino.<br/><br/>Other terribly improbable inanities of the plot include a paralyzation technique performed by some jabs in the ribs, a young girl falling in love with her robber and rapist, a governess who moonlights as a murdering martial arts master and who has wanted posters of her image in many local hands but whom no one can recognize when at her day job, and a poison that supposedly makes the heart pump blood backwards. (What? It makes the heart valves turn around in the vessels? Yeah, right.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the most disturbing delusion is the ornate wardrobe and lavish residences in which these creatures of utter fantasy exist. Were the film to show the slightest resemblance to reality, the dire poverty of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, the utter filth and disease and death with which they live every day, would be shown.<br/><br/>The one positive thing I can say about the film is that the writers for the English overdub were skilled at creating a phonemic pattern of English dialogue that matches somewhat closely the mouth movements of the actors speaking in Mandarin. The English is a creative expression of most of the concepts in the original tongue."
"tab-4","1","12","27","27 March 2002"," beautiful and forgettable
","My thoughts on this film.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful movie. It look s very very good. It has a lot of fighting scenes. Some of them are entertaining, but most of them are just plain stupid. The sound and music works fine, but are not that noteworthy.<br/><br/>The main problems with this movie are these things:<br/><br/>1.Uninspiring story<br/><br/>2.You never really get to know the characters that good, so I at least couldnt care less about what happened to them. I dont think it is the actors or actresses fault, it is the story. Of course, if you speak Chinese you may get more into it, but I still think it will fall short.<br/><br/>3.The flying. Why they thought that removing the gravity in some scenes would improve on the excitement I will never understand. It just ruins the whole thing.<br/><br/>Some people has written here before that it is a fantasy movie and that we should have an open mind to what is possible in a fantasy movie. I agree, in a fantasy movie I always accept these things, but this is NOT a fantasy movie. At least none of the trailers or ad's for this movie has given me that impression. As far as I know it's a tale from the ancient times. If people flew back in those years I would love to know the reason. At least then I would accept it as a fairytale.<br/><br/>This movie would be very good without the flying, and it could have been great with more depth. (Just because it comes from exotic China does not make it deep and thoughtful)<br/><br/>Why people compare this to Matrix, I dont understand. They have absolutely nothing in common. (to say it is similar because of the fighting scenes is like comparing Rambo to the X-files because they both have guns in them)<br/><br/>My personal impression of this movie says not to recommend it to others, but it is not a bad movie so a lot of people will like it.<br/><br/>I will rate it as I rate games.<br/><br/>Visuals: 9/10 Sound  : 8/10 Story  : 6/10 Value  : 6/10<br/><br/>Score in the normal IMDB fashion would be a 7/10"
"Mark-309","1","10","22","18 February 2001"," I didn't like it.
","It consisted of what seemed like hours of fantasy sword fighting.  The kind where no blood is seen.   Childish cartoon-like violence, punctuated by simple-minded dialog and story line.<br/><br/>At least in the original Zorro, Douglas Fairbanks does some impressive acrobatic leaps (assisted by a hidden trampoline),  and later on TV, Guy Williams charms us with bloodless swordplay that is teasingly brief.  But in this film, the fantasy sword fights are all faked up with walking up walls and flying, and they seem to go on forever.<br/><br/>By the way, there is no consistency to the magical abilities of the fighters.  Sometimes they can fly, sometimes not.  Anything to make the fight more fair.<br/><br/>The love interest in the story is a mass murdering bandit who happens to be cute, so that makes him ok.  The dialog and the storyline are both childish. But not childish in a captivating way... as in City of Lost Children... rather in an awkward unthinking way.<br/><br/>This picture wanted to make murder and slashing people with swords seem like.. fun.  Something you do on a blind date; charming, sexy, and winsome.<br/><br/>I found it to be creepy and insidious.  Give me Hannibal any day.. where murder is depicted as horrible and repulsive."
"dragonshield","9","5","9","28 September 2007"," A timeless tale about love and honour, an unmistakable masterpiece
","""Wo hu cang long"" aka ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a timeless adventure tale, which takes place in ancient China, the eternal empire of heroes, gods and miracles. Li Mu Bai is a great warrior whose good deeds are known all around East. He decides to give his magical jade sword to an old friend of his, but a mysterious martial arts expert manages to steal the ancient weapon. Li must find out the identity of the thief and find his precious sword. But, the way of a warrior isn't as straightforward - love and honour have their own demands.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Asian film making and to really watch Asian films you need this certain perspective, especially when it comes to these zen-films. Nevertheless this movie isn't a typical Asian film, as I'd more describe it as a film where Asian film making and Hollywood collide. You could think that it all goes wrong in the Hollywood -part, but for your surprise it doesn't. Ang Lee has created a fine piece of quality style, where you can sense both Asian and Hollywood which blend together like butter for a bread. The story, originally written by Du Lu Wang and turned into a screenplay by three writers, is absolutely beautiful, it includes twists and turns, it's dramatic and romantic, it's even thrilling and it has spectacular fighting sequences. To me the reason why this stands out from an usual eastern movie and where you can really know it's also Hollywood is the somehow different, even better, flow in the story and the amount of fighting sequences. Despite that I think this movie is suitable for both Asian and American audience, not forgetting the rest of the world. Each one gets satisfaction and you don't have to be a fan of Asian films or know anything about the history behind zen-movies, although you really need to be open minded.<br/><br/>This leads me to, once again, the one thing I think Asian directors are better than any other directors of different nationalities; The cinematography. If you'd think there isn't anything Asian in this film, you can't deny the fact that the cinematography is. Once again we are shown endless landscapes, mind painted sceneries and this undeniable and precise harmony of professional operation of the camera, which is to me just amazing. It holds this beauty which you can't compare to anything else and that, if something, is the real heart of true dedication of Asian film makers. You can't really do anything else than just thank them about it, but it's enough that you know it yourself. These landscapes are complimented with the utterly tremendous music composed by Tan Dun, who has composed a main theme that'll melt the heart of even the most cynical person. For Asian film making it's very common to fit the music with the cinematography and the story, but I just can't get enough of it, it's always just that good and you just don't get bored of it. The best thing about the music is that you can't hear music like it in any other films, so it's always fresh for your ears if you've only watched movies from Hollywood. Asian instruments are always strong and compelling, being really significant for the overall feeling of the film and what's left after it.<br/><br/>Even the role performances are excellent, so you'll get a full quality package. I think Yun-Fat Chow as Li Mu Bai makes his best role performance yet to date and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien makes some pretty damn fine job as well. Ziyi Zhang is again the beautiful herself, being also a great actress as well, which makes her one of my favourite Asian actresses at the moment. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh have a really good chemistry with each other, which is somehow reflected as the chemistry between Ziyi Zhang and her co-star Chen Chang. Both couples work with each other superbly on screen, so the movie isn't a let down even in that department. When you get along with film you realise that these couples are sort of equal to each other, only that the characters have different names and the stories behind them are different; It's all about love in the end and when we finally get to the end there's an astonishing solution where tears won't be spared. When love and honour have their own demands they will become equal to each other, love will become honour and vice versa. It's really hard to explain and even harder to find out, but in any case the viewer isn't left without answers. You can make up your own mind about the ending though, so it's also really clever.<br/><br/>""Wo hu cang long"" is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've ever seen, everything in it matches and clicks, everything just gets along. The film isn't perfect, but to be honest it's really close in being one. It doesn't really have any major flaws and even the minor ones can't be explained. Like mentioned before you really need a certain perspective, or you need to be at least open minded, because let's face it; A film like this isn't for everyone. If you can't stand any films which define the laws of physics or which are somehow surreal I wouldn't really recommend this film to you. If you're just slightly open minded or at least have some remains of an open mind then please do watch it, as I'd say you won't be disappointed. ""Wo hu cang long"" even won a total of four Academy Awards, which is really an achievement for a foreign film. Just to name two, it won Oscars from the best cinematography and music, so I'm really not praising them for nothing. Just see this film. You even may be surprised by its magic and its affect on you."
"classicsoncall","9","5","9","25 September 2006"," ""A sword by itself rules nothing.""
","A wonderfully lyrical film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" literally flows from beginning to end. From my perspective, I see the story not as a martial arts movie, but one with martial arts in it, done in a way to move the story along. The tone and intensity of each fight scene conveys a different emotion; Shu Lien's recovery of the Destiny Sword inspires loyalty, Jen's battles with Lo in the desert call to mind youthful innocence and aggression, Li Mu Bai's fatal battle with Jade Fox tempers revenge with justice. Each in it's own fashion has a way of confirming - ""When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots"".<br/><br/>CTHD is one of those defining films that takes it's particular genre to new levels, much like ""Star Wars"" did for sci-fi, and ""The Exorcist"" did for horror. It's choreography and wire work blend perfectly with gorgeous natural beauty and crisp cinematography. It can be enjoyed and understood on many levels, and if your mood simply calls for a well styled action film, it works that way too. Today's viewing was my third, and it allowed for a better understanding of the story with the special effects a complement to it and not a distracting 'wow'."

Great story, great actors (male and female), and magnificent action sequences. And scenes don't come along very often that are as touching as the final one with Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh. See it on a big screen if you haven't already. See it again on a big screen if you have. Then watch the fine DVD release from Sony.

The action sequences made ""X-men"" look realistic.  Indeed, they would be more at home in a Mortal Kombat movie.  The fighting itself was fairly well done, but certainly nothing you haven't seen recently in any number of other films. What really puzzles me is how anyone (above the age of 10) can honestly say that this movie has much of a plot.  It is transparent from the start, and is basically a rehash of any number of earlier films (including dozens of B movie martial arts flicks).  I was tempted to get up from my seat and leave about half way through the movie during the ""desert romance"" sequence that interrupted the progression of the main plot for 20 minutes are so, while convincing me that this is quite possible the most overrated movie of all time.

She chases after him on horseback.  There are some horse riding tricks performed as the two battle on their horses (something like Indiana Jones did in Raiders of the Lost Ark).<br/><br/>The fight scenes are an insult to anyone that has studied martial arts.  One person can take on hundreds and never get tired.  (the director needs to see any Jean Claude Van Damme film to see what exciting fighting looks like) And then they fly and float in the air like Mary Martin in Peter Pan.  There is also a scene where the old woman shoots poisonous needles through a Gatling gun type device and the needles are blocked by the heroes swinging their swords.<br/><br/>This movie is two hours long and the plot just didn't ever make sense.

Martial art films are not really my favourite choice of film, mainly due to the continuous fighting scenes, which although very cleverly planned, get slightly repetitive. However, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has an interesting, evocative narrative that brings you into the individual character's experiences and lives, rather than just continuously viewing none stop kung fu etc. <br/><br/>If you want a romantic, adventure flick with a beautiful soundtrack and depth then this film is a must see!!!"

","The only reason why this movie can be awarded a 9 is because it is a link between two cultures of movie making. It allowed for the Chinese culture to penetrate the Hollywood and even the international movie scene. Not true, some may say, but ask the commercial viewers which Chinese movie they have seen and it will be this one. they will tell you they did not like it, but i think it is perfect. It has allowed for cinematography (Chinese) to flourish, merely because they has a Hollywood budget. It is a mix between the west and the east (old Chinese customs and traditions) in a western suit. Anyone who thinks that they will enjoy a Chinese movie, but think that movies such as the fighting munk or the terrible dragon (i am unsure of the titles) then will enjoy this flic. Hopefully as many people will appreciate the movie as we have. Take care, treat life well and watch this F---ing movie please..."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film about flying warriors, powerful swords, and etc. The fight scenes are really not close to reality, but the fight scenes here are one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. The stylish camera work on the fight scenes is really great, and take note, the actors don't have any doubles in their fight scenes. Michelle Yeoh is a superb great actress, she is one of the greatest actress I've ever encountered. The fight scenes also are well choreographed, specially the first fight scene when they are walking on the walls, it is really a masterpiece. The movie and the fight scenes really breaks the law of gravity! Why? Because the fight scenes are really unbelievable, like sword fighting in the top of the trees, walking in walls... It's like no gravity!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone, specially if you are looking for a non stop action fantasy film.<br/><br/>10/10"
"kookytree","10","4","7","31 July 2003"," Excellently executed escapist fantasy
","I'm not at all familiar with the sub genre of Chinese storytelling that this film is associated with/belongs to, so for all I know it might be a very poor example from an area of entertainment with a lot more to offer. But if that's true, then this is a truly stellar genre, as I adore this film!<br/><br/>Yes, it's slow-burning. Yes, the plot could be taken on the surface as paper thin. But this is cinematic escapism at it's very best. It makes me cringe when people criticise the film because the fight scenes are ridiculously unrealistic. Some people just don't get it. It helps to think of the battles as dances, balletic visual poetry (indeed Michelle Yeoh's background is in dance, not martial arts). ""Crouching Tiger"" contains some of the most equisite set pieces I've seen on film -the first fight scene between the two female leads, the bar brawl, and the lyrical final scene in the mountain- come immediately to mind. However, I found the treetop chase to be lacking somewhat in execution- it's a concept with good potential, but it translates clumsily onto screen.<br/><br/>The visual genius on display is supported by a beautifully subtle performance from Michelle Yeoh, contrasted by the starkly vital presence of Zhang Zi (I know I've spelt that wrong, oh well :S). They both eat up the screen with their charisma- you genuinely cannot take your eyes away from them. Yeoh is all slight quivers beneath deliberate control, eyes fixed in enigmatic amusement, potential tears always seeming only a moment away. Zi uses her incredible, manga-like eyes to convey likeable innocence when she playing at being the aristocrat, mischief when she is quipping like the all-American action heros so popular in the films made the other side of the Pacific, and an incredible anger when in the fight scenes. Zi is supported excellently by her eminently likeable, equally charismatic love interest, the ragged desert-dwelling thief. However Yeoh is, unfortunately, not matched by her male counterpart Chow Yun Fat, who turns in an oddly dispassionate, uninvolving performance. However, it's possible that he was good in the film, but the sizeable talent surrounding him merely suffocated any possibility of him coming across as anything more than mediocre.<br/><br/>And now onto the plot- often accused of being far too simple and ""high-concept"" for such a critically acclaimed film. I would disagree. Certainly, this isn't an exercise in senseless ""the-plot-rules-all"" film making promoted by many a summer movie. The plot not only serves the characters, but IS the characters, their interactions and relationships. The restrained dynamic between Yun Fat and Yeoh is played against the sparky, lusty affair between Zi the aristo and her lowly bit of criminal scruff (the latter being standard escapist, fairy tale fluff, executed perfectly). The final scene between Yeoh and Yun Fat's characters is infinitely more interesting than lesser film makers would make it, as there is no tragic final kiss, merely tears and regret. Perhaps the most interesting character dynamic is between the aging female outlaw Jade Fox, and her supposed muse, Zi.<br/><br/>The rave reviews this film recieved seems to have led to a lot of bitterness from viewers who were dissapointed by it. If you are accustomed to frenetically edited and paced action movies (and don't get me wrong, I love those movies when they're well done), or bone crunchingly realistic/gory fight scenes, this may not be for you. The film is often ponderous, concentrating on the characters and/or lush scenery as opposed to plot twists on every page. The fight scenes aren't about violence, but the beauty of two bodies communicating, an acrobatic, high speed dance of wills.<br/><br/>All in all: great performances, great cinematography, great direction, great scenery, great ending, great music, great set pieces, great characters. Great film."

","I admit i liked the fight scenes, but come on, why is everyone pushing for this movie to win so many awards? It was very predictable, and not that visually stimulating. All it took was some people swinging around on wires, and some computer graphics people to erase them to get the affects.<br/><br/>I only hope that the people actually voting for the Oscars does NOT vote for this movie! there are a lot of other movies deserving the award.<br/><br/>Just my humble opinion."
"bigsexy944","1","7","15","19 January 2001"," A good movie yes a GREAT movie? Absolutely NOT...
","As an avid moviegoer I cannot understand the life of me the fascination with this movie. It lacks so much and I can't believe people fail to see it. The movie has got action... great action but does it have plot? No. Does it have characterization?? No. Is it worthy a 9.0 rating? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>Like I stated before, I thought the action scenes were really exciting, the un-realistic ness of it seemed a little silly at first but I soon got used to it and thought it was well done and cool. But the action was basically the only thing I thought was fantastic about the film.<br/><br/>I really felt the film lacked in characterization and plot, it also dragged on really long and had plenty of useless scenes. For example the flashback scene in the desert could have been cut down to a mere 10 mins instead of the 20 or so mins it ended up to be. There were allot of pointless scenes that dragged out the movie, but it's the plot in general that suffered, there really wasn't a point to it all but based on the background of the story I felt there could have been had they focused more on the characters.<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FILM.<br/><br/>I never liked Jen's character. I thought she was really a bitch for lack of better words and at the end of the film her switch over to the good guys side seemed not only too predictable but ill timed. When Chow Yun Fat's character died I really didn't care or feel any emotional connection to him as all the scenes of Jen running around here and there should have been replaced with scenes to build on his character.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the way the whole Jade Fox thing was resolved, the movie sort of drifted from that plot with all the Jen scenes especially that much too long desert flashback when we came back to the main plot I was a little confused. The story never really went anywhere and them the movie just ended. It wasn't well thought out plot but the backstory had huge potential.<br/><br/>Based on all this I'd have to give it a thumbs down. I would NOT recommend it and I don't understand why people seem to think it's such a great film. Iin a rating out of 10 I'd only have to give it about a 5."

I need to write something here for you Hidden Dragon fans.<br/><br/>A: The heavy accent: Most of you guys can't understand Chinese, so it really don't matter to you. But for me, listening to their accent is like listening to George Bush saying :""Hi, guys, I am from New York.""  And that really gets me under my skin.<br/><br/>B: The special effects: Totally fake, you can clearly feel the rope pulling them here and there. And I bet the girl called Zhang Ziyi never even went to P.E. class in her middle school(a must if you are a chinese middle school student), each move of her martial art was very much like NiuYangGe---a kind of Chinese folk dance. Anyway, if you watch enough Gongfu movies--even made in Mainland China, you'll know the difference.<br/><br/>C: The language: Very hollywood. I mean I understand hollywood lines, right, they are hopeless already, (though I have to admit that some hollywood lines ARE cute),  but why the heck do you have to put all that in a Chinese movie? Well, I noticed it does mention something like calligraphy and Chinese traditional medicine or stuff, but it was just all naive and shallow. Therefore, I sympathize those American when they see all that and cry out loud ""Wow, that's awesome!! Because I don't understand!!!""<br/><br/>D: The plot: Very boring, and incrediablly unreasonable, though I would highly recommend it as a classical post-modern study subject or something.<br/><br/>E: My boss: He is one of the American Chinese brought up in Taiwan, a complete red-neck idiot.

","Why have people gone overboard about this film? It's not awful, but it is far from great. The fight scenes are okay, but mostly take place in the dark. The flying sequences are farcical. The plot makes Star Wars look like Tolstoy. The story is too uneven to either be an ensemble piece or to focus on one character. Many of the characters key to the plot are not even seen. There are some great sequences, but I've seen better episodes of the 80s TV classic Monkey. I have thoroughly enjoyed Lee's work in the past - Ice Storm, East Drink Man Woman - but this is not his greatest. It did not deserve a nomination, let alone a win at the Globes.

I only finish watching the movie because of all the hype and overrated stuff. I'm a fan of martial arts, super powers, and leaping scenes of Chinese movies, but the story is so boring and over exaggerated, i.e. Jen fought everyone at the inn like she was invincible and very skillful, which she wasn't at all because then she would have been matched to Li Mu Bai. Jen is the main character in this movie, but she has a static character, which is not worthy to be a main character. She needs to at least change or develop a little bit from her flashback.She can't make up her decisions and acts stubborn throughout the whole movie like a little kid.

","I gave this film two chances. I watched it subtitled and I watched the dubbed version. Both times I felt the same way: enjoyed the visuals, the leading ladies but couldn't warm up to the film nor most of its characters. In the end, I dumped the DVD. I guess you could call it a doubled-edge sword, pun intended.<br/><br/>THE GOOD - On one side of the ""sword,"" you have some beautiful scenery in here. ""Spectacular"" might be a better description. It also features two pretty women: Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh. The latter looked the better of the two, at least in this film. The stunts, of course, are jaw-dropping. They were ""news"" back when this movie came out because no one - at least Western audiences - had quite seen people flying around like this doing swordplay while floating from rooftop to rooftop, etc. Nowadays, of course, since this film came out, we've seen it in subsequent movies such as ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Kill Bill"" and more.<br/><br/>THE BAD - On the other side of the sword, you have a story and characters that are just too difficult to get involved over. The characters aren't presented well enough for us to passionately root for some of them. I also don't go along with the Liberal critics who always think it's cool with women beating up all the men, as is the case much of the time here. It's stupid and unrealistic.<br/><br/>FINAL NOTE: I watched the dubbed version and the Mandarin version with subtitles. Both are excellent. Usually I prefer the subtitles but the dubbing was done so well that in this case, you should be fine with either choice."
"khanbaliq2","10","3","5","20 September 2009"," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the most solid martial arts film ever.
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon may be the best martial arts film ever. That's not necessarily because it features the best fight scenes or a lot of them, but because if features a good story and outstanding acting from the leads. It's been a long time since I've seen an action film as good as this one. Ang Lee, the director, managed to assemble a cast of some of the most famous actors from Hong Kong and China.<br/><br/>The fictional story is set in the historic Qing Dynasty in China, in the 43rd year of Emperor Qianlong's reign (1778). Chow Yun-Fat, who's one of my favorite actors, plays Li Mu-bai who's a Wudang master of martial arts and sword fighting. He meets with his long-time friend and partner Yu Shu-lien (Michelle Yeoh), and tells her that he wants to hand over his famous sword the Green Destiny to his friend Sir Te because he wants to leave his warrior life behind but Sir Te decides to keep it for safekeeping in Beijing. In the meantime, Mu-bai intends to commemorate the death of his master, who was murdered long ago by Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-pei), a woman who sought to learn Wudang. In Beijing, Shu-lien delivers the sword and meets Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the daughter of Governor Yu, a Manchu aristocrat. Jen is destined for an arranged marriage, yet yearns for adventure; she becomes fascinated with the warrior Shu-lien. One night, a masked thief sneaks onto Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Things go from there.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are spectacular. They were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, well known for his work in The Matrix and other films. I kid you not, at one time in the film there's a sword fight on top of bamboo trees. It's both exciting and mystical. The fight scenes are also important in the progress of the story, which is rare in martial arts films. The photography too, is beautiful. The film features a large range of places. Most of the credit should go to director Ang Lee. He said that he set out to make the best martial arts film ever, and I think that he succeeded. Made on a mere US$15 million budget, with dialogue in Mandarin, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon became a surprise international success. It grossed US$128 million in the United States alone, becoming the highest-grossing foreign-language film in American history. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and three other Academy Awards, and was nominated for six other Academy Awards, including Best Picture."

We find ourselves becoming attached to the characters so throughout, we feel attached to them to make us feel happiness as well as sadness.<br/><br/>The beginning is eye-opening and makes audiences ask many questions which will encourage them to carry on watching. The ending is remarkable and a true capture of how free the soul can be.<br/><br/>The use of flashbacks is also a story pushing device and is used in the best way by using it to grab audience attention to become attached to the characters.<br/><br/>Action sequences.<br/><br/>What makes this film however are the action sequences. Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) directs outstandingly scenes involving the characters who fly around while sword fighting. This is a remarkable technique. It beats conventional action sequences that we have these days e.g. Mission impossible II or James Bond and adds a more fantasy genre to the story. Its great fun to watch as the actors give the sword fighting their all and perform perfectly. Their reflexes and actions are defiantly worth watching and personally are the best sword fighting sequences I have ever seen, maybe even the best action scenes! The swords are beautifully designed and the training the actors must have been through has to be admired.

","I was rather surprised at the number of people who claimed not to like Crouching Tiger because of the flying and leaping. Even the best of realist martial arts films require extraordinary suspension of disbelief. No one should ever produce a gun, for instance, and often, while the hero is kicking the stuffing out of the guys in front, the guys behind are doing a kind of rhythmic shuffle, awaiting their turn. I thought the film was gloriously choreographed, like Swan Lake with attitude. But most interesting was the whole business of Jade Fox and the Zhang Ziyi character, who regularly express contempt for the Wudan style of martial arts, and make it clear that their resentment comes from the fact that women were excluded from learning there. When Jade Fox dies, she calls the Zhang Ziyi character her only family, her only enemy. Also, the bulk of the actual fighting was done by the two very acrobatic and good-looking women. And Zhang Ziyi's character is definitely easy for women to empathize with; she's like a lot of young women who don't want to marry the man their parents choose. I haven't seen enough martial arts movies to be an expert, but I don't think this sort of sensitivity to women's desires is that common. It's possible that this emphasis on women's needs (and the whole emphasis on love rather than duty) is what put off many traditional viewers. I loved it, and I only hope more martial arts movies feature women like these."

"sarastro7","10","3","5","8 December 2004"," One of the greatest kung fu classics of all time
","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a bona fide masterwork.<br/><br/>It's an off-beat kung fu movie with an epic love story, and every single part of it works stunningly well. I can watch it again and again, and keep being totally enthralled by the action, the acting and the beautiful cinematography. It is clearly Ang Lee's finest two hours.<br/><br/>This is a true classic, which sets a new and far higher standard for subsequent kung fu movies to live up to. And while some movies have matched and even exceeded this standard in terms of visually stunning martial arts spectacles (see Legend of Zu and House of Flying Daggers), the thing that no later movie has yet matched is the quality of the story and characterization. In fact, I doubt *any* martial arts movie ever made has the satisfying level of emotion and character that this movie has.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger generally avoids clichés of any kind, and doesn't conform to traditional storytelling structures, either; most notably in that it lacks a great climactic fight at the end. To the movie's great credit, the viewer never feels that such a violent climax is necessary.<br/><br/>It also lacks a happy ending, which is the only thing about the movie that I think borders on the problematic. I would really have liked to see Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai end up together, now that they have suppressed their love for so long.<br/><br/>The strange end, with Jen throwing herself off the mountain, is indeed bordering on the nonsensical, but somehow it works. It brings a kind of serene closure to the experience, and one leaves the movie feeling nothing but elation.<br/><br/>The only modern kung fu movie that is on par with Crouching Tiger is Hero, which has an even better story (in my opinion), and even better cinematography, but not quite as much sheer entertainment value and excitement. The two movies are too dissimilar to be compared by the same criteria; Hero is much more of an art movie and has a totally different tone and message. Rate-wise, both movies are perfect 10's, though."

I find it a lot more easy to suspend my belief when the subject matter addresses things I don't live with every day, things that I can really appreciate.  <br/><br/>CTHD does possess a high level of absurdity, it does have less of an excuse to have the characters participate in physics-defying battles than say the Matrix, and it does take me awhile to get used to the English-dub not quite matching up with the lip movement . . . but frankly, I don't care. <br/><br/>
The thing I appreciate most about this film is the fact that the plot is not a flimsy excuse to make characters enter combat every chance they get; it takes the time to develop their characters and setting and fully embrace the world it creates for us.  We have wonderful character and plot arcs, and an interesting unspoken understanding exists between the three main characters played by Yeoh, Yun-fat, and Zhang . . . then it goes even further by extending it to lesser characters.  Now we don't have cardboard clichés battling it out on screen . . . now we have characters that can and do communicate on multiple levels, and now we have some depth and reason to care.<br/><br/>Their interactions aren't played out to be 100% realistic, rather, it's surreal and poetic which provides a perfect foundation for the glorious fight scenes.  Fight scenes that carry more meaning than simply to kill or beat the other guy.  In Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, fights are used as tools to advance the plot and develop the characters, and more than mere blows are exchanged . . . a lot more seems to transpire in the combat photographed here.  My personal favorite would be as Li Mu Bai uses a twig to give lessons in swordplay; all the movements and all of his back story lead up to paint the portrait of an eternally calm master warrior, fighting to teach and not to kill.<br/><br/>And I have to bring up Tan Dun's wonderful score, which provides one of the best utilizations of the cello I've heard in film (compliments, of the extremely talented Yo-yo Ma).  It's a very moving instrumental and like the film, itself, carries an array of seemingly contradicting emotions.  It doesn't strive to sound sad here--upbeat there--happy here--like a number of lesser scores.  Tan Dun surpasses that primitive impulse in every way imaginable by writing music that requires true emotional exploration.  I just hope more directors turn to Tan Dun to provide their films with his music . . . .<br/><br/>I love Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and I applaud Ang Lee for this film as well am very glad to see the Oscars recognized it for 4 awards and several nominations.  It definitely deserved it."

","I know I'm going to get slammed for this, but sorry:<br/><br/>The script was horrid, even worse than ""Gladiator,"" which also nabbed an Oscar nod. Come on: a legendary sword is stolen by a spoiled brat, and retrieved by its guardians, who try to put said brat on the path of righteousness. That's it! The fact the brat is a girl is what's supposed to make us all go ""whoa!"" And, as if the writers knew how trite that was, they decided to torture us with an incredibly long flashback sequence that's even more boring than the main story!<br/><br/>That critics overlooked the weak story line and God-awful Pokemon dialog strikes me as patronizing and more than a bit racist. Were this made by Americans, it would've been slammed big time! And it sure as heck wouldn't have bagged 4 Oscars!<br/><br/>It was obvious the actors were on wires. Yeoh's run across the roof reminded me of the race between Clark Kent and the train in ""Superman"" -- it was that stiff. Why didn't Lee correct this, because everything depends on us being totally sold on the characters' ability to fly?<br/><br/>With the exception of the fight in the restaurant, the fights get tiresome. The ""love story?"" As the saying goes, crap or get off the pot!<br/><br/>Were it a 30 minute short, CTHD would've been killer: the costumes and cinematography are to die for!

","Minor Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>It was a cold winter day back in the good ol' year of 2000. My parents decided that it was a good day to take their kids (us) to see a film. We went online and checked out the schedule of what was playing. My brother's were keen on seeing some film that I don't remember, but luckily my parents decided that they wanted to see Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. I had heard a lot about the movie, mostly from my friends who claimed that, ""It was alright in some parts, but there were these stupid flying scenes!"" My relatives said that it was a great film, definitely the best of the year, along with friends of my parents. I knew that my taste for movies was a little bit more mature than that of my friends and decided that seeing as how I loved Asian film, and that co-star was just so damn cute, I would go, see, and enjoy. We got on our boots, and jackets and struggled out through the snowy winds just to get to the darned car in the driveway. When we finally got to the theatre the movie was about to start. We rushed into our seats, sat down, and witnessed one of the greatest films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is the visual masterpiece directed by Ang Lee, starring Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen. The film, winner of 4 Academy Awards and nominated for 10, is a visually breathtaking fantasy that captures you from the get go and lets you into a world of love, betrayal, friendship, and hatred. This film has been praised by critics all around the globe, and in 2000 deemed ""Best Picture of the Year"" by over 100 critics nationwide. CTHD features the choreography of Yuen Wo Ping, whose credits include ""The Matrix.<br/><br/>Set in 19th century China, CTHD is the story of martial arts master Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and his good friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Li Mu Bai gives his sword ""Green Destiny"" to Sir Te as a present, and just as he hands it over it is stolen. Yu Shu Lien, who is there at the time runs after the thief trying to get the sword back but is unsuccessful. She befriends the daughter of Governor Yu, Jen Yu and notices something a bit fishy about the young character. By watching Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien we can tell that they feel something for each other, but Yu Shu Lien was previously married, and out of respect for her previous husband they try not to come together. There is also a sub-plot with Jen Yu and a former lover who comes back to take her away, but she is to be married and therefore dismisses him. Jen Yu runs away to be free from her lifestyle and it's Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu's job to find her and bring her back.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's story is a fantastical love story and though you may think that this sort of thing will turn you off, I beg you give it a chance. It is an amazing tale that is timeless and will captivate you no matter your tastes; it is just that good. The actors in the movie help move the story along very well. Aside from the rigorous martial arts and action scenes they have to do, they perform the dramatic part of the film very well and convincingly. Michelle Yeoh impresses me again with her amazing talent as an actress and athlete. Chow Yun Fat does well as Li Mu Bai, and again shows his talent in both fields. Newcomer Zhang Ziyi is remarkable as Jen Yu. She is breathtakingly beautiful and an astounding actress. Her background in dance helped very much as she looks so natural doing the martial arts in the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography in CTHD is awe-inspiring. Everything is so graceful and beautiful. It is a visual feast, and done so well that you feel like this can't be the world I live on, it just can't. The martial arts are done very well in the film also. The wires are used very well, and there are a couple of scenes that I would like to mention as being great examples of each. There is a scene at the beginning where Jen Yu steals the sword and Yu Shu Lien chases her over the rooftops of the buildings. It is like a ballet, the gracefulness of the actors as they fly over the rooftops and then come together in powerful displays of martial arts, never losing the refined and beautiful style of their dance. Another scene is when Jen Yu goes to a restaurant and gets in a fight with an enormous group of men. Everything is so well done. She kicks the living crap out of every single one of them, and manages to do so with such style that it almost seems as if she is mocking them with her superior skill. There is also the famous dance on the treetops, which to me is one of the best scenes in the film, using the aforementioned style that the actors and choreographer Yuen Wo Ping put into every scene, to make one of the most beautiful scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a remarkable film by Ang Lee. It is definitely the best picture of 2000 and blows `Gladiator' right out of the water. The direction, scoring, cinematography, choreography and acting are all top-notch and make this movie an absolute must see. With awe-inspiring visuals, and a story that will steal your heart, I recommend CTHD to everyone everywhere. You will not be disappointed<br/><br/>****/****"
"swg2","1","3","5","16 April 2001"," The worst movie in years
","When I heard of this movie, I was suspicious. It had great reviews; all my mates were recommending it. I said to them ""Are you sure? It sounds like just a run-of-the-mill kung fu movie which has somehow squeezed into the mainstream movie scene"". ""No way, it's the best movie I've ever seen,' they said. I couldn't believe how correct I was.<br/><br/>The only explanation for the popularity of this film is some kind of mass hysteria caused by the shock of seeing a kung fu movie for the first time. Maybe to a virgin of the kung-fu genre, CTHD could have been an interesting experience away from Hollywood (but this movie still feels Hollywood to me).<br/><br/>In fact CTHD was so much like so many other kung-fu films I've seen and can't remember the names of. It shares all these same characteristics - a poor, but prominent love story, croony music to accompany these scenes, dying heroes (with croony music) and of course, crazy kung fu. I am disappointed to say that CTHD was inferior even to these other, average kung fu movies.<br/><br/>Of course, kung fu fight scenes are unrealistic, but in most cases they are at least believable in context. Jumping off walls and from roof to roof may be hard to believe, but it sure would look cool - that is, if it weren't so obviously fake and as poorly done as CTHD. Super jumping skills I can believe, but not ""floating"" over the rooftops and never setting a foot on them. The fight scenes were few and far between (as with most of these romance kung-fu genre) but were nothing special even when they finally arose. <br/><br/>The storyline, really, could have been reduced to a couple of sentences when you think about it. In this respect CTHD is a little different from these other kung fu films I mention. These, at least, have some kind of plot twists and intricacies to the story.<br/><br/>Everyone I went to see this film with felt ripped off, and it irritates me to hear how much this movie is loved by a lot of people. I am not a kung fu film addict who wants to pick apart every movie. But among all of the movies I've seen (a lot), I've seen a good share of kung fu's, and I generally like them.<br/><br/>I could gripe all day, but to sum up: If you want a funny, fast paced kung fu film - go get an old Jackie Chan one. If you want a serious, period kung fu film with fancy wirework fighting - go get a Jet Li film. It doesn't matter which - just randomly pick one off the kung fu shelf at the video store. I guarantee, whatever it is, it will be a better example of a kung fu film (and a better film in all respects) than CTHD."

","A week ago I went to see Traffic. It was a good movie with compelling stories and unique cinematography..however my friends and I couldn't help but yawn little bit. I rented the gladiator and Erin Brokovich also. I was horrified at the graphic of the violence and typical HERO story..a lot like Braveheart,patriot,benhur.(we really need to move on!)It tries to capture the essense of Benhur but fails to reach the expectation by formulaic plot and computer graphic people.. Erin Brokovich is a feel good movie with catchy dialogue and good acting of Julia Roberts. I enjoyed the movie but why is it in the best picture catagory? I understand how much people want to hand that Oscar to Julia Roberts..but still.. I don't understand. (I won't mention Chocolat)<br/><br/>However when I watched the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (twice)I really got into the magic of the movie. It was so fascinating, beautifully filmed and acted as well. I love it so much, I took my whole family to go see it again and everyone loved it. You don't have to be some critic to enjoy this movie. My friend who usually prefers action movie (who loved the vertical limit) enjoyed this movie as well.<br/><br/>After months, I finally accepted the fact that The Gladiator is going to win...o how I would love to see Ang Lee accepting the award for Best Picture...<br/><br/>well I guess what matters is that people over the world enjoyed the film. Also it open the door for foreign film especially for Asian film making that doesn't feature Jacky Chan..I'm look forward to Ang Lee's (and also Zhang ZiYi)next projects"
"Saber","Null","3","5","21 January 2001"," Good, hardly great.
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is probably one of the best films of 2000. I'm not sure if that says more about 2000 than it does about CTHD, but there is no doubt that Ang Lee is a master story teller, and that he certainly has a good story to tell.  The cinematography was wonderful, the music was elegant, and appropriate.  The acting was first class, the fight scenes were magical, and the theme was intriguing.  As an American viewer, I found the central plot to be universal, in that most cultures have traditions, and with these traditions, arise the conflicts between chasing ones dreams and respecting ones culture.  This theme is central enough to each of us, allowing most viewers to relate.<br/><br/>That said, I think the flaw in this movie is the general ""hokiness.""  Many scenes (particularly the final scenes) were over-dramatized, and the plot sequence seemed to make the fight scenes convenient.  As an American viewer, I am used to the general ""hokiness"" of supermarket romance novels converted to film.  In some sense, this film is similar, at least that's the impression I had at times.  I'm not sure how this film was received in China, but from the various user comments I read, I would be safe in making the analogy CTHD:Chine::Titanic:America.<br/><br/>A good film?  Yes.  A great film?  Hardly."
"preppy-3","6","3","5","2 January 2001"," Beautiful cinematography, great fights--little else
","What's all the fuss about? This movie is a Japanese romantic drama about male and female roles and a special sword and tons of other stuff. The story is so convoluted, I can't really recount it all. Basically, the film has, as I said, incredible fight scenes and beautiful wide-screen cinematography, but little else. The story is confusing and boring and, with the sole exception of Michelle Yeoh, badly acted (even Chow Yun-Fat!). I gave up on the film about halfway through when they threw in a needlessly long flashback that's a Western!!!! It adds very little to the story. It seems to be there just to up the romance in the movie. Also with such bad acting, you could care less about the characters. Also, the fight scenes aren't that original...Jackie Chan has been doing them in his movies since the 1970s. Also, the film is subtitled...it doesn't bother me but other viewers might not like it. So an overpraised Japanese film. In a few years, nobody will remember this."

","This is a movie where it seems that the whole and the sum of the parts are different and yet are both big. The story is often confusing but not irritating and one wonders about its flow at moments. Yet it is never boring and always has something new to draw you into it. It is difficult to sum it up as a whole. Some of its parts: 1. The Chinese desert - simply breathtaking and different from any other desert seen on film. 2. The cities - those aerial views are something else! 3. The fights - the action scenes in ""The Matrix"" were great and original; the ones here are incredible and way beyond those. A must-see movie, for the story or the cinematography or any of its parts. I regret seeing it so late in its showings locally, as I wanted to see it again.

If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else, and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art, this being a masterful piece of work. If you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really. There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is really the central focus and not the fights, and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles."

","As a chinese and as a big fan of Chow Yun Fat, I am glad to see that CTHD receives all the praises in US.  But honestly, I do think this film is overrated.<br/><br/>The scenery is good.  The storytelling is good, but not really special. The fighting scenes are great but definitely not the finest in the Chinese film history.  If you have seen more HK made martial art films, you won't find the story and fighting scenes too special.<br/><br/>About the flying (of course human being can't fly, but it's in a fantasy Chinese Wuxei world), it's a very common style and technique being used in Chinese martial art films.  But Ang Lee just made it seen too easy and it could annoy some people (including Chinese).<br/><br/>I simply think Zhang Ziyi's screen time is too long and at the end I just don't care too much about her character.  Ang Lee should have put more screen time on Chow and Yaoh's relationship.<br/><br/>Even though I am a fan of Chow Yun Fat, I am not impressed by his performance in this film.  But I do think that he's a very good fit for his role.  I am surprised though by Michele Yaoh's performance.  She showed that she can really act and kick ass at the same time.<br/><br/>In overall, I think it's a good film, but definitely not a masterpiece! I give it 8/10."
"Opalville","1","4","8","19 January 2001"," I cannot recommend this movie.
","As proof positive that I attended this film and did so with an open mind, I even arrived on time and saw a delightful promo for Hannibal.  With one hand in the popcorn and the other on my cell phone, I eagerly awaited one of the most anticipated films of the year.  Such promise, and so easily thwarted. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee's meticulously crafted, odious tone poem, together with its Lawrence Welk-ish soundtrack, left me mortified. But before I get into the details, let me first thank Mr. Lee for challenging all of my romanticized assumptions about 19th century China.<br/><br/>China, long open to outsiders like Bernardo Bertolucci who were unable to offer an authentic critique, has finally permitted one of its own to do just that.  Enter Ang Lee, attempting to set the record straight with his own brand of revisionist history as told through a cliché kung fu morality tale. As visually stunning as Crouching Tiger arguably is, one cannot help but notice Mr. Lee's overbearing reliance on cheap, gimmicky special effects and tediously over-choreographed swashbuckler sequences, of which there are far too many.  If this film has a point, it is buried under the weight of its snobbish nods to Shakespeare and Moliere.  Gone, apparently, are the days when a film could survive on its own merits rather than rely on the tiresome crutch of allusion and mimicry.  Yes, the film is dazzling and glitzy, but those attributes are no substitute for accuracy, authenticity, originality and grace.  Exactly how many sunsets and moonscapes can one cram into a two hour movie?  Just ask Ang Lee.<br/><br/>Unlike past projects where Mr. Lee has proven himself to be an arguably competent director and storyteller, Crouching Tiger is a formidable and inaccurate mess.  It is no English Patient.  I have often been fascinated by Asia Minor, and China is no exception.  This film so completely whitewashes the Tienamen Square incident that perhaps Mr. Lee was unconsciously expressing a repressed love for the works of Leni Reifenstahl.  Seeing this movie, you wouldn't think that the Chinese ever ate rice, grew or smoked opium, or went to the bathroom.  You would think that self-censorship was a good thing.  You would want to run out and build hydroelectric dams to wipe out whatever beauty remains in Taiwan.  You would want to subsidize plastic surgery for the ugly, guns for the unstable, and showers for the homeless. But Crouching Tiger's artistic license does not end there.<br/><br/>With the principal actors suspended from barely erased wires like marionettes, I half expected Fran, Kukla and Ollie to take up arms and battle the equally riveting Jade Fox.  Each character is a caricature; each misplaced and overwrought emotion a manipulative scam.  It is as if Mr. Lee dug a little too deeply into his emotional core, defiantly putting onscreen a half-hearted project that would have been much better left on stage at the local dinner theater.  Such audacity is unbecoming.  That being said, I have little doubt that Crouching Tiger will nonetheless have certain less discerning critics soiling themselves with diarrhea-like approval.<br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure, I confess that I have not and do not intend to read the source material, which undoubtedly has all the poetry of a Harlequin romance, and the style of a bad television miniseries.  Still, one must give Mr. Lee brownie points for setting a new low watermark for cinema.  In appealing to the lowest common denominator of soothing the audience with hypnotic images and mind-numbingly familiar content, Mr. Lee here joins the ranks of Steven Spielberg and Nora Ephron.  It's like going to church, only it's easier to fall asleep.  It's as if Mr. Lee conceptualized and edited the movie while on autopilot.  Which guarantees a smooth ride, but I fear that life's complexities are not best explored through paint by numbers, plug and chug filmmaking.<br/><br/>Please don't mistake my constructive criticisms as bitterness.  I have full confidence that Mr. Lee will one day make a movie that meets with my approval.  But until that day, I shall not forget the saccharin aftertaste of his latest effort."

"kira02bit","1","6","14","17 December 2002"," Pretension thy name is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
","Yet another feverishly overpraised film that critics needed to invent superlatives to describe.  While admittedly I am not a fan of martial art films as a rule, I have enjoyed a handful of them and thought this may fall within similar parameters.  Alas the film is a debacle on nearly all fronts. After a promising start, which introduces a wise warrior (Chow Yun-Fat), a female bodyguard who pines for him (Michelle Yeoh) and a coy young woman (Zhang Ziyi) staying as a guest in the home where everyone initially intersects, the film bogs down into lumbering tedium.  Much emphasis is initially placed on a sword, which during the course of the film gets stolen, returned, stolen again, but it really has little to do with the fragile plot.  In fact, so thinly conceived is the storyline and dialogue that one becomes frightened that a slight breeze may shred it to pieces. Characters are introduced as if they will be important and then are seemingly forgotten in the following scenes.  Headliners Yun-Fat and Yeoh (who actually manages a touching performance) seem to embody potentially interesting characters, but are shoved into the background and forced to play second fiddle to Ziyi, whose character is quickly uncovered to be a spoiled brat with a penchant for violence and destruction.  Definitely not the kind of character to enlist sympathy and carry the film.  Yun-Fat spends the majority of his minimal screen time trying to convert Ziyi from the Dark Side so that she can become the first woman to receive official training in the arts.  There are lots of gravity-defying fight sequences that would be borderline ridiculous if the film did not treat everything with such grave solemnity.  Instead, they just become boring.  Ironically, the fight sequences do not even make sense within the context of the film  (i.e., while the film explains the aerial acrobatics as being an effect of the mysterious ""training"" and is careful to explain how Ziyi and her mentor have achieved it, how then can Yeoh also manage the same aerial feats when the film tells us she has never had said training?).  The desert romance sequence seems to come from another film and the set-up with Ziyi and her ""kidnapper"" beating each other, then resting, then beating each other, etc., all over a comb, grows wearisome quick.  A friend that I saw this with waxed wistful over the drapes, tablecloths and costumes, which pretty much indicates how engrossing this will be to the average viewer.  The running time seems easily double what it is and should you be awake for the jaw-dropping ""symbolic"" climax, you will know first-hand pretension to the nth degree."

The romance was forced, and forced poorly through a half-hour flash back more than an hour into the movie.

"leeying","1","5","11","29 November 2003"," Not authentic
","Wonder why the film bombed so badly in China itself?  Well, there are probably many reasons but I can tell you one of the main reasons why this film went down so badly with me was because of the Mandarin, especially the Mandarin delivered by the two main leads in the movie.  Chow Yun Fatt's Mandarin was terribly awkward and heavily accented in Cantonese, while Michelle Yeoh's was even worse; extremely wooden and her Malaysian accent was incomprehensible at times.  The only actress who delivered her lines convincingly was Zhang Zi Yi.  It's just not convincing that this is a story set in Ancient China when the leads just do NOT sound their parts; at some points during the movie the audience in the theatre, most of whom understand Mandarin, was rocking in laughter from their terrible diction.  In fact, I don't think it'd be any different watching the English-dubbed version of the movie.<br/><br/>Furthermore, CTHD definitely does NOT have the best plot in the genre, nor the best fighting scenes either.  Understandably, the whole martial arts period drama concept was probably refreshing to the Western audience, but it is disturbing to see that the production was banking on this factor to achieve its success.  I've grown up on a staple of martial arts movies and have definitely seen better dialogue, plot depth and gong fu moves elsewhere, even during the '80s!  I found the two lead characters in the movie 2-dimensional and there was hardly any chemistry between them at all.<br/><br/>Theoretically I should be happy that a genre that I love has gained appreciation from a worldwide audience, but in fact, it actually outrages me to see that its success was largely based on marketing and packaging, with little attention paid to authenticity.  The latter makes it so obvious that this movie is targetted at the Western audience."

This movie however has a laughable attempt at a plot and an even worse ending. If you need to see a crouching tiger, go to the zoo and watch a tiger poop."

","This is a typical Ang Lee movie, complete with slow pacing, melodrama, a random, rambling plot, and good visuals and fight scenes. Also very Ang Lee, the characters act in strange and illogical ways. For example, in the scene when the bandits attack Jen Yu's caravan, they kill a few unfortunate guards and run away for no apparent reason. After chasing the bandit leader for days (I guess?) in order to retrieve her comb, Jen Yu then jumps in the sack with him way, way too quickly. And the melodramatic ending when Jen presumably commits suicide-- why is she even doing this? Is she so regretful of Li Mu Bai's death? Does she miss her assassin governess? 我受不了。"
"roedyg","4","2","3","14 November 2016"," If you have seen the trailer, you can skip the movie
","The movie is constructed of interminable fight scenes strung end to end. They use one special effect over and over. The fighters appear to have the magical ability to almost turn off gravity. They can take long slow motion leaps or run up walls.<br/><br/>The net effect is boredom. I fell asleep over and over.<br/><br/>The characters are driven by infantile revenge and even more petty motives. They belong to a warrior cast who kill each other for amusement. When someone is killed in this game, they blame the evil killer rather than their participation in the game.<br/><br/>The fights involve hitting and kicking each other. These blows have absolutely no effect on the opponent, even when endlessly repeated.<br/><br/>There one fight scene in a restaurant and one in a tree canopy that shows more imagination. I found it hard to keep track of who was fighting who and why.<br/><br/>There is a bit of comic relief, reminiscent of The Taming of the Shrew between a handsome, good-hearted, desert-dwelling falconer and a pretty young woman who preferred adventure to a stifling life in an arranged marriage.<br/><br/>The majority of the fighters are female. I think at least one of them was over 40 and another over 60. They were fully athletic. I expected the fighting to limit actors to their early 20s.<br/><br/>Others have recommended this movie. They must have a much higher tolerance for repetition than have I. <br/><br/>It is in Chinese, with English subtitles. In one scene, a character is surprised that the ""Jade Fox"" villain is female. This seems odd because they have been referred to her as ""she"" in the subtitles. In Chinese, they use the same pronoun for he and she, so that pronoun did not give her gender away."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","3","19 July 2013"," Nothing cheap but everything deeply Biddhist and spiritual
","This is a magical film and the magic of it is so purely Chinese and so purely Mental that we do not even have any problem entering it and believing it. It is the story of a very special sword from very ancient China, a sword that carries fate and destiny in it for the person who controls it, because it is not enough to own it, you must control it and when you control it, it controls you. That sword is stolen and tamed by a young woman who is to marry some nobleman though long before she was both abducted and saved by a wild young man roaming in the mountains and distant deserts, far from everything. They fell in love after much fighting.<br/><br/>When her marriage arrives, the young man comes to Beijing to claim the young woman but that is impossible because her father is the governor. So he manages to escape and she decides to steal the sword and to go after him. The story becomes complicated then and yet very simple. She is in love with a middle-age woman she calls her sister and who was the owner of the sword. Hence a rivalry for who will control it develops. That middle-age woman was in love with a man her age who was in love with her but both could not go through their love for various honorable reasons, for various pledges they had taken to their masters, the woman her fighting master, the man his Buddhist spiritual master.<br/><br/>These two go after the escaping girl and finally find her in the hands of a witch who has drugged her. They bring her back to consciousness but the witch comes back from some errand and the fight will poison the man and the witch with the witch's poisoned darts. Then the younger woman learns from the middle-age woman where the young man she loves is and she goes there to meet him, to share her love with him one single night and then escape anew in the most Buddhist way possible by flying into the mountain mist and finding enlightenment and merging with the cosmic energy of the mountains. The young man will remain behind and mourn her forever. <br/><br/>A love story film with two love stories crossing and in both cases love can be at most exchanged for a very short period of time because of full dedication to a wider and deeper objective, be it the loyalty to a sword and a martial art, or be it a Buddhist pledge to reach enlightenment. In both cases attachment is impossible, love is possible but cannot become an attachment, hence a permanent relation. Everything is impermanent and has to be impermanent not to enslave the person on the way to mental and spiritual liberation. <br/><br/>I just wonder though if that attachment to these principles is not an excessive attachment too and hence a blocking element on the path to ""nibbana"" with a trace of Tibetan Buddhism with the middle-age man who dies in the arms of the middle-age woman he has loved all his life without ever saying so: he declares his love before dying which becomes a blocking element on the path to his liberation and he knows it and chooses at this moment to be a ghost caught between the world of the living and the world of the dead, unable to escape this state till at last a rebirth, a reincarnation makes him a man again for him to have a second chance to reach ""nibbana"", enlightenment.<br/><br/>The beauty of the film is in the spectacular landscapes and mountain scenery, in the extreme power of the mental and spiritual sentiments and even passions, in the depth and faithfulness of their love and their friendship, and the impossible merging of this with Buddhism and martial arts that both require a pledge to total detachment and absolute dedication to a spiritual ideal.<br/><br/>This film has to be enjoyed like some extreme elixir from the most refined and intense essences and liquors. Then flying will become natural and the battle in the bamboo copses or groves will be a fairy show of intemporal human luxuriance. <br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","I was absolutely mesmerised by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Everything about it is breathtaking, it is nothing short of a poetic, visually gorgeous martial arts masterpiece. As much as I did love Brokeback Mountain, I think this is Ang Lee's best film. Speaking of Lee, he is a fine director, and does a superb job with his direction on this film. The story is easy to follow, but there is also a certain complexity to it as it explores the perennial themes of love, loyalty, duty and sacrifice, while the script is wonderfully poetic and the pace rarely lags.<br/><br/>The characters are also hugely credible. They could have been clichéd easily, but actually they have surprisingly so much depth to them and at the end you admire them. The visuals, music, stunt work and acting are what really impress though. The film looks gorgeous, all Ang Lee's films look beautiful but this gets my vote as his most visually stunning. The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenery and costumes are exquisite. The stunt work is brilliantly choreographed and the special effects actually enhance rather than distract. The music is just gorgeous, there were a few scenes where I was reduced to tears. And there are many memorable scenes especially the jaw-dropping rooftop pursuit and tree top battle. As for the acting, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh both excel, and I was surprised in a very good way by Zhang Ziyi who is electrifying as the teenage thief.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a breathtaking film and a must see for anyone who loves martial arts or visually stunning movies especially. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon--A beautiful movie that will captivate its viewers...An Wu Xia film that is filled with love and romance.<br/><br/>Li Mu Bai(Chow Yun Fatt) is a legendary warrior in the show whose skills are incomparable. Shu Lian( Michelle Yeoh) is his friend. Both of them love each other with all their heart, yet, because of their pursuit of justice and peace, they do not make their love open to each other despite knowing how deep they each love each other. Yet, their love is true and some may say everlasting. Through the show, viewers can feel their love but yet, it pains them to watch these two warriors keep their feeling hidden despite their desire to marry each other. At the end of the film, as Li Mu Bai dies, he finally tells Shu Xian that he had always loved her. As she cradles him in her arms, he says that he will not use his last breath to meditate to leave this earth because he wants to follow her when he is a spirit, because her love will not make him lonely. That, is the most touching scene of the show. Even through death, their love shall not cease, because the love that binds them together is true and pure.<br/><br/>Their relationship not only adds a new face to Wu xia films but also touches viewers's hearts.<br/><br/>Jen( Zhang Zi Yi) a aristocrat who is the secret disciple of the notorious Jade Fox brings something more to this film. It shows the story of a girl who self learned the Wu Dan manual and wanted something extrodianary and exciting in her life. Going to be married to someone she did not love, she feels that soon her freedom will be gone, so she steals Li Mu Bai's sword for fun an also returns it later. But after a while, she is caught in a situation which is much more serious. She finally reveals to Jade Fox what she had kept from her. She had kept the secret of the Wu Dan manual to herself so as Jade Fox would not improve, causing her governess to hate her. Yet, through the show, no matter how much trouble Jen causes, viewers can feel her confusion. She is torn between Li Mu Bai and Jade Fox as she can choose to follow one. In the end, she follows her own path and is saved by Li Mu Bai, but he dies. Seeing all this, she becomes good and travels to the Wu Dan mountain where her true lover was. There, she jumped down the mountain, fulfilling a legend about -a man who jumped down a mountain to get his wish to come true..the wish she had was not hers but her lovers, and she floated away.....<br/><br/>Her story shows how from and innocent girl, she learns the ways of a warrior and turns from bad to good. In the end, she freed herself from all hurt and sorrow, by fulfilling her lover's wish.<br/><br/>This movie is a movie that words cannot describe. What I have said is not good enough to describe it. The only way to feel and understand the emotions of the show is to watch it. It will carve a way through the hardest of hearts and will leave you mystified at the beautiful show. 10/10 is my grade."

It goes beyond many other action movies and has deep touch of the principle, morality and philosophy of Chinese Kung-fu. CTHD has sent us the message that gaining superior strength and power like kung-fu is important but how to use the power is far more important. <br/><br/>It is not easy to produce a film that can not only deliver aesthetic entertainment but also provide room for audience to give deep thought about the nature of human being and their activities.

","As a child I loved to watch martial arts films (particularly Bruce Lee films).  As I got older my tastes changed and the ""silliness/campiness"" of some of these films became more and more apparent. However, part of me was still looking for a film which would not only resurrect my youthful thrill of martial arts but would also encompass an equally engaging story.  From all the hype that CTHD had generated I thought that this could possibly be it.<br/><br/>I would have loved this film back in 1973 but for all the wrong reasons. Today however it felt like a better than average film with some incredible martial arts scenes.  I enjoyed the dreamlike feeling that let you become part of a world where flying, tree climbing,  roof top warriors existed and where honor and dignity were virtues we could all believe in once again. However the quality that all great films must have comes down to a great story and equally great performances.  Around all the visual beauty and martial arts mastery the overall story of CTHD was .. well..  just OK. That's the biggest shame of this film.  It missed this key ingredient and unfortunately ends up being a forgettable film.<br/><br/>The performances were generally very good (especially for this genre) yet no amount of acting can elevate a mediocre story to greatness.

Unfortunately this motion picture were not playing in our cinemas, so at the time when I see it at my home VCR it has already won 4 Oscars. As I have expected before buying, it would be an action with some dose of drama. Well, I must tell you that after seeing first 30 minutes of this movie I have been almost disappointed. Of course I admit that these fighting scenes are more than revolutionary, but there is that dramatically fullness what I have hope for? And in the end - is this movie worth that Oscars?  Thanks God, the second part of it proved that Crouching Tiger worth every Oscar of 2001's ceremony! Exception : Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat. Their weak performance is the only reason why I give it 9 out of 10. Because of them this movie has not become a masterpiece. I'm truly sorry  That was a negative side. Here is a positive : Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen are one of the best screen couples in the history ! Tan Dun's music is clear magic ! Peter Pau's cinematography is like a wonderful dream ! Ang Lee's directing is excellent ! The ending sequence is really heartbreaking! All this things make me to watch this film again and again so I have see it more than 15 times. It happens with me very seldom, actually only few movies make me so exciting , so if you like Crouching Tiger I can recommend them to you .

"Spleen","5","2","3","25 June 2001"," Good - probably seems better than it is because we are so desperate for quality these days
","I appreciate the beauty of Lee's film.  I also appreciate the way he can keep his characters defying gravity, throughout the film, without the effect ever becoming stale.  Break the film down into its components and all seems good: photography, acting, music, story ... so why does it not even come close to the mythic loveliness of, say, ""Star Wars""?  I don't know.  Two things bothered me towards the end... ... which means that I'm about to reveal something... ... spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>(1)  Li ought not to have died.  If Yu Jen had arrived in time to save his life, she would have succeeded in undoing some of the harm she had caused, and her repentance would have been less empty: she would have been able, by making a concrete gesture, to join the side of the angels.  Instead she does no good at all and merely feels remorse.  As a result everything after Li's death is anticlimax.  Yu Jen performs what I take to be the Eastern equivalent of becoming a nun, by running away to Wudan mountain, meeting a former lover who no longer matters to us any more than he does to her, then renouncing the world by leaping into a chasm.  Maybe Ang Lee's retreat into mystic tragedy would have worked if he had been sincere about.  Somehow it felt forced.<br/><br/>(2)  This is not so much a problem with the ending as something Ang Lee ought to have cleared up at some point or other.  Jade Fox had some kind of grievance against the house of Wudan.  What was it?  We're told in a single line of dialogue that she was annoyed because Li's master had refused to train her, but this seems thin to me, especially since his decision was so clearly justified: training Jade Fox in the martial arts would be like handing an axe to a mentally unstable religious fanatic; besides, I presume that nobody is ENTITLED to be trained.  How much richer the film would have been had the house of Wudan REALLY wronged Jade Fox in the distant past, so that although her subsequent actions were completely unjustified, they were at least provoked by an initial wrong committed by someone other than herself.  -At any rate, I wanted to hear more about the nature of Fox's grievance, and whether it was justified. ...I don't want to sound sour.  It's still a beautiful film, the only thing wrong with it being that it doesn't reach the heights it is so clearly reaching for, most likely because Lee just isn't suited to epics.  ""Eat Man Drink Woman"" and ""The Ice Storm"" - that's the kind of thing he does well."

In my opinion this movie had deserved the oscar for best film instead of Gladiator, but Hollywood seems to be unable to acknowledge foreign genius in moviemaking. On the surface, the film deals with two warriors (a man and a woman) trying to recapture a stolen sword. But at the heart of it lie two tragic love stories who give this movie substance besides the amazingly directed action sequences. Those viewers who disliked the actors flying irrealisticly around and performing physically impossible things, like walking on water have not understood the essence of the movie.

","18th Century Qing dynasty, China. A sprawling blank canvas perpetuates the endless perimeters of the fictitious Wudang Sect. The paintbrush of fate, an instrument for creativity, dipped in blank ink. A sword dripping with viscous blood. Broad strokes are set in motion, where application and tool combine. ""Calligraphy is similar to fencing"", remarks Shu Lien as she subtly interrogates an aristocratic thief shackled by the restrictions of Chinese bureaucracy. ""Fighters have rules too. Friendship, trust, integrity. Always keep your promise. Without rules we wouldn't survive long"". The expressionless material perched on the silky cloth of privilege, now a vast illustration of loyalty and respect.<br/><br/>Painting the destinies of its repressed characters. An accomplished Wudang swordsman, Mu Bai, suppressing his endearing love for Shu Lien out of loyalty for his recently deceased friend whom she was engaged to. Jen, the daughter of a rich and powerful governor, chosen to marry on their behalf, denying her true feelings for a reclusive bandit named ""Dark Cloud"". ""To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger"". A sentiment that director Lee nestled in the heart of Hollywood's introduction to the lyrical beauty of wuxia.<br/><br/>To some, Crouching Tiger is a martial arts extravaganza boasting expertly choreographed fight sequences and mystical wire work. Yet, it is infinitely more detailed than a superfluous action blockbuster. At its core, beneath Pau's exquisite cinematography and Dun's traditionally authentic score, is a love story. A tale that masterfully exploits the limitations of its archaic dynasty to sentimentalise a modern affair. Revolving around the ""Green Destiny"", a mighty sword capable of obliterating the opponent's arsenal of weaponry with one swipe, the ornately implemented characters explore the struggles of power. Acting as a plot device to represent strength without control, ""Green Destiny"" is seen stolen on multiple occasions by a thief seemingly known to be the ""Jade Fox"". Lee invests plenty of narrative hold in the bulk of Dulu's novel, circumnavigating the history behind each character. But it's what he implicitly presents within the primary story that truly elevates the onscreen poetry.<br/><br/>A striking progression for the sub-genre is the representation of women, depicting prominent martial arts styles to have been originated by females. Four of the five extensive fight sequences feature either Jen, Shu Lien or both, cementing their physical presence within the narrative. The weaponised duel between the two, a scene that sits amongst the very best in cinematic history, represents a battle for superiority. To assert methodical dominance, regardless of the instrumental tool of destruction. Notably, each choreographed sequence resembled a dance more than a raucous brawl, stipulating each move as a meticulous action for greater meaning.<br/><br/>There is an infectious artistry that resides within the choreography, and the metrical screenplay that garnishes its love story. A script that heavily implies the obligations between a student and teacher, exploring the conflict and responsibility between the two. Jen and Jade Fox illustrating the exploitation of subordination when the student's limitless potential surpasses that of the teacher. Other prominent thematic strands, including gender reversal and the cowardly usage of poison, supply Crouching Tiger with a near infinite amount of angles to perceive its contents. A truly rare example where film is translated as art.<br/><br/>Bolstering stoic yet sensual performances from all cast members. Yun-fat and Yeoh expertly conveying the emotional repression hidden within, with loyalty controlling their feelings, making their climactic scenes extraordinarily palpable. Ziyi embodying the tenacity of a naive inexperienced student whom exerts limitless potential. The only noticeable criticism that prevents Crouching Tiger from acquiring a perfect rating, is the substantial pacing issue when Jen's flashback of meeting Dark Cloud in the desert comes to fruition. It is haphazardly edited in and nearly detracts from the present story due to its elongated length.<br/><br/>Regardless, the segment does not detract from Crouching Tiger's artistry. An accessible beauty for those uninitiated with the wuxia sub-genre, and a romance tale that avoids all clichés. The only fitting sentence to conclude this review, is with a personal favourite quote. ""Even if I was banished to the darkest place, my love will never let me be a lonely spirit. I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit""."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, often cited as one of the greatest of its genre, was directed by Ang Lee.

He was apparently content to make this one masterpiece, studying the intricacies of its genre, and then move to other projects, other ideas.<br/><br/>And we thank him for this one. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wuxia film in its purest form. It's a film about mythical China, where great martial artists walk the Earth and clash against one another.

Where swords are mighty, but in the end it's the hands that wield them that matter.<br/><br/>It's a sprawling tale, full of turns, characters and locations. As much of an epic as anything the West has produced in Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur, albeit not taking as much time in-universe. Yet there's weight to the world. The sheer beauty of the production of course helps, but it's also entrenched in culture and history. I don't know enough about Chinese history to comment the accurateness of the film's look, but I can safely say that this is the film I think about whenever this period of time in Chinese history is mentioned. It's that iconic.<br/><br/>And of course it has a well-earned reputation as one of the best martial arts films ever made. Sure, some of the fight scenes are pretty out there, jumping from one bamboo branch to another, but the fact that the actors performed most of their own stunts and that the wire work on display is so well-made, gives it heft. And there are some truly great battle scenes happening on the ground where you can feel every blow, grit your teeth with every near miss and gasp in pain whenever a hit is scored. The fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi in the dojo is especially noteworthy in this regard. Still one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even after all these years.<br/><br/>One of those rare action films that have a definite serenity to them. A film only two hours long, yet telling a story most TV series would struggle to fit into a season. And making it look breezy and effortless. Easily one of Ang Lee's best and one of those film I can easily name a masterpiece."

","A film that captures the spirit of young women perfectly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon represents a psychological war between egotistical grandiosity, true emotion and simple common sense. The most notable moral is that of virtue: Honor, integrity, loyalty - why does society hold sacred principles of character? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a crippling postmortem on the consequences of delusional narcissism, the expectation of unearned respect and the complete avoidance of personal responsibility; As far as audiences are concerned, it may function as a poignant ""period drama"" case study on why people value peace, civility and honesty."

","It seems like every day, there is another report about how China is passing the US in terms of pure box office numbers. This often concerns me. Not because I'm xenophobic or even because I am just patriotic and want my country to be the best in everything. But because the Chinese tastes in my opinion are a bit... underdeveloped. Say what you want about the tastes of the U.S., but at least we only spent a bit less than 250 million on the (shudder) 4th Transformers movie (or Trans4mers, if you prefer) instead of letting it become the highest grossing film in our country to that point, as did the Chinese.<br/><br/>Their tendency to devour trash, both exotic and local, is troubling. I am worried. ...And I would be a lot less worried if China offered up a film this good at least once every year.<br/><br/>You could argue that this is not entirely a Chinese film, but that would open up a whole other can of worms that I don't want to touch as of no. So instead, I will go into this film.<br/><br/>Calling from both the future and the past, using techniques both old and new, this film creates a mystical, almost knowingly surreal environment, then fills it with all sorts of action and story. I would put this film on the list of those that you don't watch as much as experience, which is always a good place to be.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, the protagonist and a majority of the main cast is female, a rarity in films from the West and (perhaps particularly) the East. That in itself is interesting, offering different dynamics and points of view than could be done with the traditional Enter the Dragon sort of martial arts film.<br/><br/>Going further, one could almost think that the 'different dynamics and points of view' thing is almost this film's M.O. In a lot of ways, it deconstructs and reconstructs a lot of martial arts tropes. There is never a doubt that this is through and through a wuxia film. But it does not stop and take pictures at each of the typical tropes. It weaves through them with style and grace to create something special, something that is the clear work of a true artist. It is as if someone took the pieces in a tiger puzzle and used them to create a dragon.<br/><br/>There are many lenses through which you can look at this film. Artistic. Historical. Poetic. Symbolic. Even philosophical. But no matter which you choose, you cannot deny that this film is a masterpiece. It does not content itself with the easy or the simple or the standard. It goes all out, as if seeing the horizon of greatness and blazing its own path through it.<br/><br/>Perhaps what I find most fascinating about this film is how it refuses to stay within the realms of reality. Many martial arts movie prefer to stay grounded even as their mains perform superhuman feats. Not this one. This one is entrenched more in the art and heart of a fable or legend than any corner of reality. Take the jumps for instance. Most movies, though their characters jump ridiculously long distances, at least make it look like they are actually jumping. But this film makes it clear that they are gliding through the airs of their world, unbounded by the forces of gravity. And the film is better for it.<br/><br/>From a subjective standpoint, I love that the movie is Eastern from surface to core. This is a fully fledged representation of the culture of a nation. If China had to pick one film to represent itself, I think it should be this one. (If you're wondering which one I would choose for America, it would be The Godfather.) Like Ang Lee's other masterpiece, The Life of Pi, this film immerses you in its culture, in its stylings, wearing them proudly.<br/><br/>This film is stunning; a must-watch. The soundtrack is ethereal and dynamic. The cinematography is unique and top class.The story is deep, carrying much gravitas. The acting is solid and assured. The tone is dark yet artistic and hopeful.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence in the film is a flashback sequence to the desert. I won't spoil what it's about narratively, but it is stylistically stunning. Tonally, it is presented the way a flashback should be presented but almost never ends. It seems like some sort of warped daydream; real yet almost unbelievable and captivating for it. Spiral steadily on and on it does. Fifteen minutes pass. Twenty. You keep waiting for it to be over. But it isn't yet. And for that you are glad. It comforts the highest reaches of your mind and senses. And it is this movie in a nutshell."

","Minor spoilers will be announced before they occur.<br/><br/>Celebrated as one of the best movies of all time I was always baffled by the success and universal acclaim of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. With the exception of the magnificent Eat Drink Man Woman and the fairy tale Life of Pi his body of work has always left me strangely cold so I was quick to suspect my distaste for Ang's body of work had tainted my view of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and a fan might come to the same conclusion judging by my score, but please note that I judge movies solely on their own values, the word ""overrated"" won't appear here.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, starring Hongkong super stars Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, belongs to the WuXia genre, the Chinese sword-fighting epics that mainly blossomed in the 60s and 70s. Ang Lee, a lifelong fan of this genre, made it his main mission to erect it a modern cinematic monument (basically what Tarantino does with all of his movies) and spawned a new breed of modern WuXia movies like Zhang Yimou's Hero or so it seems. The story is fairly standard: love, betrayal, honor, duty and the conflicts that arise when these factors intermingle, sprinkled with some light philosophical undertones, OK fight choreography and pretty photography. The success in the west was massive, critics and moviegoers alike praised Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as the best thing since sliced bread. Hype always makes me suspicious but I'm mature enough to not let that cloud my judgment and I got excited. Unfortunately I was let down on every level.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (shortened to ""Tiger & Dragon"" in Germany) is just not a very good movie. The plot is painfully standard, the acting is surprisingly wooden, given the talents of everyone involved, the fight choreography is not very creative or exciting and the images aren't strong enough to hold the movie on their own.<br/><br/>(a little spoiler here) The only part I thoroughly enjoyed was the fight in the teahouse. Everything else, especially the dull and unnecessary desert episode left me clamoring for the movie that critics and friends had promised me. (/spoiler)<br/><br/>I have seen the movie several times now and despite the aforementioned scene I find nothing remarkable about it. It's not horrible and I can see how someone with no prior experience with Chinese Cinema would be fascinated by the Wire-Fu displayed, but that is the main crux now, isn't it? Western audiences usually have no knowledge of Asian cinema and saw many tired tropes for the first time in Ang Lee's Wu Xia attempt, mistaking them for brilliance. Absolutely every aspect of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has been done a lot better in countless other movies, from King Hu's A Touch of Zen and Dragon Gate Inn (and its remake by Tsui Hark) to the more modern Swordsman 2, Tai Chi, Wing Chun, just to name a few.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is awful, it's just unremarkable in every aspect and wastes the talents of Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh. I really wanted to like it but I can't fool myself."

","It's taken me this long to finally watch this. Oh, I've known about it for like a decade, but only now that I am in love with Ang Lee did I finally seek it out. What a fantastic film. Lee is the master here, his directing giving us some of the finest fighting sequences I think I have ever seen. The story is solid, as is the writing, but it's Ang Lee's vision and beautiful markings behind the camera that give this that extra boost. It's a truly fantastic experience, mesmerizing and captivating. And because I haven't seen any of the other martial arts fantasies that have come out because of this, it's pretty original in the films I've seen."

But I believe that it was the love story between the main characters and how it unfolded so tragically in the end that made it such a success to audiences around the world.<br/><br/>Ang Lee and his team did a wonderful job in subjugating the viewers with adrenalin pumping action in the struggle between good and evil while at the same time slowly and quietly reminding the audience that the real battle was the struggle of the heart. The audience realizing the fact towards the end of the film when all the characters suffered a broken heart including the villain. Its such a tragic movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie for the action but most of all for the love story."
"kingtype","7","1","1","25 July 2012"," Classic........
","According to the hype around Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, its creators have produced a miracle: a kung fu crossover hit, simultaneously a substantial foreign language drama for discerning art house audiences and the greatest martial arts movie of all time. Although Crouching Tiger falls short of such (probably unattainable) perfection, it is enormously fun, and manages to be one of the more interesting films of recent years. Whatever its flaws, it is also a rare example of fearless yet thoughtful experimentation by veteran filmmakers, in this case Ang Lee and James Schamus, who have previously collaborated on films in both Taiwan and the United States, including Eat Drink Man Woman and The Ice Storm.<br/><br/>Though nominally set in the Qing dynasty, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is loosely based in a Chinese martial arts movie tradition that pits outlaws against heroes in a timeless ""long ago"" analogous to the American cinematic Old West. The Wuxia, warrior figures who embody honor, loyalty, and an individual sense of justice, can be compared to the white-hat guys; Wuxia stories gave rise to what Ang Lee has called ""a mythical, larger-than-life hero in the Chinese imagination,"" and an equally powerful myth of the Giang Hu world, an imagined ""Wild West"" underworld or outland, inhabited by the Wuxia and governed primarily by their noble ideals, with little regard for conventional mores.).<br/><br/>Basing the screenplay on a series of novels by early 20th century novelist Wang Du Lu, Lee and co-writer Schamus people the simplistic Giang Hu world with complex characters whose actions result from a murky grapple with the tension between their needs as human beings and the demands that the Giang Hu world, as lived or imagined, place upon them. As the film opens, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), the greatest swordsman in China and famed disciple of the Wudan martial arts system, has realized that the years spent fighting outlaws and striving for enlightenment have left him lonely and unhappy. He is on the verge of renouncing his life as a warrior to try to find happiness with his beloved friend and former comrade-in-arms Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). As the film opens, he commits to the custody of longtime friend Sir Te his legendary sword, the beautiful, invincible Green Destiny, and is on the point of proposing to Shu Lien, who clearly shares his feelings, that they make a life together.<br/><br/>His plans are interrupted by the reappearance of old foe Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who betrayed and murdered Mu Bai's master and stole the secret manual of Wudan's techniques. Resurfacing in Beijing, Jade Fox has become the governess of Yu Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), the daughter of a prominent government official. Slated for a loveless political marriage, Jen longs for any escape-into the remote deserts of her former home province; into an imagined world based on adventure tales, drawn from the real lives of warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien; into the arms of her secret love, a dashing barbarian bandit named Lo (Chang Chen).<br/><br/>Her secret restlessness makes her vulnerable to manipulation by Jade Fox, but what makes her dangerous is her other secret: she is a martial arts prodigy of enormous potential. Half-trained by Jade Fox using the stolen Wudan manual, Jen has much of the technique but none of the Taoist philosophy; but even in this state she is a match for our heroes. Fascinated by the Giang Hu world (and her taste of it in her interlude with Lo), inspired by meeting Shu Lien, tempted by the now-idle Green Destiny, and poisoned by the influence of Jade Fox, Jen is a loose cannon, a menace to all those around her.<br/><br/>Li Mu Bai, the embodiment of the Wuxia ideal, naturally wants revenge upon Jade Fox for her crimes against his master and his school; more than this, though, he wishes to take Jen as disciple to be Wudan's first female student - largely because without Wudan discipline she will surely become a villain far worse than her mistress. Shu Lien also comes to feel a sisterly affection for the young prodigy. Setting aside their personal needs, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien take on Jade Fox in a struggle over the girl's fate, as the chaos swirling around her threatens to ensnare them all.<br/><br/>True to its title, which names the animal pair most commonly representative of the contradictory and complementary principles of yin and yang in Taoist and Buddhist symbolism, the movie concentrates on the interaction of opposing forces. The consequences of impetuously pursuing one's desires contrast with the loss and regret that are the reverse of restraint and duty. The naive certainty of youth is weighed against the ambiguities of maturity. Jen's coming of age is juxtaposed against the mid-life conflict within Li Mu Bai. All of the main characters much decide when to fight to control their lives and when to acquiesce before forces that cannot be altered.<br/><br/>The actors are well cast, and director Ang Lee coaxes great performances from most of them. As Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Chow and Yeoh smolder with their characters' repressed passions. The actors incorporate the spirit of swordplay in their performances and alternate between slow, taut exchanges and lightning flashes of intense emotion. They likewise maintain character through their fighting sequences, in which Yeoh's Shu Lien moves with confident virtuosity, and Chow's Li Mu Bai, the accomplished master, needs to use only the sparest, most efficient techniques. These megastar veterans of Hong Kong and Hollywood fearlessly play up their maturity, imbuing their performances with an exquisite sense of loss; the curious result is that they have never seemed sexier."

","""Crouching Tiger"" is an excellent film, with a story line that is quite complicated partly because it involves the lives of many characters and until the end of the movie you keep asking yourself if you understood everything or missed something from the plot. I won't describe it here partly because it would spoil the fun of future viewers and partly because it would take too much time and space. In my opinion the great quality of this movie are its characters. If you watch it closely you'll notice that although it deals a lot in a fantastic environment the characters are very realistic. There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is in a particular position because of his/her past and experience. i believe that all the actors do their best and the result is more than satisfying.<br/><br/>The other strong point of this movie is the relationships between the characters. Love, hate, friendship, abandonment and rejection continually change places and mark the lives of all the heroes. It could be a love story but as it often happens in real life true love is most of the times hidden and silent. This movie also treats death as a form of catharsis and redemption, the way most great tragedies do.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the fight scenes. I thought so. I won't say anything about them because i believe that people should see this movie for the movie and not for the fx.<br/><br/>Someone said that if this was a Hollywood movie everyone would be ranting against it. I would like to add that if this was a Hollywood movie : firstly it would have won the Oscar and secondly it wouldn't have captured the true eastern philosophy. It would turn out to be another martial-arts-great-sfx-but-no-meaning movie and i think that ""Wo hu zang long"" is a lot more that that. And personally i like when movies like this never win in the Oscars because quality and emotions can never be measured with prizes. Just see the movie and learn to respect your emotions."

The sword fight between Yeoh and Zhang's characters is an amazing fight scene, definitely one of the best in a martial arts film involving only female actors. It was one of the first movies produced in Asia to be both a box office hit and a critical success at the same time. With the great visuals and cinematography it's one of the most beautiful movies on film IMO. The action doesn't lack in it's own regard either with the stunt team from The Matrix movies involved with this film.

","Or if you think that people flying while they fight are funny, don't watch this movie with people who take this seriously. It was really hard to concentrate on the movie, while I was in a cinema watching it, because many people just started laughing every time they saw people jumping around (on houses or over them). It seems strange that most of them would accept the same style in a western movie which came out 1999 (I will not name the movie, so I won't spoiler it for you, though I'm pretty sure, most of you will know which movie I mean), but couldn't bare to see it in HK movie, just because this one was based in reality?<br/><br/>But enough about that, there is more to be said about the movie here too. About the fine acting, about the story that evolves through the fighting ... which means, the fight scenes are not just some stunt action scenes, they do tell you a lot about the story. That is because they are choreographed to keep building up the story or concluding it. There is one moment, where the movie takes a deep breath (in other words it feels like it does full stop), but other than that, the flow is extra ordinarily good! <br/><br/>If you like a little fantasy with your martial arts mixed with a strong story and a good cast, then you don't have to look further!"

Wo hu cang long (Crouching tiger, Hidden dragon) was very disliked by me when I went to see it at the theatre.  Luckily, I had a date with me who liked some special effects, martial arts, and loved romance otherwise I might have walked out disappointed by the slowness of the plot revolution.  Even though my date agreed to go see this movie, she knew nothing of it other than it was a romantic movie, in spite of my erroneous negativity about her ""supposed"" ignorance she was far more right than I.  In my case I was anxious to see an Ang Lee martial arts fest.  This movie changed my perceptions and changes with a person.  After nearly four years since seeing the movie for the first time, I must say it fits far more moods of my home DVD movie watching experiences than any other.  This movie also can sufice numerous moods of my spouse, young sons, and mine at the same time creating family unity as well. Crouching Tiger is not my favorite movie, not even my top ten. However, I am hard pressed since or before this release to find a movie of such beauty, action, romance, sorrow, and betrayal contained all in one done to perfection which does make it the most versatile movie for any occasion."

Fifty years from now, Gladiator, Erin Brokovich, and Traffic will be interesting footnotes on the Classic Movie channel, while Crouching Tiger will still be taught at film schools, and shown to young college students to open their eyes to a classic piece of art, the way that Kurosowa's films did in the '70s, the '80s, and even today."

Whilst the two polar camps of lovers and haters are present as they are on many films, I can't believe the number of differing directions the hate is coming from. From the cheated actioneers, to the Asian weirdness lot, to the HK seen it all before and better, to the affronted at the over-reaction of Western critics.  <br/><br/>OK, cards on the table.  I'm not a big fan of HK cinema, although that may because of my under-exposure to it. I think this film is beautiful and touching.  I think the plot is a little hackneyed.

I think that this film has many Western elements and many Eastern elements to it.  I think the problem that a lot of people are having is reconciling this melange with their own experience of cinema and storytelling.  I have no truck with people who want action and get disappointed when all the lovey stuff begins.<br/><br/>From a Western perspective, I'd like to lump this film in with Moulin Rouge. It's not to everyone's taste and it may affront those who are familiar with the setting and sensibilities of the era/genre in which it is set.  It is a simple story wonderfully and beautifully told.  The film has a heart (as well as wonderful cinematography, choreography and music) and that is what those who have place this film so highly in the top 250 are responding to. <br/><br/>
There is a nasty undertone of cultural imperialism here that I don't think belongs.  There are films where history is altered, liberties are taken with cherished cultures by outsiders, people and places and ideas are falsely associated with nations and tribes, and all of these are done in the name of entertainment and profit.  This isn't one of them. <br/><br/>This film, I believe, was an attempt to marry two different cinemas. Whether this has been successful or not is for everyone to judge themselves. Personally I love it."
"frickinchickin","9","1","1","10 November 2002"," A Stand-Out Example of Wuxia in America
","I'll start with the action, which is a minor controversy among people unfamiliar with the Chinese wuxia genre. Martial arts ballet is very common among these films. While this is not the first movie to use it, it is one of the few movies where it fits so well. It layers seriousness when Jen Yu and Shu Lien fight in the dojo; and it adds a lightheartedness when Li Mu Bai fights Jen Yu in the bamboo forest, as if he is toying with her; and it adds comedy when Jen Yu takes on the men in the restaurant. It's kind of an artform. It doesn't matter that it can't happen in real life; if anything, the unbelievability of these scenes makes them exciting to watch. It is, after all, a fictional story. Don't expect everything to be believable.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy element of the film which makes this movie a cut above is the acting. There is not a single actor in this movie that did not inhabit his character. Zhang Ziyi, the main character (though Chow Yun Fat mistakingly gets first billing), pulls together the role of a selfish aristocrat's daughter, unfaithful more to those closest to her than anyone else. She also creates good chemistry with many of the other actors in the film, especially Cheng Pei Pei. Chow Yun Fat also does well, even if he was stiff as Val Kilmer. Michelle Yeoh, who acted surprisingly well considering her staple as an action star and despite the poor Mandarin accent, did well to raise the bar, and captured the love-hate relationship between her and Zhang Ziyi's characters. Chow Yun Fat didn't do too well with the fake accent either, but still, the acting was well done. Even the smaller roles--such as Cheng Pei Pei as Jade Fox, Gao Xian as Bo, or Lung Sihung as Sir Te--were amazing. Cheng Pei Pei really made herself a powerful force She may not have been on screen often, but her character, who ties the stories together, is such a presence. Considering the astute use of gesture, it can't be said that this movie had acting that was anything less than amazing.<br/><br/>However, the score especially stands out as incomparable. The constant use of string instruments and drum beats is fitting for the action. But what was especially interesting about this score is that a separate theme is composed for each individual relationship: one for Jen Yu and Lo, one for Jen Yu and Shu Lien, etc. You'd think this would be common sense, and many other composers would follow suit, but strangely enough, this doesn't happen often. The only mistakes Tan Dun made were writing the excruciating Coco Lee love ballad ""A Love Before Time--striving to mirror the success of ""My Heart Will Go On""--as well as plagiarizing his own score when composing for Zhang Yimou's Hero.<br/><br/>After examining all of that, it is not an overstatement to say that this movie is, by far, one of the greater movies ever made. Ang Lee accomplished his goal of directing a story that would capture the aesthetics of China, utilizing powerful female roles and revolutionizing the American viewpoint of wuxia films. Both the visual and literary elements of the film meld together and create something on a level of its own."

","I loved this movie when I saw it the first time. I thought it was a very well made movie and don't agree with a number of -ve comments posted here.<br/><br/>And I can imagine why some people didn't like the fact that people could fly in this movie. Some have said that its far from reality. Well, I would just say one thing to them - if you care so much about reality why watch a movie. Why not go watch a documentary or even better go watch a baseball game. If you want reality. You need to have a little bit of imagination and use it to believe that its possible to fly when one reaches a certain level of mastery. Ok now that we have gotten that out of the way...<br/><br/>The story was gripping, the pace good, the martial arts sequences exquisite, the photography fantastic (I especially loved the shots of the desert and the mountains) and direction just superb.

"dont_b_so_BBC","10","1","1","1 September 2002"," Same movie, different audiences
","This is a response to all the HATE-reviews I've read/heard about ""crouching tiger"". As I'm personally quite crazy about ""crouching tiger""-- it upset me initially to know that some people dont think much of the movie. But I thought about it and came to 2 possible conclusions: either the movie we each saw as ""crouching tiger"" was not the same movie OR each of us who watch the movie was different.<br/><br/>Well, apart from some dubbing and the size of the screen (home/theatre), I'm quite sure we all saw the same movie. However, what each of use wanted to see in a movie or in ""crouching tiger"" is probably quite different. So, without using any big words or labels, these are the things I LOVE about ""crouching tiger"":-<br/><br/>1) Michelle Yeoh. She is not at her most beautiful here (she's suppose to be a middle-aged woman) but I found the firm but gentle demeanour she portrayed here full of grace and wisdom. Okay x 2, I'm a fan.<br/><br/>2) The ""Flying"". To me, this is exactly how the ""lightening skills"" dreamed up by martial arts novelists should be portrayed. Quiet and effortless. It also helped that the cameraman was strung up on a wire to chase the ""flying"" actors - I felt like I was flying with them.<br/><br/>3) The Cinematography. I'm not just talking about the mountains and the desert-but also the 2 CGIs shots of old Beijing in daytime and at night. The various sets/buildings used/created felt old and lived in to me and there is what I would call the general ""water-colour"" feel of the movie. BTW, I like Chinese ink-paintings.<br/><br/>4) The Story/Directing. The story is extremely old-fashioned (the book that the movie was based on has been around for decades) but the way it was developed in the movie allowed me to empathise with characters. But I can understand that the story would be a bit complicated for people who didn't know any martial arts novels/movies beforehand. It could also be boring for people who didn't want to hear about retiring swordsmen.<br/><br/>5) Martial Arts Choreography. Finally, I get to see some martial arts moves done in real-time and in sequence instead of through lots of ""snappy"" editing and slow-motion. With real-time fight sequences, I get very caught up following each attack, parry and counter-attack.... Watch for Michelle Yeoh's 3 consecutive round-house kicks when she first fights Zhang Ziyi as well as Zhang Ziyi's consecutive forehand & backhand-parries with the Green Destiny in their second fight together.<br/><br/>I agree with the pace was slow, the story was not clever/original, etc.. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie because I dont need a movie to be fast or clever for me to enjoy it. Yeah X 3, I admit that I watch foreign/art movies quite frequently.<br/><br/>I think all the reviewers who said the movie was ""boring"" or ""stupid"" were being honest about their opinions. But to all the people who dont think that ""crouching tiger"" deserves to be on the IMDB lists, you may be glad to know that the majority of my friends agrees with you. However, it appears that on the review boards, you guys are in the minority."

","Li Mu Bai wishes to no longer own an ancient and beautiful sword, it brings back to many bad memories, so he gives it to his friend Sir Te. That night someone brakes into their compound and steals the sword. What ensures is a breathtaking fight scene. The martial arts in this movie are wonderful, but the 'flying' is purely incredible.<br/><br/>Li Mu Bai and his friend Yu Shu Lien then try to get the sword back. The film then takes on some different sub-plots, including a very bizarre but nice love story, so I won't reveil anymore of the story.<br/><br/>Cue more breathtaking fight scenes, a very long but amazing flashback, scores aplenty to settle and some beautifully filmed scenes.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh is as nice as ever. She is a wonderful actress and I greatly enjoy seeing her in all her movies. Ziyi Zhang (Jen Yu) is also a very beautiful and talented actress. <br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderful. The flying in the fight scenes just amazed me and the bamboo tree scenes near the end are to beautiful for words.<br/><br/>
Only complaint, one of the special effects near the end of the movie looked rather cheesy.<br/><br/>'Wo Hu Cang Long' is a medium paced martial arts film, combined with a touching romantic story, and a nice, if at times a little slow (not a bad thing in this case), look at Chinese culture. Ultimately the film asks questions about life.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed this film and would recommend it for both lovers of martial arts and romantic films.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is the stuff Legends are made of.<br/><br/>Easily one of my favorite stories ever, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon simply has no flaws. It's an adventure, a story of love, betrayal, duty, war, and life. The plot is simple and yet possessed of dazzling depths.<br/><br/>The characters are all ones you care about deeply, even the Jade Fox, who you know deserves to die but she's a cool character anyway. Jen is very grey throughout the film, making her an interesting and unpredictable character. Li Mu Bai is a strong character, and Shu Lein every bit as strong, not to mention skilled in the social arena as well. It's Shu Lein who really shines, through the incredible acting talents of Michelle Yeoh (who is an /excellent/ martial artist in real life), who couldn't even speak the language she was acting in! Nor could Zheng Ziyi, who plays Jen, and both did a wonderful job of convincing me otherwise. All of the characters were wonderfully played, and the storyline is incredible. The Jade Fox is a worthy adversary too, and a /real/ antagonist, doing things for a reason. It's hard to find a good villain whose motivation isn't, ""I'm evil! Now I'm going to run around and cut people's heads off for /no/ reason!""<br/><br/>Oh yes, the film also features a 45-minute flashback. Give me back my comb!"

Colours, textures, and landscapes combine with love, anger and humanity to produce as perfect a piece of cinema as you are ever likely to see.

","It starts quietly enough. A swordsman returns to the woman he secretly loves, to tell her he's decided to give up the life of a warrior. As a token, he gives her his signature weapon, the Green Destiny sword, and asks her to deliver it to the governor in Beijing. Simple enough.<br/><br/>This kicks off ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" one of the most beautiful, passionate action/adventure movies ever made. Much has been made of the wu xia fight choreography, and many, sadly, have expressed their dislike for it as unbelievable. It's not supposed to be believable. It's supposed to be admired for its balletic artistry, its refusal to let the emotions of conflict remain stubbornly earthbound. The action choreography in this film is, like all true martial arts, both thrilling and meditative.<br/><br/>Most filmmakers working with this material would have gone overboard on the action. Ang Lee, however, is too good with actors and stories to make that mistake. He anchors ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" on its superb cast-- Chow Yun-Fat(how could it have been anyone else?) as the aging warrior Li Mu Bai, Michelle Yeoh, her face aglow with wary beauty, as Shu Lien, and the astonishing Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the new governor's daughter who is much more than she originally appears. A romance, an adventure, a meditation on how the choices we make narrow our paths in life, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the great films of our time."

","I was unsure what to expect from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  I didn't see the film until everyone and their dogs had an opinion on its excellence or its failure.  When I finally found the courage - or resolve - to see the film, I was surprisingly delighted.  <br/><br/>What I noticed first about the film was the amazing panoramic images of China.  The cinematography in this film is unmatched (with the sole exception of LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, set in New Zealand).  The film itself was beautiful, and contained all the elements necessary for a truly successful fantasy.  It had memorable characters, beautiful scenery, some comic relief, intelligent fight scenes, and most importantly, a moral. The fact that it revolves around a love story is an added treat (think: Star Wars).  <br/><br/>This film delights the senses, and whisks you away into the lives of each character.

(** minor spoiler) If a woman can become competent enough in martial arts to kill the headmaster of an all-male warrior school after stealing the sacred book of that order (even not having read it in full), I am inclined to think it serves them right( **).  Chow is absolutely pathetic playing a kind of a benign martial arts grand master, benign to the point where he starts resembling Robin Williams (yuck!).<br/><br/>Seems to me that it is no more than an average fighting movie.

"MadReviewer","9","1","1","30 April 2001"," A Mythical Epic Brought To Life
","Jaw-dropping martial arts combined with a genuinely good story  `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' delivers this nice blend, making for one of the best action movies  indeed, one of the best movies, period  made in the past few years.  Forget any possible negative preconceived notions that you might have about subtitled films, or about martial arts films, because `Crouching Tiger' is a flat-out great movie.<br/><br/>`Crouching Tiger' is told in a fable-like manner, or a tale about the Knights of the Round Table  it's fairly simple, but very engaging.  The warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a near-legendary hero, abruptly retires, giving his sword  the Green Destiny  over to the wise Sir Te (Pei-pei Cheng) for safekeeping.  Li Mu Bai has tired of the warrior's life, and wishes to begin pursing a future with the unrequited love of his life, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  Before he can confess his love to Yu Shu Lien, though, the Green Destiny is stolen  at first, it is thought that Li Mu Bai's sworn enemy, the Jade Fox (Li Fazeng) has stolen the weapon, but it becomes readily apparent that a new, impetuous young warrior has stolen the weapon instead . . . the troubled daughter of a powerful, noble family, a girl named Jen (Zhang Ziyi.)   Woven in and out of the pursuit of the Green Destiny is romance, comedy, and some of the best wire-assisted martial arts work ever caught on film. For the most part, the wire-work martial arts is used in much the same way as digital effects were used in `Forrest Gump'  to enhance the story, not to be the story.  It adds nicely to the mythical, fairy-tale tone of the film  only towards the end of the movie does the effect start becoming unbelievable and obtrusive.  The choreographed fights are like Fred Astaire dance numbers, fluid, fast, and unbelievable to watch.  Both Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Zhang Ziyi are poetry in motion.  The look of the film is fantastic as well  with sweeping desert plains, the forests, the cities, director Ang Lee created an epic backdrop for `Crouching Tiger' that helps make the film an event as well as a story.<br/><br/>Speaking of story, `Crouching Tiger' is a well-told tale, albeit a simple one.  Part of its charm is the simple backstory, which is hinted at but never explored.  It's casually mentioned, for example, that the old and wise Sir Te was once one of the greatest warriors in the kingdom  but it's left at that; it's enough to add depth to the story without beating the audience over the head with it.  The story moves along at a quick, exciting pace, except for one sequence regarding Jen that's awkwardly dropped into the middle of the film.  Well-paced and well thought out, `Crouching Tiger' is one of the best-told tales to be caught on film in quite a while.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are excellent in this film (although I kept expecting Chow Yun-Fat to pull out a pair of nine-millimeter handguns and start blasting away at villains.)  Without question, though, Zhang Ziyi steals the movie as Jen  not only is she an astonishingly good martial artist, but she is undeniably a terrific actress as well.  She runs a gamut of emotions throughout `Crouching Tiger', flying between joyful elation to quiet sadness to screaming rage  her performance is nothing short of outstanding.  With any luck, Zhang Ziyi should someday become a top marquee name; she's that good.<br/><br/>`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' isn't a perfect film . . . but it comes darn close.  Grade:  A"

","Flying Is no problem. I can suspend disbelief enough to understand that these are supposed to me ""mystical"" figures. But to see them pumping their legs just looks ridiculous. OK, that being said, let's talk about the actual substance of the film.<br/><br/>Well, except for some beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack, there's not much substance to this film. The plot IS razor thin. The only character that gets developed is Jen, and she's contemptable with her foolish attitude. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have the most stale romantic tension about them. in fact, you need a couple of characters telling michelle yeoh that she has feelings for him to even know at all.<br/><br/>
The fight scenes are just plain ridiculous, wasn't impressed with them at all usually when people fight in a martial arts film, you notice an exhibition of acrobatic prowess and it looks like the characters are actually trying to hurt each other. This was not the case with CTHD. It looked like the characters were being swung at each other from ropes and they were playing pattycake (no, really) rather than fighting to the death.<br/><br/>
The flashback, while without a doubt enjoyable and the most beautiful part of the film, ruins ANY and ALL forward momentum this film had going for it. I felt so detached from every character except for Jen, and I HATED her character, even though she's extremely gorgeous.<br/><br/>There is no plot, so therefore you wouldn't think that there'd be any holes, but there still manages to be holes in there anyway. How did this Jade Fox manage to learn all this stuff from a manual when she said herself she couldn't interpret it? How did she get into the service of Jen in the first place? Why does Michelle Yeoh's character get mad at her for no good reason? watch that scene again. it's like she just gets mad so there would be a convienient way for them to fight. It's completely ridiculous. People make fun of the Phantom Menace Star Wars Plot. In so many ways CTHD is a rip off of Star Wars. Young girl (luke/anakin) being trained by evil old crusty master (emperor palpatine). Rougish rebel (Leia/Han) becomes love interest.

But.. why is it #9 on the top 250 list at IMDB, while ""Patton"" sits way back. It's a martial arts film with poetic overtones.. just because the American public is allowed a glimpse into another culture's world of film (typically too lazy to track something foreign down unless it's highly reccomended or publicly released) it doesn't make it top 10 material. CTHD is probably one of the greatest films of all time. But it's overrated. This is definitely worth seeing, but it has some flaws (a 20-minute, episodic flashback, for example) and they never really explain the whole flying thing, which has some Chinese-religious backgrounds, which may confuse viewers. The point is, this is a good, solid film. It's just not all it's cracked up to be."
"Dan White","Null","1","1","15 April 2001"," Laughable. This film's popularity is utterly inexplicable.
","It's difficult to articulate how baffled I am by the masses who adore this film. <br/><br/>The incoherent plot doddered along with a total lack of consistency.  Case in point; a character is introduced mid-way through the movie whose presence is then explained by a terribly disconcerting, twenty minute long flashback. I have never studied film as an art, but I suspect this sort of editing is frowned upon in introductory level classes. Nor was this interjected explanation part of an overall, well thought through scheme (See Pulp Fiction) but rather an ineptly written hole that had to be plugged with some sort of (very strained) explanation. When the flashback ended I had pretty much forgotten about the ""main"" movie and really couldn't have cared less about the final resolution.<br/><br/>The special effects are closer to an elementary school play that hoists a flailing Peter Pan in the air than they are to those found in other, more competent films. Where this movie struggles most to succeed is its biggest failure, it will forever be poor cousin to the Matrix.<br/><br/>The attempts at comedy do elicit laughter, but you find yourself laughing at the actors and not the jokes. The crude humor juxtaposed with the film's obvious effort to achieve success as a piece of art is painful to watch.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Please don't spend money on this movie and encourage other producers to create films such as this that lure people to the box office that aren't willing to completely suspend disbelief (and in fact beat their disbelief into a pulp and lock it in a box and run far, far away) and arrogantly expect the writer/director/producer to have created a competent product."

And, yes, there are some spectacular fight sequences in the film, but to rate it solely on them is to miss the point. I dont think this is a Kung-Fu movie at all, its just a movie that has Kung-Fu in it. If all I wanted to see was fighting I wouldnt go to the cinema. I go to see a good story, well told, and this was certainly that. I was utterly absorbed.<br/><br/>Making films like this which are intended to appeal to the mass market without the use of English is also a very welcome step, as is the lack of a conventional 'happy ending'. This film is not instant gratification, which most of the cinema going public now seem to demand, and I for one am glad of it.<br/><br/>I honestly cant think how Ang Lee, possibly the best director working today, could make this film it any better. To the detractors in here critisising the film on the basis that people cant fly, well, no. I cant fly. Nor can you. But this is a FANTASY. That means that the content need not reflect reality all that closely. I think it unlikely that a small ring owned by a hobbit can control all the evil in the universe, but it didnt stop me enjoying a film about that. <br/><br/>The high rating in the top 250 is richly deserved, 10/10 every time."
"elliot murgatroyd","Null","1","1","14 March 2002"," Beware the version
","When I first saw this film, it was at a cinema, and it blew me away; straight into my all-time top 3. So good in so many ways! BUT I just watched it again on video - the dubbed English Language version. Epic cinematography never transfers well to the small screen, but when the sound is compromised as well.... you must ONLY watch the Chinese version (subtitled), and on the largest screen available to you!"
"MyDarkStar","9","1","1","10 March 2002"," Suspension Of Reality
","There are two types of people who walk away from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" : those who think the concept of a human being having the ability to defy gravity and accomplish impossible physical tasks is ridiculous ; and those that are able to allow the movie to tell a beautiful fantasy epic by engaging in the concept of suspension of reality.<br/><br/>The quicker you allow ""Crouching Tiger..."" take over your mindset and send you on its amazing journey, the quicker you will enjoy the awesome power of this film. The martial arts scenes here are simply amazing. For all of the tight, quick movements that are displayed by the characters, this movie never once seems choreographed - not once. It is that good.<br/><br/>But there is even so much more to ""Crouching Tiger..."" than the martial arts scenes. The gorgeous landscapes are the perfect compliment to this epic tale. They show the depth of the great story and journey being told, without becoming the centerpiece of the film.<br/><br/>That is because the true centerpiece of this film is Chinese culture. It is Chinese culture that calls for those anti-gravity fight scenes. It is Chinese culture that is depicted in the village scenes. It is Chinese culture that is shown in the landscapes. Most of all, it is Chinese culture that is heard through the mouths of the actors when they speak their lines."
"toplus2","9","1","1","2 April 2003"," Action and sensibility in a film not to miss
","Oriental characters and environment burst again successfully in our screens to transport us to the legendary and ancient China. In this film, Lee combines deliciously martial arts with a plot and love story, without falling in the error of developing to much any of this parts.<br/><br/>
Only the excellent photography  already makes this film a must. Incredible atmosphere and marvellous landscapes combine with the story. Recreation of city environment (Beijing), costumes and customs are perfect. Desert pictures are luscious.<br/><br/>About the action scenes, maybe you have heard about some  kind of post-Matrix movements. In my opinion, nothing further than reality. First of all, Matrix success is based mainly in this innovating filming techniques, while CTHD, although is true that martial arts play an important role in the plot, are only the background to develop a parallel love story between the characters. Moreover, I will say that `flying' action in this film is the only `but' to it. Fighting scenes are magnificent, but when flying is involved that makes them pretty unbelievable. Anyway, I guess the purpose of the director was no to make you believe that characters could fly or rebound in walls, just to expose a supposed ancient and secret technique. Nevertheless, this `but' not only doesn't  eclipse anyhow the film, but makes it even more special and worth to see it."

","When a movie that gets an extremely high rating  as this movie has and gets as many poor reviews as this is getting it usually means the rare ones who don't like it are so jelous of the movie's popularity they need to write multiple reviews to make people understand their minority opinion. It's ranked 21st so please, the vast majority of people love this movie. The rating is a much better indicator than the reviews are on how people like a movie. I write reviews because I want to express my opinion, not because I have an unusually high ego. <br/><br/>Now to the movie. It has a great story, fantastic beautiful art direction and cinamatography, and some of the best fight scenes ever on film. No performances in particular are spectacular, but they still all do a great job and the atmosphere is so great  that just their presense seems spectacular. The best movie of 2000 no question in my mind and by far the best martial arts movie ever made."
"sam66","10","1","1","18 August 2001"," the dubbed version
","This comment is directed specifically at the dubbed version of the film. I rented it by accident, found out it was dubbed, groaned loudly (""not letterbox/subtitled? scandalous!""), and proceeded to watch it anyway because I figured I could at least enjoy the fight scenes. I'm used to the horrifying dubbing in Hongkong action pics, after all. Well, let me say that this movie is a million miles away from any other dubbed flick I've ever endured. It is clear from the beginning that the dubbing was accomplished with a great deal of time and care in order to capture the poetry of the original script while seeking to better fit the actors' mouths. Also, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat have beautiful voices and dubbed their lines in the prevailing mood of each scene. I appreciate the kind of work that went into making the dubbed version the equal of the subtitled version--I'm not kidding! I've watched both versions and any way you see it this movie is a perfect gem. I must admit that I'm swayed by other factors in placing CTHD high among my all-time favorites: I love kung fu movies, wirework ""chi,"" period pieces, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat, Ang Lee, ""girl power,"" and cool-looking weapons. I feel like this pic was made for me! And the dubbed version is as good as dubbing can get."
"john_meyer","10","1","1","15 August 2001"," Beautiful parable
","Some movies should be viewed like a painting at a museum: You sit and slowly absorb the mastery of detail, and the interpretive expression the artist labored long hours to convey. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is such a picture. (Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" was another.)<br/><br/>The main flaw in this masterpiece, and perhaps the reason it has garnered so many negative reviews in this forum, is that its opening scenes provide very little guidance to Western audiences for what follows. We are therefore unprepared for sudden breaks from ""reality"" as characters begin to fly in the middle of fight scenes, and we don't understand the rules of this ancient, mythical Chinese civilization. Also, there is a certain ""language"" that develops around certain film genres, and without having viewed previous movies of this type, it may be difficult to grasp the significance of many scenes. Imagine, for instance, someone from China viewing ""High Noon"" without ever having watched another American Western. The heroic depth of Gary Cooper's refusal to leave town can only be fully appreciated by having viewed countless similar films, and knowing that the ""code of the West"" requires certain things of its heroes. Lacking this context, it was difficult at times to truly appreciate the characters. (However, viewing the DVD supplementary material helps enormously). <br/><br/>Despite these handicaps, this is one of the most stunningly gorgeous films ever created, with a simple, but compelling, parable at its center that can be appreciated by any viewer regardless of what movies he or she may have seen before."
"mb4084","9","1","1","9 August 2001"," The more I watch it the better I like it
","I didn't really know what to expect when I went to see this film and at first it was difficult to understand what's going on.  There are no clues that I could see by which the story can be dated,it probably doesn't matter but usually I like to know whether we're talking ancient history or something much more recent.<br/><br/>Then I realised it doesn't matter in this film. The timelessness is really part of the skill which went into making CTHD. It's meant to be that way. You can read it any way you want. When it comes to the martial arts sequences, especially those with Michelle Yeoh and Ziang Ziying ( sorry if I've spelled her name wrong ) well, they're just amazing, Who cares about the laws of gravity and motion when you're watching something like this ? If you're hung up about the physics, you've missed the point of the film.<br/><br/>I liked CTHD enough to buy it on VCDs and every time I watch it I like it better than before.  It's a super film and let's have more like it."

","This movie is beautiful.  In every single way.  From the cinematography, to the score, to the acting, to the fights, and the costumes.   WOW.<br/><br/> First off, if you plan on renting the DVD, it starts off dubbed.  WATCH IT IN IT'S ORIGINAL MANDARIN WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!!  I have no idea why they programmed the DVD's default to have dubbed English, I suppose it's the same reason why this movie began playing only in art houses for a month before Sony Classics found they had a goldmine in their hands.  Then again, Life Is Beautiful was released in English in the 2nd release, so I shouldn't be surprised.<br/><br/> This is a romantic fantasy epic with martial-arts action interwined within. Yes, it is a love story fantasy movie first, martial-arts movie second. While the story is a bit simplistic, it is grand and powerful.  Chow Yun Fat does an amazing job, as he did in Anna and The King (even if I didn't like that movie much).  and of course the fight scenes are incredible.  This movie is just beautiful."
"kylerkl","9","1","1","16 July 2001"," A Masterpiece
","Get set for a real treat while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Was there anything bad about this film? You feel as if you know each of the main characters. You don't just watch this film, you experience it. One moment you are full of sorrow the next you are in the middle of a fight for your life. The dialogue freely flows and is arranged well. The story evolves as each character reveals more of themselves. The sets are like fireworks; they are intense, dramatic and are designed compliment the next. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed and seem less like a conflict and more like a perfectly orchestrated dance. The film is full of symbolism and imagery. It is available in a subtitled format and in a dubbed format."
"Space Hamster","Null","1","1","15 July 2001"," Looking for mindless thrills? Then look elsewhere!
","A large majority of internet reviewers have panned this film for being 'long and boring', and for having 'fake martial arts stunts'. Some have simply panned this film for 'being popular' but for 'not being made in America' - which is a pretty racist excuse for panning a film. Let's be blunt, shall we? If you're expecting a mindless, violent Hong Kong-style chop-socky extragavanza, I strongly suggest you look somewhere else. And if you're expecting to see a Matrix-style science-fiction/fantasy film, I definitely advise you to look somewhere else. This is not a good film to watch if you're looking for vicarious thrills.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(CTHD) is a serious drama wrapped in the guise of a Wuxia martial arts film. It deals with issues such as love, devotion, honour, duty...many concepts that our modern society seems to have devalued or simply forgotten. No wonder this film got such a panning from internet critics - I guess this film doesn't really deal in anything modern audiences would consider ""important"".<br/><br/>I felt that this was a film where the 'special effects' such as the wire-work stunts, took second place to the real special effects - the actors. Zhang Ziyi is the obvious standout, she's received plenty of raves for her outstanding performance. However, I feel that not enough credit has been paid to Michelle Yeoh and Chow-Yun Fat. Both have roles that require measured, understated performances. Their characters may not garner as much attention as young Jen(Zhang Ziyi), but they (and their relationship) are the foundation of this film.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this film is a credit to its creators - Ang Lee and his collaborators should be proud to have produced such a brilliant film. This is not the kind of film that will win instant accolades from everyone. It challenges every single stereotypical element we've come to expect of Asian martial arts films...and succeeds brilliantly. If it were possible to give ten out of five stars, I would. If you're a viewer that's sick and tired of unoriginal, dull and boring cinema, and want to be challenged and invigorated by something totally different, then I definitely reccommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This film is a classic."

","The film may look like another martial art flick but it is not the case. The martial art is given a new and fresh look (though at some places it too unnatural), but then that is the beauty of it.<br/><br/>The story is strong and makes you feel part of it. My personal favourite are the scenes between Li Mu Bai and Jen, they are so silent and yet make a strong impression.<br/><br/>The location, the scenery, all just go along so well with the story.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all those who like good story with good *action* in the form of martial arts and an unpredictable end."

","Dorian said on February 14, 2002 that ""Some people have bashed this film because of the plot's impossibilities, and the impossibility of people flying, and jumping as high and as graceful as the characters in this film can. <br/><br/>GROW UP!!! Yeah, that's right - GROW. UP. For the two simple reasons<br/><br/>1) It's a bloody film!! 2) Ever heard of the expression 'suspension of disbelief'?!"" ------------------------------------<br/><br/>I expected a better argument from an English person.  #1 - you want us to like the film because it's a film.  That isn't a very persuasive argument.<br/><br/>#2 - you expect us to ""suspend our disbelief"" without a reason.  Walking into a movie theater is not enough to suspend disbelief.  If I'm watching an animated Disney cartoon, I can suspend my belief when a mouse talks.  The movie Babe was about animals talking to each other - fine I can accept that and move on.  Star Wars starts off the whole movie by saying ""In a galaxy far, far away.."" Great, laser swords and Jedi Knights exist their.  In all of these areas I can easily suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>But I can't suspend disbelief when watching Arnold Schwarzenneger in Commando, somehow dodging 50 submachine guns firing on him from forty feet away.  Why you ask?  Because the movie based itself in reality, the other movies clearly tell you up front that this is fantasy.  Crouching Tiger tried to be a martial arts/romance movie and as a serious movie never explained how people fly through the air.  This movie would have been better if they started it off with some old monks reading some ancient book that explained how the great ancestors could tap into some hidden powers.<br/><br/>Why didn't they do that?  Because then it becomes a fantasy movie which stuffy critics choose to hate.  Critics like yourself who probably have never seen Conan the Barbarian or Lord of the Rings.  Mark my words, here in writing, Lord of the Rings does NOT win best picture, even though 37,000+ people have given it the highest rating of any movie ever made in the history of mankind.  <br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, Lord of the Rings takes place in an ancient pre-civilization world where elves and hobbits exist.  So I had no problem suspending disbelief when I saw the hairy footed 4 foot tall creatures."

","Got Plot? Because this movie doesn't. Sure it looks pretty. Thats it. End of story. The movie looks pretty. It's not even the best martial arts film ever made, and no where near one of the best films ever. The director would be better used making commercials, something quick and easy that doesn't need a plot. Obviously I am in the minority thinking that movies still do need plot and character development more than they need action scenes. Waste of time, money, and space on the Top 250 list. But if Star Wars and The Matrix can make it, I guess anything can. In ten years people might finally realize what a waste of praise this flick was, but probably not."

But after going I couldn't believe it got the reviews it did. Was it a very good movie, yes. Did it have a good story, and was it very well acted, again yes. But was it Great NO. I was bored for much of it, and I thought on a whole that it was rather stupid (people flying through the air to fight, even with its symbolic meaning). Also I was particularly annoyed at the critically acclaimed cinematography. I was dizzy for half the movie. I thought the shots were extremely close all the time, and it was very difficult to follow, especially the fight scenes. It may have given a faster and more real effect but at the confusion I felt as a result, wasn't worth the realism.  Over all it was a good movie but was it an 8.9 on average, and number 9 of all time. In my opinion definitely not. I implore you users to think for yourselves and not to just think it is great because critics say so.<br/><br/>For all of you who did think it was a great movie I will see this movie again when it comes on video because of the reviews it continues to get, and maybe my opinion will change if I missed something the first time."

BUT, I REALLY could not get over the flying samurai, or whatever you want to call them. I needed the same hookup of wires to get over the large suspension of disbelief needed to swallow such a thing. This was a MAJOR stumbling block for me. And, I know, you could be thinking it's just me, but I tell you the whole theater comically laughed every time the movie's heroes took to the clouds. And yet, when one of them needed to quickly travel to the nearest town to pick up medicine, it was imperative for them to find a horse to travel by! I'm telling you, the whole audience laughed! If it was a Jackie Chan comedy (I haven't seen one yet that has a larger unbelievable premise) I possibly could have gotten over it!

I see 'Crouching Tiger' as his method of gaining pop status, not pushing limits.  Compare the content here to prior junk in 'Matrix'.<br/><br/>The story is a farce, too simple.  How many Bruce Lee, John Woo, or even Peckinpah films have been loaded with the same filler?  Even the acting is just flat.  Four years later and no performance rings in my mind.  I'm wondering if Lee ever examined Kurosawa's work because so much could have been applied.<br/><br/>I guess Lee wanted to be Raimi and Woo but didn't want to prove that he was better.  Raimi's films are always stupid in the basic qualities because they rely on his visual intuitiveness.  Woo has been making the same movie since 'Heroes Shed No Tears', never deviating from formula.<br/><br/>It's in that respect where I hold Lee in high regard: always trying to do something new.  Woo, Cameron, and Burton all found their niches, but I doubt Lee ever will.  He'll keep experimenting and I will admire him for that.<br/><br/>So here is an uncomplicated look at an old genre.  Performed by a master, but clumsily so.  'Hulk' showed Lee really experimenting with the comic book medium, but there isn't any new blood in this project.

","Like most Asian born Canadian, I have grown up watching many martial arts film. To be very honest with you, most of them, if not all, never met my expectations, but ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was the first excellent martial arts movie, because watching the movie was like seeing a dream that was finally coming true.<br/><br/>Unlike so many martial arts movie, the emphasis is put on the plot, the mood and the feelings, so that's why the story is so well written. However, James Schamus, the script writer, followed too much the ""rules"" for creating a martial arts movie, so that's why some people might say that the movie is full of clichés. For instance, how many times have you seen a martial arts master who wants to avenge his master's death? Everyone must have seen it a lot of time. After all, unlike what I have previously seen, James Schamus finds a very brilliant way to present, at the same time, both the love story between Li Mu-Bai and Shu Lien, and the story of vengeance without creating any long periods. In short, one the main strength of this movie is its emphasis on the story line, the feelings and the mood, because unfortunately, so many martial arts movies that were produced before ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" only focus on the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Obviously, one wouldn't expect to see so much depth in a martial arts movie. Speaking about the cast's performance, Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Zhang Ziyi (The Road Home) all have an undeniable ability to bring their respective character's feelings to the surface and the chemistry between them is so impeccable. Well, at least, we can admire such a great acting without cringing. Personally, I found this movie better than all the Jackie Chan's and Bruce Lee's movies, because for once, the movie director has worked very hard on the story line and the acting. Although the fight scenes are unrealistic, I was stunned by them, because I found them visually poetic, in a manner of speaking.<br/><br/>Finally, I am sure that in at least 20 years, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" will certainly be remembered not only as a greatly entertaining movie, but also a very smart, deep and an intellectually challenging movie. Moreover, let it be said that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee will certainly have a very low profile because of this movie and also other martial arts movies, such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers""."
"philip_vanderveken","7","2","4","14 July 2005"," Surprising and better than what I expected
","If it hadn't been for the very high rating that this movie has received up till now (8.2/10 by 53,959 voters) and the fact that it is in the list of the 250 best movies ever, I would probably never have watched it. Why? Very simple, I absolutely detest all those Kung-Fu movies. You just can't please me with it, not even when it comes from the famous Bruce Lee, let alone when you get some cheap imitations. I hate it and I was convinced there was nothing that could change my mind about that. But I was told that this movie was different, that this one actually had a lot more to offer than some tedious fight scenes, that it had a more philosophical and poetical approach to the subject. That's the only reason why I gave it a try, despite all my reservations.<br/><br/>Even though the story in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is rather timeless, it seems to be situated a couple hundred years ago (People who know a lot more about it say the QING Dynasty, I believe them but don't know whether that is true or not). Master Li Mu Bai has decided to give his sword, that is called the 'Green Destiny', to a friend because he is tired of all the violence and killing. But then the sword is stolen from that friend and it is up to Li to bring it back to his rightful owner. At the same time, he also tries to find the evil Jade Fox, a female warrior who had killed his master many years ago. Yu Shu Lien, the love of his life with who he has never had a relationship, is also a warrior and she will help him on both his quests. The link between all these different story lines is Jiao Long Yu, she is the mysterious and beautiful daughter of a well known family who hates the idea that she will soon be forced to marry a man she doesn't love. <br/><br/>Quite surprisingly, I must say that overall this movie was far from bad. I would even say that I liked it, although I must admit that it was only during the last half of the movie (and in the last 30 minutes in particular), that I was really sucked into the story. Before that it all looked a lot like what I've seen before in those other movies: A lot of fight scenes, but little of an interesting story. Still, what I missed in the first half, I got in the second. Thanks to the, in my opinion, a lot more interesting love stories, these super heroes looked more human after all. <br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie were the well-choreographed fight scenes who seemed to offer more variation thanks to the clever use of many weapons and techniques. This was more than a lot of screaming and kicking by what seems to be a madman... However, there was one thing that I really didn't like about it and that's all that 'flying'. If they would have kept both feet on the ground like normal people, instead of making 100 feet steps while walking over water or jumping over a roof, I would have believed it a lot more. Perhaps it is a part that I didn't understand well because I'm not too familiar with the Chinese culture (I hardly know anything about it if I'm honest). Maybe it is supposed to be that way because it perfectly shows how mythological these fighters actually were. I don't know, but it didn't really help me to be completely overwhelmed by it like so many people are. Still, as I said before, the movie wasn't bad. Especially when they left the city for the countryside I was very interested. I just couldn't get enough of those wonderful landscapes.<br/><br/>As a conclusion I would like to add that, although I'm not a fan of Kung-Fu movies, I liked this one. It had a lot more to offer than what I expected and despite the fact that I wasn't really drawn into the story during the first 1.5 hours and that there were some things that spoiled my fun, I still give this movie a rating between 7/10 and 7.5/10. Maybe if I knew more about Chinese culture or had been more familiar with the genre, I would have given it a higher rating. Now I liked the love story a lot more than everything that proceeded it, because that was the more realistic part of the movie."
"empress_soraya","9","2","4","27 February 2005"," I would rather be a condemned soul drifting by your side...
","I just watched the film yesterday, it was shown on one of our national TV stations and it affected me quite strongly. I have always been willing to try and watch an oriental film and I think I was fortunate enough to start with this one. It was beautiful. <br/><br/>The director and the cast did a wonderful job presenting a fairy like, ethereal landscape, so apt for the story behind it. And quite honestly, I was amazed how much depth it added to the whole picture. The story is told in a very poetical, lyrical way which one cannot cease to wonder at and perhaps even dream...The depth of feelings captured on the screen enthralled me and left me speechless for the whole evening afterwards. <br/><br/>While watching it for the first time, as I did last night, one may become captivated by the delicate, spring-like feelings, by the deep and mature devotion of the older couple and a deep sense of tradition and honour preventing them from realising that love, the love which is meant to be but ,tragically, for people of their kind, painfully impossible to enjoy. And so, they enjoy their comradeship never crossing the boundaries...but their eyes speak for them, their eyes express everything gestures or words fail to do. <br/><br/>This absolutely beautiful and lyrical story is contrasted with the passions and dilemmas of the impulsive, carefree and at times quite inconsiderate youth. Jen is a princess whose fate had been forced upon her, which she refutes and denies, quite visibly lost amidst all the formality and stiffness accompanying her status. She wants freedom, she wishes to ride on the wings of wind into the wilderness. And yet, we are reminded, human beings cannot be ever truly free, bound as we are by knots of tradition, honour, morality, values. Her seemingly predictable youth is filled with passion for the young renegade, full of hidden secrets and yet she seems to be quite unsure of what she truly wants, she is not ready to follow the path from an ancient legend.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are also other elements and admittedly, quite admirable, but frankly personally I was too absorbed in the magic of the storyline and the landscapes that I perhaps failed to fully appreciate the skillful arts of fighting or the realities of the 19th century China or music even, which are other elements worth mentioning and important in a film of this class. <br/><br/>To sum up, I only want to say that the magic of this unbelievable image lies in its great subtlety and delicacy of portrayal and this ""visualised poetry"" certainly deserves high praise and applause."

","While this is far from a bad movie, it is certainly one of the most over rated films of the last ten or fifteen years. I don't hate this movie, I just can't understand why this film was noticed when China and the rest of the Orient are turning out films equal to, if not better than this one.<br/><br/>The story of pairs of lovers is interesting but its nothing that hasn't been told before and gave the film a strong sense of deja vu. I was marking off how many plot points in my head I got right while I watched the film and found I was pretty much right down the line.<br/><br/>(A side note, this is based on, I think, the fourth book in a series so there are numerous references to events that happened earlier between characters. While this gives a sense of the characters being grounded it also is frustrating since there seems to be many times events in this film are echoing events in the past) <br/><br/>If you've been watching Hong Kong films (or even Hollywood films over the past few years for that matter) you've seen the wire work that wowed many people when this film first came out. For many people the technical brilliance of something they have never been exposed to is the selling point. For me it was just been there done that.<br/><br/>In the end I was left wondering if that was all there, and apparently it was.<br/><br/>Despite my disappointment I suggest you try it. Just don't expect the bells and whistles."
"toxicwaste","10","2","4","31 August 2002"," Top 50 isn't high enough
","I loved this movie, and every time i see it, it gets better. There were very few flaws in this movie. It's like there's no movement (from the camera, the actors or even a tree) that wasn't planned. It's the best mix of action, drama and romance I've ever seen. Many compared it with the matrix, but the two movies are completely different (except for the kung-fu and the flying). While the matrix (a great movie) was al about a hero saving the world, this movie was much more personal (and that makes it better than the matrix).<br/><br/>But I don't understand the people who found the top 50 to high for this movie. Did they watch the same movie I did. This one definitely deserves a higher place. Maybe not top 10, but top20 at least. If there's one movie that shouldn't belong to the top 10, it's LotR. (It bumped Strangelove out:-( ) But this movie isn't overhyped, it's underhyped and underappreciated.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a 10/10, and after the Kubrick Collection the best DVD I've bought so far."

","To those who doesn't understand how the people fly around.<br/><br/>
It actually cames from ancient Chinese Martial Art (wushu or Kung fu), theres something called ""hing kung"", which aids the user in becoming sort of ""lighter"" (hing means light). This concept has been widely used in Chinese martial art themes.<br/><br/>If you've seen Jacky Cheng climbing up the walls in insane speed, this is that sort of thing what hing kung is, I recall the code where ""hands move feet follows""<br/><br/>Also if you've seen in a movie where ninjas jumping around, this is basically the same idea, because most Japanese martial arts are inherited from the Chinese ones.<br/><br/>This is one of the best filmed Kung Fu films out there. The fight scenes are awesome and the crew did put alot of work in perfecting them.<br/><br/>
Well people who claim to hate this film because it's ""unreal"" are probably foreigners, who doesn't like fantasy stuff, or is simply jealous because this film kicked so much azz."

But those are the only positive comments I can make about it.<br/><br/>There's nothing truly original in the storyline and once you've seen the characters do their ""flying nun"" stunts once, it becomes pretty silly and redundant afterwards.<br/><br/>In short, all through the movie you keep looking for a sign of what it is that made this movie to be praised by so many people.<br/><br/>In that genre, Chinese Ghost Stories was far more better and, at least, it had a sense of humor. I'm sure Ang Lee is very talented but it's totally wasted here.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10"

","Exciting, often beautiful, and captivating- Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon may be predictable to a fault at times, but is still packed with enough enjoyment, action, and romance to prove to be something unique and truly worthwhile. Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi lead the cast, and both provide some fantastic performances throughout. The supporting actors are also quite good, most notably Chow Yun-fat, as Master Li. The film is surprisingly very entertaining, with some truly impressive and unique action sequences unlike any film before and any film after. The film is very cleverly shot, with some truly captivating and beautiful cinematography. The film handles its plot and story very well, though it can be rather predictable to watch at times.

The romance in the film is brilliantly executed, and feels genuine and very poignant. In the end, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is full of truly original and captivating moments for the screen. It may be a bit obvious to see where its going from time to time, but it can be extremely entertaining, and is often quite sharp and well acted.

"davidmvining","10","0","0","21 April 2020"," Sumptuous aesthetics and an involving story
","I decided to rewatch this because I watched Patrick H. Willems' video about the film and why it's great. I also remembered Ang Lee's introduction to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring on the Criterion Collection's release where he talked about the movie's great influence on him. As I watched the film again, I had things both said and some of my own Bergman thoughts floating around in my head. Willems talked about how Ang Lee characters are usually repressed and refuse to say what they mean (it was clear the second he said it), and Lee talked about how much of an influence Bergman was on his work. I was particularly thinking of my own observation that Bergman's characters often lie to each other and to themselves, and it fit rather well. The characters in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are often masking what they want from themselves and from the world around them.<br/><br/>Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are long time associates who both obviously love each other romantically, however they are separated by a societal convention that says that they cannot be together because Lien was engaged to Bai's brother who died decades before. Jen Yu is the daughter of a regional governor and betrothed to some bureaucrat, but she harbors memories of her weeks in the wilderness with an outlaw, Dark Cloud, and has kept secret her martial arts training with Jade Fox, a murderer hiding in Governor Yu's household as Jen's governess. Jen has another level to her deceptions in that her training with Jade Fox is based on a martial arts manual she stole from Li Mu Bai's order but couldn't read herself, which Jen did, only providing a cursory education to her own master.<br/><br/>The element that ties all of these characters together is the Green Destiny, a magical sword that Li Mu Bai gives to Lien, assuring himself that he's leaving the life of a fighter behind after meditation took him to a place his master had not prepared him for. Jen, having grown up on stories of the fighters, in particular and specifically around both Bai and Lien themselves, is enamored with the sword and decided to simply steal it. That event ignites the adventure that follows.<br/><br/>Now, to talk about the action. I adore the action in this film, and it's for several reasons. The first is how Lee films it. The action is largely filmed from afar, in wide shots, with more than enough room to see the performers going through the complex moves. Those shots are intercut with inserts of some closer action, but the action overall is driven by those long shots that allow the action to play out in clear terms for the audience, never trying to paper over poor performances with quick cuts. The other major reason is the use of wires. Now, I don't love wirework whenever it comes along, but I love it here. That has a lot to do with the overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>Wirework in action implies something otherworldly. That can be explained through stuff like magic, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes it in a more interesting direction. There's an ethereal feeling to the whole affair that lends itself to the wirework in the action sequences. It's not like the movie ends up feeling like something else entirely when it switches from people talking to people swinging swords at each other. The talk around repressed emotions makes characters seem like they're never quite connected to the real world around them. They are inherently otherworldly in that way, so the flying fits how they interact with each other. These are people who are more concerned with larger ideals like the fathomless fear of reaching a place in meditation they hadn't expected, duty over passion, and questions of freedom against obligation.<br/><br/>However, that's not to say that there are no baser concerns, they're just hidden below the surface. Bai wants to kill Jade Fox because she stole the martial arts manual but also for revenge. Lien and Bai keep coming together out of duty and because they love each other.<br/><br/>Aside from the action, the movie is a sumptuous treat. From Bai and Jen standing on the top of bamboo trees to the simple, economical, and classic way scenes of people talking to each other to the beautiful colors of every scene, the movie is simply a joy to look at.<br/><br/>Exciting, beautiful, touching, and intelligent, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great film told with tenderness and verve all at once."

","Hollywood seems to be an emotionless company. They simply don't care if a film is good only if it rake's in the cash. This is why there are so many Transformers movies or Pirates of the Caribbean movies because they are economically profitable. That's why whenever Hollywood produces a film like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon it's so satisfying. This was film that took real risks, It's completely spoken in chinese features no famous hollywood actors and is very artistically filmed. Yet it nearly quadrupled its budget and became a massive hit in the united states, and was nominated for 10 academy awards including best picture. 
 Ang Lee has crafted a film that appeases both those looking for an entertaining experience and those looking for a truly artistic and poetic film. The film takes place in the beautiful chinese countryside and has one of the most pleasing color gradings in recent film history. Even though the film features many brilliant, tense action scenes the whole film feels nuanced and laid back simply letting audience sit back and truly appreciate the beauty of what you're experiencing. The performances also feel natural just embracing the human spirit. The stand out performance Zhang Ziyi playing Jen the rebellious martial arts master. Ziyi gives us one of the most memorable characters in recent memory embracing the teenage spirit of just doing whatever the heck she wants to do. In the greatest scene in the movie Jen battles seemingly hundreds of adversaries boasting her name as the ""Sword Goddess"" and ""The Woman who kicked down the mountain where Kung Fu was founded"". 
 Can we talk about the action scenes? Because they are some of the tightest, intensely choreographed, and brilliantly directed I've ever seen. The scene where Jen battles Yu Shu Lien in sword combat is arguably the greatest sword fight ever put to film (take that Princess Bride!). The use of all the different weapons is quite simply breathtaking.
 The story is simple with Shu Lien and Mu Bien trying to tame and teach Jen in the ways of martial arts all while Jen continuously betraying them and causing more and more trouble. After Mu Bien eventually sacrificing his life to save Jen she finally accepts her ways are wrong and in the final shot of the film giving up her selfish desires and becoming one with herself giving her life to everyone but herself.
 The film isn't perfect I thought the relationship between the two masters felt underdeveloped but other than that this is a movie that pushes boundaries and take risks that pay off almost innumerably. What impressed me most about the film is how graceful the editing, directing and acting were. Add some breathtaking action scenes, thought provoking drama and gorgeous cinematography and you have one of the most exciting and satisfying films made. I'd give Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a 9.5/10."

","Before Ang Lee's foray into Chinese martial arts movies, the Wuxia film genre had only enjoyed a small cult following in the West. With Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it hit the mainstream. Steeped in the tradition of Wuxia, and fully celebratory of its genre's over-the-top conventions, Ang Lee's 2000 masterwork plays perfectly as an action-packed and rousing martial arts movie. That alone would be enough to champion this movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, Ang Lee and his collaborators have created something for which the word ""transcendent"" is meant. Crouching Tiger mines from its pulp heritage, a type of metaphysical artistry. The action is not just exciting, it is endlessly and exquisitely creative. The scenery is not just pretty, it is otherworldly in its beauty. The characters and story are not just interesting, they are mesmerizingly spiritual.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is a classic romantic adventure, and while I have little experience with Chinese martial arts cinema, I assume its story sticks closely to well worn genre traits. Based on a book by Wang DuLu, the story centers around two women, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a veteran Wuxia warrior and Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) a princess who dreams of living free of her upper class life, and their respective loves, the master warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and the renegade outlaw ""Dark Cloud"" (Chen Chang). In Jen's journey of self discovery, Li's philosophical meditation, and Yu Shu's liberating romance, the course is set for a sweeping, large-scale adventure. <br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is exactly that; a rousing action fantasy full of fun and thrills. What's more is that it is also a stirring emotional experience. The three principle characters are effortlessly magnetic on screen. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh deliver the finest work of their careers here as lifelong friends and repressed lovers, and Zhang Ziyi is enchanting in the role that turned her into a Chinese sensation overnight. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one that snuck up on me emotionally. There is a good deal of talky time spent discussing the plot of a stolen sword and a mysterious Jade Fox character, as well as a long flashback that apparently does little to forward the plot. The emotions are relatively understated for the first two-thirds of the movie, so when the character resolutions finally hit, they feel like body blows. The movie very subtly builds its themes and endears us to its characters. It is a remarkable feat of storytelling from scriptwriters Hui-Ling Wang, James Schamus and Kuo Jung Tsai.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most remarkable of Crouching Tiger's many remarkable elements are its martial arts action scenes. Under Ang Lee's direction, Peter Pau's cinematography and Yeun Woo-Ping's sensational fight choreography are given an elegant, mystical energy. The action in Crouching Tiger resonates like nothing I've ever seen before. It is fast, inventive, and so ceaselessly exciting, that it becomes more than just action. There is something hypnotic about its juxtaposition of sublime craftsmanship and pulpy cheesiness. It's enough that the fight scenes are perfect from a technical standpoint, but the tone here strikes the perfect balance of camp, fun, and danger. I've seen a lot of great action movies. None of them left my jaw on the floor every time the swords clash. Crouching Tiger did.<br/><br/>If story and action weren't enough, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also excels in each and every one of the technical departments. The costumes, sets, and sound all radiate quality. The production values in Crouching Tiger are lightyears beyond its drive-in schlock cousins. Peter Pau's cinematography, which won him the most deserved Oscar in the history of the award, is a top-to-bottom perfect showcase of what a great cinematographer can do. Crouching Tiger is beyond beautiful to look at. The streets of Beijing, the vast Gobi desert, and the lush, green Bamboo forests are just a few of the standout locations in Crouching Tiger and Pau photographs them in a way that makes them feel like characters unto themselves.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an extraordinary piece of film. Plenty of movies claim to have ""something for everyone"", but few are able to master dozens of elements the way Crouching Tiger does. This is one of the great art house films ever made and also one of the great action spectaculars. How delightfully crazy is that to think? What Ang Lee has done with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is create pure art from the basic elements of a genre mostly accepted as meaningless junk. It's miraculous. Any way you look at it, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is magical.<br/><br/>96/100"

","I don't know why it took me this long to watch this movie. WOW! I don't know where to begin. I suppose with the characters and their archetypes. In my assessment: Master Li Mu Bai would be the sage. The reason why, is because he was, at any time, able to kill Jen Yu. Instead, he wanted to teach and show her the way. Which, in the end, he did. Yu Shu Lien would be the caregiver and the hero. Caregiver, because she looked after the well-being of Jen Yu. The Hero because in the end, she sacrificed the love of her life (Li Mu Bai) in a way to teach Jen Yu a lesson. The lesson being, because Jen Yu wanted to be just like Yu Shu Lien, was: Don't waste your life or the opportunity to love for the sake of duty. Breaking tradition is necessary to stay true to yourself. Jen Yu would be the shapeshifter simply because you don't know what side she's going to wind up on. Not too far into the movie does it reveal her alliance with Jade Fox. However, at the same time she wants Yu Shun Lien to be close to her like a sister would be. It's not until the very end, we see that she finally listens to Yu Shun Lien ""sisterly"" advise and tells her to live her life and to follow her heart. Basically, Yu Shun Lien was telling Jen Yu not to make the same mistake she did in not expressing her true feelings to the person she loves. Lo 'Dark Cloud' would be both the Outlaw and the Lover. The outlaw because he does not come from the same life style as Jen Yu. He is called/known as the Dark Cloud because of the ruthless, barbarian ways to stay alive in the desert. However, being an orphan, he longs for the ""one bright star"" which turns out to be Jen Yu. Lo and Jen Yu were truly in love with each other. Jade Fox was, in a general sense the, the villain. However, if we take a deeper look in her different archetypes, she would be known as the Sage, Caregiver, and Outlaw. The Sage because she was very wise and tried to teach Jen Yu her ways (even though Jen Yu would eventually surpass her in power and ability). The Caregiver because she looked after Jen Yu in ways as a mother, teacher, or guardian would. The Outlaw because she is wanted by highly respected people. This movie was one big lesson filled with excitement and regular beats all the way up the act structure and down the resolution slide. The main lesson I took away from it is to not waste your opportunity in life to love in the name of duty. What I loved about this movie was the regular beats up the act structure. While it was difficult to watch the scenes with dialog, because of having the distraction of having to read subtitles, they usually didn't have much action in them. So, you weren't missing much, visually. Note: the scenes with dialog weren't too long. So, the audience would not get bored with having to listen for too long. While the dialog wasn't too long, they were still able to accomplish a lot of expression without over using words or extended explanations. The choreography of the fight scenes was incredible. The best fight scenes I think I've ever seen. It was difficult to see the same move performed twice. It seemed every scene, location, and scenario of a fight was fascinating. I mean, the fight in the trees? Beautiful! This movie is clearly obvious as to why it would be known as an artistic film. The message is creatively deep, as well as visually. By. Malcolm Krause"

","Taiwanese director Ang Lee (THE WEDDING BANQUET, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, LIFE OF PI), perhaps the most versatile film craftsman his country has produced, gives us his take on the martial arts film with CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, a movie, like so many of Lee's works, that is greater than the sum of its parts. Watching this movie is like going on the best thrill ride in the new amusement park in town.<br/><br/>The story itself is minimalist in the extreme, centering on a prized sword owned by a great warrior, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). He gives it to his friend and erstwhile lover Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) for safekeeping, but it is stolen by a notorious thief, Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei). The remainder of the film is a quest to reclaim the sword, which falls into the hands of Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), a disciple of the notorious Jade Fox who appears to have outdone her teacher.<br/><br/>The rest is a series of amazing fight scenes (there are a lot of these but somehow this movie never gets boring).<br/><br/>I won't reveal any more; the film really has to be experienced.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the genre but this unique example is in a class by itself."

","If Akira Kurosawa could live for a hundred years, he would have made movies like ""Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon"", an epic tale of love and duty told with stylish grace and poetry, and a good deal of action sequences, now, that's the most honest and serious compliment I can give to Ang Lee.<br/><br/>His film has been regarded as the culmination of 'martial arts' movies but I'm not too hot about this label, because my mind can't help but associate it with Bruce Lee, Van Damme or Jackie Chan's flicks. I'm aware that 'martial arts' is the most popular genre in China or East-Asia in general and is widely associated to plots involving apprenticeship, relationships between masters and disciples, tales of revenges, of good vs. evil and quest for a sacred relics or an inner peace, well, while ""Tiger"" does handle these elements, it is beyond genre tagging, it is a film that tackles usual archetypes but with indomitable freedom and a style that can appeal to any movie lover. Still, ever since this film was made, there would be two Lees counting in the legendary scroll of Asian cinema.<br/><br/>The film is about two skilled fighters: a master swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-fat) and female bodyguard Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who have in common a precious loss, his former friend he promised to avenge and, her fiancée she promised to love and the same dedication to their duty, that feels like a decoy where they can hide the uncertain feelings toward each other, but that wouldn't fool an unwise eye. Li Mu Bai is instantly recognizable as a heroic figure but when we see him, he's a worn-out man, contemplating his burdens with a tired spirit. To seal this abandon, he decides to give up his sacred sword: ""Green Destiny"" and assigns Shu Lien to give it as a present to a friend in Beijing. There she meets Jen Yu, a governor's daughter played by Zhang Ziyi and whose governess (Cheng Pei-Pei) is revealed to be bandit Jade Fox (no spoiler as this comes quite early).<br/><br/>The relationships between masters and disciples are vital to the film and they're all ambiguous and enriched with other personal subplots that unfolds like a rose under the sun, Jen Yu is a fiancée but has a lover in an impetuous desert bandit named Lo (Chang Chen) who also have projects for both of them, and Jen Yu remains the real mystery and core of the film, she's the leading role actually. And Ang Lee goes beyond the simplification of having just a hero, a villain and a quest. Anyone is actually a crouching tiger or a hidden dragon for that matter. It takes several viewings to really appreciate this film as you discover each time another layer of the characters' personalities, and it's never done without feeling like a character study, you can discover more about them during a fight, or a stare.<br/><br/>Indeed, Asian cinema has this unique capability to be surprisingly quiet in a very heart-pounding way, and the counterpart is that the action sequences, meant to thrill you are hypnotic and you just stare at them as they didn't even belong to the film. ""Tiger"" is remembered for the gravity-defying combats where two characters can walk over a wall, jump miles ahead or literally fly over trees and there's never a moment where it feels over the top (no pun intended) or laughable, and that's a credit to the way Lee, surrounded by master visual effects and storytellers, know the audience and is aware that there's nothing as beautiful and dreamy as being able to fly, this is part of human subconscious, this is the ultimate challenge. These scenes have become immediate staples of the art martial genre and parodied everywhere, but even with that in mind, the choreographic battles are impressive.<br/><br/>Ebert compared these actions to musical numbers in musicals, they're expected now and then as a relief or a plot punctuation, but I felt they had the same aesthetic value than in Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"", where, you forgot you were watching a film and you just admired the beauty of some shots, looking like Rembrandt and Vermer paintings. The beauty of ""Tiger"" and the cinematography are simply breathtaking, and it is so contagious that even the characters become part of it. There's a panoramic shot over a long wedding outfit, and it takes as long as it would to show a bamboo tree or a pagoda, but this is the dazzling and beautiful Jen. And then an arrow hits the rickshaw, she raises her curtain and the action starts. There's just something in Lee's directing that shows fighting with art and displays art with the soul of the fighter. Martial Arts came from the Art of War and that's exactly what you get in the film: battles and art.<br/><br/>And like for the art, the greatest battles aren't necessarily in forest, arenas or castles under the moonlight but in the mind of tortured characters who are their worst adversaries. It might sound corny but not when Ang Lee is in the command and treats his material with a respect to the audience, one that provided one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's, and as today, the highest-grossing foreign movie of all time.<br/><br/>The title comes from Chinese proverb ""Behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon."" Well, I wonder what extraordinary effect this had on audiences sitting in the dark and experience the story told by a director who, on the field of cinematic mastery, is not just a tiger and a dragon, but a butterfly who swings across the breeze with poetic lightness and gracious beauty, defying the wind like Lee did with cinematic conventions."

"Screen_Blitz","10","0","0","14 December 2016"," This masterful martial arts epic is no ordinary thrill ride, it's a hallmark of the martial genre
","In the mysterious world of foreign cinema, there are many films that glamorize not only jaw-dropping taste of the Hollywood industry, but also the incredible cinematic feats directors in international countries have brought all around the globe. This masterful martial arts epic directed by Taiwanese director Ang Lee stands out as not only one of the most thrilling cinematic projects of its genre, but also one of the most unique ever brought to American Hollywood from overseas. In short words, it's a masterpiece of epic proportions. Exploring the extravagant historical period of Ancient China while driving a mix of electrifying martial arts action sequences and sweeping drama, this is a rare film that shatters the boundaries of the martial arts genre. Set in China somewhere in the 1800s during the Qing Dynasty, this film follows the story of two martial arts warriors, one of them is Li Mu Bai (played by Chow-Yun Fat); a young man aching to retire of fighting but continues on in pursuit of vengeance against Jade Fox (played by Cheng Pei-pei), the woman responsible for the death of his master. The other Yu Shi Lien (played by Michelle Yeoh), a woman struggling to establish her feeling for Mu Bai as well as being the bodyguard for young teenager girl Jen Yu (played by Zhang Ziyi) who is desperate to escape from the confinement of her home to independence. When a precious sword known as the ""Green Destiny"" is stolen, this places Shi Lien and Mu Bai on a heart-racing showdown against the person responsible for the priceless weapon.<br/><br/>If director Ang Lee proves anything crucial, it is that he has an incredible gift of balancing pulse-pounding martial arts action sequences and a compelling epic story; a task even some of the most ambitious struggle to pull off nowadays. In shocking efforts, Ang Lee manages to pull this off in ways that is truly phenomenal. Unsurprisingly, the biggest attention grabber here is of course, the martial arts action sequences where audiences sit back and watch our characters engage an exhilarating martial arts fist fighting and frenetic swordplay. What makes these action scenes really stand out aside from the hefty cinematography by Peter Pau is the eye-popping choreography the boost the ferocity of the sword-to-sword (and hand-to-hand) combat. If these sequences feel reminiscent to the martial arts combat in the sci-thriller 'The Matrix', that is because the choreography is orchestrated by Yuen Wo Ping who collaborated with The Wachowksis to conduct the fight choreography in The Matrix as well. Only in this film, the fight sequences are even more impressive and poetic than we saw Neo engaging in the brutal hand-to-hand brawl against Mr. Smith, especially when considering the lengthy takedown sequence into the restaurant.<br/><br/>For a filmmaker like Ang Lee, it is only expected that he expands the film's stylish grandeur with not only the nifty production design to present an authentic setting of 19th century China, but also a solidly written story to drive the film's substance. Fortunately, this film blesses filmgoers with an astounding narrative heft that not only feels original but spawns plenty of emotional arrest. The masterminds by this feat is writers Wang Hui-Long, James Schamus, and Tsai Kuo Jong who have the blissful taste of powerful characterization and vibrant storytelling. The writers tap into to themes of relationships, love, and betrayal; and use them as coherent building blocks to form an awe-inspiring story along with some stellar characters. Yu Shi Lien and Li Mu Bai who are portrayed gracefully by Michelle Yeoh and Chow-Yun Fat respectively make for some intriguing, heroic characters with both humanity and adrenaline-fueled testosterone (mostly in the action sequences). But by far the biggest show stealer in the bunch is the indulgent Jen Yu who is empowered with a riveting performance by Zhang Ziyi. Jen spawns to life as a mysterious character wired with powerful emotional complexity that drives the emotional atmosphere of each scene until the very end of the film. Whenever this characters come on screen, she immediately grabs a hold of our eyes and never lets go.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a masterful martial arts epic empowered by a sweeping narrative heft and exhilarating martial arts action, and blossoms into a explosively entertaining experience. At best, it is an electrifying piece of foreign cinema that places Ang Lee in the high ranks of Hollywood filmmakers. To say the least, the film is a an eye-dazzling masterpiece."

","Easily my favourite of Lee's films, plus this was a no-brainer for me to watch, since I love martial arts films and the three stars. Peter Pau's cinematography and Dun Tan's soundtrack deservedly won two of the four Oscars, amidst its ten nominations, but even though the production values and story were the reason that this, rather than more significant martial arts classics, such as 'The 36th Chamber of Shaolin' and other Shaw Brothers' masterpieces of the genre is that it stepped outside the box and became mandatory viewing for both genders and all cultures with its love story, in the same way that 'Rocky' isn't simply a boxing movie. Still fascinating watching today, and the scene in which the restaurant is destroyed is one of the most fascinating set-pieces I have yet seen.<br/><br/>Just afterwards, I was watching a behind-the-scenes featurette on 'L.A. Confidential', which I hope to watch soon, and director Curtis Hanson had the completely antithetical approach to that film, for he said he wanted to make the surroundings great, yes, but kept in the background so that the acting performances captured the viewer's attention and shone through. It's a shame that Michelle Yeoh, Yun-Fat Chow and Ziyi Zhang weren't nominated for Oscars, but I believe that was why: Our attention was so much on the production values and the story that unfortunately the actors left less of an indelible imprint on us than they deserved to."

Chow Yun-Fat stars as a warrior who quits training upon failing to save his master who was poisoned by Jade Fox. He gives up the Green Destiny Sword, which is eventually stolen by a masked assailant. Michelle Yeoh is given a wonderfully bold role as a female warrior who pursues the assailant who is discovered to be a female herself. Beautifully written containing the most awesome and original martial arts footage ever shot. Brilliant fight sequences take place on roof tops, horseback and tree tops. Characters drift about aimlessly as if floating. This symbolizes the nature of martial arts. Miraculous job by Ang Lee and quite a departure from his previous film The Ice Storm. Yun-Fat is excellent as the guilt-ridden warrior. Yeoh presents strong an noble female character, and Zhang Ziyi steals the film as a rebellious girl offered in marriage yet finds love in the most extraordinary and unlikely place. Chang Chen plays a bandit who gains more than he bargained for when he he is pursued by what becomes a most intriguing relationship.

","A film like this comes around once every 2000 years. It has so many points of interest that I would no doubt have to create a film just to explore them! As human beings, we are free to use our senses, emotions, intelligence & inspiration to seek enlightenment. But instead, we have created a society hinged upon avarice, forged in fear, stunted by traditions & institution & sealed with an unhealthy desire for distraction. Living in these primitive times frustrates me, & foreseeing just how far man shall go to maintain such a dull & predictably dire way of life fills me with despair & self-inflicted peril. The principles hidden in this film touch on the future's way of thinking; when all the resources have been squandered, & we are reduced to re-assess the circumstances of 'living' & 'dying'. <br/><br/>Every single character in this film displays an intractable dilapidation from the demands society imposes upon them. We have the elder female servant who was denied training due to her gender even though the passion was present. The young government official who covets an opposite life of free will, feral love & irresponsibility. A rogue who found a home following the stars, but who is forced to conform to a life of aristocratic servitude for love. Then we have a woman of age who has the flexible pilgrim lifestyle but is destitute of honest expression; bound by love from a man of 'mind over matter' who looses his will to strong emotional confliction to both ""Love"" AND ""Hate""! It all ramifies so perfectly. <br/><br/>""Only by letting go can we finally possess what is real"". <br/><br/>The philosophy behind this fairytale is perhaps lost on westerners of vacuity & subservience. My friend was only invested in the ""Who Dunit"" aspects at the start, & fell asleep by the sword fight scene. And my farther grunted uncomfortably as to cavil at every meaningful scene like some over gorged sebaceous parliamentary private secretary. Sometimes I wonder if I am the only person on the planet who acknowledges profound contemplation & introspection. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is startlingly sparse & fleeting at times but is never hidden within frenetic edits with Adobe After FX abound. Some of the shots look a bit washed & grainy but it really just adds to the ethos of a dream-like picture. You're on the brink of romance & illusion at all times; sometimes questioning your every decision in life, & what life truly is. <br/><br/>I have to mention the score. At first, you don't think much of it. The drums of the first fight scene are typical of overused cues today. But as the film & tension climbs, the music responds ten fold. Tan Dun launches you into masterpiece after masterpiece with an extremely intimate reduction of highly disciplined players. It is extremely contemporary, & woes you into a euphoric trance. It's hard not to fall in love with both Michelle & the celestial Ziyi Zhang as they reign conflict in this world of wonder. And the composer maybe did a too good -a job here because it is so unlike anything you've heard from any other score; it haunts you to re-watch it for those captivating moments when capitulating gliding strings hypnotize as the counterparts climb swaying bamboo to a enchanted uncharted canopy. It really stings my senses raw. <br/><br/>It's a shame that there's news of a ""sequel"" coming to light. It will without a doubt lack the impact of this masterpiece, & shall be a detriment to it's name. Mark my words, the sequel shall only cash in on the success of this title & belittle the underlining allegorical struggles of this story; the corporate world I originally abnegated returning to destroy the glimpse of deeper discontent this film bestowed on us. <br/><br/>This film will always have a place in my heart; Jen shall always resonate with my arrogance of youth, desire to be free from family, society & institution, & most of all.. she shall tell the story of the lost potential of such a lack of discipline. <br/><br/>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon may have a long winded & misunderstood name.

","*********POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS********** <br/><br/>Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow)is a retired warrior and something of a legend amongst his community. Li Mu Bai possesses a sword called 'Green Destiny' and although this sword has brought Li some joy, it also carries a lot of painful memories. Following a conversation with his friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), he decides to leave his sword in the care of Sir Te (Sihung Lung) who acts as 'custodian' for the sword. However, when the sword is stolen, Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien do everything in the power to recover the sword.<br/><br/>For me, this was a very well written film which really focuses on three aspects; MORALITY, CHOICES, AND CONSEQUENCES. It's clear that Li and Yu both care deeply for one another and later it's also revealed that they both have feelings for each other. However, it's also revealed that Yu was engaged to Li's brother before he was tragically killed in battle. Both Li and Yu subdue their feelings in order to respect the memory of Li's brother. It would probably be fair to assume that Li's brother probably wouldn't want Yu to be unhappy, but Li and Yu are both respectable and have a real sense of morality and loyalty towards Li's brother and therefore decide to keep their relationship platonic. The relationship between Li and Yu is one of the main underlying themes within this film - again they had a choice to be together, but felt that it would be morally wrong for them to be together. Due to all this back story, a romance would have been believable, but the writers keep this on the back burner which ultimately gives the audience plenty to think about.<br/><br/>The second major focal point in this film is Jen (Ziyi Zhang) who is a young woman who is being forced by her parents to marry someone who she doesn't love - again this topic is mentioned, but isn't treated in a heavy handed way and in some ways is only mentioned to get more of an understanding of Jen's confusion at this point in her life. In some ways, Jen is a bit of a cliché in that she's a messed up young woman that is searching for some direction in life. Her characters themes are CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCES; Jen is taken under the wing by evil Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng). Jade is the person who was responsible for the death of Li's master and therefore he has a score to settle with her. For Jen, this is about CHOICES; throughout the film, both Li and Yu try to recruit her as a disciple, but Jen has always been a free spirit and is less than co-operative. Likewise, although we're lead to believe that she's allied with Jade Fox I tended to get the feeling that she wasn't really on anyone's side - after all, she hid the training manual from Jade so it's clear that she doesn't have much loyalty towards Jade either. Ultimately, Jen's choices lead to CONSEQUENCES and by the end of the film there are both positive and negative CONSEQUENCES that result from her actions.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the film is also wonderfully filmed with some of the most beautiful cinematography that I've ever seen. It's pretty to look at, but it also has the substance to back it up. The fight choreography is excellent and as mentioned the film was emotionally engaging and very well-written.<br/><br/>CTHD is a very good film which is filled with underlying themes focusing on love, betrayal, morality, choices and consequences. It really is a 'work of art'."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo Hu Cang Long)- Taiwan 2000 Review<br/><br/>This is film #2 on the film list. This movie was awesome. I hate referencing and comparing movies but this movie was what I thought of as a Matrix meets Western in Asia. The film is stunningly visual with the concepts as well as amazingly realist with the fights. If you didn't pay attention, you might have thought this be a true story of a magic sword, the story telling is that good. But once you saw people fly off rooftops or fight on a thin bamboo tree you might think differently.<br/><br/>This movie, from a Directing standpoint was amazing. I can only applaud Ang Lee, how does he do it. This had his fingerprints all over it too. The fight scenes had the most dramatic and beautifully capturing and captivating camera angles, but then when the movie slowed and came to a emotional or less serious scene, it was stunning his way of capturing emotion. His directing in this type of movie=second to none.<br/><br/>Much of the story and concept confused me until clarification. As this is the only film that is live action that I am watching with English Dub instead of subtitles. The movie had some plot holes but it was well made up for by the beautiful and emotional fight scenes.<br/><br/>SilverRating: 7/10"
"christos200","8","0","0","10 March 2014"," A very good, but overrated film
","Being more a fan of 70's Hong Kong Kung Fu films (mainly Shaw Brothers) and not a fan of more modern Kung Fu films that overuse CGI, I was reluctant at first to see this film. However, after reading many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint me. In fact, it impressed. However, I still believe that this film is kinda overrated.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat complex, although easy to understand, and has to do with a rare Sword of great power, the Green Destiny Sword, being stolen, a young aristocratic woman, Jen Yu, who is in love with a bandit, Lo 'Dark Cloud', and a Kung Fu Master, Master Li Mu Bai, who tries to find the sword.<br/><br/>The plot is quite good, as well as the acting, and it is surely better (in terms of plot) than most Kung Fu films I have seen. The plot, although complex, it is, as I have already mentioned above, very easy to understand. My personally favorite character is Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow), who gave an excellent performance.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, although sometimes overuse the supernatural element, are quite good. While not as good as in old 70's Kung Fu movies, the choreography is exciting and very well done.<br/><br/>Overall, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the better Kung Fu films I have seen. But still, I believe that people who view this as the ""best"" Kung Fu movie or a ""masterpiece"" are overrating it. Although it is a quite good movie and it impressed me, I have seen other Kung Fu movies which I consider better, like One Armed Swordsman (1967), Blood Brothers (1973), Snake in the Eagle's Shadow (1978) and Young Master (1980). So, while a quite good film, I would not say that it is the best Kung Fu film."

","When Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out i've been fanatically into fitness. Watching fighters flying across screen seemed like a reasonable outcome of the right exercise boosted by mediation, despite being physically impossible, at least at the current stage of human evolution.<br/><br/>The movie offered a good story, albeit slightly melodramatic. And the overall production quality was impressive, to say the least.<br/><br/>Then i talked to some people from China and it turned out that Wuxia is a well established movie genre merging kung-fu action with romantic stories.

","It is rare when a foreign language film has the ability to grab the attention of my fifteen-year-old nephew and me, but this movie is extraordinary. We read the subtitles and did not feel like we were missing any details -- only that a world had suddenly been opened for us to view. Since we saw this film, we have discussed it and persuaded others to experience this enchantment. Every so often we talk about this movie and plan to see it many more times. This DVD should be shown in wide-angle format in order to see all of the majesty captured on cellulose.<br/><br/>The script creates a perfectly logical connection between fantasy and reality, logic and irrationality, and mythology and truth. This flow makes it easy to suspend disbelief and be completely entrapped within the breathtaking beauty and fierce fights of the movie.<br/><br/>Yun-Fat Chow is Li Mu Bai, and he displays a spiritual countenance that is the center of a true martial arts master. His life has been in service and honor toward the sword *The Green Destiny.* The complexities of his life and his choices are only a background for the intricacies of romance, tragedy, heroism, and philosophy that are woven with precise skill and art throughout this astonishing movie.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) and Zhang Ziy (Jen) become acquaintances, then friends, then sisters, and finally enemies. The transitions are created by the strong will of the young princess (Zhang) who ultimately learns the value of friendship, but at great cost. She is well trained in the ninja arts by Li Mu Bai's ancient arch nemesis. This training is significant because rivals do tend to reveal the inadequacies of their opponents while assuring their young students with victory.<br/><br/>The action scenes are stimulating and plausible though the stunts are physically impossible -- or so it seems. What is most amazing is that these impossible stunts were real! The actors did the scenes, perhaps stunt doubles for some, though I doubt it because of Ang Lee's determination for accuracy. When the warriors fly through the air, fight on the sides of building, chase across the rooftops, or fight high in the bamboo trees they did exactly that. These were not created through simulation and the magic of technology.<br/><br/>After the scenes were filmed then the digital artists worked to remove the equipment that helped the actors complete the feats. The visions of China and the exciting ninja action captured my imagination.<br/><br/>Ang Lee required the actors to learning to speak Mandarin Chinese. The language accuracy may not seem important to those of us who do not speak Chinese, but it is the difference between cultures within China. I was left with the feeling that I had spent time in a sacred place.<br/><br/>Throughout the film there is the artistry of the music. Segments will take you to dreamland while other sequences will cause a rush of adrenaline. It is as if you are riding on a magic carpet -- you are there.<br/><br/>I purchased two DVDs -- one for me and one for my nephew -- *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* is that good.<br/><br/>It is better than five stars for the director (Ang Lee), cinematography, choreography, film editing, script, actors, action, philosophy, and emotions. This movie won Best Picture in the Foreign Language category at the Academy Awards; and it deserved the honor."

","No matter what Oscar says. I knew as soon as I saw this movie nominated for both best foreign film and best picture that it would definitely win best foreign, and fall to gladiator for best picture. While I enjoyed Gladiator a great deal, it is a crime that CTHD did not win the award it so richly deserved: Best Picture of the year 2000. When I first went to see this film, I was among the hordes who were blown away by the stunning cinematography, incredible action choreography and amazing wire work. Truly a remarkable action film with amazing filming on location. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so brilliantly green as the bamboo forest that is but a small location shot in this movie. The first viewing proved to me that I loved this film, but it did not prove to me that it was the best picture of the year. That took 2 viewings. I highly recommend to anyone who has seen this film and enjoyed it that you go see it again. I found (since I don't speak Chinese) that seeing it a second time while already knowing the story allowed me to concentrate less on reading subtitles, and more on the actors and their performances. It was amazing to me to peel back the layers of the initially strong performances in this film and see the incredible amount of nuance that each of the leads provided in their portrayals. After seeing it the second time, I had a whole new take on almost every piece of dialog in the film. The first scene between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh most definitely sets the tone for this film, and contrary to what many would have you believe it is not a tone of rollicking action/adventure. It is instead a tone of yearning, tragedy and love found too late, then lost. This movie, packed with stunning fights and amazing flying martial artists is not so much about fighting, as it is about the Chinese values of loyalty, honor and duty, and how these admirable values can ultimately keep one from truly being happy. It is the story of a love denied too long, and accepted too late. I am not ashamed to say that I wept openly at the end of this film both times that I saw it. The power of the story and the performances were so strong that I felt a small shadow of the loss that the characters in the film felt, and even this small shadow was enough to make me weep. For those of you who find nothing but swordfights and blood in this movie, nothing I can say will change your mind; but for those who have an inkling that this film is about much more than fighting and bloodshed, go see it again and buy it when it is released on DVD. You will not for one instant be sorry that you did."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is simply a masterpiece. A brilliant film with great performances by its stars, Michelle Yeoh, Chow yun fat, and especially Zhang Ziyi. Director Ang Lee along with his choreographer tell this epic story in a stunning and creative visual way that makes this film one of the greatest ever made. The action scenes in this film are jaw dropping, and are unmatched by any action film ever made. Along with the action, is a great story and great characters that reflect influences from Lord of the Rings, and parallel the Jedi of the Star Wars trilogy, but remain consistent with the eastern culture and philosophy which permeates throughout the story. In fact, the main characters, especially Jen, portrayed by the talented Zhang Ziyi , seem to question that philosophy and culture throughout the film, almost rebelling against it. This is foreshadowed in the beginning of the film when Yun-fat's character describes how his meditation leads him to a place of sorrow instead of enlightenment. In a later scene, Yeoh 's character questions the buddhist teaching of Fat's character in relation to their suppressed love, pointing out the touch of her hand is real,not an illusion, even though it is of this world. However it is also the discipline of this eastern spirituality that gives these knights their power. the main character Jen, abuses this power, along with the power given to her when she possesses the Green Destiny, a magical and powerful sword, owned by the wizard -like, or jedi- like, character portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat. The Green Destiny, much like the ring of power in lord of the rings, or the force in Star Wars, becomes a power that threatens to consume Jen. Throughout the film , Jen rebels against the traditions of the easten culture and philosophy. Even during the action scenes, as Chow Yun-Fat's character scolds her, she responds by telling him to stop talking like a monk and fight. Her rebellion is also reflected in her love for a barbarian that lives in the desert. Jen's rebellion is an extreme one, however, that leads to such deep despair, that it leaves the viewer to question if even the true love she found in the desert can save her. This movie has everything one wants in an epic, great story, acting, cinematography, directing, score. This film should win an Oscar for Best Picture... Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is truly a great film."

","Director Ang Lee (Sense & Sensibility) has created an epic tale of love, honor, devotion, and intrigue set against a backdrop of 19th century China. When Li Mu Bai (Chow Yung Fat) decides to give the infamous ""Green Destiny"" sword to his good friend it sets in motion a story of breathtaking passion whether it's a sword fight in a courtyard or a gentle touching of the hands at a table. The acting is superb especially Ziyi Zhang with her porcelein doll looks but lightining quick moves manifesting itself throughout the film especially in the restaurant scene. Chow Yung Fat (Li Mu Bai) and Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) play their roles to perfection on two levels, they are great warriors but understate their strengths due to their teachings from the Masters...and the relationship between them is on the surface benign but we know they are madly in love with one another. Then we have Chen Chang (Lo) who sweeps Jen Yu off her feet like Michael Douglas did to Kathleen Turner in ""Romancing The Stone"". Pei Pei Cheng plays ""Jade Fox"" nicely as the betrayer but deep down inside someone you can feel sorry for. The action sequences were masterfully choreograghed by Yuen Wo-Ping (The Matrix) as he was able to blend the movements like a Kirov Ballet. Add to this the thunder and fury of the music of Tan Dun for the fighting/action scenes and the beautiful and melodic cello work of Yo-Yo-Ma to bring out the love and passion of the central characters you soon realize your senses are experiencing something special. Only a few films have done that to me in the past...it would be an understatement to simply say i think this is the best film of 2000-2001 since that would be accepting it on just a physical sense but when it touches your mind and soul in ways words can't describe it goes way beyond that."

","Every now and then I happen across a film that seems to etch itself into my consciousness and cultural view of the world. These are the cinematic masterpieces that in part build up my identity. They're the films that fill my Top Ten or Twenty lists and which I find myself quoting or using as comparison for other films.<br/><br/>What then makes a movie one of my personal cinematic masterpieces? Sometimes it's the story, that razor sharp writing that either keeps surprising me or goes exactly as I want it to go. Sometimes it's a singular character, a realization of a archetype I've formed in my head, given form in the silver screen.<br/><br/>In Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that something is both the world of mystical China with its swaying bamboo forests, meticulously decorated houses and vibrant colours, and it's also the art of human movement, of martial arts and swordplay. For me this film embodies those two things. This is the film I think about whenever either of those topics is brought up. This is the milestone used for comparison.<br/><br/>One other things that elevates a film above its peers is the intangible feeling of weight, the feeling of belonging, tradition and history. It's the sense that the camera could walk around any corner, follow any character or even go looking for another story altogether and it would find something. A sense of fullness and realism, even if its a world of fantasy warriors capable of leaping thirty feet in the air with a single jump. And that can only come when everything works together perfectly. The actors have to fully immerse themselves into their roles, the production values and special effects have to convince the viewer, the story has to have enough weight to pull the viewer in without hesitations. This movie has that.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating film, a journey unlike any other and well worth taking. One of my personal favourites and definitely an easy recommendation."

","Yes, you heard that right. At its essence, Ang Lee's fable of fated warriors and princesses is a resurfacing into the universe of myth and legend. It takes place in Ancient China, perhaps of the Han Dynasty era, but the story is adaptable to any time frame or location. The cast of archetypal characters are our superheroes, Jedi-knights, apprentices, swashbucklers, the martial art of the Wudang is the secret power, the force, the sorcerer's magic, and the sword called 'Green Destiny' is the artifact, buried treasure, or the maguffin. <br/><br/>It is a world of fairytale and high fantasy, brought to vivid life by the imagination of Ang Lee. The character's are multi-faceted and believable, and the tale is one of life affirmation. Good and evil are not painted in broad strokes of black and white, contrary to what many critics have said previously, but legend is transformed into a realistic analysis of the human condition.<br/><br/>They say the film was a massive hit in the US, and a notorious flop in China. This is not so inconceivable, as the film as certain 'anti- Eastern' sentiments and more global, humanist tendencies that put it in league with certain works by Shakespeare. The story doesn't denounce any particular facets of Chinese culture. Tradition and homegrown philosophy are shown to be advantageous to those that live by honour and the sword, and perilous to those that live lives of imbalance and despair. Jealousy and hubris are the undoing of many, and while the Buddhist and Taoist quest for enlightenment is detailed by the protagonist of Mi Lu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), his 'great sorrow' is a symptom of the greatest human emotion known to the world. <br/><br/>Is the film perfect? No, not at all. The plot hops around, and while it doesn't ruin the experience, what needed to be a 3 hour epic was reduced to a 2 hour engagement with a giant detour in the middle that relied on too much back story. But it is a wonderful back story. This is not a film about superpowers, as spectacular, unmatched and jaw-dropping as these effects and scenes remain some 13 years later. But it is a simple coming of age tale and warning against unrequited love. It is a confirmation of companionship, and for that, Ang Lee and his team deserved the highest praises.<br/><br/>The real all-encompassing epic and Best Picture of the year 2000."

","From the piercing sound effects of the swords, to the beauty in the sets and costumes, and the folksy-Chinese-proverb-esque music, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a visual feast. The cinematography pops the color out of the sets like flowers in a Chinese garden, but philosophical questions are a constant output by the film's characters. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon also benefits guidance from it's excellent performance of subtleties by Michelle Yeoh.<br/><br/>This may be an earlier effort, but with Ang Lee's name on the director's title, we know we're in for kicked-visual ass and a strong hand in the truth on the page of the screenplay. Lee does the famous fight scenes justice with poetry and ballet mannerisms surrounding the startling violence and precise choreography. The screenplay draws interesting parallels between its two primary couples and remixes the an Asian-Western feeling amongst the romance. Some of the scripted lines are like opening a new fortune cookie every ten minutes with insightful meaning. An example: ""Whatever path you decide to take in this life... be true to yourself,"" and ""There is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.""<br/><br/>Problems arise, however. Some of the other dialogue in the script feels like it was generically selected from soap operas, which doesn't lessen the script's highs, but certainly creates some inconsistency in the quality. During the fabulous sword fighting scenes, a distracting element is the fantasy brought to the table. I know it was fantastically intentional, but the character's embodying Superman's ability to fly does acquire an eye roll here or there, especially with its final act. A tonal alteration at the start of Act 2 abruptly changes the course of the story, which could cause momentary vertigo.<br/><br/>Because the main character does so much to compromise our view of her moral actions, the film drives an open to interpretation opportunity. Ang Lee believes in her, but wants us to believe in her on our own terms. The topic of liberation is exposed to the audience a good number of times before the finale, through conversations that literally discuss it. It's the vital ingredient to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that poses a question for the ending, as well as an emotional sting.<br/><br/>Rating: 8<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

I don't have much to complain about other aspects but the wuxia action segments are so exaggerated here that it simply took the seriousness out of the story for me.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon does score from an artistic standpoint and works best when approached as a fantasy. In my reviews for other martial arts features, I've made no secret of my disdain for this overly-stylised action choreography unless it's marketed as a comedy, so even if my rating may seem a bit harsh to the die-hard fans of this film, it has less to do with the film's quality and more with my inability to appreciate such gems.

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a grand depiction in Wuxia style film. Director, Ang Lee, creates a wonderful dynamic in a situation high in intensity. There is a constant pressure between fighting factions, but an underlying level of respect is still conveyed, much in the Wuxia style. The actors and actresses seem to portray their roles with class and exacting without ever over acting; their work makes some of the film's surrealism appear to be normal, believable. From a cinematographic perspective, the camera angles and filming style make the often small scale battles scenes seem of the utmost intensity. The skills of the camera people make the viewer feel as if they were in the same scene as the combatant. The choice in setting accompanies this nicely, with some scenes being placed in beautiful, captivating locations. In all, this is one of the most interesting and well done foreign films I've seen, especially on such a small budget."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is probably one of the most acclaimed foreign language films of all time, and rightfully so. It is one of those movies that, even if you don't love it, you still find it hard to truly dislike. The film tells the story of two warriors in search of a legendary sword that was recently stolen. The trail leads them to a teenage warrior who is going through a difficult part of her life as she has to choose between two worlds that she has become involved in. One is with royalty, the other with a fugitive who she is madly in love with. This is a hypnotic film with a certain quiet beauty to it that is as immaculate as it is raw. The film is pure, alive, and practically flawless as far as filmmaking goes from a technical point of view.<br/><br/>It is a film like this that comes to mind when I think epic scale production. This film is grand, glorious, and mighty. And yet it is also gentle, dainty, and beautiful. It is this contrast that so mystifies the mind as you watch it and makes this film very different from any you have ever seen before. I found myself not so much moved by this film, but rather entranced. Throughout the film I was still, focused, and attentive. The film draws you in very slowly and it plays with you as you learn more about the characters and the film itself.<br/><br/>The story here is more complex than average and you have to work to keep up with it, especially with all the odd subtitled names. I'll admit that I got lost a few times but I didn't have much trouble catching back up and keeping up to date with everything going on. This film actually plays a fairly cruel trick on you. You think it is very straightforward and won't be difficult to follow. However, as the film goes on you begin to realize that it is much less accessible than you at first thought. You realize this after you've been lulled into this false sense of security, then you have fallen behind and you miss a lot of what has been going on. I still really liked this film, despite being fooled by it, so I definitely feel like it deserves a re-watch.<br/><br/>Now, for whatever reason, the people in this film can fly. Yes, fly. Unless I missed it, it is never explained why they can do this, and you just have to take it for granted. But the beauty of it is that you do take this for granted and you quickly buy into the idea that these characters can fly, just because of how well this element is utilized. The martial arts fight scenes in this film are just astounding to watch. The beautiful choreography of these fights turn them more into immaculate dances than actual fight scenes. And they are shot with the utmost care and keen eye for detail. You never miss a single swipe for punch through Ang Lee's fabulous direction of these fights. At first I wanted to call the fights in this movie awesome. But then I realized I was wrong. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Star Wars is awesome. Saving Private Ryan is awesome. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is beautiful.<br/><br/>This is a very good film. It tells an epic story that enthralls you from start to finish, throwing in incredibly well orchestrated fights that astound the mind while entertaining the eye. It takes effort to fully appreciate this films story and everything else about it, but it is an effort worth spending. This film is unlike any I've ever seen before and that should be reason enough to call it a great film."

While it does not move easily between differing emotions or genres, there is nonetheless something for everyone in the film's beauty, action and emotion. Not quite the masterpiece many credit it with being, it remains a curious watch which, at times, is richly rewarding."
"colebt33-780-179547","9","0","0","23 July 2010"," Ang Lee blends action and romance with strong production values resulting in one good Wu Xia film.
","I haven't seen many Chinese films in my early years so I wouldn't know much about Wu Xia, but apparently it's a broad sort of film genre that evolved from Chinese fictions concerning the adventures of martial artists set in ancient China. Ang Lee had mentioned quite a few times that he wanted to make a Wu Xia film, and I don't see why he shouldn't, it sounds like a very interesting scenario that would definitely attract some audiences. Finally he followed through with it in the year 2000 and received immaculate results from both Chinese and American viewers. It went on to being nominated for 10 Academy awards, coming out victorious in four categories including Best Foreign Language Film.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a wonderful experience with excellent production qualities and a near perfect line up of Chinese actors. There's so much to like about this film that it makes it almost impossible to deny its brilliance.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is a story of passion, revenge, tradition and above all things, love powered by three main characters. Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are two warriors and long time friend's that both have deep feelings for each other, but past and current events keep them from admitting their true feelings. Jen Yu is the young governor's daughter who is unsure of where or who her heart and loyalty lies with, her master, her love, or herself. Jen seems like a confused mind. She makes rash decisions and jumps from place to place with no real intentions, which is actually something I noticed in a lot of the characters in this movie. The decisions they make don't seem to keep within their character very often and their intentions are seen as unclear throughout most of the film. The story progresses somewhat aimlessly making it difficult to appreciate, never the less it doesn't stop the story from taking toll with the themes nor does it lower interest in the invigoratingly romantic scenes and the oddly appealing conflicted relationships between characters.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's really hard not to like this movie. There so much to offer that it stages out all possible criticisms and eliminates any doubt that it will appeal to audiences of all kinds. Like for example if your one of those action folk that are not really into the touchy, feely love story, no worries, your needs will be satisfied with Crouching Tiger. The martial arts choreography is kick-ass fantastic that matches some of the best Matrix inspired films, and while I found the wire-work in this movie to be way to obvious it was nice to see an action flick that wasn't ruled by visual editing, I guess that's Ang Lee's take on traditional Wu Xia film making. He takes us back to a time where we didn't have advanced computer programs to distract people from the decreasing population of good storytellers. Mr Lee proved himself to be a good storyteller for that very reason and I applaud him for it.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in my opinion Ang Lee's best achievement ever. He takes hold of us visually and emotionally and it's very hard to let go. I highly advise you to see this movie, it's beautiful and breathtaking, you will love it so many ways."

","Versatile director Ang Lee (""The Ice Storm,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") made a certain type of Chinese martial arts film a crossover hit with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and it's only because of this film that later similar movies, like ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" received even the attention they did in America.<br/><br/>""Tiger/Dragon"" is the kind of movie that feels more profound than it actually is, because all of the lines are delivered in a foreign language and with stoic import. But the plot and ideas are really just typical kung fu movie melodrama -- and that's not a criticism. The movie takes flight, as any good martial arts movie does, when it's fighting, and the combatants literally take to the air, defying the laws of gravity to chase each other through roof and tree tops.<br/><br/>And it certainly doesn't hurt that we get the twin eye candy of Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang.<br/><br/>""Tiger/Dragon"" became only the third film (""Z"" and ""Life Is Beautiful"" being the others) to be nominated for both Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars in the same year.

","One of the best and most stylish martial arts films of all time. The choreography and wire-work that was so impressive back in 2000, is still just as awesome today.<br/><br/>I've watched my fair share of martial arts flicks, both old and new, and none of them convey the ""art"" part of martial arts as effectively as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The action scenes are so graceful and mesmerizing that they almost seem like ballet. Every fight scene is a visual feast, with people flying, floating, leaping, and running straight up walls. And each scene manages to be more impressive than the last. It's poetry in motion. <br/><br/>And pleasantly, there's a nice, story to serve as a background to the action. It's nothing you haven't seen before. A  rebellious young woman, forbidden love, revenge, etc. It's all simple and well-presented. All in all, there's not another modern martial arts film that I'd recommend over Crouching Tiger. It chooses to be elegant and restrained instead of gory and brutal, and it's a better movie for it."

","This was my introduction to Chinese martial arts films so when I first saw it I had no idea what to expect, I just knew it had raked in quite a few awards. I really enjoyed it from the start although I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gravity defying fight scenes although they were easy accept once I'd realised such action was just part of the genre.<br/><br/>The film opens with Li Mu Bai, a martial arts master played by Chow Yun Fat, giving his sword to Yu Shu Lien the wife of his late brother played by Michelle Yeoh, so that she can take it to Peking and give it to his old friend Sir Te as he wants to retire from fighting. Soon after Governor Yu and his family come to Peking and the sword is stolen by a mysterious stranger who appears to be part of the Governor's retinue. Yu Shu Lien befriends the governor's daughter Jen, played by Zhang Ziyi, who is due to be married but would rather become a fighter like Yu Shu Lien. As the story progresses Li Mu Bai returns and believes his nemesis Jade Fox is involved in the theft of the sword and sets out to find her. Tied in with the action plot there is also a romance involving Jen and a desert bandit called Lo, also known as Dark Cloud.<br/><br/>The acting was very good through out, especially Zhang Ziyi's portrayal of Jen who I considered to be the main character despite her not getting top billing, I suppose that is down to her being a less established actress at the time it was made. The cinematography was excellent showing a variety of stunning Chinese scenery varying from a bare desert to a beautiful bamboo forest. As one would expect the fighting scenes are very well choreographed less expected were the moments of humour which I felt added to the film. I would certainly recommend this film; I enjoyed it enough to seek out other examples of the genre."

","Here's the good news: this film has finally brought much-deserved attention to Chinese film-making, and for that I am very grateful. The bad news is that it's a shame that it took Chow Yun Fat and the martial arts angle to make Chinese movies accessible to mainstream audiences. While this is definitely a quality film (it has especially beautiful direction and photography), it is still sub-standard when compared to some other Chinese films of recent years. If this was your first Chinese film and you enjoyed other features besides the martial arts/fantasy (e.g. the lovely storytelling, the expressive faces, passionate emotions, and gorgeous backdrops), then put these other Chinese movies on your list of must-sees: """"Xiu Xiu"", ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""To Live"", ""The Story of Qui Ju"", ""Not One Less"", ""Temptress Moon"", ""Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker"", and ""Farewell My Concubine."" If you liked Michelle Yeoh, you will love Gong Li. The bottom line is that Chinese films are in a league of their own. Compared to most of the Hollywood big studio stuff out there, this film shines. Compared to the films I've listed above, it's just pretty good."
"natalielyk","10","0","0","13 April 2008"," An American Chinese Classic
","I've watched this film twice, and plan to watch it again soon. I registered myself just so i can comment on this film. as a Chinese who has grown up with Wuxia films and loves the genre very much, i felt i needed to put my two cents worth. after reading about 1000 comments here, there are a few things to be clarified. first off, this is NOT a martial arts film. this is a DRAMA infused with martial arts. 'wirefu' is something common in wuxia films and even those like once upon a time in china, etc... secondly, the fact that they 'fly' is something we Chinese fantasy movie-goers don't even question so imagine my surprise when i find out the main dissenters complain of the implausibility of flying in a movie like this. given, when i first watched this film i was slightly disappointed because of the over-hype, and i thought the 'flying' bit was done a bit too easily, but the thing that sets this film apart from your regular wuxia film of the late '80s and early '90s is the acting. it's very westernized in that sense, something unique since prior to this i certainly didn't watch wuxia films for the acting. it was mostly for the jin Yong-esquire plots. however, this movie grows on you with repeated watching. at first i thought zhang ziyi was the scene stealer, but now i know it's really Michelle yeoh who's the powerhouse. her eyes... man, anyone who's not blind can see how deeply she yearns from Li mu bai. and at first i thought chow yuan fat was a bit too... well, chow yuan fat, in that he didn't bring anything new to this and seemed so cold towards Michelle's character but i've come to realise he had to play it that way or else the two would have been together right from the start. very strong supporting cast. and the story seems superficially simple but really, it's multi-layered as are the characters. just use your brain and imagination for once. thank you Ang for not spoon feeding us. after a while, i've accepted Ang lee's vision of wuxia, which is slightly different from our wuxia films, and certainly nothing most westerners have seen. i envy them because now they can be enthralled as i once was by classics like bride with white hair, swordsman 2, ashes of time (which i thought was very similar to this), dragon inn... the list is near endless. only superficial people will think this movie is plot less and think it's just about retrieving a stolen sword. there's so much more and it all depends on the viewer's willingness to participate in the film. I'm also surprised how i did not pick up the feminist themes, i should have, but i put it down to the fact that most Chinese films (think Brigitte Lin and Michelle yeoh films - and a whole lot more) have strong female characters, so it felt like another Chinese film. and the funniest part is how ppl say this is a matrix and star wars copycat. get your facts straight, Joel Schumacher hired yen woo ping so obviously they were influenced by hk cinema, and George Lucas referenced Chinese folklore so there you go. i'm also amused how foreigners draw analogies from star wars, peter pan, etc. i'm sorry guys, you have been deprived. the genre isn't new, but an lee made it his own. and i thank him profusely for reigniting the genre which has died out since Brigitte Lin retired. i think this film should have gotten best picture only because that Oscar year was crap, my reservations due to the fact that wuxia isn't new, but Michelle yeoh was robbed of an Oscar nod. so sad. it's so easy to overlook her because she wasn't given the opportunity to run free as zhang ziyi's character could, but her soulful eyes, fierce combat, and having to do this in a language that's nearly completely foreign to her. i don't mind her accent since i'm a 'banana' myself-yellow on the outside, white on the inside. her performance was so minimalist and nuanced, in stark contrast with her fight scenes, i hope the woman never retires! it's also sad how ppl give this a 1 star rating just to bring down the overall rank. childish. again, this is not a martial arts film, it's a drama take on the wuxia genre. so stop drawing comparisons with Jackie Chan. it's like asking why wasn't there a car chase in gladiator?"

This energy is manifested in form of lust,violence,rebellion and theft..which is crouching Tiger.

","As years have proved, is that Hollywood directors simply does not have the skill to make good films based on the elements of like Crouching Tiger. Ang Lee, the director, here provides the audience with one of the greatest films ever made, with few competitors in this genre. The characters are convincing, considering you do not see that much reaction and expression, this is a traditional ""samurai"" film, even if there are no samurais in it. The story is simple, yet so fascinating; some seek to forsake the art of war, others desperately seek it. You'll either hate the movie, or you'll love it. It's hard for the viewers to adjust to this kind of world, as there's some ""flying"" in it, and that's a part of the whole mind-over-body thing. But no one can deny that Crouching Tiger & Hidden Dragon is a brilliant, great and entertaining film. The fighting scenes are jaw-dropping, the way it is done is stunning. It's fast, correct and it really pulls you in, along with some powerful drumming effects you got a winner. The choreography of the fighting is quite impressive, to say the least. I especially liked the scene where the sword is stolen, and the thief outsmarts one of the guards so easily. The thief actually jumps over (!) him. This is soon followed by some impressive shots of the thief duelling with a powerful fighter, all along with drums and swift punches and kicks - Awesome!<br/><br/>Top score, no doubt."

Filmed entirely in Mandarin with a harrowing score by famed cellist Yo Yo Ma, and jaw dropping fight sequences by Yuen Wo Ping [The Matrix-1999].

"JamesHitchcock","8","0","0","16 May 2004"," Haunting, surreal martial arts fantasy
","Like most Westerners I had always associated martial arts films with the standard Bruce Lee action vehicles or the humorous Jackie Chan equivalents. My wife, however, who is herself Chinese, tells me that in the Far East there is a tradition of using martial arts elements in many different cinematic genres, including historical romances. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a rare example of a film of this type to have achieved success in the West. Set in Imperial china, it tells the story of two warriors, Li Mu Bai (male) and Yu Shu Lien (female) and their attempts to recover a valuable sword which has been stolen by a young girl named Jen Yu. Jen is the daughter of a wealthy aristocratic family, and outwardly a respectable young lady, but she is secretly in revolt against her background and the limited possibilities open to her, and has secretly been receiving martial arts training from a notorious outlaw named Jade Fox. (Also a woman; strong female characters are a tradition in martial arts films).<br/><br/>Intertwined with the action sequences are two love stories; one between Jen and her bandit lover Lo, the other between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, who are obliged to hide their feelings for one another by the austere warrior code to which they subscribe. I found that the romance between Jen and the desert nomad Lo was never quite convincing; it seemed like the East Asian equivalent of those old Hollywood desert epics where the heroine ends up falling in love with the sheikh who has kidnapped and ravished her. The love between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, however, although at times it is so repressed as to be virtually invisible, does lead to the most poignant and tragic scene in the film when they realize their feelings for each other when it is too late. <br/><br/>Although I could never believe in her love for Lo, the character of Jen is an interesting and ambiguous one. At one level she is an arrogant and spoilt brat, whose mischief-making leads to pain and suffering for others. At another level, however, I found myself sympathising with her and her impatience with her stifling conformist background where she is expected to be dutiful and obedient and to achieve nothing in life other than to marry the boy of her parents' choice. Her theft of the sword can be seen both as wanton disobedience and as a necessary act of justified rebellion. The lovely Zhang Ziyi, who seems set to succeed the luminously beautiful Gong Li as the queen of Chinese cinema, did well to suggest both sides of her character. Of the other characters, Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien was probably the best; Chow Yun-Fat as Li Mu Bai seemed rather too stolid.<br/><br/>What really made the film stand out, however, was its visual beauty. This may seem a strange quality to praise in a martial arts film, but the fight scenes were the most beautiful of all, particularly those between Yu Shu Lien and Jen. I should point out that this is in no sense a realistic film. The characters have powers that verge on the supernatural (although in the context of the film this is attributed to their rigorous martial arts training). They are able to run up vertical walls, float through the trees, bound effortlessly across the rooftops and leap high into the air and hover there. This is achieved not by computer-generated effects but by stunt work on wires, often performed by the stars themselves rather than by stunt doubles. The result is a strange, breathtaking aerial ballet of an exquisite beauty which contributes to making this a haunting, surrealist film. 8/10."

","There is a skill in Chinese Gongfu, it is ""force skill"". Chinese discover that there are many force-roads in our body, and when these road are banned, the force(chinese call:""force blood"") will stuck in the force-road, and we feel sick and weak, if the roads are clear, we will be healthy, that's how Chinese use acupuncture and moxibustion, they use needle to clear the road or control the force in our body. Chinese believe that if a man with very clear force-road, his physical function will be better than others, which means he can jump higher, or run faster or with more power. Massage is something like this with similar axiom, but I don know how to explain in English.<br/><br/>So in Chinese gongfu story, those who learn gongfu will let the master clean their force-road and learn how to control the force, many ways like how to breath, how to sleep (also what to eat), and learning gongfu basically is also to let the body be in a very well state(not for fight or kill). In Chinese gongfu story, there are always the gongfu masters can use his force perfect, so they can jump very very high. but they cant fly. In this movie they can fly because there is a special skill called ""light skill"" in chinese gongfu legand, when people jump too fast and too high, they look like they can be free from gravity. But no one ever seen this kind of gongfu really, except in movie or novels.<br/><br/>The force we talking about here is not the force in ""Star Wars"", but the goal of both are similar that to discover our human protential.

Knowing the hype (and seeing it has been ranked high) I absolutely have to see this Chinese masterpiece but there are some points though that need to be said. Of course this movie is a superb masterpiece of both costumes, landscapes, visual arts and martial arts but it has been done before, just think of Bertolucci's ""The last emperor"" but people need their hypes now and then so saying this is a masterpiece is both true and false. The story itself can be reduced to a simple fairy tale but that's the attraction behind it as well as Ang Lee tried to give a sort of social view of the ancient China.

","First of all, I have to say I was disappointed by the start of this film. The story, about a magical sword and a coterie of fighting monks, is pure 'Star Wars', and the fight scenes (viewed purely as such) are spectacular, and sometimes funny, but never convincing (and notice almost no-one dies: in one scene, Zhang Zhiyi's character, who continually fights with mighty swords, nonetheless expresses horror that someone actually got hurt in a fight).  We now live in the age of second generation special effects, which exist not to feign reality but to outdo it, which is in a way quite pointless - the most gripping scene in 'The Matrix' for me was the one where Keanu Reeves nearly fell off the skyscraper; once he got his magic powers, all my interest waned.<br/><br/>But 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' grew on me as it went on.  For a start, it's one of the most beautiful films I have seen, with stunning images and music.  And once you start to see the outrageous movement of the characters as a kind of music too, rather than as plot, the film gains charm.  Though there is variation in tone, skilfully handled by director Ang Lee, everything in this fantastical world is logically and aesthetically consistent, and gradually it envelopes you.  And in spite of all the fighting, the film does not fetishise weaponry, in sharp contrast to the trigger-happy 'Matrix'.<br/><br/>Plus there are three strong, individual, female characters, all-well acted, and a great performance from Chun Yow Fat in the leading role. And a subtle tale of unexpressed love that surprises one with the force that it carries at the denouement.<br/><br/>So enjoy the trickery with wires, and then ignore it.  This is an old fashioned film in modern clothes:  an epic, beautiful tearjerker, and none the worse for that."

","*Minor Spolier Alert*<br/><br/>When I first saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I thought it was going to be in English dubbing, obviously it wasn't so was basically the first foreign film i've seen in theaters. The film was breathtaking. It showed a mystical part of ancient China that was almost long forgotten. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is as follows: A magic sword called the ""Green Destiny"" is stolen by a impetuous nobleman's daughter who is amazingly skilled in martial arts named Jen Yu played by import hottie Zhang Ziyi. Two respected warriors Li Mu Bai played by the great Chow Yun-Fat and Yu Shu Lien played by the beautiful ""queen of martial arts"" Michelle Yeoh team up to retrieve the sword. Along the way they clash with a female criminal known as Jade Fox, played by Pei-Pei Cheng. C.T.H.D is a new type of Hong Kong action movie combing drama with gravity defying martial arts and romance. Director Ang Lee is not exactly known for kung-fu movies, but for drama's such as ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Ride With the Devil."" Him directing a kung-fu action movie and and comic-book based action movies (""The Hulk"") shows that he is a very versatile director. C.T.H.D's plot is pretty simple, stolen sword, a young girl who is in a crossroads in her life, and two fighters realizing their love for one another. The cinematography and camera work is brilliant. They show the beautiful mountains and fields of feudal China. The best thing about thing about the movie is the incredible fight scences choreographed by one of the people who revolutionized Hong Kong action movies, Yuen Woo-Ping. The man behind great action movies such as ""Drunken Master"" with Jackie Chan, ""Once Upon a Time in China"", ""Fist of Legend"" ""Black Mask"" and ""The Tai Chi Master"" with Jet Li, and ""The Matrix"" trilogy. The fight scenes both had aggressiveness and softness with wire-work magic. What made the fight scenes great was the fact that the some of the main actors are not exactly martial artist. Zhang Ziyi is not trained in martial arts but is actually a dancer which made it easy for the action directors to teach her some wushu techniques. Chow Yun-Fat, who is a action movie veteran, is not a martial artist as well but was also trained and picked up the moves real quick. He should of gotten more fight scenes though. The best fights were the restaurant fight with Zhang Ziyi fighting a crew of warriors which kind of looked like the restaurant fight in ""Legend of Drunken Master"", the night fight with Chow Yun-Fat fighting Jade Fox, and the training hall fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. The movie gets a little slow in the desert flashback, but overall Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a landmark film to be remembered. Score 4/5"

Fun, exciting, engrossing, gorgeous, a great movie.  Who cares if it was or wasn't worthy of Oscar nominations? The Oscars are hardly a yardstick of quality anyway, so why pay attention to them?  Who cares if it's not The Greatest Film In The History Of Cinema.  It was fabulous, simply fabulous."

","This film with a somewhat threatening title turns out to be a work of art something like a Chinese scroll but with bolder richer colours and the accompanying music keeps respectfully in the background.<br/><br/>The martial arts in this film are presented in a ballet style, the combatants defying all gravitational laws as the blades of steel thrash the air and strike with showers of sparks.  Interesting to watch for a while but for me the fights go on for too long.<br/><br/>I could not believe my eyes when I watched the chase across the rooftops. What graceful leaps from house to house, floating airborne figures, the pursuer never overtaking, just as it happens in a dream.  Indeed, much of this film has a dreamlike quality.<br/><br/>The most memorable moment was the sword fight in the forest of giant bamboos.  Flexing right and left, up and down, the branches move with body weight.  I have never seen anything so excitingly beautiful as the combatants appear and disappear amongst the dense growth of the green bamboos.<br/><br/>While the story is mainly about a stolen sword and its repossession, it really is a fairy tale in which a lover can jump off a mountain top to make a wish come true.  There are wicked poisons and potions too.  What is most surprising though is that despite the furious wielding and thrusting of blades, most characters escape serious injury.  Being able to run up vertical walls helps a lot, I suppose."

","i finally saw this movie 3 years after its release.  it was beautiful, moving, and inspiring.  the fighting scenes were perhaps a bit excessive, but marvelous nonetheless.  the storyline was very interesting because it was quite complex and suspenseful throughout.<br/><br/>i probably would have enjoyed the movie more if i had watched it in mandarin, instead of the english dubbing.  the english dubbed over voices were quite annoying and the translation often silly or awkward sounding. (actually i think michelle yeoh did her own english dubbing, and sadly her english is as poor and awkward as her mandarin).  i started watching the dvd in chinese, but they used such archaic language that i had trouble understanding some parts.  (using subtitles always annoying b/c the words end up coming up before they're actually spoken, so that was out of the question).<br/><br/>the martial arts in this movie has motivated me to devote more of my energy into practicing wushu... so for that i'm grateful.  i should watch more chinese martial arts movies ...  :)<br/><br/>in short, i really enjoyed this movie... it was a beautiful masterpiece. the only possible complaint i can imagine american viewers having is with the terrible english dubbing... i highly recommend it to everyone."

","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Review You may remember a recent review on a unique film called Run Lola Run. This film explored the question of 'what if'.  From time to time we all have strange dreams like jumping from rooftop to rooftop chasing someone or being chased.  Some times you seemed to get involved in some of the most amazing martial arts.  Sometimes dreams can be reflected in films.  One such film is the Chinese movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  When I was invited to see this I had no idea what it was about because I had heard nothing, read nothing nor even seen a poster.  I was shocked and amazed at how strangely familiar this film was because it seemed to reflect dreams I had experienced.  Ignoring whether I was suffering deja vu this film really had my attention and I was determined to find out more about this type of film. This film could be considered the pinnacle of the genre `Wuxia Pian'. 'Wuxia Pian' is deeply rooted in mythical China when the country was largely lawless and the only hope was the wandering 'knights in shining armour' or 'knights errant'.  Since the beginning of movies filmmakers, especially in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have depicted 'wuxia' in dazzling displays of swordsmanship and mystical power.  Kung fu tended to replace swordplay films during the 1970s and 80s.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon resurrects the more traditional 'wuxia' plot and which often presents the struggle between social, responsibility and loyalty and personal desires. Set in the ancient world of China the story revolves around a sword called 'The Green Destiny'.  The sword belongs to Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) but he has given it to Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  When the sword is stolen by a thief in the dark Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien travel through the ancient cities to track the thief.  Unknown to these two warriors the thief is none other than the Governor's daughter, Jen Ju (Ziyi Zang).  Fallowing Jen Ju leads a trail of magical martial arts and flying.  Yes, you heard correctly, flying - well jumping as though there is almost no gravity.  I can't give to much detail because much of the action that goes on in this wonderful film is simply stunning. Starring international action star Chow Yun Fat as Master Li Mu Bai, who's latest release is Bulletproof Monk, is suited to this role incredibly well. Another international star, made famous in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies, is Michelle Yeoh, who plays Yu Shu lien, the women in love with the master Li Mu Bai.  Another young and new actress is Ziyi Zang, making her first international appearance in Rush Hour 2 as the bad girl.  She stars as Jen Ju, the thief in love with Xiou Hu 'Dark Cloud', Chen Chang, an outlaw living in the desert plains China. Ang Lee, who is directing his latest blockbuster The Hulk with Eric Banner, shows his methods of directing a martial arts movie very well.  The fight choreography that Woo Ping, (The Matrix Trilogy), delivers is highly professional and simply astonishing.  Ang Lee uses his directing methods to show the ancient Chinese scenery in a beautiful array of lively colours. The special effects in this film are highly professional because they looked really natural.  The change between a normal and real life action and a special effect was seamless. What I didn't like about the movie was that it was a bit slow getting started and seemed to take along time to set the scene.  However, once the action began the music and fight choreography lifted my spirits considerably.  The acting was a bit on the dull side but when it came to the fighting, the acting seemed to improve.  The script was interesting because it must have taken in depth research into the world of 'wuxia pian' and ancient China.  Whether they could fight as well or fly as well is a mystery but it does give that sense of freedom to it. If you ignore the fact that the film is in Chinese with English Subtitles or the fact that it has been dubbed in English you should enjoy this mystical film.  From the amazing fight scenes to the wonderful scenery, it is a film of imagination and excitement. I really enjoyed watching this sensation. Rating 4/5 Stars"

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is no ordinary foreign film.  Its not hard to see why it scooped up four Oscars and was nominated for six others this year.  It is a movie of forbidden love, astounding fighting sequences and breathtaking scenery.  The film is best described by director Ang Lee's words; ""It is a dream.'<br/><br/> Among the Oscar-winning Cinematography are unbelievable fighting scenes. They are a convention of the 'Wuxia' genre, which is almost 2000 years old. Wuxia can be roughly translated for the uneducated Australian to a flying swordsmen movie.  Characters of a wuxia fiction contain some of the following traits: generosity, honour, martial prowess, honesty, sense of duty, sense of justice, and courage.<br/><br/> The movie is based upon fiction in the 19th century.  This was a time of mystical worriers that ruled the land, fighting evil forces.  A particular warrior and expert swordsman by the name of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) has had enough of his fighting days and is ready to retire his sword, ` The Green Destiny.'  He desires to devote his life to his secret love Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), an equally gifted adept with the sword.  However, she is tangled in a situation of wanting to be with Li Mu Bai, but is devoted to her long dead betrothed.  Then onto the scene is the beautiful, young noblewomen, Jen (Zhang Ziyi).  Jen is looking to escape the ordered and strict life that she lives. Instead, she  wants to lead a more exciting and adventurous tale.  Shu Lien, Li Mu Bai and Jen all meet when the legendary `Green Destiny' is stolen.<br/><br/> Through the unraveling of the romantic connections between the characters and the exciting hunt for the `Green Destiny,' comes a fantastic tale which has been sequenced flawlessly.  Although, at some times in the movie, the plot moves at a snail's pace, it is fortunate that the imaginative fighting sequences make up for it.  The director uses manipulation of editing and special effects to perfection.<br/><br/> Words can not justify the overall production of this movie.  From all aspects, it is a superb production.  An experience not to be missed.<br/><br/> 8/10"

","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' could easily be seen as the Star Wars of the Chinese dynasties, the 'weightless leaps,' swordfights, the vagabond warriors, magical elements and fantasy worlds all echo those seen in George Lucus' Star Wars some 20 years ago. However you could say it's the other way round. Both these films are based loosely on the film culture of Wuxia, with 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' taking a more traditional approach. The Wuxia genre can be analogised the story of a swordsman or knight, who is able to mentally break away from the physical world and therefore defy gravity and the limitations of the human body. These people were highly feared and glorified as noble swordsman who fought not for state or lord but for themselves but were however honest, compassionate and loyal. This movie truly exemplifies the beauty of this making the movie almost a piece of art.<br/><br/> The first action scene which features Yu (Michelle Yeoh) chasing the mysterious thief of the Green Destiny, a Sword owned by the great warrior Li (Chow Yun-Fat) When Yu begins to climb up the sides of buildings with mere hops and the characters fly through the air as if they are, temporarily, weightless, it seems to become too un-realistic and fantastic, however as the film progresses, both the Wuxia and Zen culture are slowly revealed to show how these warrior's can defy the laws of nature an physiology.<br/><br/> This is Ang Lee's last Chinese film was 1994's Yin shi nan nu since then he has Directed the English film's Ice Storm (1997) and Sense & Sensibility (1995) This is Lee's first martial arts movie and he felt obligated to film and produce it in Chinese as he says: ""Making a martial arts film in English to me is the same as John Wayne speaking Chinese in a western."" Ang Lee<br/><br/> Lee has however created a martial arts masterpiece, one of the best scene for many years. It may come as a surprise however none of the scenes in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' are computer generated, all the stunts performed were on wire, especially the scene where Li (Chow Yun-Fat) and Jen (Ziyi Zhang) fly through the trees, that really is them, flying through the trees. The directing of a movie with some many aspects, love, action, can be an overwhelming task, however for the most part Lee has successfully created an entertaining film.<br/><br/> The script sets up an intricate storyline, full of interesting characters and events, however there is one particular, part of the film that seems to go for too long, which is the desert flashback. It might have been wise to remove some of these scenes as most are simply not needed, perhaps a single fight in the desert would be enough to establish the abilities and feelings of the characters, however the section goes for a few too many minutes, leaving you wondering when are we going to get back to the main plot. Aside from that the acting is excellent from the main characters, actors have been well chosen for these characters, and dialogue is also very well written and presented, a compliment to the writers and actors. It is unfortunate that this film did not reach its full potential, not it was a bad movie, but because people were daunted because of the 'foreign film branding' as well as the long love story, even though the film was first and utmost a love, not action story. This is also disappointing as the love story seems shallow and stereotypical, two people who cannot truly be with each other, but in the end express their love for each other, and I'm not going to even say in how many movies I have seen two enemies fighting, rolling on the floor to end up in each others embrace. However these few problems are more than overwhelmed by an excellent cinematographic style, and great performances.<br/><br/> The Wuxia genre has never been portrayed nearly to its true stance; however 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has put an immense amount of detail, and thought into the script, storyline and characters to become as true to the culture as they possibly could."

","No real spoilers, but warning anyway<br/><br/>I'm a novice when it comes to this stuff. I know nothing about Asian lifestyle or Asian cinema and for anyone like me, this is a perfect movie to get started with. It's a blockbuster Chinese movie clearly made for mass consumption. Don't worry that it's foreign either, dear neophyte, nothing esoteric here.<br/><br/>Master Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) comes down from a mountain where he has been meditating and wants to give up his sword Green Destiny, so he goes with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a fellow martial arts master, to deliver it personally to Sir Te (Sihung Lung) in Peking. Also at Sir Te's compound are Governor Yu (Fa Zeng Li) and his daughter Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang).<br/><br/>We learn that years ago Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) killed Li Mu Bai's master and that he longs to avenge his death before he leaves the warrior lifestyle. Jade Fox must die by Green Destiny's blade. In the night, what looks to be a ninja steals Green Destiny from the compound. This is where the first scuffle comes into play, between Shu Lien and the thief. It gives nothing away to say who the thief is. We, as well as Shu Lien, suspect Jen and in one of the few missteps in the film, Shu Lien none-too-slyly insinuates Jen may be the thief. While watching her do calligraphy, she practically says to Jen, ""Say, your writing is a lot like FENCING. You write like a warrior fights...SWORD.""<br/><br/>Early on we learn that Jen is working with Jade, that foe of all that screams like a banshee. We discover that Jen has been hiding things from her master Jade, and that since the time she was ten she's been developing past her in terms of technique. In fact, she's so skillful people mistake her for a disciple of Li Mu Bai's. (This Jade Fox gets around. There's another family that she's robbed a mother and a wife of, who get in the second battle of the film with her.)<br/><br/>In one fight, Jen tells Li Mu Bai to stop talking like a monk, but I wished he would get more philosophical. It's what, I think, could push this over into the level of greatness. But instead we've got semi-profound lines like ""Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real"" or ""To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger."" Some of this may be the fault of poor translation. (Is ""fliers"" the most appropriate word?) If Lee had been more willing to really delve into the nature of the Giang Hu lifestyle, this could have been one of the most spectacular films ever. It seems like a warrior movie done for the masses; indeed I never realized the difference between them all. It's still a very good film but notable mainly for those astonishing action scenes.<br/><br/>The warrior characters glide through the air, weightless. It's all very impressive (there's even an underwater scene). The martial arts masters can virtually fly (in that first fight, Shu Lien keeps having to pin down the thief so she doesn't fly away). When Jen tests out her skills in a restaurant, the wood crumbles like rotten planks. Little Jen, with a face like a porcelain doll, is the one match for the two members of the old guard, Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai.<br/><br/>Intertwined with the fight scenes are the love stories. It's not a romance by any means. It's just seasoning. It's the final seal around the movie. We are told that Shu Lien was engaged to Li Mu Bai's oath brother, who was killed by Bai's enemy (we assume that's Jade Fox). There's a longish flashback that, at first, I thought served no point, but it gives us background on Jen's character and her drive to be a warrior. It also shows her hypocrisy: she chases after a bandit, Lo (Chen Chang) who's stolen her comb, yet freely steals Li Mu Bai's sword. Also, through the flashback -- after they fall for each other -- it's rammed home that Jen and Lo are the young version of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien who, we hear a few times, have repressed feelings for each other. Lo has come back for Jen, in the hopes of getting her back before she is to be married. There are some clichés here (how many movies must feature a fight between two people rolling around on the floor, only to end up -- ho-hum -- with them having sex?). But, when the girl's as immaculately gorgeous as Jen's actor Ziyi Zhang, I can't complain.<br/><br/>Even though the film features the obligatory speech-deaths, it's not an epic. It's done on a very intimate scale and it works best that way, I think. It matches the fluid, nimble delicacy of the warrior's moves during the action sequences. I really don't want to call them action sequences because everything is so graceful. The actors move as elegantly as Jen's calligraphy brush. Also, there's very little blood or gore. A scene or two and it's hardly noticeable. Peter Pau won an Oscar for his camerawork, which I didn't think was that great. If the movie looks fantastic, credit the men and women who made the characters' flying seem realistic. The soundtrack music, principally Yo-Yo Ma's cello work, is very beautifully noble.<br/><br/>***1/2"
"paraplouie","Null","0","0","11 February 2003"," Fantasy, not reality.
","Ang Lee offers us Crouching Tiger not as something we should compare to reality, or to what is humanly possible, but as a piece of art, a legend of physical and philosophical adventure. It is easy to dismiss this film as unrealistic and too unbelievable to be truly appreciated and worthy of repute. But such critics would be missing the point of this film -- it's about beauty, fine art, philosophy, and adventure without connection to the world we live in now. So when some worthless member of the audience grumbles disgustedly about how floating and flying from housetop to housetop is completely cheesy and unreal, he also is missing the point of the film and should obviously be back home, playing his beloved Tekken or something similarly suited to his unappreciative intellect.<br/><br/>Watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for it's visual grandeur, it's ideas (whether or not you agree with them), and it's top-notch fight scenes. The plot itself may be slightly overused, in its general sense of revenge and fighting, but a few of the lines, especially delivered by Chow Yun Fat, are quite intriguing. And don't worry too much about the fact that Michelle Yeoh has a horrible accent -- you only care about that if you can speak Mandarin anyway, and so it shouldn't matter. Again, what is important to remember here is that Crouching Tiger is a hint at a legendary, almost unreachable past, together with its unique ideals and physical possibilities; it isn't meant to correspond to our reality. Watch it for it's own sake. It is a very beautiful thing."

","Hypocrisy in the movie?  No.  Let's hooray hypocrisy in the movie going public!  Harry Potter--nobody cares that you've got a kid flying around on a broom stick.  Lord of the Rings--I haven't heard a complaint about the use of magic and monsters.  Crouching Tiger--People run on air!?  That must not be tolerated!<br/><br/>People don't seem to understand that this movie could fall just as easily into the fantasy category as martial arts or drama.  People running on air, or on water, or across roofs shouldn't be too unusual, since their incredible abilities are supposed to be the results of training to beat their human limits.  But this may not be the important thing.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is very much a drama first and a martial arts movie second, but with what I think is a fairly good balance.  However, anybody going in for one or the other will probably be disappointed.  Martial arts fans may not like the slow, deliberate pace or the 45-minute flashback (hey, Citizen Kane didn't have a linear structure either) and drama (and action) fans will be confused with the fighting styles in this film.  But if you realize you're going in there for a balance, you've got it made.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is wonderful, as are the dynamic characters. If you want a fun little kung-fu movie, get Wing Chun.  Otherwise, this movie has what it takes to break out of the ""chop sockey"" genre to make it big.

","I think that many people, especially Asian people, have misunderstood this film. One common criticism i have heard from my Chinese and Japanese friends is that it is nothing that they haven't seen before. That is beside the point! This film was especially made for a western audience, as Ang Lee himself has said. He wanted to open the world of the martial art movie to a new audience in the west.<br/><br/>Also, i think criticism of the 'flying' aspects of the marital arts are again missing the point. The film for me was a moving, and ultimately tragic love story with the fight scenes as a result of the plot rather than the other way round, as is often the case.<br/><br/>This film, as in many other great movies, for example the brilliant Pleasentville, requires a slight suspension of disbelief. After all it is ultimately fiction. It is not represented as a true story! If you can manage this then i think that you will find this to be a moving, beautifully shot film, with some amazing fight scenes.<br/><br/>I would wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone, be they a fan of martial arts movies or not.

","Everybody talks about the film's stunning fight scenes and fantastic music score. I have something else to say:<br/><br/>Chen Chang, as Ziyi's barbarian lover, is totally unconvincing. His makeup can't hide his boy accent; his performance can't match up with other 3 stars; his role unnecessary; his lines become unbearably poetic after they fall in love. If the subplot involving the relationship between Ziyi and Chang were removed from the film, it wouldn't hurt the narrative a bit.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, Chang is put in Wu-Dong monastery by Chow Yun-Fat to wait for Ziyi. When she arrives, they make passionate love in western style (again). I must point out it's impossible that she could stay in his room due to strict rules in the monastery.<br/><br/>Then comes the bizarre ending as Ziyi jumps into the river from a bridge high above. Chang Chen, who stands beside her, doesn't even have any response to her suicide. He just looks at another direction like wood. Ang Lee should have had a better judgment when choosing an actor."

The storylines are simple and require a bit of thought on the part of the moviegoer - and in these days dominated by brainless, bloody action films, that seems to be a problem.<br/><br/>This is not an action flick, though some people seem intent on jamming into the form of a martial-arts action movie. It's not even remotely that. Yes, there are fight scenes, but those scenes are more a dance between the characters than to-the-death battles.<br/><br/>If you're confused by the film, read a little Eastern philosophy - you can't watch it, take the view of a Westerner and expect to understand everything."

","Taken into the context of Chinese film-making, the story was good and poetic, and an ending Hollywood would not approve of (they love happy endings after all.) However, the greatest king-fu film ever made? BULL! FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUST was better. SO was ENTER THE DRAGON. ENCOUNTERS OF THE SPOOKY KIND, CHINESE SUPERNINJAS, even LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES were better king fu films than CTHD basically because the martial arts were real, performed by REAL martial artists, not by cables, wires and CGI. There are some moments of brilliance in the film as far as choreography, but overall I was mostly disappointed by the phony stunts Hollywood wants you to believe is great kung fu. The story itself is the saving grace of it, and it only served to make the fake kung-fu all the more disappointing since if the likes of Gordon Liu, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and even Lam Chin Ying were doing the choreography, would have made the film THE BEST in king fu. Alas, it is only a pretender. I think of guys like Liu or Lee or Chan who gave their bodies to make excellent kung fu, realistic kung fu. This film is an insult to the men (and women) who didn't need wires or CGI to make themselves look good. They only needed their skills, which made them all the more legendary. And for anyone who says these wires and flying scenes are part of Chinese culture, I ask where were al these flying scenes in kung fu films 10, 20, even 30 years ago? And the young girl in the film? Such a snotty and arrogant heroine is the reason why I can't take female leads seriously in Hollywood films, because they over exaggerate their toughnes and independence from men that they fail to realize if we don't like them or relate to them, we're not gonna care about them, and sure I enough not only did I not care for the girl, but I ended up despising her since her actions led to tragedy in the film. However, CTHD is a good film for the handling of the material, but if you're looking for good kung fu, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good herione, be disappointed. The story itself deserves a peak."

","Having just seen TIGER-DRAGON, I am sifting out the bits and pieces in my mind, particularly between the involvement of the film's writers with that of the director -- and where the creativity of this film is placed.  This is my first martial-arts type film, so I am no qualified critic in that genre other than saying it definitely has many excellently crafted surreal poetic moments in the ability to fly and escape.  Which is the theme or moral of the film:  take an 8am-to-5pm job or go over the hill on a whim or return from that hill to settle down and take a wife or lover.<br/><br/>These comments are my very Western appreciation of this film - which is Ang Lee's forte from what I observe from past films (with my top vote going to THE ICE STORM which I think set the stage for AMERICAN BEAUTY's recent awards).<br/><br/>There is nothing negative about this film.  It is NOT the best film this year, nor during the prior decade. It may be the BEST MARTIAL ARTS FILM.<br/><br/>I think ANG LEE has provided these talents:<br/><br/>1) Re-introducing English speaking/reading folks to FOREIGN LANGUAGE films and to use one's mind when viewing a film; 2) Blending Western familiarities (i.e. a Dodge City-type saloon brawls) with more subtle Eastern values of mystique and patience and honor. 3) Great editing and continuity along a fast-paced path (i.e. do not drink a DietCoke any time before your viewing if you anticipate a short visit to the restroom). 4) A fantastic initiation to Wu Xia swords and wizardry, if that is what was happening or tagged (I will start reading my second Harry Potter book tonight!!)<br/><br/>Those are my thoughts."

Some complain that its not realistic, or its too stylized, etc... Okay, fine, let them go make a movie.  Thank God for Ang Lee's vision and creativity.  A movie, at its best, presents a reflection of the human condition, humorously or dramatically, realistic or not.  This film hits all those details of life-love, loyalty, honor, duty, freedom, joy, despair, wanting things you can not have, missed opportunities and still manages to be a happy escape from the ordinary.

I enjoyed ""Crouching Tiger hidden Dragon"" immensely and did not find the subtitles distracting at all.  However, Western audiences may not be prepared for such a tragic ending, as one typically expects of a Chinese film; crouching tiger also offers far more storyline, plot, and character development than the average martial arts flick.  Ang Lee's tasteful direction can be thanked for that. I give the film a *10/10*, with a note that filmgoers expecting meaningless staged fights and badly dubbed dialogue, a happy romantic ending or intermittent comedic interludes will be disappointed.

When I was younger I was a big fan of martial arts movies but after a while I realized that most of them don't really have a story or even some deeper meaning. So I stopped watching them because I thought it's pointless and a waste of time. The other day, however, I went to see CTHD (more by accident than on purpose). Frankly speaking this movie took my breath away. Everyone who hasn't seen the movie yet should really hurry in order to see it on the big screen. CTHD isn't just one of those martial arts movies. It's about our hopes, about life and death and most of all about love. And all of this is embedded in beautiful pictures accompanied by gorgeous music. I feel pity for all those who think this movie is a waste of money and time. Try to open your mind and dive into this beautiful dream. If you are trying to compare this movie with The Matrix, well, then you didn't get the point of CTHD (and I am a big fan of The Matrix myself, but I think it's a completely different thing).<br/><br/>Anyway, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is worth every penny and I will go and watch it again very soon."

","Caution: There may be spoilers ahead. A culture thoroughly embedded in tradition, honor, duty, and repression of natural instincts is suddenly lit up by the exciting light of a beacon of the free human spirit. Jen, who embraces her passions proudly, is everything the principals in this movie oppose; yet, like moths, they are attracted to her - and the effect is every bit as devastating to them as the beacon light is to the moths. Each views Jen as a tabula rasa to be shaped to fit his or her own ideal. Gray Fox wants to join with her as a team to conquer the underworld. Her father would have her marry to improve his political position. Yu Shu Lien would have her submit to her duties as a woman. Li Mu Bai would make her his protege as a Wudan knight. But Jen ever follows her passions (Li: ""Kneel!"" Jen: ""Never!"") and holds to her own free spirit to the very end, even when engulfed by guilt and sorrow.<br/><br/>In Jen we have one of the most remarkable and constant characters in literature, joining with the likes of, among a very few others, Shakespeare's Juliet, Irish legend's Deirdre, Ibsen's Nora, and more recently Mary from ""The Book of Stars"" and Devon from ""Lawn Dogs"" to form a singular group of free-spirited heroes who live a perilous existence in a society that greatly fears the natural free spirits of its members."

Many others complain about the fake flying and such, but rest assured that this is a traditional theme in various Chinese martial arts films, and shouldn't be an object to lower the film's grade."

A joy to behold from the first frame to the last, this movie quite simply breathes life into a sinking genre populated with the ubiquitious chop socky adventures of wooden orientals. Ang Lee obviously has a story to tell and he does it in style. Catch then, the lyrical quality of the fight scenes or the tender romance of the two protoganists or the simply breathtaking scenery..be it the relentless expanse of an arid desert or the magnificience of a wooded forest or a grotto of doom drenched in a drizzle. I have been a fan of Martial arts ever since I was this high and seeing this form elevated to an art form certainly does no harm. Above all Ang Lee scores by eschewing hyperbole and melodrama and investing instead in economy of emotions. Enough said. This is definitely one of the most uplifting movies of the year. A prime catch. Miss it at your own risk !"

I typically found the main characters interesting.<br/><br/>My main problems is that _some_ of the flying/fighting sequences did look rather weird, particularly early on. When the defiance of gravity is used in conjunction with martial arts, it is excellent. When it's simply characters pointing their arm out Superman-style and flying through the air it looks a bit goofier.<br/><br/>Also, the desert flashback in the middle does tend to drag on a bit, bringing the movie to a grinding halt after about ten minutes.<br/><br/>But generally I enjoyed the various characters and found the plot engaging enough. There isn't really one ""central"" plot, and I'm not convinced they intermesh the various threads as well as they could have. Still, I would recommend it."

All credit to the actors who performed all of the moves so fast I did not know it was possible (and no CGI either) but the real medal must go to the choreographers who came up with these quite stunning fight scenes. But a film review such as this cannot go on without a mention of the master director that is Ang Lee. I cannot even imagine what challenges a project like this must put in front of you but it looks like he handled them with the same genius that he showed in Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm.

","I went to see the movie the other night, expecting to see a movie similar to the Matrix and some other movie that I cannot currently remember.  But, much to my dismay, the movie did not meet my expectations (or hopes).<br/><br/>Firstly, the fight scenes were excellent.  Everything was so fast that they were hard to follow.  And people have complained that the movie was not realistic (i.e., people gliding through the air, running on walls, etc.), but it wasn't supposed to be.  This was back in an age where Chinese monks/warriors were supposed to have possessed mystical powers and should have been able to perform feats incapable of performing by the average human.  Personally, I would have liked to see more of these abilities like using electricity in battle like in the movies ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and ""Mortal Kombat.""  But I suppose that if the movie had more mystical aspects to it, then I imagine it wouldn't have won the four Oscars.<br/><br/>Also, the movie did have subtitles, but that did not bother me.  It added to the authenticity of the era by hearing them speak Chinese (although perhaps in the wrong dialect, since this movie was supposed to have been taken place many years/centuries ago).<br/><br/>I suppose what I found disappointing was the lack of action and suspense in between the fight scenes.  Typing these comments now, the movie is but a blur to me, but I do recall thinking that the movie was slow and uneventful, that is until the fighting began.  But really, excluding the fighting scenes, the movie was just a bunch of love stories and, at least to me, quite boring.  I have to admit that I actually fell asleep watching the movie, but only for a few minutes until the next battle sequence began.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this movie 5 stars out of 10.

It really was astonishing to see a Chinese film to recieve 10 nominations from the people who usually take no chances with their selection of movies. Now, after seeing the film, I feel a bit disappointed but I also understand why Ang Lee's film pleased the Oscar committee. It is truly an entertaining film which combines a very typical 'American' storyline with the long traditions of Chinese filmmaking to create a perfect mix for audiences on both sides of the Pacific. Lee cleverly disguises the classic American film stereotypes (the pair of professionals who hide their feelings and the rebellious teen and her 'wild one' lover) by setting the story to a fairytale-like China and giving the protagonists some fabulous physical abilities, thus giving something new for the Asian audiences to watch out for while the Westeners can admire the spectacular landscapes and breathtaking fight sequences and enjoy the film as pure entertainment. Still I felt that something was missing. A film that seemed truly unique and atypical turned out to be just a typical 'Oscar-film' with nothing too serious or interesting to say for itself, relying solely on entertaining action and cheesy romance scenes with some really corny dialogue."
"twobellsilence","9","0","0","9 April 2001"," Worthy of all the praise it has received
","<Possible spoilers> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a very good film that has exceeded my expectations. I was not very impressed by the trailer, feeling dubious about some of the unrealistic looking scenes but after watching the show, practically everything else made up for it.<br/><br/>What the critics say about it is mostly right. It is an epic tale of good versus evil and experienced versus eager. In a sense it is a good old fashioned action film not too detached from Star Wars. What makes it so good is that it is executed so well with excellent acting, brilliant photography, outstanding music, gorgeous sets and above all, the masterful directing of Ang Lee. Unlike most action films, it surpasses its own genre by being able to give an insight into humanity. Take that, Gladiator!<br/><br/>On the downside, I felt that the aerial scenes were just plain unrealistic. Most say that it's meant to be that way to give it a poetic or dream-like feel but I feel otherwise. It's not that I don't accept people being able to defy gravity in the movies but it's just that when watching any of those scenes, the fact that the actors were suspended on wires was so glaringly obvious.<br/><br/><WARNING:SPOILER><br/><br/>
As an example, take the much lauded fight among the trees where the characters precariously balanced themselves on the flimsy branches. There is a scene where Zhang Ziyi tries to balance herself on a branch Her legs are shown to be swaying with the branch but her entire upper body is motionless. Does that not destroy the entire illusion of sincerity? But don't get me wrong, despite the poor use of wires (In fact, I think they should have used computer generated effects for this rather than wires), it is still an outstanding film (I voted 9 out of 10) and I'd recommend it to anyone. Between this film and Gladiator, I'd have given the Best Picture Oscar to the former. Actually, I'd have given it to Almost Famous but it wasn't even nominated."
"The Truth","6","0","0","10 April 2001"," Entertaining, but quite shallow.
","Although Ang Lee is known to be unpredictable, a year ago I would never have guessed his next film would be a kung fu one. Being an admirer of Mr. Lee's work, I had high hopes for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Perhaps Lee could bring new life into a weary genre. The positive critique kept my hopes up, and I couldn't wait to see the film. Now I have, and I must admit I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Not to sound too negative, I'll begin by telling what I did like in Crouching Tiger etc. The visuals are, of course, magnificent. The fight scenes tread the fine line between beauty and silliness, but never fall into the latter category. The cinematography is both elegant and dynamic, and the film excels in production and costume design as well. The actors do a decent job, and yes, for a kung fu flick Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has unusual depth. Neverthless, all the above can't hide the fact that this is Ang Lee's worst film.<br/><br/>There are serious themes in the film, but they never become interesting enough. There are four essential subjects in the film: Li Mu Bai's and Yu Hsui Lien's suppressed love, Jen's and Lo's impossible romance, Jen's desire to exceed Mu Bai and Hsui Lien in fighting skills, and the daughter/apprentice relationship Jade Fox has with Jen. Sadly, none of these dramatic archs has time develop properly between the fight scenes and the other three stories. The lessons taught in the end sound banal, partly because one hasn't rooted enough with the characters. The final scene is both predictable and unnecessary; one suspects it was added for visual effect only.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, had Crouching Tiger... been merely an entertaining kung fu flick, I probably would've liked it more. Now it tries to be both entertainment and deep drama, and succeeds only on the former department. One is compelled to compare the drama with Lee's former films, and on that comparison Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon reveals it's shallowness. Also, though better than this one, Ang Lee's previous film Ride with the Devil had the same tendency to prefer surface over substance.

","I'm not a huge Ang Lee fan.  At least, I wasn't.  This film is absolutely amazing.  The martial arts scenes put _The Matrix_ to shame.  These scenes, especially the first confrontation, seem more like a dance than a fight. The motion of these actors, with the beautiful scenery as the backdrop, is incredible.  Of course, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat are fantastic, but I was especially impressed with Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu.  Not to be fooled, this film is not a strict martial arts action movie.  The love story between the various characters is also shot very well.  Definitely one of the top 5 films I've seen this year."

A wonderful dramatic love story that transcends special effects, and a slap in the face for the almighty Hollywood studios. It's beyond the ""Poetry in motion"" cliché. It easily proves that it doesn't take a budget of $100 million to make a movie that will be remembered for eternity, like this one will be. If Mr. Lee is willing to go ahead with the prequel, it might become the new ""Star Wars"" Saga of this decade. I'm glad it didn't win the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director, because this will prove what the Oscars are really about."

"jessx2001","9","0","0","3 April 2001"," A literary, social, spiritual, poetic and humane artistic masterpiece
","As of this writing, I have seen this movie three times and I intend to see it at least two more times before it leaves the theatre permanently. I have read the various comments on the IMDB and other websites about this movie and I have taken my time trying to come up with my own comments. I am afraid that whatever I say about this movie will not do it justice. For this reason, I will show the comments made by Ang Lee and James Schamus on a website that explains the movie and my feelings more accurately.<br/><br/>First of all, you must come in to see this movie with an open mind, with an awareness and appreciation for the Eastern religion and culture. I am a 24-yr-old Asian female who is interested in philosophy, sociology, and psychology and I took a college course on Eastern religions. So I was well prepared to watch this movie other than for the fighting sequences even though I definitely appreciated those.<br/><br/>The first time that I saw this movie, I was intrigued but not overly impressed. The second time I watched it, I thought it was a very beautiful and under appreciated movie. The third time that I watched it, I had an epiphany. I felt every scene, and every word of dialogue in this movie contributed to its' greatness. I went home and thought about over everything in my mind. This movie is so difficult to understand because I think it is essentially a two-hour poem. You cannot possibly fathom who these characters are unless you attempt to read underneath the surface. There is so much information that is not given up front and only implied.<br/><br/>
James Schamus: . When somebody says something in this film, the character that is written down, that attaches to that, has roots that are 5,000 years old, if not older. The Chinese embedded in every word of this movie has layers and layers of culture and meanings. They simply don't exist to a Western ear. It is one of the truly delicious ironies of this movie, that although I co-wrote it, I'll never fully understand all of its meanings<br/><br/>For this very reason, this movie can be interpreted in so many ways. At first viewing, I felt this movie was about human desires and regrets. Now I have come to the current opinion that this movie is very much about human desires vs. the society that we live in and how we are all prisoners in way or another because of these desires. Then I read a comment somewhere about how this movie is similar to Stars Wars. I'm not that familiar with Star Wars so I cannot make a fair comparison. However, while I was watching it the last time, I was trying to figure out what crouching tiger, hidden dragon meant. In a comment made by Li Mu Bai in the story, he mentions to Shu Lien that the Giang Hu world is full of tigers and dragons and that they are all corrupted. Taking from this line, I made the assumption that Jen herself was the crouching tiger and the hidden dragon because she has that potential for corruption-- her tiger is crouching and her dragon is hidden but they exist. Taken in a much broader concept, we all have the potential for corruption and we all have crouching tiger and hidden dragons within ourselves ready to spring out.<br/><br/>Ang Lee: ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"": for those familiar with the Chinese characters, the link between the film's title and the storyline is graphically clear: Jen has the word for ""dragon"" embedded in her name, while Lo, her lover, is the tiger. Jen and Lo are headstrong, self-centered and wild - and young. In contrast, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien respect the ideals of honor and selfless duty - acting as role models within the story, and to the larger audience.<br/><br/>Today, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a common expression that refers to the mysteries that lie below the surface of society and our everyday lives. The expression is a reminder never to underestimate our own dragons and tigers - they can spring out at any time.<br/><br/>The title ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" describes the structure of the film. The first part of the story is about society - it takes place in the world of law, duty and ceremony. The second part takes us beneath the surface, into the world of individuals and their relationships. The story becomes a psychological one.<br/><br/>I cannot stand senseless violence and I will be the first to admit that I haven't watched enough Chinese movies or Hong Kong action movies to make the assumption that they have senseless violence in them. I felt the fighting in this movie was so emotional and so much a part of the story that when it occurred, it felt right. It didn't feel ""cheap"" to me as if it was a cinematic device to keep the audience interested and on the edge of their seat. I was breathless after the first sequence. It was very emotional and graceful even though it was martial arts.<br/><br/>James Schamus: And ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is not a Kung Fu movie that we associate with street fighting. This movie is more about inner strength and centeredness. That's where the floating comes in, more romantic choreography and dance.<br/><br/>James Schamus: In this film, the acting, the drama has a kind of martial arts choreography to it. It has that kind of grandness and scale. And the martial arts themselves are a kind of dance and very abstract art: motion, editing, movement, and image.<br/><br/>Ang Lee: Through the martial arts you express how you feel instead of just beating someone up. There is a dramatic quality to it.<br/><br/>James Schamus: The people are expressing where they are, their ambiguities and ambivalences, the conflicts they feel. In most of the fights in this movie, the people can't fully fight, because emotionally they are torn. So, the fighting is a way of thinking and feeling and relating.<br/><br/>
As for the flying, I accepted it and didn't really initially try to find an explanation for it. It is a fantasy after all and you have to suspend your disbelief in any fantasy movie. I read somewhere of an explanation for it that I found interesting. I will try and explain this concept as best as I understand it. This person said that the flying had to do with their level of enlightment and attachment to society. Li Mu Bai was almost to that point and therefore his movements were more effortless and fluid. Shu Lien had to struggle more because she was more bound to her duties on earth. Jen wanted that kind of life and that enlightment and she also had fewer responsibilities so she did not have to make as much effort as Shu Lien. Maybe it was me, but I could clearly see that she had to put more effort into her flying than Jen had to in the first fighting sequence.<br/><br/>Ang Lee: The fictional Giang Hu world is very popular in Chinese culture. Li Mu Bai's character - righting wrongs, staying true to his word - is wishful thinking come true. A constant theme of the Wuxia novels is that of surpassing your abilities through practicing your martial art. You keep doing this, and fulfill the final achievement, which is transcendence.<br/><br/>James Schamus: And in this particular case, the Taoist influence...<br/><br/>Ang Lee: Internal strength is, in essence a search for nothingness, in the void, to find your strength. Because you are pulled apart by tension, which comes from external emotions, complex relationships-all your strength goes in different directions. If you can lose this tension and direct all your energy to one channel, find transcendence, then you can create tremendous power and wisdom.<br/><br/>
This movie has so much depth to it that you cannot understand or appreciate it after only one viewing. Some users commented that the flashback scene was overly long and pointless. I felt we needed this flashback to understand Jen and Lo's character better. It definitely introduced us to Lo and it helped us to understand Jen. From watching this flashback I could see how stubborn and passionate Jen really was. I could also see how much she had changed in terms of her desires and goals. At that point in time with Lo, she was able to settle down with him if just for a moment and in her innocence, to try and commit to him. By the time they meet up again, her goals have changed; she wants the Giang Hu life and to have freedom to do what she wants and not settle down. Lo, however, has not changed. He has spent all of this time trying to make himself respectable and to be able to be with her and build a life with her. It is tragic seeing them together again and realize that they have lost their innocence and their dreams of being together. This flashback was necessary to illustrate these differences and to enable us to empathize more with the characters.<br/><br/>According to someone, if you listen very carefully to the dialogue between Jen and Lo concerning the part where Lo ""tells her the legend of a boy who jumped from a mountain they gaze upon, so that his wish would be granted. His parents were ill and he jumped to save them. The boy didn't die, and wasn't even hurt. He just floated away on the clouds, never to return. He knew that his wish had come true."" This is an enlightening piece of dialogue that will clue you in on that mysterious ending of why Jen jumped off the mountain at the end of the movie. Did she die? Did she not die? Perhaps it is a test for her of the decisions she has made thus far... in any case, I am paying more close attention to that part the next time that I watch it.<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about this movie but I wanted to finally address those comments where someone mentioned that they couldn't see anything between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien and that they felt the ending was cheap and uncharacteristic. I can only assume this person expects these two characters to throw themselves at each other before he realizes the love and respect they have for each other. Or at the very least, to show some outward physical affection which would be quite contradictory to their characters and probably to the eastern culture in general. I thought it was very real and emotional because I know of many older couples in my culture that don't show physical affection and everything is in the eyes and I could not doubt for a second how much love and respect they have for each other because of their shared experiences and history. This is how I approached these two characters and it felt very honest and mature and I saw it as a love and respect in which physical affection could not do justice. Li Mu Bai's death and subsequent confessions were more meaningful to me than the tragedy of Jen and Lo.<br/><br/>This movie is so wonderful because the characters feel real. There are no good guys and bad guys in this movie. Just plain human desires, decisions and regrets. All the main characters were fascinating and all were tragic as in real life. For those moviegoers that expect a straight story and to have information fed to them, this just isn't the movie for them. You have to go in to see this movie with your brain and intellect in check. If you plain just don't care for this kind of movie, fine. Having to read ignorant comments about this movie without attempting to try and understand it is a tragedy.<br/><br/>Perhaps I read too much into this movie. I know that there might be movies with better fight scenes, better this and better that, but as a whole, the acting, plot, fighting and drama is well balanced in this movie. It is an artistic movie that attempts to redefine the genre while at the same time paying tribute to it; trying to reach a usually inaccessible audience. It succeeds on this level and more. I welcome all intelligent interpretations and insights."
"Rhino Rover","10","0","0","5 April 2001"," Excellent but not a martial arts film
","You know what I find so appropriate about the title of this film? It has managed to stay hidden in the background from critic eyes and yet it literally crouched up onto the competition and take everyone by surprise at the last minute. If you look at all the films selected for Oscar nominations, every one of them has been playing in the theatres for a long time or has been a major box office hit. The only film that is remotely similar in feel is Chocolat and at best it is a long shot to win Best Picture. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came onto the seen not too long ago and not with a lot of marketing hype and yet it has managed to garner the second most Oscar nominations next to the goliath film, Gladiator. This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do: make women the strong central characters.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not. Take this film for what it was meant to bea story about a legend, inner strength and undeniable honor.<br/><br/>Alan"

","It certainly deserves the Oscars for best art direction, best original score and best cinematography. That's THREE Oscars, not four. (I think the best Foreign Language Film cannot be included). They are really doing a great job as those three factors are supporting each other. Good art direction makes good cinematography and they are sweetened by a good music arrangements. The trio are like old classical music, it's really indeed in the harmony.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they are heavily ruined by the most conventional plot ever made. It's like you're a big fan of pizza, and it looks very good with all the meat, the vegetables, the mushroom and the sauce. But when you finally taste it, the bread is awful and it ruins your appetite. That's what I felt when I first, second and three times, saw this movie. I cannot feel the emotion as it's supposed to be when I finally understand the story. It's because all characters talk like several heartless androids who pretend to be humans. The dialog scenes are just too lame, boring and uninteristing. Most people are astounded by the fighting scenes, but to me, it's too ordinary and unrealistic. There's one scene that bothers me a lot, when Michelle Yeoh acts like a true sister to the princess, but then suddenly she's furious at her without a strong motivation. If I hadn't known Ang Lee as a ""renowned"" director, I would have thought it was a cheat to get them into fighting again.<br/><br/>To summarize, it's an ordinary kung fu movie with great visualization."

","I just returned from the movie theater. It had been over a month since the last time I had been there. Nothing had really interested me to make me couch up the ten bucks that would get me into a comfy chair in a darkened room with hundreds of strangers.<br/><br/>But 'Crouching Tiger...' was different, from the very beginning. Even without seeing the trailers (I usually don't; they tend to be misleading, or spoil the fun, or they just show the best scenes) I just KNEW this would be a great picture. The story struck me as typically oriental: simple in the surface, but with many layers. If you add to that the fact that I'm a very big fan of Hong Kong movies, you'll understand what draw me to the multiplex.<br/><br/>But, the magic of the movie is not only in the wiring, as one might say. Granted, the fight scenes are amazing, visually stunning and lirically beautiful. Nonetheless, I would say the movie strengths lie in the powerful acting and the even more compelling tale of treachery, love, fate and death that it gives the audience. Chow Yung Fat confirms why he is Hong Kong best: his acting is restrained yet strong in a very Eastwood-esque way. A very nice surprise comes from Michelle Yeoh, who shows that she can jump and manipulate swords and generally kick some ass, yet her performance is sensitive and deep. Ziyi Zhang, the third side of this triangle, is beautiful but it's the sense of innocence lost that permeates her every word that makes her even more fragile.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is superb. The photography is breathtaking, and Ang Lee's skillful hand lets the story develop in a slow pace that helps us get into the magical mood necessary to understand what this movie is about.<br/><br/>'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' might as well be 2000's best picture (after lots of scary movies, road movies and unbreakable guys), and if it is not, at least it's the best way the end the year. Don't miss it."

It's not the best kungfu movie because it relies too much of wire-fu special FX.  But if you judge them as action sequences (not kungfu sequences) they're clearly the best EVER put in the silver screen.  Far exceeds the Matrix sequences. To the untrained eye (99% of the population) the martial arts appear authentic... unlike Keanu Reeves & Lawrence Fishburne in The Matrix.<br/><br/>But people who watch this movie expecting a blockbuster action flick WILL NOT enjoy it.  These action sequences appear only intermittenly, and much of the movie is filled with dialogues & beautiful scenes.  People who want adrenaline-pumping movies are better off renting Die-Hard or any John Woo movie (Face Off, Mission Impossible 2).<br/><br/>People who see this movie expecting a wonderful storyline should think twice.  The plot is good, but basic --- afterall, it's based on Chinese folklore.  The plot resembles a parable more than it does an actual storyline.  Think (Oscar-winning) ""Unforgiven"" by Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great movie because it takes the viewers into a different place.  I don't speak Chinese, but I'll be darned if I even remember reading subtitles during the movie.  That's how engrossing the film is: You forget that you've been reading subtitles all along, and imagine that you understood the spoken dialogue.<br/><br/>Beautiful scenery, wonderful actors, and a storyline based on a world Hollywood has never seen before.  Imagine watching the first Western ever created.  You would've been blown away with the concept of Cowboys, Sheriffs, and High-Noon shootouts.

","My ultimate measure of quality in a film is how understandable the psychology of the characters is. Ambiguously evil villains and infallible heroes make a story line boring at best and completely derail it at worst. Every character in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is thoroughly understandable and multi-dimensional, complete with desires and flaws. These characters are real people in complex situations and, although the setting and much of the action is highly fantastic, we can all relate to them. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon reaches across time and culture to take the viewer on deeply philosophical and spiritual journey. I was highly impressed with both the acting and the action of the film, truly a masterful accomplishment by director Ang Lee. I was also impressed on how egalitarian the characters seemed, with as strong a set of female characters as has been found in cinema in a long time.

","A lot of my friends in this part of the world do not think much of this film. They either think they have seen similar films before or they say they do not see any plot in this film. I must say I totally disagree with them. Having long given up hope that any good will come of a Chinese big screen production, I was dragged into the cinema by my other half to see this film just because she has a crush on Chow Yun Fat (mind you, that was in July last year in Hong Kong and before any hype). But, bingo!  Here it is, a film which, in my opinion at least, succeeds in bringing out, where so many others have failed, the mood/atmosphere created by those good Wuxia novels that many Chinese of my generation spent their past time reading in their adolescence.  It is difficult to describe what that mood is but it includes many of the elements that have already been discussed in this column, honour, chivalry, the majesty of the Chinese landscape and the subtlety of the Chinese culture. It is indeed a dream comes true. Although I think there are flaws with this film (the plot being one of them, probably because it was based on only part of the novel and seems somewhat disjointed at time), I think these are minor flaws in an otherwise magnificient effort on the part of Ang Lee et al.  I also hope that this is not the last. But this may just be wishful thinking as there seem to be few Chinese film makers these days that possess, like Ang Lee does, both a healthy respect/understanding of their home culture and a good sense of the market.  So Holywood can feel at ease.  Finally, I heard that a Chinese action film director is planning to team up with a Canto-popstar to make a film on a Sung dynasty war hero. I sincerely hope that he will not turn this Sung chap into some kind of Kungfu master character."

","Lots of movies have been magnificent mainly for their backdrops--the production design, location, cinematography; or for the lyric movements of their cameras; or for the charisma of their stars; or for the power and poetry-in-motion of brilliant action.  CTHD meets each of those challenges on the grounds of the greats, and joys in them all.<br/><br/>It's incredibly accomplished on all levels: strange, breathtaking, deeply imaginative, wonderful film, largely dwelling on the modesty of gifted people.  In this case the gifted characters can stand in too for the filmmaking crew--down to the excellent subtitle work.<br/><br/>With a surprising ease, it marks the end of the Hollywood action blockbuster.  Stallone, Schwarzenegger, whichever Bond--never mind Seagal or Van Damme or Schumacher's Batman--you won't go back.  It makes the Hollywoods look that much cruder, that much leakier at the seams.  Or if you want, Li Mu Bai and Yu Jen would kick their asses.  And since it weaves romance in with its great battles (the two are pretty closely tied in this movie), this a pretty good bet no matter which gender demographic you've found yourself in.

"Sunny99","10","0","0","29 March 2001"," Regarding Voice, Plot, Translation-- answering ""Whaleking""
","I loved this movie and end up watching it twice in the theater in my midwest town.  It is definitely worth the time and cost for me.  I would not say it is 100% perfect-- no movie is perfect.  However, it is a very oriental, very sincere & beautiful film, so different from the other films we usually got to see in this side of world.<br/><br/>I was also quite shocked when I read a post by ""Whaleking"" on March 28. He ""claim"" he is from Taiwan but he post some points that I just have to totally disagree, being myself a Taiwanese, and I speak Mandrin very well.<br/><br/>1. ""Whaleking"" say this movie has ""no plot"".  I almost drop my jaw on his ignorant comments. To me, this movie has main plots, has sub-plots, and even have 'hidden plots'.  What more can you ask?  I can only say this movie is a subtle and intelligent movie.  If the viewer is sensitive and intelligent enough, he will feel these plots are working together nicely, like many of my friends feel.  If the viewer did not catch the sub or hidden plot, he may think this movie has little plot or 'bad' plot.  It is mainly the problem with the viewer, not the movie itself.  You may not like the style of this movie but it did have very good plots. ( I work in a university and  I have talked to several PhD level movie goer and they all agree with me on this.)<br/><br/>2. ""Whaleking"" say this movie has ""bad translation"".  I strongly disagree with that.  First, this movie was based on an old Chinese novel, but the first screenplay was written in English by James Schamus with the help from Ang Lee (surprise, right?).  It is then passed to an Taiwanese screen writer Wang Hui-ling to creat the Mandrin version of screen play.  They do not intend to ""translate everything from Mandrin to English"" AT ALL, as Whaleking ""imagined"" !!   An intelligent movie maker know these two cultures are so different, you have to sometimes use different way of expressions in order to touch the hearts of viewers from different cultures.  Also the subtitle need to be very concise so you can't cover every word the actor was saying.<br/><br/>3. He claim he can't stand the Mandarin audio of Chen Chang (Lo).  Again, I, as a native Mandrin speaker, just have to strongly disagree.  Yes, Chen Chang's role (Lo) is a bandit, so his voice acting is maybe too ""gentle"" as a desert bandit.  But remember, Lo was a young bandit and he was in love with a teenage beautiful girl!  How can he be rude and rough (like a bandit?) while bathing with his young lover??  After all, the story is describing him as a ""lovely young bandit who was sincere and true to his first love"".  About his Mandrin, I can not pick any really flaw.  He may has light asscent, but every actor in this film has it one way or another, and I think that's more realistic than dubbing their voices.  Many serious movie goer already say that it is a blessing that Ang Lee insisted keeping the movie's original audio, and not dubbing it!  So please let's stop repeating it here. ( However, for people who prefer listen to English, there will be an English Audio in the DVD version. :-)  )<br/><br/>I was from Taiwan and I am so happy that CTHD actually win 4 Oscar awards, including a ""Best Foreign Language Movie"" for Taiwan.  It is especially hard, because there was no Asian movie winning that Award in the past 40 years, if my memory is correct.  It is also very impressing that a movie from East can be so broadly accepted and enjoyed in US, to become a 100+ million film and still going.<br/><br/>Thank you all movie lover who make this happen!  The earth is truly on its way to become a world-village.  and thank you Ang Lee for making such a good quality movie for us to enjoy!"

","The Chinese movie performed by the director Ann Lee was a complete success. Amazing martial art fights mixed with romance and mystery produced a 4 Oscar-winning movie. Although the plot of the movie was not very interesting to me, the scene and pictures were good enough to make my ticket worthy. The story spins around a sword which was considered a piece of art as well as a lethal weapon. This sword is stolen by a young girl who becomes a powerful warrior searching for emotion and adventure. The ex-owner of this sword will try to get it back for the rest of the movie creating a whole bunch of situations involving magic, love, friendship and, of course, martial art action. The only negative aspect of this sample of Chinese art could be the subtitles one is obliged to read if one does not understand mandarin. Easily, you will get tired after watching the movie besides it is not possible to enjoy the beautiful sceneries the movie shows while reading the translation. Finally, I would recommend the movie to those people who enjoy martial arts but not to those ones who expect hi-tech effects as the Hollywood style."

"Russssss-1","9","0","0","29 March 2001"," Americanisation of Chinese story
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has interestingly received far more attention, especially critical attention, in the US than it has in China! I teach in a senior high school in Ningbo and of the high number of students who have seen the film only a handful professed anything other than disdain for it. The main comment has been that they have seen many films like it but that they were better!<br/><br/>I don't know if this is true but it raises interesting questions about the reception of the film and how it has been perceived. Although it was directed by Ang Lee, a Taiwanese native and has been claimed as a Chinese film very vociferously by the Chinese media, there is a strong element of the film that is undeniably slanted toward a Western, and therefore in filmic terms by definition a Hollywood, sensibility.<br/><br/>This mystification of Chinese spirituality and history gives it an added pull at the American box-office where it's $100m + haul makes it a commercial success but this has failed to appeal to the Chinese mass market in quite the same way! In many ways, Crouching is symptomatic of the effect of globalisation, but a globalisation where America is the senior partner! Part of the success of the film lies in its marketing strategy which has followed Hollywood custom & practice in having a large percentage of the final budget allocated to publicity and presentation. This has not been seen in China before and coupled with the fact that the last films of Wong Kar-wai & Zhang Yimou were co-financedm by American money illustrates that America is more than keen, as ever, to try to seize a foothold in foreign markets no matter what!<br/><br/>But getting back to Crouching, the much lauded film music, featuring the cello playing of Ma Yo-yo sounds authentically Chinese in a romantic-tourist idea of what Chinese is and yet the soundtrack features a song sung in English that is effectively an action replay of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On from Titanic.The fact that it is sung by Coco Lee, Chinese born/American raised, illustrates this duopoly that the film encompasses of trying to combine two widely disparate elements that have seldom been successfully married before. Thus, for American audiences, the mix of Hong Kong film style martial arts with Titanic-esque romance, with a hint of the spices of the East, makes for a tantalising dish.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is an excellent film. The action sequences may drag a tad but the adult romance stories, and especially that of the requited, non-sexual and respectful love of the Chow Yun Fat & Michelle yeoh characters place the film in another league to the often wafer thin love stories found in the average Hollywood blockbuster. It is undeniably epic in scope, rich in the texture of its images and appealing in its simple good versus evil conflict. Thus, it can appeal on different levels and rewards repeated viewings in a way that the other contenders for Best Film at this years Oscars do not. Zhang Ziyi could well be the next big foreign star in Hollywood and could be the major female success there that was once predicted of Gong Li.Her performance in Zhang Yimou's The Road Home promised much and Crouching has helped place her in a similar position to that Gong Li was in after Raise the Red Lantern. Now however, Zhang Ziyi is in a much better position to exploit her potential than Gong Li was because of China's developing position as the soon-to-be biggest economy in the world.<br/><br/>Crouching will be re-assessed in a few years time & I predict it will then be seen as an important event in the changing world political-economic sphere. Ang Lee has lent his name to a film that can in 2001 be seen as a celluloid representation of the process of globalisation & unlike other globalisation events re: Seattle & Prague, this one is popular!!!"

Reality is not the desired effect.  Is Achilles' invulnerability realistic?  Do we think that a single man in armour could really kill a giant, fire-breathing lizard?  Can Arnold Schwarzenegger really mow down hordes of faceless mooks with a machine gun and walk away untouched?  The flying, the superhuman reflexes are just another example of this.<br/><br/>What people should be saying about the fight scenes is that they are fantastically choreographed, with superb timing and camera positioning.

I heard that Ang Lee did not want to dubb this movie(no matter in Chinese or in English),and I think he really made a great mistake not dubbing Lo's part. Some Non-Chinese speaking viewers find it annoying to look at the subtitles in order to understand the plot,well, here's my advice: don't bother reading the subtitles. First, it is poorly translated----there are some things in foreign languages that can never be properly translated into English, and in the case of CTHD, A LOT-----Second, the plot itself isn't anything worth the brainpower comprehending.As a person growing up reading and seeing Chinese martial novels and movies of all sorts, the plot of CTHD is just uncreatively average.So for those planning to see CTHD(again maybe?), pay less attention to the plot and the subtitles, and more attention to the incredibly wonderful cinematography and great fighting scenes!(personally I favor the part where Jen and Shu Lian fight indoors using a lot of different weapons) And if you go to the cinema to see it, take a chance to look at Chinese people among the audience----and have fun seeing their ""God!I want to run away"" grit-teeth-expression whenever Lo talks!"

You can choose not to like it, it doesn't matter, just like many Chinese audiences, they don't like it, but their critizing point is not this. To a Chinese audience, they know that flying is impossible, fighting shouldn't be like dancing, but they accept it, since they understand the culture. This culture comes from traditional swordman novels, just like the English understand the world of JJR Tolkens (sort of Dwarfs/Dragons/middle earth).<br/><br/>A Chinese audience could categorize swordman movies (just like CTHD, warriors fly around), kung fu movies in olden days (more realistic fights in the Ching Dynasty) and modern kung fu movies (Jackie Chan movie which have realistic fights). But western audiences mix them up, they take them as one category. Why, because they've never tried to watch these movies or tried to understand others culture. On the other hand, a Chinese audience could accept the JJR Tolkens/Willows style of imagination, not because they believe it, it's because they accept it as a foreign culture. Why do they accept it, because they've seen so much such kind of Hollywood movies (or other foreign movies).

It is a film of epic proportion - of legendary heroes, honour codes, and ancient grudges. The film is beautifully shot, from the vast deserts of Western China to the lush green mountains and the bustling citadel of ancient Beijing. The sets are comparable to the Emperor and the Assasin. The attention to detail also adds a level of belief to this movie, as evry extra has a unique get-up or weapon. I cannot express just how impressed I am with this movie with mere words.

Given that it is never going to be perfect, but as a seasoned English subtitle reader, it can be further improved. There were some spelling mistakes in the subtitles as well. Certain words like ""Giang Hu"" are spelt wrongly (is there actually a correct spelling for this?) and it may not be immediately clear to someone who has never watched a Chinese swashblucker before.<br/><br/>Apart from these little technical details, I think that the show is really good.

But we all agree that this movie virtualize those stories into the best form that you can see, you can hear and you can feel.  There is always some feeling that you can't express.  Movies can do that, can speak for you.  That's how I feel about this movie.  It represents part of our culture.  Of course,  we understand the beauty of it more.  For those who dislike the movie, I am sorry to say that you may not like our culture. Just like some people, such as my bf, don't like Chinese food, or think they like the American-Chinese food.  For those how like the movie and you see the deep part of the movie, I thank you for ""trying"" to understand our culture.  I may not say all the culture in that movie are good.  But I thank you to open your mind to us.  Just like we try so hard to understand American jokes, I know it's so hard for trying.<br/><br/>I should say this is NOT a martial arts movie, at least not the kind what is well-known by Americans.  It's the DREAM of our ancient martial arts.  That's why we love it.  It's our dream, not yours.  The flying thing, of course, seems to be not realistic, same as that the mental power thing in ""Star Wars"" is so funny to me.  My bf used to hope that I would like ""Star Wars"" and ""South Park"", but he failed.  Now I know it's because we have different cultures.  So if you dislike the movie, maybe you should realize that you can't like most of Chinese culture.  It's not the kind of the martial arts you want, not the love you understand and not the life attitude you can imagine in your culture.

You should be thankful for living in such an environment where is full of the movies in your language.  For us, we watch all non-Chinese movies with Chinese subtitles (EVERY SINGLE movie from American, specially there are tons of American movies made each year.). So if you want to watch this Chinese movie, accept the subtitle. You have no right to judge it if you are having problem reading the subtitle.  It's a movie for Chinese and everyone is welcome to enjoy it.  But it should keep its original language.  We don't expect Julia Roberts ""speaks"" Chinese in her movie.  So don't complain too much on the Chinese audio as well.  It's not designed ONLY for you.<br/><br/>On more thing.  I love Matrix very much. However, I would not compare this movie with Matrix, because they are totally different.  The only same part is that they are all unrealistic in action parts.<br/><br/>At the end, I want to rate it 9 of 10, as a Chinese ; If I were an American, it would be 5 from not understanding it."

","I believe in the free speech, and everyone's right to their own opinion as far as movies go, but a certain individual has crossed the line with his blatantly racist and hateful comments towards Asians and other non-English speaking peoples.  I am frankly amazed at the overwhelmingly positive response CTHD have had from Americans and other non-Asian peoples, and that we may be evolving towards a more open and accepting attitude towards other cultures and ethnicities here in the US.  It is unfortunate though not surprising that some individuals will display certain recessive traits that often surface due to restricted gene pooling as a result of excessive in-breeding. <br/><br/>To those individuals let me say that the secret is out.  We Chinese CAN fly, and have and an inner force of unspeakable power.  Ang Lee has exposed our little secret, and now we'll have to up our timetable for enslaving the free world and making them watch subtitled movies with multiple storylines.

","Ok, I'll admit it, I'd never heard of Wu Xia when I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I guess I expected what most Americans have come to expect as standard martial arts fare. Immediately, the treatment of the film reminded me much more of Kaige Chen and Yimou Zhang than Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. Something was remarkably different here... Not knowing what to expect, I watched as the characters moved from fighting to flying! I found myself laughing with joy at the sheer beauty of what my eyes were seeing but my oh-so-rational mind told me wasn't possible.<br/><br/>The scope and direction of CTHD kept me riveted to my seat, my eyes to the screen. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Indulge me as I pay homage to the beauty and elegance of CTHD. The acting is superb (no nominations?)! The cinematography is breathtaking. Who cannot marvel at the sheer beauty of the battle in the bamboo trees?<br/><br/>The central character, Jen, is a fascinating character study of adolescent rebellion, juxtaposed with the courage, honor and duty of Bai, Shu Lien and even Lo. Heavily laden with symbolism and archetypal imagery, CTHD is closer to Greek Tragedy than what I used to think of as ""martial arts.""<br/><br/>Since the day I first saw CTHD, I've learned a great deal more about Wu Xia, and I look forward to checking out some of the other important films in the genre.<br/><br/>I understand that for longtime fans of Hong Kong cinema and Wu Xia, this movie may not blaze any new trails, but for me it has been an eye opening, mouth gaping education."

"Eric-186","10","0","0","18 December 2000"," A truly great film.
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is truly a great film. I'm normally very critical towards the films I watch so I don't give this praise lightly. First off, this movie shows the talent level of Hong Kong/Chinese and Taiwan movie making in particular which we North Americans have been so deprived of all these years. Even the recent releases of Hong Kong films in the US aren't even close to the best films that came out from that area. Unlike most action movies nowadays, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon uses action as a means of furthering the story instead of using a plot as an excuse for action. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed, far surpassing the Matrix and the actors have done an excellent job pulling it off. I enjoyed the Matrix, but it's not in the same league as this film.<br/><br/>Don't get confused though. This movie wasn't inspired by the Matrix. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is part of a very popular chinese genre called Wu Xia (roughly equivalent to our swords and wizards fantasy genres), which has existed for a long time. Matrix actually got it's inspirations from this genre because Hong Kong and other chinese regions have come out with such  movies for a long time. The action director and martial arts choreagrapher for the Matrix is actually from Hong Kong and has worked on countless chinese films before the Matrix.<br/><br/>I would strongly suggest anyone to see this film, as it's not just an action film, but something far surpassing  it. Films like this don't come by very often so check it out. It's much better and more original than many Hollywood films we get now that shamelessly follows the same formula."
"McBrenda","Null","0","0","24 March 2001"," What I liked.
","With every word, we describe ourselves more than whatever it is we're talking about.<br/><br/>Ok, I liked it.  I know a few reasons why I liked it and found it interesting, but I don't know why it is considered great.  On the other hand, I realized, standing in front of Michelangelo's David, in Florence, that if someone less talented had created it, and the world still revered it, that I wouldn't know the difference.  Great art is lost on me.  I suspect that it's lost on most of us, that it's marketing that saves most of it from obscurity.<br/><br/>The flying during the martial arts scenes threw me.  Then I realized how westerners wouldn't have any problem with wizards performing magic in movies, that our culture makes that easy to accept for us.  Similarly, Chinese culture makes the notion of martial arts ""wizards"" entirely acceptable to people of that culture.  I like the presence  of magic as a metaphor and reminder for what's magical about life.  For instance, for a time, itself made meaningless by the lack of a universe as we know it, there was *nothing*.  Then, out of that nothing, the universe exploded.  Then, somehow, life happened.  What's more magical than that?  Or, some Supreme Being created all this.  That's less magical?  So all of this, including all the rational science, simply dwarfs flying through the air, for pure magic content.<br/><br/>I liked the feminist presence, where women are every bit as physical, and demand the same performance from themselves, as men, without making it a huge issue that they're women doing it.  They simply do it, and quite well. That's a feminism I can sink my teeth into honestly respecting.<br/><br/>I liked the way the young woman's flashback to her first involvement with the bandit leader expanded the scope and plot of the film, while bringing in such beautiful desert scenery.  I never think of China as having deserts. I liked having that particular horizon expanded.  I also liked the way they fought it out, how neither gave in, and how they fell in love in the process.  There's a heartening fantasy/metaphor for relations between men and women - that through all the conflicts and problems, there's something to draw us together, that makes us care about and respect each other.  I am a sucker for some love stories.<br/><br/>I liked the cinematography, if that's what's called.  The scenery, and the art used in filming it, were wonderful.  What is beautiful within us resonates with what is beautiful around us.  Experiencing what is beautiful makes me think God may exist.<br/><br/>I liked that something about the film overcome my racism, that it let me understand and care about people from a very different culture.    I have to like someone in a film to like the film, and I liked several people in this film.  What a refreshing change, to be shown and drawn into a whole other world.  More horizons expanded.  I wouldn't mind more of that.<br/><br/>So my advice is, forget the marketing that says it's great, and just go see it.  There's a lot to enjoy about it.  Me, I want the DVD when it comes out."

","I've seen similar films years before (Chinese Ghost Story films), so when I read & heard all the good reviews that praised this film, it received loads of credits during the IFF Rotterdam in January and was considered one of the better films shown, I went to see it with high expectations. The film is certainly filmed beautifully and although it is difficult to judge a film in a foreign language, especially an unfamiliar one, I found the acting convincing. The settings, costumes and the humor are enjoyable. However the story could not catch me and the way it was told was too hastily. Action scenes come falling out of the air and the connection between scenes is not always obvious. If the pace was a little slower, more scenes had been added to glue everything together the film would have made more impact. Of course it is an action film, but these need their slow parts as well to make the fast part convincing. Leaving the theater I did not have the feeling I saw something amazing. I've seen better films in this genre. It was a nice film, and with that everything is said."

Despite its questionable violence in most of the scenes and its sexual themes, the movie still kept its cool and never lost its touch. I didn't really remember any of the character's names, but the movie was understandable enough to view as a classic. Do I think it'll win Best Picture at the Oscars? No. The reason is not because its a foreign film, but because of the teenage based audience and its style. I admit that Director Ang Lee did a good job but I believe he kind of overdid it- the flying, lazy sword battles, poison arrows- this movie kind of reminded me of Mulan. So in other words, this movie is basically Mulan that is not animated- nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards. <br/><br/>Out of a rating of 1-10- I give it a 7"

"repulsion","Null","0","0","17 December 2000"," An accomplished film by Ang Lee
","The story begins when a renowned swordsman named Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) travels to the palace of a peaceful king named Sir Te, whose security is maintained by his friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai has just returned from a meditative excursion to a mountain that has left him spiritually unsound. Although his non-enlightenment was something that has left him in a state of unease, and at odds with the promise made to him by his dead master, Mu Bai still decides to renounce his famed sword, the Green Destiny, to the protective hands of Sir Te.<br/><br/>Ang Lee quickly establishes the social order of his characters when Shu Lien meets Sir Te's daughter Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a seemingly quiet girl whose secretly rebellious nature lies at the center of the film. A mysterious figure steals the Green Destiny and Mu Bai believes that the perpetrator is Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), a female martial arts legend who was responsible for the death of his mater. The three women at the heart of Crouching Tiger all represent the vastly different paths the female can choose to follow in a world dominated by the fighting male. It's a world that these three women have longed for but one so inherently uninviting to the woman that it is very easy for these women to choose the path towards evil. Jen, arguably the film's center, is caught in the middle; needing to decide whether to follow the teachings of Jade Fox or bow before the open arms of Mu Bai and Shu Lien.<br/><br/>The Wuxia Pien, a category of the kung fu drama relying heavily on the presence of warriors with magical warriors, is something inherently melodramatic and ridden with archetypes and cliches. This is in full effect in Crouching Tiger, but Lee manages to stage the proceedings with such a gorgeous glow and pristine understanding of his characters pathos that their journeys toward self-actualization is something that is always within the realm of complete believability.<br/><br/>Take one scene in the desert, where Jen becomes romantically linked with the bandit Lo (Chen Chang). The flashback to the much younger Jen shows her pursuing Lo across the desert in an attempt to retrieve a comb. Her pursuit of the girly item (albeit a family heirloom) is at first troubling, considering how fiercely independent she is, but her journey becomes rooted in a mutual exchange of power between herself and Lo. Her love for Lo, erotically charged in ways that makes Minghella's The English Patient look like the cheap burlesque story that it is, becomes the source of primal strength that will drive Jen throughout the duration of her life.<br/><br/>Lee and Peter Pau, his cinematographer, stage their characters within their settings in such a way that their relationship to their environment becomes something from which the characters draw spiritual strength. Mu Bai and Jen's dance atop a forest's treetops, the film's visual centerpiece, could have been saddled with spectacle but Lee turns the choreographed bout into something much more urgent. It is a battle between a man completely at ease with his relationship to nature and a woman so driven to prove a point that she has failed to notice that her impulsiveness has not gained her the spiritual peace of mind that will make her a true master.<br/><br/>Many have singled out Michelle Yeoh as the centerpiece of the film. One would be hard-pressed to find an actress who can express so much with so little and even though Yeoh's tragic beauty seems to hint at a legacy of pain, Lee fails in truly center Yeoh's Shu Lien within the confines of a solid and three-dimensional narrative. It's always clear that she and Mu Bai gave up on love because of the respect she still harbors for her dead lover, but there is nothing to their relationship aside from a couple of longing stares. It's subtle, but too subdued to register as much of a passionately resonating impulse as the relationship between Jen and Lo.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon belongs entirely to Zhang Ziyi, a fierce creature that teeter-totters between the inviting force of good and evil. Her journey, which ends in a glorious display of spiritual self-sacrifice, is engaging because we never know at any given point in the film whether she will fall into the welcoming arms of Mu Bai or Jade Fox. She is to Crouching Tiger what Luke Skywalker was to Star Wars, and I'm sure many will find the mythos that is so deeply-rooted in the Lee film to be reminiscent of the world that Lucas created in his 1977 space saga.<br/><br/>The world of Crouching Tiger could very well be the world of China itself. It is a world of magic and intrigue, where men and women are bound by the ethos of honor and dignity. It is a land rich with the intricate history of all it's people, slowly enveloping its arms around the females of the land, long relegated to the role of servant and obedient wife. Many will no doubt flippantly brush Lee's film away as a mere post-feminist diatribe, catering to the Camille Paglias of the world who long for female empowerment in otherwise testosterone-laden tales. But let's not trivialize a film that is obviously grasping for something entirely more complex.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger isn't a film about women beating each other up for two hours. Granted, there is plenty of woman-to-woman battle sequences, and they are all ferociously fierce of behold, but the film's quieter moments suggest that this is not merely a film about female empowerment but female solidarity. One of the film's least energized scenes allows us to feel sympathy for the otherwise loathsome Jade Fox because we understand that her chosen path was one that was necessary for her to take. It was a decision that was in direct opposition to the status quo but it was her only apparent means for self-expression. Her intended revenge on one of the main characters is nothing more than a misguided, although understandable, attack on a fellow woman who used thievery to impose above her the proverbial glass ceiling that is usually constructed by the male."

","The Taiwanese born Ang Yee is nothing if not versatile, having in the last few years directed a very polished version of the English classic comedy of manners `Sense and Sensibility' and the very evocative American family tragedy `Ice Storm'. This film brings us to the director's cultural roots, being set in 19th century China and telling the tale of two sets of lovers with strong martial arts backgrounds.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning and the stunts breathtaking; at times you think you are watching ballet rather than swordfighting. There were some magnificent desert shots and some amazing scenes in the tops of a bamboo forest (I trust no Giant Panda habitat was destroyed in the making). The characters are well defined but rather two-dimensional and don't develop much, perhaps they are more archetypes than characters. The younger lady, `supergirl' is rather improbable thought the older pair of lovers ring true - a lady with a past is inherently more interesting than a virginal whirlwind from nowhere.<br/><br/>This movie apparently comes out of a long tradition of Kung Fu films, a genre that bores me rigid, but somehow the director kept me interested until the end. I think it was the sheer ingenuity of the thing that kept me watching. What it says about the culture it come from I'm not sure Â– aggressive, romantic, fatalistic, superstitious, highly developed sense of beauty, all come to mind. Certainly, a strong sense of tradition. Anyway, a visual treat."

","It's almost impossible to find good things to say about this movie that haven't already been said hundreds of times. But I'll say them anyhow: it is epic, exhilirating, engaging, and utterly beautiful.<br/><br/>The major thing to understand about this film is that it is not really a kung fu movie in the traditional sense you'd expect. There's fight scenes, of course -- and they are beyond spectacular -- but for once they complement and enhance the storyline rather than replacing it. This is not another ""hero learns kung fu, conquers all foes"" movie. It is a Chinese fairytale; a Taoist parable writ large. Expect no simplistic good vs. evil tale here. You'll spend too much time trying to figure out who the ""hero"" is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Just one further note: don't be put off by the fact that the movie is subtitled. Some people refuse to watch foreign-language films just because they feel that having to read the subtitles is too distracting; but not to worry, by the time ten minutes have passed you'll have forgotten that the actors are speaking Mandarin at all."

","The elegance of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is possibly the most enriching feeling one can get from an action movie. I can't help but think of Matrix - another splendid, commercial but equally elegant production. What is it about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that makes it so enticing? First of all, sublime visuals - rich colour (starting with the lush green in he opening credits, following with red of dust and blood, blue of deep waters and yellow of the deserts); picturesque locations, and, most of all, of course, the ballet of duels.<br/><br/>This might not be new to East Asia (mmm, now where did Matrix get to know these tricks...), but it is definitely groundbreaking in the West.<br/><br/>The Oscars 2001 belong to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

Ok - the music is great, the cinematography looks good, but if you want to see astounding cinematography in a Chinese movie, I have two words for you: ""Yellow Earth"" (Kaige Chen, 1984). If you want amazing Martial Arts action combined with excellent acting, look no further than Jackie Chan's 1994 ""Drunken Master II"" (Yes - THAT Jackie Chan!!). From reading the comments on this site as well as several external reviews, it would appear that the persons who were most impressed with this movie never saw a Martial Arts or other Chinese film before. Now about the flying...<br/><br/>In a word - SILLY!!!!<br/><br/>It was overdone, completely unnecessary, and detracted from what was an otherwise okay movie. For those unfamiliar with the genre, when this is done, it is usually just at the edge of believability - like ""did I really just see that?"" or ""can they really jump that high?"" not this Peter Pan/Superman nonsense. Strangely enough, I was most impressed with the dubbing. I was expecting it to be subtitled as I had heard that Ang Lee was totally opposed to dubbing. However it was done, great care was taken in the choice of voices, and at times the dubbing was almost seamless - you forgot that they were really speaking Mandarin.<br/><br/>Bottom line - worth seeing, but don't believe the hype!"

","I am mostly in agreement with Ranma. (See a previous comment).<br/><br/>On the point of the lack of or thinness of the plot, based on the sub-titles alone can be seem to be true. For Westerners who can only understand the movie by reading the sub-titles, this is not your fault.<br/><br/>Being a native Mandarin speaker, I can assure anyone that the story is richer and deeper than the sub-titles suggest.<br/><br/>Often 3 or 4 lines of dialogue in Mandarin are condensed into one short sentence in English. This often fails to convey most of the nuance or depth of the conversation. Bits and pieces of information are sometimes neglected!! Modern day one liners are used in abundance adding to the seeming lack of depth.<br/><br/>A good movie but not perfect. A little more time spent during the writing of the script or in the selection of sub-titles could have resulted in a far superior work.<br/><br/>However, Ang Lee and his team fell short only by thaaaaat much!"
"ganbare1","10","0","0","15 December 2000"," An almost-perfect Wuxia film
","First of all, I've read some of the comments posted and to be honest  I'm kind of ticked off by those who don't like the ""excessive"" amount of ""flying"" during the fight scenes.  I believe these people think that Wuxia is the same as Kung-Fu.  Well, they are completely different.<br/><br/>To those who are not familiar with Wuxia, it is a supernatural form of martial arts that was originated from novel writers in China some time ago. (exact time I do not know, if anyone knows, please tell me)  One of the most prolific and celebrated Wuxia novelists is Gin Yon (forgive me if I spelled his name incorrectly).  Almost all, and I mean ALL, Chinese have read his work one time or another.  Simply put, Wuxia is kind of like a fantasy in which characters can defy the laws of physics and perform supernatural stunts and fighting moves.  There is always a clear distinction between the good and the evil, and romance is always an important aspect of the story.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to my point earlier.  Kung-Fu is completely different from Wuxia.  Kung-Fu is real, and Wuxia is surreal.  What makes Wuxia films so interesting is that they can be very creative and imaginative.  A Wuxia (Wuxia literally means martial art warrior), if he/she is good, is expected to leap 50 yards or ""fly"" to a tree top effortlessly.<br/><br/>Another Chinese term which is used in CTHD is Wudan.  For those who don't know,  Wudan is simply one of the many ""schools"" of martial arts in ancient China.  Just like we have Taekuando, Kung-Fu, Judo, etc. today.<br/><br/>Ok, about the film.  It is shot very beautifully.  The locations are breathtaking.  I just wish that Lee Ang could have held the wide-angle establishing shots just a tiny bit longer.  The fight scenes are the best I've seen.  The action is fast and simply jaw-dropping.  The final battle could have been longer though, as it was over even before I knew it.<br/><br/>Zhang Zi Yi's performance is spectacular.  Zhang Yi Mou (director of Raise the Red Latern, To Live) have found a real gem in Zi Yi.  She's the next Gong Li, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat's and Yeoh's accents are a bit annoying for those who understands Mandarin.  Yeoh's Mandarin, to be honest, is bearly passable.<br/><br/>The score, on the other hand, is excellent.  It gave me goosbumps when I heard Yo Yo Ma's beautiful cello in the soundtrack.<br/><br/>All in all this is one heck of a film.  Go see it!!!"

","I finally got around to seeing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in my desire to see all the Academy Award nominees. Personally I enjoyed it, but I can see why others may not. The cinematography was wonderful. The martial arts scenes superb (they make those in the Matrix look like child's play), and the love story wonderful. I liken this movie to a type of Romeo and Juliet in the Far East, but with more complexity. This is by far and above the most compelling Far East movie I've watched. I do think the flying and treetop dancing were a little overdone, but not objectionable.<br/><br/>

","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", is most certainly the best movie I've seen this year.  The drama and the action are amazing.  The acting is the best I've seen ever in a karate movie, the best I've seen in a movie this year - it's a crime that Michelle Yeoh wasn't nominated for Best Actress.  The cinematography is genius - the scenery of mainland China is captured flawlessly, the costumes are in turns effectively simple or incredibly detailed.<br/><br/>Some of the other people who have seen this film pointed out a few ""flaws"". One of the most ridiculous I can find is people complaining of lack of character development.  This movie had some of the most clearly drawn, complex characters in any movie.  Especially note the characters Shu Lien and Jade Fox - both are masterfully portrayed and are a perfect example of the characters' emotions.<br/><br/>While the plot is certainly not the most complex thing, it certainly gives these people a great reason to be running around the country after eachother - the real joy in this movie comes in the interactions.  Any scene in which the three leads are, especially the ones with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, sparkles with energy and chemistry.  This movie proves that the karate genre -- no, movies in general! -- are not beyond hope."

","This is a great movie. YES! Overrated? NO! But unless some reviewers, I can understand why some people don't like it. Ask yourself this, Why do the bad reviews have a lot of paragraphs? Why do these people have the urgent necessity of explain with great tenacity their points?  Why do they use that rhetoric and those remarkable words just to convince you that is a bad movie? What kind of films do they like? (good question!) **SPOILER AHEAD**<br/><br/>The people who like the movie just like it for what is a great action/romance/drama movie. Most of the reviewers who don't like the film said, `I don't get it'. Why? There are three reasons for that (you can choose). FIRST: Maybe they don't want to get it (you can get excuse if you don't like or are not used to read while watching movies). SECOND: Maybe they are used to their `steroid-pumped clowns' heroes who kill every enemy they have in sight. So for them Li Mu Bai do not fit into the hero category, just because he did not kill Darth Maul, Godzilla or Jar Jar Bins at the end of the movie. The man is a hero, a respected warrior, but since they don't know why he gained that reputation they `don't get it'.  So they had no sympathy for this character or any (the characters were not developed) Um! That brings me to the next point. THIRD: Have these guys any imagination at all? Some of them claim that they read, but what do they read? X-Men, Superman, Archie perhaps? They want plot. Maybe they can't see beyond their noses. The main characters are not Li Mu Bai or Shu Lien or Martial Arts or the Sword. The main character is a girl who becomes into a dangerous person due to the misguide of a twisted woman, due to her reckless attitude and mainly because of her whim. But the plot is more than that, just look for it.<br/><br/>They need more character development. In a two hour movie? Can't they just imagine how Li Mu Bai became a great warrior, how and when began the relation between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, how Jen did became a great fighter without the help of the Jade Fox, how can she practice that kind of martial arts without being noticed? Imagination! They read, however, one of the best things of reading is use your imagination. What kind of background had Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars? But we recognized him as a hero and we had sympathy for him. We need no prequels or character development to knew it. Imagination?<br/><br/>Sorry, there is a fourth reason: Maybe some reviewers don't know that there are stories and very beautiful places in other places of the world that are not between Mexico and Canada.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a must see."

However, over the years, I've seen a few 'martial arts' films, that have been just as spectacularly staged (""The Fate of Lee Kahn"", ""Dragon Gate Inn"", and ""Five Fingers Of Death"", are three that immediately come to mind).<br/><br/>The plot device, that of a 'student' set on avenging the death of his 'master', is common to most 'martial arts/kung fu' films, and is no different in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", as it is in the most rudimentary of 'Ninja' films that clutter up the shelves at my local video store.<br/><br/>I agree that the photography is wonderful.

","I find it amazing that some people thought this movie (1) is noteworthy only for the scenery, (2) has little or no character development, (3) has no central plot, and (4) the fighting didn't make them feel life-threatened. If you think (1) is true, you must have been sleeping through the whole movie.  If you think (2) is true, you must be incapable of guessing what another person is thinking or feeling other than from outright verbal expression or from obvious acts involving explosives, knives, guns, or condoms. If you think (3) is true, you either slept/talked through the movie or you are not accustomed to movies with more than 1 story line. If you think (4) is true, you are right but so what?  The point wasn't for gore. Sorry that the women in the movie were portrayed as good fighters ... maybe you can write a letter to the producer and asked that he include 300 lb men yielding axes chopping each others limbs off. Request research be done on the types of damage an axe can do to a human body so the producer can competently plan the scene to give it the life-threatening, realistic feeling that you crave.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes are not that much out of the norm from HongKong TV series and movies that feature fighting set in a time similiar to this movie. And in common with many of those movies that I like, ""Wo Hu Zang Long"" has multiple subplots and is based on a book series. This movie is definitely not overrated especially so when compared to the miserable movies produced by the big studios in 2000.<br/><br/>This movie scores a 10 for entertainment value.

","You need to read the review above from JazzmeltsintoWar before you can appreciate my review. Another review above compared ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to Star Wars and I thought that review did a good job of explaining the idiocy of people who say this movie had no plot, no story, no good acting, stupid action scenes, etc. After reading the review above from JazzmeltsintoWar, I decided to write ""my"" review of all the Star Wars movies - JazzmeltsintoWar style. I do, however, really like Star Wars, but it shows you how crazy it is that people say ""I don't get it"" when talking about ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" By the way, if you can understand anything JudBoy says in his entire review, congrats on your psychological dissection of the protagonistic views of confrontational movie managment skills....see I can use big and meaningless sentences too. I still have no idea what JazzmeltsintoWar was even talking about, but it sure made me.<br/><br/>My review of all four Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>There are those who loved this movie, citing it as cool and exciting, and then are those such as myself who think of it as over-rated.<br/><br/>Those who don't like this movie typically reference the fact that these characters warrant no occasion for our caring for them. They are ""not developed well."" We know little about them, etc etc.<br/><br/>The reality of the movie is, something some viewers have grasped in which case they don't like it, is that the characters and the relationships between them are unengrossing and unidimensional involved in an unidimensional and simple-structured plot that unfolds in the crudest way (i.e., characters, whom we know little about, give us little reason to care for them- at least in my view- who share or reveal few experiences with us apart from fighting, saving a captured princess, fighting off robotic villains, all the while revealing their relationships between them in a peripheral plot structered in an A (introduction/conflict) B (digression/romance) A (resolution to conflict) format)<br/><br/>There is a bivalent dynamic between director/story/movie and the viewer. We speak of things like suspense of disbelief. ""The Force"", for instance, was not a bother to me at all- the movie is a fantasy, though I think the idea of ""The Force"" could have been romanticized, fictionalized a bit, to give it a more apealing aura. As it is it was merely placed in the scenes.<br/><br/>The light saber duels are the most upsetting thing to me. What constitutes our captivation with any light saber duel is that there is a *credible* or somehow real sense of danger. The fighting that takes place between Luke Skywalker and Darth ""Skywalker"" Vader, in particular, is nothing hot or heart-rending. Instead what we have is purposeless, meaningless duel between father and son, who fight for extended periods of time, and always at the end of the movie. One scene has them in a cloud city and they fight first using ""the force"" to just jump and leap, and then use ""the force"" to fling heavy object at each other, as though that's supposed to induce adrenaline in us. It doesn't. What we're left with is a film that reduces to displaying ""how the force looks when used by a master and novice."" Any edge of the seat, heart pumping adrenaline here? Not at all. Personally I get more involved in a regular season highschool chess game.<br/><br/>All the while George Lucas does NOTHING to compensate for the fact that these men flailing wild lightsabers that cut thru anything are supposed to be *believably* formidable somehow as Jedi masters, that their mental attacks using the force actaully do damage etc. What is left is the glaring sensibilty that a viewer simply can't ignore, and if he does grant that ""suspence of disbelief"" it is an act of kindness on the behalf of the viewer. No movie that is supposed to be great an oscar-worthy should require that kind of viewer grace. A huge dissapointment, that could have easily been mended with just a few insertions by the director. Granted, there was one interesting fight scene that takes place by the only interesting characters in the movie, the virile, heroic Obi Won Kenobi and a spiteful, vengeful Darth Maul. Theirs is the only fight scene that carry a sense of adversity and overcoming in it.<br/><br/>George Lucas' touch was welcome, offering us beautiful cinematography, but as noted, by another viewer, is bordering on the amateurish. The idea of being in space could have been in a stale ""noweather"" sound stage, and the beauty is nullified by this fact. Space is beautiful, not images of it.<br/><br/>The relationships and romances, being quite frank, were not engrossing for me at all. Trite sentiments, and banal dialogue.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a great and and overwhelmingly beautful movie. As it is ""I don't get it."" I see a lot of raw potential unfufilled in movie that somehow does not ""work"", does not produce something memorable, wondrous, and a beauty we can be grateful for. Those who don't like this movie, are the ones ""who get it"" We are the ones not seduced by the hype, sensibilities unsedated and clarified. Six and a half stars only."

","I saw this film for the first time last night, and I can say that I was supremely impressed.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice as the film begins and the credits roll over you is the music. The music is some of the best in ANY film, ever. Mostly quiet, the film has managed to escape the hollywood trap of giving every single second of picture a note to go with it. Instead, when the characters talk to each other, there is just the background noise, and their voices. With no music to influence you, it is somehow much more satisfying than it otherwise would be.<br/><br/>But when the action starts, so does the music, and it fits perfectly with the fight scenes; breathtaking.<br/><br/>Which brings me onto the fights. Supremely choreographed, the speed at which the participants move is astonishing, as are a lot of the things they do. If you really thought the matrix had good fight scenes, well, you had obviously never seen a Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan movie, but this puts even them to shame. Unlike almost all other reveiws i have read, i believe that the treetop battle scene is the weakest of the fights, with none of the frantic action of the one in the nighttime courtyard or the fight in the tavern.<br/><br/>During these scenes you get a real sense of danger, of being on the edge - the combatants are only a slipped foot or missed handhold away from dying at the hands of their adversary, and this sense of frantic, urgent action comes across very well.<br/><br/>The heros and heroines of the piece are also extremely well acted in those all important quiet bits. Usually these chop-socky chinese language films are poor when it comes to the storyline, but not in this case. The adult story contains lies, betrayal, revenge, unrequited love and a whole raft of double bluffs.<br/><br/>the scenery is always beautifull and some of the camera work, especially following a falling man down as he falls from one level of a building to another is also fantastic.<br/><br/>Basically, if you havn't seen this yet, you've missed out."

","Yes this is a beautifully photographed film. So what! I didn't pay my hard earns to watch a promo for tourism in mainland China. Call me crazy but when I go to the cinema I like to se a solid plot in conjunction with characters I can emphasize with. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon provided neither for me.<br/><br/>At one stage I thought I was watching a Chinese version of Peter Pan as actors miraculously walked up walls and zoomed across tree tops. I don't have a problem with fantasy but hey guys it would nice to have the ground rules set up before evaporating any historical realism.<br/><br/>I admit martial arts set pieces leave me cold and this film did nothing to change my opinion in this respect. Maybe it's cultural I don't know but those staged fights left me cold. After a while we knew the ball busting chic was unstoppable so it came as no surprise she wasted all the guys in the Chinese version of the old west bar. I got to tell you I had no sympathy for this character. To me she was a privileged spoiled brat who deserved a bit of pay back. The way she treated that barbarian suitor. Why did he put up with her s**t? I would have been interested in the back story to that.<br/><br/>Instead we're treated to cliché city. Just because this film is Chinese and beautifully shot doesn't make it a masterpiece. I'm gratified to see that other user comments are also critical. So they should be. If eye candy and clichés is what you're after go for it. For me there are much better films around this year. Unfortunately the external critics and the voters of the academy tend to hunt in packs so this film will probably scoop the poll. So be it. I'm glad to see I'm not the only heretic here."

","After a year of disappointing movies (witness the mediocre GLADIATOR and ERIN BROCKOVITCH), I was hoping to see a Best Picture nominee which I could endorse.  Alas, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is NOT it. How can one enthusiastically endorse a movie whose opening scene is so<br/><br/>fuzzy, whose dialogue track is so hollow, which has several key scenes which are so choppily edited, whose story is so convoluted, whose ending is so nihilistic and with those stupid ""flying"" sequences, in many of which the harnesses are clearly visible.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I can state without a doubt, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON contains the greatest fighting sequences AND one of the finest film performances I have yet witnessed.  That BOTH these can be attributed to one performer, Ziyi Zhang, is absolutely remarkable.<br/><br/>To explain almost any of the story would ruin the fun, so I won't. The film summary does that quite perfectly, thank you. Interestly women totally dominate this movie.  All of the fight sequences occur EITHER between a man and a woman, two women or one woman and several men.  In almost all instances, the woman wins.  When that woman is Ziyi Zhang, one can well believe she would.  NOBODY I've ever seen is faster.<br/><br/>By all means, see CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, particularly if you enjoy great martial arts.  Just don't expect too much.  This movie is WAY too overpraised."

","I saw the movie a few weeks ago and decided to see it for the second time at the theater. I don't remember when was the last time I did that for a movie. But waiting for the DVD release is just too long a wait. And it turned to be even better than the first time! There are so many exquisite details of the film can only be enjoyed without worrying about reading the subtitles. And the fight sequences are just as breathtaking as the first time. They always started out with a slow steady drum beat then doubled the speed and just getting faster and faster, then stopped at the climax on a loud accent beat! Like a piece of visual music, it's brilliant! The images of the two swordsmen in white soared into a sea of green bamboo forest at the end of the movie is an instant classic in movie history.<br/><br/>I've never expected everyone would have a unanimous feeling about this movie. Like any other movies, there will be always people who love this movie and those who just don't get it. But it puzzles me to see the number of people showed such a hostility (and just plain nasty attitude) towards such an artistic achievement. I have no doubt that only time will prove it: 15 or 20 years from now, this movie will still be remembered, but NOT the rest of this year's Best Picture Nominees. That's the difference between a timeless classic and a short lived sensational."
"astrid-3","Null","0","0","16 March 2001"," A Fairy Tale Come To Life
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an exquisite film and I think most people would find something to like in it.  While one can find on these pages some criticism about the film's lack of character development and plot, I prefer to think of it as a fairy tale come to life, and who would require that a fairy tale have plot and character development?  Rather, fairy tales have messages that are universal:  unrequited love, the call of honor and duty, the desire to believe in something greater than oneself, etc.  These messages are not presented in a heavy-handed way, but are lightly delivered. In fact, this film brings to mind a wonderful British film of recent years, ""Fairy Tale: A True Story.""  Likewise, watching the magnificent depictions of people flying in Crouching Tiger even conjures up images of Peter Pan, though it is done far better here than we ever could have hoped for in the days of Peter Pan.  <br/><br/>I am not a martial arts afficionado, and I tend to regard most films that are centered on martial arts as comedies - intended or not.  However, the swordsmanship in Crouching Tiger is nothing less than brilliant. Even if it is mostly accomplished by special effects and film editing, the result is stunning. In this film people DO fly across roof tops and up walls, and one lone swordsman DOES defeat dozens of the enemy; but it's never camp or hokey. In the context of this fairy tale it's REAL.  Don't expect to have a life-changing experience by watching Crouching Tiger.  Do expect, though, to see a really excellent movie with superb actors, stunning scenery and costuming, brilliant action sequences - and the wonderful music that accompanies them - and the universal themes that we can all relate to."

","This was one of those rare sleeper hits that never reached its potential here in the United States. It was released piecemeal to the nation and could've hit #1 on the Top Ten Blockbusters.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it was in Taiwan. It had just premiered there and I was really excited to see it on the second day it opened. However, I could not understand all of the Chinese. So, I just had to see it again here in the States (twice, actually). The language used within the movie is of a more aristocratic nature but still comprehensible to the general Chinese populace of today. With the subtitles here in the States, I sort of felt like I was cheating when I watched the movie .. ;).<br/><br/>Although the movie did not sell well in the Asian sector, the kung fu scenes were choreographed a la ""MATRIX"" style. This type of fighting is still quite fresh to American eyes, and boy did the audience eat it up. Impossible stunts pulled by the seemingly avian actors wowed its audience as the story took you from cosmopolitan settings in Beijing to the barren deserts of Western China and finally in the evergreen forests of some western Chinese Province.<br/><br/>There is way too much to describe about the artistic values contained in this movie. The only way I can concisely summarize this movie is that it resembles the fluid simplicity of Chinese poetry (Ci Fu). You will not be disappointed by this work by Ang Lee!"

","Ang Lee outdoes himself with this movie -- he manages to combine legend and myth, with an epic grandeur, compelling love stories, ample humor and wit and some of the best action sequences ever committed to film.  Lee's confidence as a film maker is apparent, as the movie builds slowly to its first daring action sequence -- yet as dazzling as it is, you ain't seen nothing yet.  The tale takes place in vastly different setting, all beautifully photographed.  The story isn't exactly complex, but it is has different moods and tones -- best exemplified by a lengthy, charming, flashback sequence.  The acting is superb -- Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat have that essential commanding screen presence (their really living archetypes) that immediately gives their characters weight.  Zhang Ziyi more than holds her own with these legends.  Awesome is an understatement.<br/><br/>Mike Bennett"

","i must admit, i was very interested in seeing this movie when it started getting press here in the united states. i was expecting a good foreign film with great scenery, fine acting and some top-notch fight scenes. well, here's what i got. i got a movie that did most certainly have great scenery. that's really about it. it was a ridiculously simple film. the acting was without any depth or emotion. we know basically nothing about any of the characters except for jen, and therefore in the end they mean nothing to the viewer. and for the fight scenes, only the fight between jen and shu lien is remotely believable. i know this is supposed to be a ""fantasy"" film, but when it is set in a certain time period when the laws of physics are the same as now, people can't fly and hover in trees. these characters are human, not gods. and i know that there is a whole other discussion about secret warriors (wuxia-i think) that supposedly could ""fly"". nope. sorry. it was just laugh out loud over-the-top bad. if this movie wins more than 1 academy award we will once again prove that the academy has no right to decide what is good or bad in the realm of film."

","I'm sorry but this movie is way too over-hyped. Don't get me wrong, it's good but not as great as advertized. The characters are shallow and sadly underdeveloped, the acting was very weak (especially Chow Yun-Fat who was inexplicably terrible in this film) and, yes, only one fight scene (the secon fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang ZiYi towards the end of the film) was any good. The plot is nowhere near being original and the characters have no real motivation. Even worse, the best performance in the film (Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox) was sadly all too short. I could not care about Li Mu Bai's fate since I felt nothing for him. As much as I wanted to feel something for Jade Fox (again, the best performance in the whole film) but she was underdeveloped. Cheng Pei-pei impressed me so much as an actress that, while watching the film, I was hoping for a five to ten minute monologue with her detailing her past with Li Mu Bai's teacher. Then I could decide wether I felt her character was wronged, misguided, or just plain evil. Jen was simply annoying and I was hoping for her death all throughout the film. I love Michelle Yeoh as an actress and, despite a solid performance, I felt she was not at her best. Both romances were quite boring and I only had marginal interest in the romance relating to Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien because I felt a degree of simpathy for Shu Lien (due greatly to Michelle Yeoh's performance). I'm a HUGE Chow Yun-Fat fan which is why I was horrified at his ""I'm only here to sell this movie"" cardboard cut-out performance. Had this been the first film I had ever seen him in, I'd never give anything he ever starred in even a glance.<br/><br/>The fights were pathetic save for that second fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. Nuff said.<br/><br/>As for the score, I only noticed there was music in this film during the awful desert flashback scene. To be honest, I wish I hadn't noticed the uninspired music at all.<br/><br/>The cinematography was nothing to write home about. The scenery and settings were gorgeous but the cinematography itself was quite ameteurish. The sets were gorgeous and inmense and the supporting characters were fun and well acted.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it may sound like I hate this film. In all honesty, I don't. It was filled with good intentions but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. The film was way too hyped when it is nothing more than an average weekend rental.<br/><br/>It's by no means terrible but by no means the greatest movie of this or any year.<br/><br/>Well, those are my two cents."

The superb performances of the actors manages to cross launguage barriers and give us very believable and sympathetic characters. It's really hard to hate any of them, even the villainous Jade Fox.

I just hope those people didn't think this was some kind of spoof on the Hong Kong martial art films. <br/><br/>Crouching Tiger was a film that many lovers of Martial art films have been thinking about. However, until now, there has not really been a director capable enough, with sensitive enough control of acting and story, to truly capture the myth and magic of martial art. But Ang Lee is a director who understands both the western and eastern culture, and he knew exactly how to allow the westerners appreciate what he must have loved as a child.<br/><br/>But I just wish it had been a more general release so I could have watched in a quite empty cinema, on my on, on a Tuesday afternoon, instead of in a packed cinema on a Friday night with people who thought it was 'kickass martial art film'.

The film takes many of the classic martial arts cliches (stolen swords, forbidden knowledge etc.) and crafts a truly beautiful film out of them. Much has been made, of course, of the action scenes and indeed they are breathtakingly exciting. It is a shame however that some people will think The Matrix was an influence on this film as they share action choreographers. It should be pointed out that Yuen Woo Ping has been making martial arts films for years and anybody who has seen Drunken Master 2 or Fist of Legend will know the quality of his fight scene choreography pre dates The Matrix. The performances really shine in this film.

It's good, sometimes very, very good, the fightscenes are fenomenal and the photography is stunning, but it's not a fantastic movie. Maybe if you haven't seen to many movies, or to many movies of this kind, then you could think it's the best movie in the world. I have seen to many films in my life to be shrugged at when i cast my opinion about this movie, but that is what happens. If you say you think this movie was just okay, then the fans look at you in a strange way and you can almost see in they're eyes this guy must have bad taste in movies or he doesn't know what he talks about. Well, Ang Lee's martial arts- western lack a story to begin with, it's a saga, nothing more and to implicate anything philosophical into the movie is quite silly.Between the killer fightscenes it's almost boring, very beautiful, very well acted, but you kind of wait for the next fightscene to come along. After a while, as in any movie,you begin to feel tiresome with the flying combats and when they fly down the waterfall it's Superman- the movie. If they can fly, why do the fight at all? And as i friend of mine pointed out, why is it suddenly so okay with women fighting, why are all going, oohh it's so feminist, it's so awesome, so cool and so forth. But they're fighting nonetheless and it's that a good thing? I know i'm out of line here a bit because it's a fairytale, but a lot of things bothered me.<br/><br/>Like the roller coaster ride of different genres within the movie. it's a adventure movie, a action movie, a period piece, a romance, a western and a martial arts movie all wrapped up in one, and that brings the movie down. It's to much up and down, it can't decide what kind of movie it will be. So there you have it. I know there a more of me thinking this way about this movie out there, but will you dare to come out and say your opinion? I dare you, because i won't have this movie to be, like, the number one on this site. It mustn't be."

","Watched the movie. First reaction I had (and practically ALL the theater goers in the cinema) was that the fighting scenes were WAYYYYYY too exaggerated. Flying and swooping on the roofs, gliding across a lake the size of a football field ... geez.<br/><br/>But the swordplay was good though. I thought the story line was straight forward but at times pretty slow moving.<br/><br/>Also, the dialogue was in Mandarin as spoken by the actors themselves. To a Chinese, I thought Chow and Michelle had pretty shaky diction. hee :)<br/><br/>Overall, it's a curious peek into the hype that surrounds it, but not something I would watch again."

","This gorgeous tale emits from a genre called 'Wuxia', which basically means that it is going to take a brain wrap for the common public to totally accept. Wuxia's basic premise is that the story takes place in medieval China, and is filled with fantasy, warriors, magic and mystery. Kind of like a huge Chinese Role Playing Game.<br/><br/>The most outstanding feature in the film is the cinematography. It contains the most gorgeous shots that I have seen since Titanic. The Wired Fighting Scenes are brilliant as well, not what most Westerners are used to. We got a good taste of it in the Matrix, a pungent aftertaste in Charlie's Angels, yet now it returns in full flavour to this wonderfully choreographed piece.<br/><br/>In essence, it is an encapsulating love story. It is not as linear as most commercial films these days, yet I feel that viewers will be too busy being swept away by the sheer beauty of the film, and the spectacular fight scenes, to get too caught up in ""who did whats and whys"". HIGHLY recommended. See the original (sub-titled) piece."

","I'll admit, after seeing this movie, I wasn't impressed at first. And there are still some things I didn't care too much for (like the desert scene which, for me, took away from the movie). But the more I thought about it, the more I see it as a magical fairy tale. You have to go into this movie with the frame of mind of letting the movie create the world for you. My mistake, at first, was not letting it envelop me. But once I allowed myself into the movie, I really enjoyed it. In doing that, this movie can be summed up in one word -- magical."

","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This is certainly one of the most amazing movies ever made. As a movie, it bridges the gap between an epic and a full-fledged action movie. This movie contains some of the most dazzling scenes and breathtakingly beautiful images that I've ever seen. The gorgeous Ziyi Zhang (or is it Zhang Ziyi?), as the character named Jen, graces this movie with her striking presence. The cinematography, the editing, and the choreography are all phenomenal. Furthermore, this movie has a visually stunning and haunting ending. It astonishes me that anyone would have anything negative to say about this movie. The people who downgrade this movie must be people who actually think that ""Gladiator"" was a good movie. ""The Fall Of The Roman Empire"", the 1964 movie that ""Gladiator"" was nearly a remake of, was definitely more deserving of any accolades...yet it was ignored by all of the award-giving organizations back in the day. Anyway, you can't compare a masterpiece like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to a disaster like ""Gladiator"". ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a remarkable movie experience. **** out of ****."

The action scenes are breathtaking and even though I don't understand a word of the things they speak I feel involved and I can feel their emotions as they talk.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the great aspects, the visual effects simply blow you away (Except maybe for some flying scenes) and I regret the movie wasn't like 14 hours!

"smars","7","0","0","7 March 2001"," Beauty and sometimes spectacular but without plot
","The mostly favorable reviews I got for this film (not only written ones but also comments from friends) convinced me to go to the cinema to check it myself. I must admit that I was unable to find some of the supposed merits of ""Crouching.."". The plot is ridiculous (if there is plot at all), the characters are flat and many of the acting sequences are too obviously a fake (I don´t say that just for the ""flying"" but if you do something do it right). I´m not saying that this is an awful film. In fact it is maybe one of the best films in the last months as far as I can judge. But, being serious, it is highly overrated.<br/><br/>Where do I find the real strong points of this film? Well, I was really shocked by some scenes. The mix of a perfect photography, magic sets and really beauty shots create a handful of great moments (I remember specially a close-up to Jen and Lo with a waterfall as background and the arriving at Beijing). Of course there are some fight scenes that are spectacular (after all the film is nothing more than a discontinuous fight scene). Finally, the music is quite interesting when no consisting exclusively in drum beats. In these aspects ""Crouching.."" has many things to teach to action-filmmakers.<br/><br/>And now the comparisons. I would never believe that I was going to say that ""Matrix"" had a prodigy of plot but after ""Crouching.."" I must reelaborate the standards for kung-fu flicks. We must praise the effort for trying to tell a story to link the fights (breaking the model of ""Bloodsport"") but sadly it has been only a try (the dialogs are hilarious in their pretended deepness and all the characters have only one idea in mind and don´t change it for almost any reason). Maybe the problem rely on the fact that the screenplay adapts one of the books of a series of five (I´m not sure of that point but, in any case, is one of the novels in the middle). It is like a bridge in the middle of a river with no beginning nor end. I can accept the lack of one of the extremes but both of them is too much for me.<br/><br/>On overall, and considering the rest of films of the year, I will give it a 7 out of 10."

The actors have pulled off intricately choreographed fight scenes and built dynamic relationships, both in romance and friendship.

","I only went to see this movie because it's said to be so good by www.imdb.com, one of the top-ten movies ever. So my expectations were very high. During the movie I didn't know very well what to think of it. The story has ups and downs, some very exciting moments, but unfortunately also a few moments almost boring. There were no real surprises in the movie, not even the flying (I knew it from the trailer and I understand it and find it cool) or the Chinese language, it's a very beautiful language.<br/><br/>Overall the film got me a very beautiful feeling, the fight scenes are amazing, the acting is perfect, the landscapes stunning, the dialogues intelligent (if you know something about eastern philosophy). There is really nothing in the movie that's somehow done bad. But there's one thing in the movie that disturbed me all the time: I always saw parallels to Star Wars. A few examples:<br/><br/><ul><li>old school heroes (Wudan - Jedi) - a young talented pupil (Jen - Luke Skiwalker) - the swords! - supernatural abilities (flying - Jedi forces or ""the Force"") - the master / pupil conflict - good and bad side of the force - training school far away (Wudan school - Yoda) etc.</li></ul><br/><br/>Look, I don't want to make this movie bad, but I think I've seen Star Wars too many times, for me CTHD is Star Wars in a good ol'china style. And for me Star Wars is the greatest movie ever made, one not to mess with. The story gets predictable if you know Star Wars, and that takes the tension out of it. As I said, I've had a very good feeling after seeing this movie, and for me that's the most important thing, and this movie's got one big bonus: It's not from Hollywood! It's almost unbelievable that Ang Lee has been able to make this film in China, it must have been quite expensive.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if you can say this is one of the top-ten movies ever, but it's very good and worth to watch for everyone. 9/10"

","Let's all be honest here, not so many people are into foreign films.<br/><br/>They have their own little niche, their own little fans and pretty much<br/><br/>their own little market. In most smaller areas (not cities), you're<br/><br/>lucky if you have two art house theaters (I only have one). It's sort of<br/><br/>like independent films, films from other countries are very unique and<br/><br/>are usually in their native language with subtitles. The only really<br/><br/>mainstream foreign film ever was the good but overrated ""Life Is<br/><br/>Beautiful"", which garnered many, many awards and spread to a few hundred<br/><br/>theaters and became the top grossing foreign film in the U.S., grossing<br/><br/>around sixty million dollars.<br/><br/>So here comes ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Released in China last<br/><br/>July to much critical acclaim, Sony Pictures Classics snapped up the<br/><br/>rights to bring it to the U.S., where the film has been playing for the<br/><br/>past few months in various film festivals, gaining a lot of buzz. Sony<br/><br/>has even released two trailers. One for the casual moviegoer with the<br/><br/>action it features, the other for art house audiences with more of the<br/><br/>story side and critical acclaim. Sony is also releasing it in a few<br/><br/>theaters for a consecutive weeks, so by mid February, it'll be all over<br/><br/>the United States. After hearing about the movie it did sound like it<br/><br/>could be like a mainstream film, and that Sony may be having a surprise<br/><br/>smash hit on their hands, but after seeing the film itself, this film is<br/><br/>defiantly not mainstream for a sole reason: it is too arty.<br/><br/>Mu Bai (the excellent Chow Yun-Fat) has an reputation for being a deadly<br/><br/>and soulful warrior, yet has a lot of wisdom and heart. The film opens<br/><br/>with him arriving at the headquarters of Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), that<br/><br/>being one of his oldest and most loyal friends. Mu Bai is settling down<br/><br/>to retire, so he is giving away his infamous sword, the Green Destiny,<br/><br/>(which is 400 years old and looks really light and somewhat weak, yet it<br/><br/>is incredibly powerful and heavy) to Sir Te, a man who has supported and<br/><br/>encouraged him throughout his life. However, after the sword is at the<br/><br/>home of Sir Te, it is stolen by a mysterious masked stranger known as<br/><br/>the Jade Fox. Lien assumes that Te's beautiful daughter, Jen (Zhang<br/><br/>Ziyi) stole it, but we learn that Jen isn't like any other girl, as she<br/><br/>is controlled by the Jade Fox herself and is a deadly warrior. Jen is<br/><br/>also downright nasty, who wants to be free of the male dominated<br/><br/>society. <br/><br/>I really don't know what more I can add to what already has been said,<br/><br/>but I'll do my best. This film has gotten raves all over, and pretty<br/><br/>much it's all been covered. But here it is anyway. I guess I'll start<br/><br/>what has gotten the movie a lot of buzz: the action sequences. The<br/><br/>action sequences don't outrank the plot or story (thankfully), but I<br/><br/>wish there were more of them. Still, what is presented is a real treat.<br/><br/>There are about seven or eight of them throughout the film, and they are<br/><br/>really like nothing you've ever seen before. These stunts and fights are<br/><br/>really, really intense. Many people are going to draw comparisons to<br/><br/>""The Matrix"" with them. For one thing, they were choreographed by<br/><br/>Yuen-Wo Ping, the same guy who was responsible for the sequences in<br/><br/>""The Matrix"". Anyhow, these parts defy the laws of gravity and balance.<br/><br/>Characters fly and duke it out with swords and their punches and kicks.<br/><br/>I'm glad these don't last a minute or two, and with the exception with<br/><br/>the final battle with Jade Fox and the Green Destiny (which was<br/><br/>disappointing in length but still cool), these last a good amount of<br/><br/>time and will cause your jaw to drop. Characters jump so gracefully and<br/><br/>run sideways on walls, it's all really well done and such a joy to<br/><br/>watch. This is what I think is the mainstream part of the film, and if<br/><br/>you're going in for these stunts, you'll be amazed, but ultimately<br/><br/>disappointed at the lack of them.<br/><br/>Next is what I think won't appeal to the mainstream audiences: the<br/><br/>story. The story is excellent, but what I really like about is how deep<br/><br/>it is. Based on an early 20th century novel about the Wuxia, a group of<br/><br/>loyal Chinese warriors, the film was written by James Schamus, Hui-Ling<br/><br/>Wang and Kuo Jung Sai. For you Ang Lee fans, you know Schamus has been<br/><br/>his right hand man, adapting the screenplay for ""The Ice Storm"" and<br/><br/>writing ""Ride With The Devil"". The script is really good, as the plot is<br/><br/>laced with some deep themes of love and the old days of China when it<br/><br/>was ruled by males. The characters are well developed, each with their<br/><br/>own strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own emotional core. Jen<br/><br/>yearns for freedom, Lien wants to express her love despite what's going<br/><br/>on and Bai is a man who is tired of fighting and simply wants to settle<br/><br/>down and live in solitude. What I didn't like about the script though is<br/><br/>how things shifted, it felt a bit uneven. There was not so much of a<br/><br/>focus on Jade Fox and the sword itself, but rather what Jen was going<br/><br/>through. This really gives the film depth, but it would have been great<br/><br/>if they made it more even. Yes, I realized things have to be<br/><br/>established, but I felt it was a bit much. <br/><br/>The production values of the film are first rate. I think Ang Lee is an<br/><br/>extraordinary director, bringing such films as ""Sense and Sensibility"",<br/><br/>""The Ice Storm"" and ""Ride With The Devil"" to life. Here he really shows<br/><br/>his stuff here, as he blends the action and themes into one. His vision<br/><br/>for this film is superb, and I think without him it wouldn't have been<br/><br/>so good. The sets and costumes are really unique, I actually thought I<br/><br/>was there back in Imperial China watching all of this unfold before my<br/><br/>eyes. You really feel like you're there, and it looks really nice, so<br/><br/>good art direction on that part. In part of feeling like you are there,<br/><br/>the performances are great. Chow Yun Fat (people will recognize him from<br/><br/>""Anna and the King"" and ""The Replacement Killers"", but he's a huge Asian<br/><br/>action star) and Michelle Yeoh (who was in the James Bond film ""Tomorrow<br/><br/>Never Dies"") has deeply affecting performances, bringing a lot of life<br/><br/>into their characters. The same thing for Zhang Ziyi and Cheng Pei Pei.<br/><br/>The musical score is really well timed and is sweet yet haunting,<br/><br/>perfectly fitting the film, it does bring a lot to it. The cello solos<br/><br/>are performed by Yo Yo Ma, which is really cool (I like Yo Yo Ma). One<br/><br/>aspect of the film which I really liked was the sound effects and sound<br/><br/>design, they are just booming to death. The fists flying, guns firing<br/><br/>kicks rising and swords clasing... they sound so good and are edited so<br/><br/>well, it's like music to your ears. It makes it all the more alive, so<br/><br/>my kudos to the sound designers. Finally, the editing and<br/><br/>cinematography. Each is can be summed up in one word: flawless. The<br/><br/>movie is so well filmed with great camera movements and angles. There<br/><br/>are so many lovely shots, just like the action sequences, they will<br/><br/>amaze you. The editing is great too. As I said, I felt like I was there<br/><br/>watching all of this, thanks to the cuts the film has. It's all done<br/><br/>appropriately and with much thought. The editing is superb in the action<br/><br/>sequences. It's not shaky or quick or anything, like some movies where<br/><br/>you get so confused and can't tell what's going on. Here you have a real<br/><br/>easy time following the action, setting up good shots.<br/><br/>This film is nearly perfect, and not perfect as everyone is going on to<br/><br/>be. What brings it down is how the story arc is presented (see earlier<br/><br/>in the review), but it's still all good. What is going to be interesting<br/><br/>is how all of this does with mainstream audiences. As I said, the story<br/><br/>is deep, and I don't think so many casual moviegoers are going to really<br/><br/>understand be enthralled by it. Yes, they'll love the action, but<br/><br/>there's so much beauty to the story, which I feel they'll find boring.<br/><br/>Also, so many people mind subtitles. If it's not in English, it is a big<br/><br/>turn off (they re-released ""Life Is Beautiful"" into a lousy dub which<br/><br/>quickly bombed). But I am a big advocate of films being presented in<br/><br/>their original languages, so they can be presented they way they were<br/><br/>originally supposed too.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a revolutionary film, there is<br/><br/>simply nothing like it to ever grace the film before. While I felt some<br/><br/>parts were a bit slow and dragged on, and the story was not as even as<br/><br/>it could have been, this is one damn good film and is an instant<br/><br/>classic. Even if you hate subtitles, but love a great plot with<br/><br/>interwoven themes, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a film for you.<br/><br/>Be on the lookout for when it hits your area, Sony is putting it out<br/><br/>gradually so it catches steam. You will not see a finer film in the year<br/><br/>2000 (some of you will have to wait until 2001) than this, and is the<br/><br/>first time in a long time where I have really, really loved a film so<br/><br/>dearly as this. It's incredible. Sure to win the Best Foreign Film<br/><br/>Oscar, and possibly be nominated for Best Picture, but I doubt it will<br/><br/>win it. I hope the Academy doesn't over look the editing, music,<br/><br/>cinematography, performances and art direction."

","There have not been many times that I have walked out of a movie theater almost speechless, in a reverie, and almost in tears at just having seen a movie of such poetic flights of fancy as to leave me in awe of the creative process that has brought this cinematic magic to the screen.  This is what movies should be about, what they can be when they aspire to be the very, very best.  This movie is cinematic art brought to its highest form.  It is pleasure beyond description to experience a work as unusual, as different, as intelligent, as beautiful as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger,..."" goes back to a mystically distant past where warriors elevated swordsmanship and the martial arts to levels undreamt of by any in King Arthur's court.  To one who has long admired the swordsmanship and the downright gutsiness, brass and sheer bravado of Errol Flynn in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", I have to admit that I have now seen a movie that puts that classic to shame.  In a very real way, this movie, adapted from a pre-WWII Chinese novel, is the mirror Oriental image of our own Occidental Star Wars saga by George Lucas.  This movie also has its warriors (Jedi Knights) able to master the laws of gravity and magically make their swords (re: light sabers) overcome all odds after long periods of training at the distant Wudan Mountain sanctuary, similar to, but much more beautiful, than the resident planet of Yoda where the young Luke Skywalker received his training.<br/><br/>Master Warrior Li Mu Bai(Chow Yun Fat) wants to retire and confess his love for his fellow warrior Yu Shu Lien(Michelle Yeoh), but he must first convey his magical 400 year-old sword, ""The Green Destiny"", to a governor and long time friend.  Yu offers to convey the sword to this governor herself and Li gives his consent.  The very night that she arrives, however, it is stolen by the young Princess Jen Yu(Zhang Ziyi), the daughter of another governor currently visiting this home at the same time.  Princess Jen is a mysterious and rebellious young lady in torment over her impending marriage to another politician brokered by her father. It turns out that she had earlier been kidnapped by a gang of bandits in the desert, the leader of which, Bandit Lo, captured her heart.  The scenes of the Mongolian desert, as all others in this movie, are filmed in rapturous beauty.<br/><br/>Warrior Yu begins to suspect that Princess Jen is not the demure young lady that she pretends to be as her reflexes betray a training in the warrior arts of the Wudan.  Could there be a connection between this young lady and Jade Fox, the mysterious assassin of the Master Teacher of Wudan, whose murder his disciple, Warrior Li, is pledged to avenge? Once again there are parallels here between the Master Teacher(Yoda and/or Obi Wan Kenobi) and Jade Fox(Darth Vader), although the latter comparison is somewhat weak as the character of the Jade Fox is not nearly as well fleshed out nor is it as beautifully villainous as that of Darth Vader.<br/><br/>There are two love stories in this movie, one middle-aged and poignant with lost opportunity, and the other hot and passionate with all the fire of youth.  Both are beautifully filmed. Director Ang Lee deserves every kudo for bringing this masterpiece to the screen.  The musical scoring is lush as the passages of the Shanghai Symphony are interspersed with solos by master cellist Yo Yo Ma.  The filming and editing are first rate.  This is one of the best movies in years."
"great_sphinx_42","9","0","0","7 March 2001"," An Epic With Style & Class
","I was stunned to find that this movie was playing in a theater within walking distance of my house. This is not, of course, the sort of movie that generally gets wide release in America. It's easy to see after watching it, though, why this was an exception. The characters are well-developed, the actors who play them give good performances and the action sequences are interesting without being overly bloody. Jen is a girl after my own heart. She's too proud to know when she's lost and too headstrong to know when she's won, but she's *fierce* in a way that few young female characters are. The story of her determination to be free of the societal constraints of her position as an aristocrat, her tutoring by a shadowy warrior called Jade Fox and her love affair with an attractive thief named Lo is one of the two main stories. The other is about two old friends (Yun-Fat and Michelle) who are bound by honor to a dead comrade and therefore cannot love each other as they would like. The two stories are of course intertwined. The contrast between fiery Jen and Lo, willing to do practically anything to be together and the characters played by Yun-Fat and Michelle, who have only a bond to a friend long dead to keep them apart but allow it, is striking.

","I'm no expert on foreign films by any stretch; however, I didn't feel the movie was that great.  It is definitely a movie worth seeing as the small screen will certainly not do the cinematography justice.  The film itself is beautifully set, the fight scenes were amazing, but the characters themselves were a little flat and predictable.  I wanted to learn more about the principle characters, not just see how long they could defy gravity.<br/><br/>I didn't sense much of a story that hasn't been seen a dozen times in other movies.  Go into it with tempered expectations, and you will be pleasantly entertained."

","Not a bad story, the action at times was great, but something that bothered me (and please be patient while I try to explain this) was the inconsistency of the super human actions of the characters in the movie.  In the first action sequence, the two fighting characters are flitting over roof tops as if gravity is lower in this universe.  In the same sequence, one character is bounding between two walls to climb them, indicating she is super-humanly strong to do so.  If she is lighter than normal, why wouldn't she just do a standing jump to get where she wants to go?<br/><br/>If the sequences were played such that the characters were very strong and very acrobatic and were so powerful that they could jump very high, I think the action would have satisfied more hardcore martial arts fans and impressed the more plot oriented viewers.  In that light, the characters should not have simply floated between roof tops, but should have jumped high in the air in wide arcs.   The lighter-than-gravity concept best demonstrated by the bamboo sequence could not be played realistically, because it required sustained action by the characters that they could not pull off because, in fact, they are not lighter and were supported by wires. It limited their movements and distorted their actions, which would not have happened if, say, the movie were animated and the artists could actually make the characters move correctly in a light gravity environment.<br/><br/>Really weird and nit-picky I know, but that's how I see it."

The only thing that is memorable and amazing in this picture is the beautiful photograph, the perfect direction and the excellent music BUT in the rest, the movie slips.

","When was the last time you found a martial arts film beautiful and touching? Ang Lee wants to give you something that holds your interest because of its visuals. The story is tailored around the many fight sequences that it contains. The difference, as it turns out, is that these people are allowed to live and breathe and have depth. Lee is not afraid to stop and explore his characters in a way that action/adventure films never do (chicks and dudes alike will enjoy this one, but probably for different reasons).<br/><br/>The result is a completely unique cinematic experience. It didn't blow me away like it did for some. I haven't heard many people talk about how comedic this film really is. Lee can't help but borrow this trait from the Bruce Lee or even Jackie Chan school of filmmaking (the fight scenes were orchestrated by `Matrix' choreographer and long-time Jackie Chan collaborator Yuen Wo Ping). In this case, the humor is more obscure. For example, the climactic fight scene (which will go down in history as one of the best ever) between Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and her would-be apprentice Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) begs for laughter. They fight in the middle of an arsenal. Lien keeps grabbing larger, more imposing weapons to use against the magical, indestructible sword Jen has stolen. It lasts quite a long time and by the end, still you wish it would go on.  <br/><br/>Then there's the Peter Pan' aspect of the combat these warriors use. It didn't work for me much of the time. To Lee's credit, though, at least he's attempted to create something fresh. At times, you can almost see the cable it's so obvious. At other times though, the effect is so cool you can't believe what you're seeing.  I rule in favor of its incorporation, but wish they'd used it more sparingly. <br/><br/>`Tiger' deserves the acclaim it's received as much as any movie this year. What makes `Tiger' so appealing is that it's not trying to be an Oscar contender, nor any other kind of contender. It's like Crash Davis (you know, from `Bull Durham'). It just wants to Be. Same can be said of all the films nominated for a lot of hardware this year, `Traffic', `Gladiator', `Almost Famous' for example: they just ended up being really good. For one reason or another, they were weeded out of that vast pool of worthy films (well, not so vast this particular year). `Tiger' is certainly worthy. If it cleans up on March 25, I'll be happy for it.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) **** Directed by Ang Lee. Starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei.<br/><br/>I don't have reason to hide that I was worried about what I would think of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. I was never a fan of martial-arts movies. The story, the characters and the situations are laughable and, even recognizing that Bruce Lee was a great personality, I just don't care about his movies. It never occurred to me that I could watch a Jackie Chan flick some day, but I thought the fight sequences in THE MATRIX and CHARLIE'S ANGELS were very cool. I wasn't a big fan of Ang Lee's pictures either. THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN were fine, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was lovely, but THE ICE STORM was quite disappointing for me and I didn't watch RIDE WITH THE DEVIL because it didn't interest me to see a Civil War art-house starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. However, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON received some of the best reviews of the year worldwide, won 2 Golden Globes in January and is nominated to 10 Oscar, including best picture, best director and best film in a foreign language. That changed my view and I started to wait anxiously for it. I saw it yesterday and... Wow! Wow! Wow!<br/><br/>The story told in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON brings nothing new, but what makes the difference is the way it is told. Ang Lee returns to his roots and pays homage to the old Chinese ""Wuxia"" movies, with the story of two women who try to find their place in the 19th century China. Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is a brave woman and an excellent fighter, who never confessed her love to fellow friend Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). He has just come back from his long training and now he wants to rest for some reason. He asks Shu Lien to give his sword, ""Green Destiny"", to an old man as a gift. For that, she makes a long journey to his house, where she meets Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi), a young woman, daughter of an aristocrat, who is just about to marry a man she doesn't love. At night, a masked thief steals the sword and that act is what will make all the characters evaluate their strength and their inside feelings.If Ang Lee doesn't win the best director award, I'll be very very angry. First of all, he has made one of the most visually gorgeous and rich films of the last years and maybe of all times. He literally takes us to another world, where you have to leave logic at the door. During two hours, you become so involved in what's happening on the screen that you forget what time of the day it is. If I were him, I would never stop working with the same cinematographer, writer, composer, set decorator, costume designer, editor and cast. The cinematography is triumphant: the colors are rich but never exaggerated, the light and the dark are always on the right place. The music is just wonderful. I loved it! The sets are terrific and so are the costumes, and the editing helps to make the fight sequences even better than they are (we'll get to them in a minute). This is the kind of film made to fit perfectly the big screen. It's really beautiful, wonderful, marvelous, gorgeous! Probably the most well made film of the year. All that with a 15 million dollar budget!!!!!<br/><br/>It's not every film, especially a martial-arts one, that has such a complex character development. We can identify with all their dramas and choices, especially Jen Yu, a young woman who wants to run away from conventions and stay with her beloved Lo, but first of all she has to choose what side she should stay: with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who will take her to a training, or with Jade Fox, a mean woman who has killed Li Mu Bai's master and is target of other people's revenge, but has been Jen's master, even if she doesn't know the real meaning of the manual, a thing that Jen is able to understand. In fact, she is her own master and also an amazingly determined person. The relationship between Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai is also very well portrayed and even the supporting characters, as a detective who seeks for revenge against Jade Fox, have their place. This story has wonderful messages about courage, determination, destiny, love and strength. `Crouching tiger, hidden dragon' is a Chinese proverb about hiding your forces, what all the characters do. The screenplay explores many situations and there's even place for some slight humor. By the way, there isn't an isolated genre the film is part of: adventure, romance, fantasy, drama, action, there's all.<br/><br/>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON didn't receive any Oscar nominations for acting, but it is top notch. The Mandarin language sounds like poetry when said by Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi. Believe me, it's never hard to follow- it's delightful. Michelle gives us a quiet, powerful performance as Shu Lien. Chow Yun-Fat proves once again that he is excellent, as Li Mu Bai. But Zhang Ziyi is the best- she is very pretty and acts with security and strength, just like a veteran.<br/><br/>Now we finally get to the already famous fight sequences that break the law of gravity. I confess that I found it to be very strange the first time I heard about, but in the film it is breath-taking. If there's someone in your session who laughs when the characters fight kung-fu in the air, just ignore this person because he/she doesn't know what is cinema. The same way there are films that portray life just like it is, as Robert Altman's masterpiece NASHVILLE, there are fantasy films where logic is left at the door. It's more than impressive, it's jaw-dropping when you see what they could do using only wires. The two women running on the roof, Jen and Li Mu Bai walking on the water and especially the same two fighting on the bamboo forest- the most beautiful and memorable scene of 2000. I absolutely adored them!<br/><br/>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON will stay as Ang Lee's masterpiece. I think I couldn't describe how wonderful it is, but if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, don't think twice: leave the logic at the door and see it on the big screen. Don't worry if it doesn't win many Oscar. GLADIATOR will win best picture, but CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is much better. It will recover many people's faith in the art of cinema. And prepare yourself for one of the most poetic endings you will have seen."

But the sort of martial arts fighting style is quite a common occurance in many domestically produced films and TV series in both mainland China and Taiwan.  Indeed, many domestic films and TV shows in China are based on historical events or myths, and most involve martial arts, only, they haven't been fully exposed to the West until this film.  Well, I guess you could say, the local film industry in China is a crouching tiger/hidden dragon.  Enough of the guns and high-tech.  Bring on the art of the fists and swords!"

","I wondered why I was hearing such great things about a ""martial arts"" movie. Now I know.<br/><br/>Tiger is, quite simply, one of the best pictures I've seen and absolutely the best of 2000.   Where do I start?<br/><br/>The action is, as you've certainly heard, excellent.  Lee has fairy tale action in which the characters literally fly through the air, balance on slender bamboo trees and walk on water.  The camera work makes sense of the action while not hiding the blurring speed at which it occurs.  These scenes where choreographed (and it is like ballet) by the same man who did the Matrix.<br/><br/>This action is surrounded by a story that is layered and compelling and leveaned with symbolism.  The plot unfolds novelistically.  The dialogue, even in translation, is music to the ears.  And speaking of music, the score is awesome.  The acting is up to the task.  Michelle Yeoh was snubbed by the Oscars but gives a standout performance.  In fact, all of the leads are strong.<br/><br/>But what really makes this film is Ang Lee's directing, which scales heights only reached by artists like David Lean.  The camera loves this movie, especially the gorgeous desert, mountain and forest backdrops.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and don't read any plot summaries.  One of the more pleasant parts for me was not knowing much about the film going in."

","I was captivated by this fantasy; it is beautiful and a little mysterious, as well as action-packed. In Taoist thought ""tiger"" stands for yin, the ""accepting [better word than 'passive']"" feminine side, ""dragon"" for yang,the ""active"" masculine side; but each principle contains elements of the other--it is never either-or, never just a simple opposition. And the story traces that ambiguity in Jen's coming of age, in her becoming a woman but not giving up her warrior side at all (whereas Shu Lien and Jade Fox, each in her own way, represent the pain in trying to be both a woman and a warrior). (Freudians will spot plenty, whether it was put there on purpose or not: sword, comb, flying, the ""sexless"" surrogate parents, etc.) Ang Lee returns to the themes of gender and sexuality that he explored in earlier movies, but here they are worked into a stunning action movie. All ages and tastes will find something to engage their imagination--you can enjoy it on many levels!"

","This movie is a grand, sweeping comic book of a movie and about as deep, though certainly well photographed for the most part.  It was a shame to see so many good actors with sriking faces wading through such a formulaic script, though the sets were lovely. I suspect the only reason so many people have been blown away by the movie is that it features women fighting each other with more than marginal competence.  The fight scenes are all too relentlessly high-speed to be savored, however, and the anti-gravity element gives the whole thing a puppet-theater quality which is jarring.  I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if the characters had worn masks; the surrealistic, fairy-tale element would have made more sense then."

The dialogue is easy to understand, and English subtitles remain on screen for a lengthy period of time, allowing the non-Chinese audiences to read the text. The script is magnificent, featuring many brief and memorable and poignant quotes. The background score is a delight to listen to, and enhances the emotion, suspense or awe of the film.<br/><br/>It is a brilliant epic, with incredibly fight sequences and dazzling special effects, and has a fantastic cast, and brilliant script.

","This is a good movie but something kept bothering me as I watched it. Then it struck me! I have seen this movie dozens of times before. It's a melodramatic Western (an eastern western?). I think the reason this movie is getting praised so wildly is because it is in Mandarin. Mainstream people are slapping themselves on their backs congratulating themselves they sat through a sub-titled movie and thus are now ""sophisticated"". I believe if this movie were made (not dubbed) in English it wouldn't achieve the acclaim it is receiving. The cinematography is outstanding - from the lush green mountains to the brittle desert. The acting is fine and the fight scenes amazing though tedious after a while. Add those elements with a predictable hackneyed script and characters and you have a good movie. I gave it a 6 out of 10. O Brother was a lot more fun and Not of This World was vastly superior. It's a good movie that I have nearly forgotten about - 3 days later.

Of these only learning the language is the truest way to experience the intent of the script. Second, subtitles...see above. Third is the special effects. I've got some advice for people that ""laugh"" at the flying scenes: stay at home. People seeing this move should just accept the idea that people can fly if trained right. If people can't get over this part of the story, they should just walk out rather than laugh out loud because they don't understand. On the film: it's a great story, great direction, great acting. The desert scene seemed a little long but it was necessary to the story and very enjoyable to watch. As far as the last star wars piece of junk being better than this: uh, whatever.

After years, that one or two lines about the brother or honor, or some avenging desire becomes good enough, and we call it a meaningful martial arts movie.<br/><br/>
This is the exception. For those not fans of the genera, rest assured that there is more to this film that the jumping, flying, and kicking.

"brunoccj-2","9","0","0","12 December 2000"," Some things you must understand before watching it!
","Some things you must understand before watching it!<br/><br/>WuXia stands for martial chivalry. (Wu is the Chinese character for martial, and Xia for chivalry or chivalrous fighter.) If I have a find an film analogy for Americans to fully appreciate this film , it's ""X-men"" I would compare to. When in chaotic times (especially when at war , or when the society is extremely unfair,) authors (common in every culture) write story like this to express their anger toward injustice. I don't use ""Batman"" as an analogy, because in ""X-men"", more political and emotional sides of human nature are discussed.  And that's why ""X-men, the movie"" got much higher rating on IMDB than that of ""Batman 3"" or ""Batman 4.""<br/><br/>If you can accept the ideology of this fantasy, you'll find a lot of implicit story lines that you can come home with and mull for a long time.<br/><br/>For those who don't fully comprehend the story because of the fast pace and huge amount of interconnected dialogue, Jen dies. Ang Lee didn't make such a big mistake to make this a ghost story.<br/><br/>Another idea that is to be clarified is, for WuXia novel readers, those fighters don't fly. (WHAT A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING!) Those trained fighter must bounce against something to make a high jump, just like Wolverine, not Storm nor Rogue. It's called the light-body KungFu. Modern athletes tie lead straps around the ankles , and when without straps, they jump higher. That is the basic idea of this kind of training. It's just WuXia fighter boosts this jumping power by inner power (like the Force in Star Wars, this idea is better known to yoga learner. And Chinese KungFu has its roots from India with Buddhism coming to China)<br/><br/>I do think the bamboo scene is overdone, a lot of WuXia novel readers think so, too. But the 1st fight scene is much more real. The close-body fight between Jen and ShuLien, I think that is something those of you have learned Tai-chi boxing understand. I suggest you guys rent Ang Lee's first famous debut ""Pushing hands"", this is about the relation of an immigrant Tai-chi master and his son and American daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law is a perfect example of one who fears what she doesn't understand. And Tai-chi boxing are strongly founded on physics.<br/><br/>The director's intention is to elevate action-packed traditional WuXia movies to the next level. And he did it. As for those of you who think the film doesn't live up to your expectations , maybe you should blame the Sony Classics' overdone promotional ads and campaigns. And which film promo doesn't overdo itself these days?<br/><br/>I don't know why this ""choreography"" term has been overly inflicted on this film. Martial art is martial art. This term connotes ""dance,"" but has nothing to do with martial art.<br/><br/>For those of you who think CTHD is not as good as ""The Matrix,"" CTHD is a rommance with action. Matrix is a sci-fi with action. They're not supposed to be the same. What they have in common are that they both hired YUEN HO-PING as martial art director to present the fight scenes. And They both deal with ""spiritual and skill elevation"" topic.<br/><br/>For those of you who think CTHD's story lines are too vague, some friends of mine don't get what Matrix is about after watching. (Maybe their faults!) And CTHD requires more brainstorming to fully appreciate its petite treasures scattered everywhere throughout the movie.<br/><br/>As a Taiwan viewer, I personally don't deem CTHD is my all-time favorite (which is actually Forest Gump.) But it's worth the admission. Maybe you should watch it again on DVD 6 months from now, but the unprecedented action scenes are something you can't fully enjoy at home -- unless you're rich enough to have a home theater.<br/><br/>And someone compares the ""I must avenge my master's death"" part to ""Star Wars' dark side of the force"" issue, cum' on, this is a sub-sub-sub plot of CTHD.  Star War is more adventure-oriented , and CTHD deals with subtle issues.  The emotional parts are for the heart, and the action scenes are for the eyes."

","This movie is one of the greatest fairy tales of all time. If there is one thing I did not like about the movie it was the sub-titles.  This is a very visual movie and us Americans miss a lot of it trying to read what is going on. It was like Star Wars in a reality far far away, different from our culture but spell-binding non the less. Great acting and great story telling.  A sci-fi movie down to earth.  I really liked this movie and would recommend you go see it with the idea that it is a fantasy for the soul.  I believe that in the end she jumps because she puts her life in God's hands. And that if God thinks she is worthy, she will get what she hopes for.  I might be wrong but that is what I get from the ending."

This overrated film about a missing sword and its struggle to get it back does not kick ass, contrary to popular belief.

"benz0325","9","0","0","3 March 2001"," A lesson in culture...
","I am still pleasantly suprised at the huge positive reaction to a movie initiallly intended solely for Asian audiences.  Perhaps the world is a little smaller now.  Great movies such as CTHD will always have its critics, but it's interesting to note that almost all the criticism have been aimed at aspects of the movie that relate to the native culture in the movie. The Shakespearean tragedy here is while for most people, the world is smaller, for other's it's an abyss of ignorance and ethnocentrism that is so prevalent here in the US.  This is ironic in the sense that most middle-Americans, including, I hate to say, some multi-generational Asian-Americans, have no sense of their ethnicity, and it seems you can't describe middle-American culture without using the world ""trailer,"" and that would be stretching the definition of ""culture.""  Ang Lee doesn't need to justify or explain anything he did in CTHD. Any reasonably intelligent individual would not need a primer prior to watching this movie.  This was his vision and his movie.  He made it for native Chinese audiences as his attempt to touch on his native roots.  The fact that CTHD have been embraced by people outside of Asia, and the fact that this movie has 10 Oscar nominations is justification enough for his making of CTHD.  The fact that his $12 million movie subtitled its way to $120 million plus worldwide is justification enough for the existence of CTHD. CTHD is a wonderful lesson in culture.  Go in with an open mind, it might be the best eight bucks you ever spent."

","Crouching Tiger.. was the movie I wanted to see for quite a long time. It just recently opened in the Netherlands, and people at work, friends all started to talk about the film...I came to the movie theater already being prepared for a spectacular show. First part of the film can be a bit boring for some people, but those who are familiar with East-Asian theater traditions, they know that the action will not make you waiting for long time.. The plot seems to be too complicated at the beginning, but after half hour you suddenly realize that in this movie plot is not so important. Camera work, design, performances are great. At some point you realize that what is going on the screen is a real event in the cinema world. Some people are afraid of movies with subtitles. In Crouching tiger... I did not really notice them, so natural is the way the director tells us the story.. Martial scenes are beautifully shot. Some compare this movie with The Matrix. But Crouching tiger.. has so much more depth. The real culmination of the movie is already well-known fight on the tops of the trees. If you never had a feeling of flight, at this movie you will feel it. Ang Lee is a magician. The way he tells us the story of his characters has an effect of a magic spell: everyone who leaves the theater want to see the movie again. The film is so multi-leveled so you can hardly understand it at once. Return to this movie like to a good wine which needs time to be matured. I am sure we are present at the birth of the new movie-classics. In couple words: Don't waste your time and just go find this movie in your theater."

"kasima","10","0","0","28 February 2001"," maladaptive personality
","CTHD is a foreign movie from Taiwan with projected audience not just limited to those of the US.  That has been said, I would like to respond to many harsh comments on this epic movie.  First off, precisely because this is a foreign movie concerning a particular strata of subculture in historical China, we, as Americans, should adapt ourselves to the contents of the movie, not the other way around.  It's our ignorance that we don't understand how people defy gravity in the movie, but not the responsibility of the director to fully explain an established subculture (namely, WuXia movies and novels)in the alloted movie time----it would be redundant and totally unnecessary to those who are familiar with these basic elements that sustain the subculture, and incidentally the very audience Ang Lee had in mind.   Now if you have an open mind, even you had no previous knowledge on this flying thing (by using the word flying clearly shows our limited knowledge on this subculture, for anyone who is familiar with the genre knows it's just a established, fantacized Martial art called Qing Kung, or the martial art of lightness), you would regard this as more or less an expression of the mythic nature of the movie, and enjoy what's being presented.  I suppose the people who criticized about the flying probably don't like abstract art either---it's boring, it doesn't reflect reality, or giggle at the seemingly randomized mixture of primary colors and be puzzled by the fact that how this artwork is adored by so many avantgarde art lovers.  That basically leads to my conclusion, a person suffered from maladaptive personality disorder fails to adjust to its surroundings.  The person lives in a rigidly formed reality, and when presented with new facts or situation, maladaptive defensive responses ensued including sweating, palpitation, dizziness, and possiblity fainting, on the other extreme, the disgruntled person will vehemently deny the surroundings, eagerly return to his/her comfort zone, and frequently accompanied with irrational emotions including hatred and extreme fear.  It is okay that you don't know what Wudan or Qing Kong is about, an adaptive person would simply accept these facts or go back home and ask somebody more knowledgeable on East Asian Culture or do some quick research....a maladaptive person after experiencing the aforementioned physiological responses, comes to IMDB and writes a review to present with us his/her ignorance and the associated pathological manifestations.  In the end, this is only a 2 hr movie, and do you really expect Ang Lee to explain everything that is taken for granted by the Asian audience just for us Americans?  Well, after all, Ang Lee is going to make a Prequel and perhaps we would have a better idea about the mythical Qing Kung, WuDan, and the Green Destiny.  After all it is going to take Lucas 6 episodes to tell the star war saga, right?"

","Very briefly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a break through for foreign language film in the western market.  With the critical acclaim it has received and richly deserves, this Ang Lee masterpiece will blaze a path for other foreign language films to make their mark to a much larger audience and subsequently give an otherwise American dominated medium a good run for its money.  Chow Yun Fat will undoubtedly become an Asian movie icon for this role, in case he wasn't already.<br/><br/>The film itself presents an epic tale of good verses evil, of a legendary warrior and an equally menacing villain, a tale of youthful romance, and of a romance not quite fulfilled.  Trying to move away from his warrior escapades, Chow Yun Fat retires his majestic sword, which soon after goes missing, bringing our intrepid hero and his long suffering ally into a grand battle with an old adversary.  Throw in a misguided young warrior who appears torn between two masters of battle, and some breath taking scenery as a backdrop, you have a movie experience quite unlike the recent offering served up by Hollywood.  With fight sequences reminiscent of something from a video arcade game, the acting, the editing, the directing... everything about this film is brilliant.

","This movie was great!!! Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let me tell you why. Like the last critic, I'm also only 16. I was very happy that a subtitled movie made it to the U.S., and not just the big city theaters, but all of them! Even in small-town Louisiana! I hope we see more movies from foreign countries in our theaters. I am pretty used to subtitles, seeing as how I'm a Telegu Indian who doesn't understand Hindi (all the big movies in India are in Hindi). So I've become pretty experienced with subtitles. :) But in any case, the fighting sequences in this movie are very well done! They have a wonderful flowing quality and a grace which demands respect. I thought the movie was going to be set in ancient China, but it is set in a fantasy place where the fighters can fly. Incidentally, the tree scene was very creative. :) The scenery is beautiful and gives the perfect mood to the story. I loved Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien. She carried herself very well as a lady warrior and had an aura of honor and stature about her. Ziyi Zhang is also great as the confused upper-class girl. She really is a firecracker! And her true love, Lo, is wonderfully charming and swashbuckling. The desert scenes are romantic. I won't give away the end, which is very sad. I think the message in this movie is to ""Be true to yourself,"" as Shu Lien tells Jen. And don't wait too long to tell the one you love that you love them, because sometimes it's too late. Don't waste your life. Seize the day! Okay, I've babbled long enough. But I strongly suggest watching this movie. It was very artfully done. This movie soars and will take you with it!"

","My partner & I went to see this film yesterday at the Marquee Cinemas here in Charleston, West Virginia, and we were warned at the box office that it was in Chinese with subtitles, therefore no refunds. Well, DUH. One of the reasons I wanted to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was BECAUSE it had subtitles. As a matter of principal I probably WOULDN'T see it if it was dubbed into English, and if I were Ang Lee I would NOT include a dubbed version on the DVD package. If more Americans could get over their parochial attitudes toward foreign languages, we'd probably have more exquisite films like this in theaters.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an absolutely exhilarating film caught somewhere between the realms of reality and mythology, kind of like Wagner, sort of like ""Star Wars."" It is also a much different movie than Americans are accustomed to, and so much the better. Don't be put off by having to read the subtitles at the bottom of the frame; they are very easy to follow. I'm not a fan of Kung Fu movies, but I have to admit that the fight sequences were spectacular. As for the much-discussed suspension of certain gravitational laws in the film, please remember: It's a FABLE, and as such it's no worse than films about talking pigs. And the very ending of the film was truly sublime.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing that Greg & I found utterly laughable was the song ""A Love Before Time,"" sung during the closing credits by Asian pop star CoCo Lee. It's almost as though the producers felt they HAD to come up with some kind of CD single that they could mail out to top-40 radio stations to generate interest. It was completely unnecessary and utterly incongruous to the rest of the movie. For its part the score of this movie was wonderful, with pulse-quickening percussion work during the fight sequences and Yo-Yo Ma's sensitive cello solos during some of the more dramatic moments.<br/><br/>See ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in the theater if at all possible.

I loved the way the script handled so many characters and subplots without once losing control or interest.  The acting was uniformly good, but it is the beauty of the shots and the powerful wizardry of the martial arts scenes that really transcend the medium.  This film completely elevates you along with the magically endowed characters flights above the rooftops.  It is amazing how Lee manages to balance the supernatural elements with the period drama.  <br/><br/>I'm sure this film will not please everyone.  It belongs in the pantheon with such beautiful works as Metropolis, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even The Wizard of Oz.  It is pure FILM MAGIC!  It surpasses the genre of Kung Fu Flicks, practically rewriting the genre.  You have to be a true cinephile to enjoy work this beautiful, and this rich in film imagery.<br/><br/>The ending is truly beautiful, and perfectly closes the chapter on the many subplots involved in the film.  <br/><br/>Ang Lee is truly a film genius.  He is the descendant of Howard Hawks and William Wellmann, who managed to direct many different genres of film and succeed admirably well in all of them.

This film breaks new ground, not only with the one-of-a-kind special effects but with a storyline that is truly unique. Every scene is perfectly scripted and set in such a way that the camera angle is *perfect* -- sometimes almost too perfect. Although communicating through subtitles, CTHD nevertheless hits the mark. If you see one film this year -- one film ever -- see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". You will not be disappointed."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not meant to be judged with cinema classics such as The Godfather or Citizen Kane. It's a good and entertaining movie that has something to offer for most audience. The music, cinematography and fight scenes are among the best of its genre. And I'm not talking about kung-fu film in the tradition of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. I'm talking about movies like Chinese Ghost Story and Warriors of Magic Mountain, movies that should be classified under adventure/fantasy. If you go into theater and expect to see the best movie of the year, the odds is you are going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Like it or not, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has touched many people. Hey, a lot of folks honestly love Titanic. It has nothing to do with being in denial or unwilling to admit mistake.  Bitch all you want. Do you believe Chocolat which happened to occupy a spot among nominees of best picture  is a better movie?<br/><br/>If the number of nominations Crouching Tiger received puzzled you and made you disappoint in Academy Award, it's about time. Of last 15 years among my favorite movie of the year, only Schindler's List came away winning the best picture in Academy Award.<br/><br/>Drop your critical lenses and enjoy Crouching Tiger for what it is."

Personally, this film had it all for me. I've seen it twice and I'm sure I'll go again. The story, the photography, the action sequences, soundtrack - were, in my opinion, first rate.

","Crouching Tiger is a beautiful movie, no if's and but's about it. And yet it suffers from one disturbingly serious flaw.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie is Jen (Zhang Ziyi). But you won't know that from the trailers. In fact, I have the DVD here and Zhang is only fourth in its billing, which is outrageous. This is like giving Liam Neeson only fourth billing in Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Apparently, the movie's producers wanted to leverage the star power of Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh to the hilt. If that meant playing with the credits, then so be it. Unfortunately, they went further than that. Much further. The producers went so far as to alter the sequencing of the movie's events just to make Michelle and Chow the apparent stars.<br/><br/>Ideally, the movie should begin with the story of Jen's desert adventure, where we can establish her history with proper attention. Unfortunately, to do so would also establish her as the real star of the movie, which the producers felt may threaten its box office appeal. So the producers decide to open the story with Yeoh and Chow instead.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the end result is rather clumsy: the only way to segue back to that important desert scene is thru a painfully long flashback, which becomes distracting and eventually damaging to the epic flow of the movie. And all because the producers refuse to admit, to this day, that Zhang is the real star of the movie.<br/><br/>Politics aside, however, the movie is a beautifully rich production. The cinematography is astonishing, the setpieces are lavish and, in the end, it made me wish that I too could fly."

","Undoubtedly the martial scene in 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden dragon' is exquisite and excellent. While people are stunned by the gloriously choreographed kung-fu shot, unknowingly, the fine and smooth portrayal of characters is neglected, especially the strong feminism spirit appeared in almost every Lee's film. We can find the evidence easily from 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.<br/><br/>1. The background of story happened in the male-dominated wuxia group--WuuDang, whose kung-fu bequeath only transmitted to male student rather than female, no matter how brilliant the female student is. What Jade Fox opposed not only the male opponents, but the gender-discriminative martial group.<br/><br/>2. Against the parental authority in traditional Chinese society, Lee chose Jen, daughter of an official bureaucrat, to steal the sword. Audience thought her behavior was childish, but she didn't do this just for 'fun'; she was striving the freedom she longing for a long time. What Lee tries to show is the liberation of women.<br/><br/>3. To break the stereotype of emotional essence of women, Lee created a successful career woman, Shu-Lien, present in ancient martial society. Comparing to the reactionary and impulsive Li Mu-Bai, Shu-Lien was very liberal, sober and competent. She was also the model of Jen.<br/><br/>Reviewing from 'Tui Shou', 'Hsi Yen', 'Yin Shi Nan Nu', 'Sense and Sensibility', 'The Ice Storm', 'Ride with the Devil' to 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', gender is always the main issue that Lee wants to express. I would say that, those critiques mentioning that this is a shallow film must understand the implicit meaning Lee gave. Otherwise, they would get lost in the multifarious actions totally."

"uglykidmatt","Null","0","0","23 February 2001"," Good old-fashioned filmmaking
","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a martial arts film for people who don't like martial arts films.  Ang Lee's elegant, heartfelt film combines the high-flying acrobatics common in Hong Kong chopsocky epics with the kind of deep characterization and streamlined storytelling that most of those other films can't even muster around the edges.  It's a handsome, exciting, and surprisingly moving film that fully warrants the acclaim that has been visited upon it by the Oscars people.<br/><br/>Based on a novel which, to my understanding, has not yet been published in America, ""Crouching Tiger"" follows the adventures of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), mystical master warriors who have shared a friendship, and maybe more, for years.  Shu Lien is sent to the estate of the aristocratic Sir Te (Sihung Lung) to deliver a magical super-sword known as Green Destiny.  One night, the sword is stolen by a spectacularly powerful bandit, and the chase is on, bringing out old wounds, new loves, and buried secrets that have plagued the characters and driven them to the depths of despair and the heights of ecstasy.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger"" is a film intimately familiar with esctasy, primarily the esctatic freedom of movement.  The film's battle scenes, choreographed by ""The Matrix""'s Yuen Wo Ping, are marvels of gravity-defying elegance, almost like ballet in their free-flowing kinetic energy.  The characters flip off of walls, scramble over rooftops, and, in one of the most hauntingly lyrical action sequences in history, clash with swords while swinging from the branches of swayingly tall trees.  The film seems to transport us to a fantasy world where defying the laws of physics is as easy as breathing, and the mastery of the physical is the most noble and beautiful achievement of all.<br/><br/>Of course, we've seen stuff like this in other martial-arts films.  What carries ""Crouching Tiger"" above the realm of the familiar is the direction of Ang Lee.  A filmmaker who until now has specialized in character-based drama (""Eat Drink Man Woman"", ""Sense and Sensibility""), Lee brings all of his understanding of the subtleties of human interaction to bear on this picture, creating relationships built on barely perceptible arpeggios of emotion.  Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien need just a glance to convey their years of suppressed passion for one another, and it's heartbreaking to behold them give up their feelings for the good of the world.  He also skillfully orchestrates the work of his technical crew, drawing a haunting score from Tan Dun (complete with lyrical cello interludes by Yo-Yo Ma) and polished, beautiful cinematography from Peter Pau.<br/><br/>Lee's actors also contribute to the film's powerful effect by committing utterly to material that could have been pulp in the hands of less talented performers.  Chow holds the screen with his effortless charisma, and Yeoh's soulful eyes convey a lifetime of buried feeling in a single glance.  The real star here, however, is Zhang Ziyi, a former ballerina who plays Jen, a young dignitary's daughter with a few buried secrets of her own.  Zhang's soft voice conceals reserves of strength, and she is front and center for the film's most impressive action sequences, where her dance training carries the film to breathtaking new heights.  She, unlike everyone else in the film, was ROBBED by the academy; she deserved to be this year's Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>Stateside, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has become the highest-grossing foreign-language film of all time, thus proving that the usually subtitle-phobic American public will respond to a foreign film.  All it takes is true feeling, a compelling story, and powerful acting by a cast who takes great material and runs with it all the way.  Oh, and action scenes that KICK ASS."
"jha","10","0","0","23 February 2001"," A tall, cool drink of water in the midst of the Hollywood desert
","A question for James Cameron, Spielberg and such:  why does it cost you $100 million (and up) to make a movie?  Ang Lee, with a budget of $12 to $15 million, made a film that runs circles around other Hollywood offerings. I've been to see it in the theater 3 times already, and I will go a few more times before getting the DVD (thank GOD for EBAY!). I check here everyday to see what the comments are, and it seems to me that the only detractors are individuals who can offer nothing other than some illogical emotional prattle.  If you don't like Martial Arts flix, why bother reviewing this? Anyway, I saw a post a few days back that offered up the theory that Li Mu Bai (Chow-Yun Fat) was falling in love with Jen- and I found that intriguing, but I thought about it and this is my take:  Jen may indeed have been fighting feelings that were developing for Li, but I think she found this unacceptable due to Jade Fox's experience with the Wudan master.  Li on the other hand, may have saw the possibility of repeating his Master's transgressions, and did not want to- 1) because he loved Shu Lien. 2) because in Jen, he saw the potential for her to become a great master, and becoming involved with her would compromise her path to this end.  Also, he did not want any of the other monks at Wudan to do the same thing, so I think this was part of the impetus behind sending Lo (Chen Chang) to Wudan. If he wanted them to be together, they could have just escorted her to the desert.  Shu Lien's rivalry with Jen I think was based solely on the fact that Jen's immature actions placed Li Mu Bai in the position of having to re-enter the dangerous world from which he was trying to escape.  Of course, we see that in the end, her fears were realized. Each time I've seen the film, I've gotten more and more into the details- like during the Jen/Lo story, Lee uses shots of the desert as transition to show that time has passed (sands of time).  During the bamboo fight, we see Jen ""falling"" for Li- which establishes the scene where she bares herself and asks if he has come for the sword or her. Sir Te (Sihung Lung) is the antithesis to Jar-Jar Binks.  This is definitely Star Wars for grown folks....and to think, we didn't have to travel to ""a Galaxy, Far, Far Away...""<br/><br/>The ending was so satisfyingly complex!  First, Peter Pau gives us this incredible shot of Wudan mountain that establishes the majesty and power of this monastery.  Just viewing Wudan makes it easy to see why Li Mu Bai is such an accomplished swordsman.  Then, the last scene with Jen and Lo and the final image of Jen floating.  Now juxtapose this with the Deathstar exploding.  Is there any question as to why this is one of the greatest movies ever made?  Oh, by the way, the fight scenes are pretty good ;-).<br/><br/>
Part of me wants a sequel (how American of me, right?) where Lo trains at Wudan and goes to work for Shu Lien, who gives him the Green Destiny, but I'd simply be happy with seeing more movies like this.  To paraphrase Grace Jones, ""It's not perfect, but it's perfect, for me!"" A 10!"
"McGorman-2","8","0","0","12 December 2000"," Great kung fu, but still missing something
","I was expecting this to be unparalleled; what else can you expect when you combine Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, director Ang Lee, fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping, music by Ma Yo Yo... but what ended up happening, I think, is that the picture has trouble supporting its own weight.  There's too much going on in the film: a whole subplot that becomes (sort of) the main plot is introduced halfway into the movie in the form of a flashback, and the other main conflicts aren't adequately built up to and then resolved. There's multiple unrequited loves going on, a ""I must avenge my master's death"" plot, and a very Star Wars-esque ""dark side of the force"" issue.  In any case, the kung fu, the graceful wire-supported floating around, and the amazing setting are more than enough to make this a great film.  But it's not absolutely superb.  Perhaps my expectations were just too high.  To its credit, I've watched plenty of kung fu movies, and there were still times during the film when I was just blown away.  8/10"
"lim2lim","3","0","0","9 July 2000"," Not good.
","I can't understand all the hype about this movie.<br/><br/>It may be visually interesting with good cinematography, special effects and fight scenes but as an artistic and dramatic work it is extremely flawed.<br/><br/>The special effects are good but ultimately repetitive and over the top.<br/><br/>The acting was good but the speech was awful! I believe this film was shot in Mandarin and that's the version I saw (with English subtitles). It was obvious to the Mandarin speaking audience here in Singapore that none of the leading actors bar Zhang Zhiyi are comfortable with speaking Mandarin. Too many of the ""serious"" lines became hilarious. This wasn't at all helped by the awful scripting with some of the worse lines I've heard (and read) since Sliver.<br/><br/>There are unnecessary characters - e.g., the irrelevant undercover cop and his rather plain daughter - who don't add anything to the story. The obligatory comic element represented by the bungling security guard isn't developed - he's just a character that comes out of nowhere, bungles through the movie and and is forgotten at the end of the movie without adding any value to the part. Most criminally, he isn't even very funny.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have commented on the supposed artistic qualities of this film. Ang Lee certainly had the opportunity to make a this film commentary an exploration of the issue of personal freedom vs duty - but the ending is a total cop out which undermines anything if at all achieved in the film.<br/><br/>Apart from good performances from Chow Yuen Fatt, Michelle Yeo (bar her inability to speak Mandarin) and Zhang Zhi Yi, this show is absolutely forgettable."
"Alex 26","3","0","0","23 February 2001"," The Most Overrated Movie Of This Decade
","This is the best rated film by critics and IMDb in many years? It's on course to break Â£100 million box office in America? But, it's barely the best Chinese Kung Fu film to offer. Jet Li's ""Once Upon A Time In China"" has far superior combinations of real martial art and romance.<br/><br/>I would have been proud of the achievement of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" as a Chinese but I feel outraged by its hype and recognition in WESTERN WORLD. This film debuted poorly in Asia more than half year ago but with the right marketing strategy to sell it through film festivals and gradually into wide theatrical release, the hype built up and suddenly everyone in western countries rushed to see a Mandarin speaking film. Its 10 Oscar nominations seem more like a showcase that the Academy is willing to recognise foreign language films than the film's actual merits.<br/><br/>My first complaint of the film is its inconsistent pacing. At most times, the film lingers on with unnecessary subplots. The fighting scenes brighten up initially but lose the impact after several similar ones. The fight choreographer, Yuen Woo Ping, has done better work in Jet Li's Once Upon A Time In China and many other Kung Fu's movies.<br/><br/>The most glaring flaw of the film is the inclusion of the flashback of the two supporting characters' romance.It seems just cut into the film for dramatic and comic purpose but indeed very tedious to sit through.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the romance between the two leading characters lack chemistry. Come on who says Michelle Yeoh's acting is good? She barely can ""fake"" the proper Mandarin accent because she is Cantonese speaking. This makes her acting seem forced and as if she is reading scripts especially at the beginning. Chow Yun Fat, who is also Cantonese speaker, fares better but by not much. Ziyi Zhang is the only main character that speaks proper Mandarin and acts sufficiently.<br/><br/>As anyone who has read Wu Xia ( ancient Kung Fu ) story will point out, the flying in the air and floating on the tree scenes are absolute craps and such a turnoff. There is a theory of defying gravity in Wu Xia story whereby a warrior is said to be able to ""leap"", not fly , using inner body strength from a place to another. But Ang Lee argued with the great fight choreographer, Yuen Woo Ping, to surprise the audience with flying sequences. The result is that the flying sequences in the film were booed in China.<br/><br/>Many people claim the special effect in fight scenes are spectacular which are actually wire works but these have been used in Kung Fu films for decades!<br/><br/>The good thing about ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is its music score and cinematography. However, ""The Colour Of Paradise"" from Iran, which is not qualified for this year Oscar's Foreign Language Film, is an overall better film.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" Oscar's recognitions should have been given to the more profound and entertaining film, ""Cast Away"" and even the breakthrough film of the year, ""Requiem For A Dream""."

","First off, I like to say that as an Asian-American, I have seen this kind of movie from my dad who is into the Wuxia genre. However, this is not to say that this movie was not one of the best this year (2000). For those people who do not really understand certain elements of this film (i.e. ""the flying/floating"") understand that it is no different than from Western heroes flying (i.e. Superman, etc."") Take the movie for what it is, a fable and a fairy tale. Even Ang Lee said that it was a movie about ""a China that never existed except in my boyhood fantasies and stories."" Anyone who complains about the flying and floating is not be fair and informed. CTHD is one of the best movies this year purely based on the acting alone. I understand Cantonese and to some extent Mandarin. I watched the actors and actresses and I was amazed at the gestures and expressions all the characters had. Please, go watch it one more time for those who had seen it already and this time pay attention to this aspect of the film. The eyes! My God! What suppressed emotions are there! What does Gladiator have over this movie? Nothing! And I LOVED Gladiator! Anyway, I agree with some that the desert scene was a little too long but this does not detract from the movie and to an extent, was necessary. I have read many reviews from the movie going audience out there and I believe we all have a right to voice our opinions but please don't trash a movie because you had to read subtitles! My friend who is American went and saw the film with me enjoyed it just as much and he read the entire movie.

"shanessa4","Null","0","0","22 February 2001"," I was both amazed and disappointed.
","(Spoiler notice!!!!) I just came from watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I am a great fan of the modern Mandarin Chinese Cinema that really flourished in the 90's. I'm also a fan of some of the sillier Hong Kong kung-fu movies that are usually in Cantonese. Being familiar with both types of films, I know what to expect. I expected a lot, especially being a fan of Ang Lee. Halfway through, during the big fight between the two female heroines, I was already planning to see it again with my sister. But, I must say that on some levels I was disappointed with this movie. People tended to focus more on the martial arts aspect of it, so I was under the impression that it was going to be a well-done kung-fu movie. Not an over-the-top Chinese tragedy. Chinese tragedies are some of my favorite movies, like Raise the Red Lantern, but I have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch them. CTHD really ruined my day, to tell you the truth. It's a fantastic film, but in some ways I feel manipulated as I always do during certain tragedies. In tragedies where the characters aren't developed in a certain way, it does seem like certain things happen just to advance the plot in the way the filmmakers intend.  I'm just not buying the suicide at the end. In fact, Jen wasn't really a heroine if you think about it. She was the villain until halfway through the movie. As I was driving home, I wondered why did she jump and why do we care? She was an impetuous jerk the entire movie, so why was I rooting for her? In some ways she had gotten everything she wanted, and I don't believe that she jumped because of guilt (over Li Mu Bai) or grief over Jade Fox. When Shu Lien told her to be true to herself is what I am guessing. She realized that she has no place in this world. It reminds me of ""Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl."", a film which I also found troubling.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars. He admits that parts of the plot are ""plain silly"" and focuses on its martial arts aspects. But this isn't a martial arts film--it has fighting in it, but during most of the screentime it's a drama. And as a drama, I don't think it has the stuff Oscar-worthy films are made of.  I guess it some ways you have to see it for what it is. Kung Fu legends are like opera: epic, grandiose tales not necessarily meant to be literal or realistic. As a viewer, it was difficult to know which I was watching:is this serious, or is it not? Many if not most Chinese dramatic films feature suicides, and repressed love but few of them have plots this contrived. It is a watered down version of common threads in other films of these genres. So many people loved this film, and it is perhaps received the most exposure in America of any Chinese language film. This is both good and bad in my opinion.

","Since there are numerous plots given here I will not waste space reiterating what has already been said.  I went to see this with a friend who knew I was studying Chinese (Mandarin/Hanyu).  I had wanted to see it.  I don't normally like martial arts movies, but it has something for both the die-hard macho man and for his sentimental counterpart.  But the thing that struck me the most (beside understanding bits and pieces of the dialogues and characters and picking out the Cantonese pronunciations that slipped in) was the beauty of the whole thing.  The landscapes, the costumes, the people, and, most importantly, the choreography of the fight scenes.  They were truly awe-inspiring.  The scene in the bamboo trees especially.  I am glad that I went to see this movie.  It's the first one in a movie theatre that I walked away from without being disappointed.  I was delighted and may even see it again just to watch the fight scenes."
"POG-2","10","0","0","25 February 2001"," Excellent in my opinion
","I personally enjoyed this film greatly but the audience's and my friend's reaction showed that there are many ways to see it. I tend to like Asian martial arts films but can't bear the humour that usually goes with them (with the exception of A Chinese Ghost Story). And so this film - for me - is an ideal combination of rounded characters and a magical firework of fights that is close to dancing in many ways. I was also deeply moved by the ending.<br/><br/>Many of the people in the cinema measured what they saw by the laws of gravity and of course most of the fights are impossible then and they couldn't overcome this obstacle. That's like someone who can't get over the fact that the Christmas presents weren't brought by Santa Clause (or the angelic christ child here in Europe). So as it was unreal to them they couldn't accept that the emotions can be real.<br/><br/>And I suppose my friend's reaction lies somewhere in between those extremes.<br/><br/>What I also like about this film is that Ang Lee took up a genre and turned it into something new and yet retained the essence.<br/><br/>I'm amazed by the variety of his films but somehow they all seem to be connected by the common theme of the tension between the individual's hopes, feelings and aspirations and society's demands."

","If you're looking for a good kung-fu action pic with some elements of story and character development which you don't normally find in a kung-fu action pic, see Crouching Tiger.  But if you're expecting a great story, you may be disappointed.  The fight scenes are definitely spectactular, and the much-heralded bending of the laws of gravity is neat (if overused), but DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE AN EMOTIONALLY INVOLVING MOVIE.  It's just not.  The acting is good, but the story does not let you into the minds of any of these characters.  The one exception is the 20-30 minute Flashback In The Desert, where young Jen resists and eventually falls in love with the roguish loner guy.  That was compelling storytelling.  But essentially there's not much else to the story.  I didn't buy the romance between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat, and without spoiling the ending, I think that this storyline, and the whole movie, ended quite unsatisfyingly.  Maybe certain things don't translate from East to West very well, but I couldn't help but think that this is yet another lesson in Don't Believe The Hype.  8 out of 10."

"crystalline starscapes","10","0","0","21 February 2001"," a note about advertising and marketing
","One thing: films that are marketed everywhere and advertised everywhere are not always great films. I can remember a particular 'The Matrix' being advertised a couple of years ago, but think about it people!<br/><br/>Here's a classic example:<br/><br/>The only reason why car company Ford advertises its cars with such frequency is because they are ****! They are bog standard and are nothing special. It's the same way with a film...a great film doesn't need advertising to lure people to see it, it should do it by its strength and power alone. (Hannibal, anyone?)<br/><br/>I also see no point in drawing comparisons with 'The Matrix' as this and CTHD are two entirely different films. I found 'The Matrix' to be a cheap, quick, hi-octane kind of tomato ride, with an impenetrable plot and some good 'wow' kung fu - good for your couple of hours but not worth a repeat viewing, you know what I mean? There is so much more depth and intrinsical beauty to CTHD that it deserves to beat all other contenders for the Oscars this year... Gladiator was good but it was hardly spectacular, CGI effects abound as normal, as we have lately come to expect from Hollywood, and of course Traffic...well, both Gladiator and Traffic aren't bad films in their own right but I'm afraid I'll be rooting for CTHD come Oscar night.<br/><br/>I give CTHD these marks out of 10 for each category:<br/><br/>Performances from Leads: (Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat) 10/10 I have never, in living memory, seen such a subtle love exist on the screen.<br/><br/>Performances from Supports: (Chang Chen, Zhang ZiYi) 10/10 These performances are enough to put the best Hollywood performances of late out of their misery...quite literally, expect some slack-jaw moments as every trick in the book is utilised to add 'line' to the overall visceral shape.<br/><br/>Artistic Impression:       10/10 Possibly some of the most beautiful locations you will ever see in a film, the night chase, the city, and the desert, this is one rollercoaster of a film that never lets up. And of course the level of detail - the costumes, the ruts in the road for the carriage in the city, and interior design. Effects are used appropriately and yes, it is true that in the documentary with Ang Lee, he said he didn't want to use CGI effects for the wind in the tree-top scene because he felt that computers couldn't duplicate the effect of swaying tree tops in the dense forest. It's the strength of statements like that alone that are true testaments to the sheer power of CTHD, but anyway, we're digressing :)<br/><br/>Sound:       10/10 Not a hair out of place, metaphorically speaking, in this category. Sound effects are always appropriate and have just the right amount of weight to this to make it seem authentic, which is as it should be.<br/><br/>Music:       10/10 Always used in appropriate places, this film features some haunting cello solos from Yo-Yo Mah. If you are into beautiful 'a capella' (unaccompanied) music, you will definitely love this. Texture is rich and always has the right pitch, volume, and tone.<br/><br/>Cinematography:     8/10 Almost full marks in this category, but I felt that the cinematography fell down as the film goes on and on. Is there a logical progression of images that are utilised in the film? I felt it was conjured up in a somewhat haphazard fashion. Peter Pau certainly knows how to control the pace of a film, though; some quick, arousing battle scenes contrasted against the desert, dragging on and on for seemingly infinite length.<br/><br/>Direction:    10/10 You couldn't really ask more from a director, and Ang Lee gives it his best shot, and boy, what a shot that is. Camera angles are graceful and filled with splendour, so that even in the most basic of conversations at Sir Te's home, you will see all the detail that Ang Lee intended you to see. Top marks - absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>TOTAL MARKS:      68 / 70 Summary: One of the best films I have seen in the past 6 years of my life. Consistently outclasses others when I make comparisons to other works such as 'Clockwork Orange', 'American Beauty', etc. and all the other films that think they have something to say about society. My only wish is that (1) there is a global re-release in cinemas everywhere and (2) there should be more films like this. This is film-making of the very highest order.<br/><br/>Jaz"
"Dynamo-4","Null","0","0","20 February 2001"," The Emperor's New Film (with apologies to Hans Christian Anderson)
","Once upon a time, there lived an Emperor who ruled over a large kingdom encompassing a Major Film Studio. The Emperor's only worry in life was to make great films. He greenlighted many films and loved to show them off to his people. A few of these actually were great films, but many were not.<br/><br/>Word of the Emperor's films spread over his kingdom and beyond. Some film producers from a foreign land who had heard of the Emperor's vanity decided to take advantage of it. They introduced themselves at the gates of the Emperor's studio with a scheme in mind.<br/><br/>`We have invented an extraordinary method to turn an average kung fu flick into a box office smash,' they said. `It is called 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. As a matter of fact, its greatness cannot even be seen by anyone who is too stupid or unhip to appreciate it.'<br/><br/>The Emperor gave the producers a large bag of gold in exchange for their promise to begin working on the film immediately. `Just tell us what you need to get started and we will give it to you,' he said, `marketing, distribution, you name it.'<br/><br/>The producers then pretended to begin working on a quality film. The Emperor thought he had spent his money quite well: in addition to getting an extraordinary new film, he would discover which of his subjects were stupid or unhip.<br/><br/>Some time later, the Emperor called in his most trusted advisors, the President of Production, the President of Marketing and the President of Distribution. [In those mythical days of yore, everyone working at an Emperor's studio, no matter at what level, was entitled to be called `President' of something. In fact, they even had a President of the Mail Room.]. `Go and see how the work is proceeding,' the Emperor told them, `and come back and let me know.'<br/><br/>The advisors were welcomed by the producers. `We're almost finished,' they said. `Here Excellencies, admire the script, see the acting.' The advisors looked at the film and tried to see the greatness that was not there. They felt a cold sweat break out on their foreheads. `I can't see anything,' they all thought at once. `If I see nothing, that means I'm stupid, or worse, unhip.'<br/><br/>`What a marvelous film!' the advisors said. `We'll certainly tell the Emperor.' The producers rubbed their hands gleefully. They had almost made it. More gold was requested to finish the film.<br/><br/>Finally, the Emperor received the announcement that the film was finished. `Here it is, Your Majesty,' the producers said. `We have worked night and day, but at last, the most beautiful film in the world is ready for you. Look at the acting and see how fine it is.' Of course the Emperor did not see any real acting at all, nor was there anything which could actually be called a story or a script. He panicked and felt like fainting. But when he realized that no one could know that he actually saw nothing, he felt better. `Yes, this truly is a great film,' the Emperor said, trying to look comfortable. `You've done a fine job.'<br/><br/>`Your Majesty,' the advisors said, `we have a request for you. The people have found out about this extraordinary film and they are anxious to see it.' `All right,' the Emperor said, `I will grant the people this privilege.' He summoned his distributors and commanded that showings of the film be held all over the land. Film critics raved about it. Incredibly, the film was nominated for many awards, including the most prestigious award, a gold statuette presented annually by the Emperor Oscar. Finally, all the people gathered in the main square, known as IMDB User Comments, pushing and shoving to get a better look. An applause welcomed the regal presentation.<br/><br/>As the Emperor's film passed the crowd in IMDB, a strange murmur rose from the crowd. Many said, loud enough for the others to hear, `Look at the Emperor's new film! It's a masterpiece! I have never seen anything like it in my life.' Some of the more outspoken subjects even went so far as to voice their opinion that this was the best film ever.<br/><br/>They all tried to conceal their disappointment at not being able to see anything in film other than the silly mediocrity that it truly was, and since nobody was willing to admit that he was unhip or just didn't `get it', they all behaved as the producers had predicted.<br/><br/>One viewer, however, just a regular viewer who could only see things as his eyes showed them to him, went to the film hoping to see greatness. He sat through it, just the same as anyone else (he even tried, though ultimately unsuccessfully, to restrain himself from commenting openly when one of the characters in the film said: `When will this end?').<br/><br/>And when the film was over, this viewer said simply, `The Emperor is naked. There's no great film here; it's just an average grade B kung fu flick.'<br/><br/>`Fool,' the critics and others reprimanded, `Don't talk nonsense.' But the viewer's remark, which had been heard by the bystanders, was repeated over and over again until everyone cried: `The viewer is right. The Emperor is naked. This is a mediocre film at best and is certainly not even remotely worthy of an Oscar nomination. What could they have been thinking!'<br/><br/>The Emperor realized that the people were right but could not admit to that. He thought it better to continue the film under the illusion that anyone who couldn't see its greatness was either stupid or unhip. And he stood stiffly, while behind him a page held up his imaginary film.<br/><br/>Postscript: Well that's the fairy tale. The real ending, unfortunately, is that everyone keeps on deluding themselves that Crouching Tiger really is a great film actually worthy of an Oscar nomination."

This is one of the movies that you appreciate more when you watch it for the second time, third time, and on...<br/><br/>My roommate, who I dragged to see this movie, loved it, and said it was incredible, definite one of the best movie he's seem all year.

Michelle is from Mala., so her Chinese is as good as a foreigner speaking mardarin, and CYF is not a good speaker since he speaks Cantonese.

"uoftenglishmajor","10","0","0","21 February 2001"," Glorious and Haunting
","Dear Dream Journal,<br/><br/>I remember going to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on December 8th of last year... well before all of this Oscar attention and bandwagon jumping hoopla. Having heard very little about the movie, aside from the fact that it was directed by Ang Lee and that it had created quite a bit of a stir at Cannes and the Toronto International Film Festival, I was open-minded; apparently, it was also touted as a Westernized take on a very Eastern genre - Wuxia.  Having grown up while weaned on tonnes of this type of film (mystical flying, melodramatic storylines, and dance-like martial arts in general,) I thought I had seen it all.<br/><br/>I attended the opening night screening with my best friend, and about half an hour into the film (about the the time the first fight/chase scene occurred) it dawned upon both of us that we were in the midst of watching one of those very special films that only come around once in a very long time. The movie's vision prompted uncontrollable giddy excitement and knots in my stomach; the characters were literally flying around, skimming across rooftops and treating the laws of gravity as if they were only a suggestion. I felt like I was being led by a master magician whose trick I knew couldn't possibly be real -- but I let myself believe it anyways.  There was a kinetic energy to the first fight scene, one which left me gasping for breath as Michelle Yeoh's character repeatedly tugged on Zhang Yiyi to keep her from becoming airborne.  The drumbeat in the soundtrack, editing, and flurry of moves came at a metronomic pace, until it culminated into an eruption of audience applause at the end.  It turns out that the movie was just giving us a taste of things to come.  The fight scenes build, and of special note is the intense battle in the weapons room, and also, of course, the unforgettable scene atop the bamboo grove that possessed such magic, such gorgeous lyricism that it still haunts me to this day.  I think these three scenes can be considered as some of the best action sequences to be ever captured on celluloid.  Yes, I've seen good martial arts movies.  Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend,"" comes to mind, but what that movie had in sheer physical prowess, it lacks in execution and presentation.  Yes, I've seen good wuxia movies featuring zero-gravity.  Tsui Hark's ""A Chinese Ghost Story,"" and ""Bride With White Hair"" are notable examples, but the technique is never used as audaciously or breathlessly as it is in Crouching Tiger.<br/><br/>
I know I've talked a lot about the the martial arts in this movie, but before I fall into the trap of labelling this as a kung fu movie, let me be certain to say that Crouching Tiger is a fantasy film first and foremost, that also happens to contain refreshingly complex romantic subplots and fantastic martial arts.  The movie is not revolutionary in any isolated category, but it is one of the best examples of a movie reaching the apotheosis of refinement in its genre.  The trappings are there -- the battle of good vs. evil, the melodramatic quadruple love arc, the requisite restaurant fight scene, a legendary sword, unnecessary characters -- but the brilliance of the movie is in the details.<br/><br/>Notice the exquisite direction of Ang Lee; this is film that is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully executed.  Notice the lush cinematography of a China that can barely be contained within the confines of the frame; notice the care that went into the costumes; notice the soundtrack and how pants and drums and moody cellos accentuate the action; notice the unusual way that the fight sequences are shot (overhead views, large numbers of moves before an edit, an unflinching camera during long, stunningly choreographed sequences); notice the care that went into supplying everyone in the restaurant fight scene with different weapons, all strange and unique looking; notice the amount of restraint shown by the protagonists.  These features are not there by accident, but rather because are part of the director's vision that he wanted to project.<br/><br/>And what a glorious vision it is!  I walked away from the movie stunned, knowing that I had seen one of the best movies... ever.  It is unfortunate that the film has come attached with the stigma of a foreign film being released in a year full of ""weak"" films. As such, some might view it as overrated, or the obligatory slice of ""culture"" for the year. I think anyone who appreciates film can see that Crouching Tiger can hold its own in any year of release -- it has that timeless, ethereal element to it.  When I left the theatre, it was akin to waking from a dream... I could only remember bits and pieces of it --the drums, the panoramic views of China, swirling ribbon over a wall, the tension in Michelle Yeoh's face, feet skimming over water, and then scurrying up a supple bamboo branch... It was as if my imaginative mind were a glass of water and these fragments, droplets of food colouring.  The droplets may be small when compared with the water in the cup, but  they have forever imbued the way the way I view film again.<br/><br/>Indeed, it was like a dream... and I had to write it down."

Don't know why there is so many posts concerning its unpopularity in Asia. To my knowledge, it did very well in Taiwan, Malaysia and Phillipines too.  I think it was mainly North East Asia that snubbed the movie.  It is not like that critically acclaimed Chinese movies have been well received over there.  I wonder what was the box office performance of  Raise the Red Lantern in China.<br/><br/>Sure, Ang Lee did not come up with innovative ideas, using the old formulas of Wuxia films. But he sure perfected it like no one else ever did. (hm... remind me of Mozart's perfection in his quartets and symphonies. His concertos and operas belong to another league though....)  Great Acting (if u can overlook the accents), elegant choreography, breathtaking cinematography, gorgeous sets and beautiful soundtrack....<br/><br/>I really enjoy the parallel and contrasting love stories (yes the long flashback scene in the desert was necessary!), the difference in how the 3 female leads take their place in a male-dominated society, and not forgetting the ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>Truly the most beautiful movie of all time.<br/><br/>JP"

"aznvazion","10","0","0","20 February 2001"," Not your typical kungfu flick
","Being an Asian American, I've had my share of kungfu flicks. Many Asian friends of mine have complained to me, after watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that it was merely another one of those martial arts films. To explain for its wild success they've offered me two reasons: 1) the director, Ang Lee, has a respectable reputation in the film world, and thus Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was expected to be good, and 2) It is one of the few kungfu flicks that has had a lot of public exposure. I, however, thought very differently from my peers. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is not, by far, your typical kungfu flick. It transcends the amateur standards set by other movies in the genre. Its a shame that it must even be considered to be in the same category as those movies.<br/><br/>First of all, Ang Lee has put the focus of Crouching Tiger on the characters and their relationships to each other, contrary to the popular genre standard of concentrating on the clan or group the character belongs to. More attention is given to the particular martial art style, the bloodline, or the clan that one character belongs to. However, in Crouching Tiger, Ang Lee zeroes in on the characters of Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien, the Jade Fox, Jen, and Lo, beyond the extraneous details such as clan. Yes, the characters do often refer to the ""Wudan"" discipline; however, it never goes so far as to define the character of Li Mu Bai. Because of this focus on character, and not on bloodline, Ang Lee is able to portray emotions, such as love, loyalty, and hate with full effect. Many have also claimed that the wire play in Crouching Tiger makes the movie silly and deters the seriousness of the action sequences. I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE. The problem with many other kungfu flicks is that while they use wires while trying to cover it up to make it seem more realistic. That, however, usually backfires, and the action sequences feel stunted and immature. However, Ang Lee and Woo-ping Yuen makes full use of the wires and almost goes to the point of flaunting it (well not quite). That results in giving the sequences a graceful feeling. After all, martial arts is... well... art. Ang Lee has given us a gem. He has a created a world where gravity-defying leaps are possible, where one can move faster than one can see with his eyes. Perhaps that is the lost craft of filmmaking that many seem to have forgotten, that film is, among other things, a creation. However, amidst these fantastic action sequences, there is a realistic array of emotions presented throughout the movie. My favorite scene is the movie is not a fighting sequence; rather it is when Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are in the mountains in search of Jen. They stop by a small lodge where they have tea and enjoy conversation with each other. Li Mu Bai, during the scene, says that this is what he wants in his life, the peace and solitude that reign over them right now. The scene could have ended there but instead, the shot stays in the same scene for another several seconds, so that the viewers can truly see and appreciate the kind of peace that Li Mu Bai is talking about.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and it has to be considered as one of my favorites ever (although I'm only 16). If you have not seen this movie yet, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to see it. Don't pay attention to those who say that its just another typical kungfu flick. It's more than that, a lot more. It's less about martial arts than the emotions that the characters go through, and the relationships they have with each other. So, I don't care what time it is that you're reading this, if you haven't seen it yet, grab your coat, take a night out in the city, and see this excellent piece of mastery."

","This is a kind of movie I wish I could see every time I go to a movie. A movie that you love and you don't have to find reasons why. You devote yourself completely to the movie and when it ends you simply want more of it.<br/><br/>The basis for the film is a love story(actually 2 love stories),which run simultaneously in the film,but the way the story is been told, is simply superb. Ang Lee takes his time and tells the story slowly. He pulls us in to the story and make us care for every thing that happens in the film. In his way from A to B he is not afraid to show long scenes that serve the movie well, or some fight scenes which defies the laws of gravity and yet remain true to the nature of the film.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot and well acted,and it's a shame that none of the actors involved has got any Oscar nomination.Let's hope the Academy will give this film the recognition it deserve.The film is a rare thing.It leaves you breathless and the word wonderful (repeated more than once) is a word that describe it well and yet not enough to explain why.

","I have just got back from watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for the third time in less than a week. I have been to see it practically every other day during the half term with my friends. (Note: This movie has great date potential!)<br/><br/>There will be those that will come away from CTHD disappointed. This does not reflect on the content of the film, but rather the individuals in question. This film has been nominated for 10 Oscars and 14 BAFTAs (the British equivalent) and should, in my opinion, deserve more. It seems that the general public isn't as stupid as previously thought and will actually pay good money to see a subtitled film, if they think it is in their interest.<br/><br/>The storyline is set in the Qing dynasty, in 19th Century China, a time of strict morals and high expectations of the young. With such masterpieces as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Ride With the Devil"", (bizarrely enough, shown for less than 3 weeks in UK cinemas) Ang Lee has proved himself to be one of the most versatile, intelligent people working in modern cinema today.<br/><br/>I won't regurgitate on what countless numbers of people have already written here; but for me, there are very similar and interesting lines drawn here that overlap what 'American Beauty' and similar dramas are trying to tell us. It seems to me that CTHD is a daring story about the courage it takes to be yourself, in the same vein as other dramas of the year. (American Beauty, Boys Don't Cry) Intelligent, discerning people should come away from this movie and reflect on the hidden ideas that Ang Lee is trying to relate to us - what is our place in society? why do we conform to authority? etc.<br/><br/>The other thing is, if you're a martial arts fanatic and are expecting a full-blown studio production along the lines of Jackie Chan / Jet Li, you will be very disappointed. This is NOT an all-out, hi-octane adventure. What it is, however, is a beautiful passionate look at values of old and contrasting them with society today. (Sometimes I feel like I'm repeating myself over and over...and I wonder why I am bothering. Words fail to do this film justice.)<br/><br/>Newcomer Zhang Zi Yi is one of the most haunting young faces to grace cinema screens today. I get the impression that the writer must have almost written the part for her - it is as though she has some kind of inherent haughtiness in her. Her expression can be read in more than one way at some points in the film and there is a definite unpredictable element in her attitude to the circumstances. Moreover, this film shows humanity, as American Beauty did. It shows compassion and caring.<br/><br/>People go to see films to be entertained, excited, and taken on a ride for a couple of hours. CTHD does this and so much more, this is moral therapy of the very highest order. It is a soulful action 'epic' that every man, woman, and child on the face of the planet should be taken to.<br/><br/>To summarise, this is definitely worth your money and time. You won't be disappointed leaving the cinema, and I don't mind admitting that I was crying at the end - I definitely wasn't the only one either. One half of the audience sat there slack-jaw, the other half were openly crying and it reminds me of the society that was, before all this materialism has entered into our lives. CTHD is a wake-up call that must be echoed everywhere. And of course, you always get the small minority, destined to be ignorant forever. Of course, these are the people that laugh at the graceful martial arts...and these are the people that have the collective IQ of a wet fish.<br/><br/>Despite my 16 years it is not hard to see why so many people have hailed this film as truly worthy of gongs come Oscar-time.<br/><br/>The level of humanity and moral destiny on screen was just too great to bear. My only concern is that some of the dramatic impact is lost when the film is transferred from big screen to small screen...is there any chance of a global re-release?"

","I'm really disappointed to hear so much criticism of this film - insofar as people are comparing it to every special-effects-fest/cheezy love story churned out in Hollywood, and asking dumb questions like, ""why didn't he just kiss her already?"" and ""what's with the cheap wire effects?..""  There are thousands of years worth of spiritual and cultural mythology and imagery fueling the choices made in ""Crouching..."" , and anyone who left the theatre feeling disappointed that they didn't get to see a Jackie Chan cop flick or who thinks true love can only be shown by ramming your tongue down someone's throat can go re-rent ""American Pie."" OR, they can open their minds to something a little new and contemplate the idea than maybe things are handled a little differently in other cultures.  Not everyone has a dog-eared copy of the Tao in their back pocket, or has truly studied martial arts, but I don't think you need to to appreciate the core beauty of the film - not to mention the beautifully choreographed and brilliantly executed kick-ass combat. There are motivations behind the characters in ""Crouching..."" other than your standard ""blow-up-the-building and f*** the girl"" nonsense.  I think the ""feeling"" of the wire work was in keeping with much of the spirituality behind martial arts training, and glossy, seamless CG effects would have robbed the film of much of its charm.  And for those who found the stolen-sword/avenged-master/mystical-training plot points ""tired"", I'd like to point out that it hasn't hurt the ""Star Wars"" franchise any.  Moreover, I'd like to see Harrison Ford or Natalie Portman in a believable quarter-staff fight without some serious help from a stunt double or the special effects department. I think they all deserved an Academy nod, if only to encourage American actors to actually develop a few skills along the way.

","After seeing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the new kung-fu love story from director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm), one might be tempted to make grand, sweeping pronouncements about this film's place in the upcoming Oscar race or in the all-time pantheon of great movies. (I will do that later.)<br/><br/>And while a film of this quality will only attract such talk--and deservedly so--it is so important to realize that this is a film not only of grand moments, but also of small flashes. For it is the combination of grandeur and those seemingly insignificant flourishes that elevate this film from simply great to classic.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a story about a sword. But this is not just any sword. Rather, it is the Green Destiny (Lee loves his imagery), a 400 year-old sword owned by the legendary wuxia warrior, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat). (Wuxia pan is a type of Hong Kong period action romance that focuses on swordplay--Asian pulp fiction.)<br/><br/>Mui Bai is a weary warrior, ready to hang up his sword when we meet him at the beginning of the film. Though he has never avenged the death of his master at the hands of the Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), he arranges for the sword to be given to his close friend Sir Te (Sihung Lung) by fellow fighter Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a longtime friend. Shu Lien delivers the sword, but it is soon stolen and she must get it back. The masked thief is the local governor's daughter, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who is conflicted. She is about to be wed in an arranged marriage, but wants to be with her secret lover, Lo (Chang Chen), a desert bandit she met years before.<br/><br/>Shu Lien is also conflicted. She feels for Jen because she has long felt the same way for Mui Bai. Unfortunately, she and Mui Bai have never admitted their love for one another because they were both honoring the memory of Shu Lien's long-dead fiance.<br/><br/>To complicate matters further, Mui Bai realizes Jen's warrior potential and offers to train her, to help further her skills. But Jen refuses, despite her obviously strong feelings for Mui Bai.<br/><br/>This film succeeds because it its firmly aware of what it is. It is a love story. It is a spaghetti western. It is a kung-fu film. It is a celebration of feminism (as so many of Lee's films are.) And it does not take itself too seriously. Lee fully intends for the audience to laugh during Jen's scene at the saloon and during her initial meeting with Lo.<br/><br/>The big moments are big. The gravity defying fight scenes are choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping, who did similar work in The Matrix. And while his work in that film was wonderful, it cannot hold a candle to the onscreen antics in this film because, while CGI is incredibly effective at making unreal situations real, it cannot compare to what can be done by people manipulating invisible wires.<br/><br/>The initial fight between Shu Lien and Jen brought loud applause from the audience. The battle between Jen and Mui Bai on top of the bamboo forest drew similar reactions. I have never seen better martial arts displays in a film--not from Bruce Lee, not from Jackie Chan.<br/><br/>And the small moments are big too. Because despite their importance in furthering the plot, they are treated almost as afterthoughts at the same time. Confused? When you see the film, consider the significance of Jen's comb or the moment when Shu Lien drops a teacup that Jen catches silently. That is a monster moment that can easily pass unnoticed. The viewer is being strung along by a master director.<br/><br/>A film like this could not be a success without terrific acting performances. Anything less would cause the film to cross the line from masterpiece to cheese. Chow Yun Fat's quiet dignity meshes so well with Michelle Yeoh's painful resolve. Newcomer Zhang Ziyi's youthful exuberance is the perfect antithesis to the aforementioned performances. The supporting cast is wonderful.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed by Peter Pau, and supported by Yo Yo Ma's virtuoso cello sonatas, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a dream, a perfect film. Lee not only knows how to open a film, but he knows how to close one as well. The closing line, spoken by Lo, will go down as one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>Note that I have yet to mention the fact that the film is subtitled. Please do not let that prevent you from seeing it. After a few minutes, you forget about their presence since this is a film that is not driven by its dialogue. No one complained about the having to read the opening credits or subtitles in Star Wars.<br/><br/>Movies are supposed to be an escape. The great ones take you somewhere you have never been. This is a great action film--one that reminds you why you fell in love with the movies in the first place.<br/><br/>Many people have complained that this has not been a great year for film. Though I tend to disagree, secure in the knowledge that I have seen at least 10 great films so far this year, said feelings should only strengthen the argument that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon deserves to be nominated not only for Best Foreign Language Film, but also for Best Film.<br/><br/>
Though I still have yet to see Traffic ,and one or two others that have been rumored to be excellent, I feel confident saying that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not only the best movie of the year, but also the best movie I have seen in the past 10 years. While the film is almost assured of winning the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, the Academy must not be afraid to give it the Oscar for Best Picture. It is most deserving."

"ajy1","7","0","0","8 December 2000"," Ang Lee's first disappointment...
","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of those movies that come to our shores with much pre-release hype.  After all, this has been playing the festival circuit to much praise as well as trophy acquisition.  The hype surrounding this flick has been unavoidable and would serve to show that this film should indeed be the masterpiece that it's been cranked up to be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""Crouching"" ends up being a passable film that is quite disappointing on a lot of levels.  While the basic storyline seems to invoke some fun melodrama, diehard martial arts fans will be saddened to see that the fighting scenes are poorly rendered and made unrealistic beyond recognition.  Character development is rather limited and the audience can pretty much determine things from their basic understandings of movies. This is really not the film that it should've been.<br/><br/>Basically the story breaks like this.  Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) has to return a famous sword called the ""Green Destiny"" to his master.  He has his friend and secret crush, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) take care of this for him.  There's also a young woman, Jen (Zhang Ziyi) who is engaged in an arranged marriage and ends up having an affair with an outlaw, Lo (Chang Chen).  Since the sword obviously gets stolen, all these characters end up entwined in some way.<br/><br/>The thing that has caught many critics' attentions with this film are the action sequences.  I'm saddened to report that for martial arts fans, this will be a major sore spot.  The filmmakers elected to overuse ""wires"" to lift the actors around and have also blended in some digital effects from the ""Romeo Must Die"" school of filmmaking.  I love wire stuff as much as the next fella (check out Jet Li's classic, ""Once Upon A Time In China"" for great usage of this), but this is ridiculous.  All suspension of disbelief is gone once you see these actors fly over the rooftops for long periods of time with minimal effort.  This is not just leaping (which would've made more sense).  Actual lift-off.  Plus, much of the editing distracts from the hand-to-hand combat scenes and this makes it even more obvious to an audience that it never really is that intricate and exciting.  With the minimal impact that these characters have when fighting, it looks more like an art exhibition than a true martial arts film.  This is the film's biggest debit.<br/><br/>Next up is something that not many people will notice: the widely varying accents of the actors speaking Mandarin.  Yeoh and Chang seem to have the worst ones and this automatically disqualifies us from believing that the film is set in the early 19th century.  True, this shouldn't be a big deal, but it really becomes distracting as 2/3 of all dialogue seems to have been relooped in post-production, sometimes mid-sentence!  I admire the actors' attempts to get their Mandarin in check (as it certainly isn't easy), esp. Chow Yun-Fat's proper diction (even though just about all his lines are redubbed).  Again, this doesn't affect the majority of viewers.  For those who will notice, this REALLY diverts from their appreciation of the film.<br/><br/>So, what really works in ""Crouching""?  Peter Pau's sumptuous cinematography captures the atmosphere of the setting quite well and it's also fun to see Beijing rendered digitally a la ""Phantom Menace.""  The ripe melodrama between the couples is also well-established.  Their situations are rendered in an overwrought fashion that leads to some unintentional laughter.  All that level, the film does succeed and we do see the actors giving what they can to their performances (even with the dialect problem).<br/><br/>It's a shame here that the director is Ang Lee, esp. since the guy is a master at films in different genres and settings (""Wedding Banquet,"" ""Sense & Sensibility,"" ""Ice Storm"").  He is truly a brilliant filmmaker, but I think we've found his weakness.  He understands the importance of cultural differences and generation gaps (as well as showing scenes of people eating, something greatly lacking in this film!).  With ""Crouching,"" most of those elements aren't necessary b/c of its sole location.  He has, on the other hand, correctly rendered the feeling of the pulp novels on which this is based in a grand fashion.  Maybe ""Crouching"" would've been better if there were no martial arts at all.  However, the tone of the film keeps shifting. What style is he trying to accomplish here?  One second it's an arty Mainland Chinese epic (in the Zhang Yimou vein of ""Raise The Red Lantern""), the next second an HK B-movie actioner, then a modern Taiwanese soap opera? These elements are too diverse to try and combine successfully in one narrative.<br/><br/>So ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" may become the arthouse hit that it's destined to be due to curiosity and hype.  My hope is that those piqued viewers interested in seeing better martial arts epics will come away from this experience in a renting mood.  Go out and try locating the classic 70's Taiwanese martial arts flicks by the underappreciated auteur, King Hu.  Or even any old Jet Li/Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung/Yuen Biao flick will do the trick.  Those martial arts films indeed have the sheer visceral thrills that ""Crouching"" seems to have forgotten completely to accomplish."

","An absolutely wonderful movie. Just finished my 3rd viewing. The last time I went to theater for a movie for 3 times was when Saving Private Ryan came out. Both of these movies have what I call the touch of a master. In SPR, one of those moments was when the camera showed the gravel vibrating while the audience could only hear the approaching Tiger tank. That single shot brought the tension to the breaking point. There are just so many places which exhibit the touch of a master in CTHD, that I am at a loss to say which one impacts me the most. Truth be told, I wouldn't want to see SPR for a 4th time. But I still want to see CTHD again. The experience was that powerful for me.<br/><br/>If I have to bring up something specific to rave about, I was amazed by by Yeoh and Ziyi. Having just finished a 3-week tour through 6 western US national parks, the scenery in this movie was equally breath-taking.  China will definitely be high on my list of places to have the next vacation. The music score was fantastic. The drum beat was unbelievably effective in complimenting the furious action. The cello parts played by Yoyo Ma were very haunting, and fit extremely well with the sweeping grandeur of Western China and the tragic story.<br/><br/>A previous reviewer who hated this movie said it stole many elements from the Star Wars. Go read what Lucas said himself about where his inspirations came from for that movie. As long as the movie evokes an emotional response, I really don't give a damn if it was a copy or not. I think a person has to have the right make up (background, personal experience or whatever you wanna call) to enjoy a particular movie. For example, I hated some of the Oscar favorites, such as Gladiator. I also hated some past winners, like Titanic, the Last Emperor (what a bore!) etc. So no matter if CTHD wins or loses in the Oscar, this movie will always have a permanent place in my heart.<br/><br/>I've seen some really good Asian movies lately. Sunny Days (Yang Guang C'an Lan de Ri Zi) and Chungking Express stood out among them."
"Guitar-2","Null","0","0","18 February 2001"," A fine film, but Best Picture?
","I liked this flick overall, but I'm afraid I can't endorse it carte blanche as others seem fit to do. While Michelle Yeoh's performance was excellent, I found Chow Yun Fat's performance contrived for the most part. He seems to have 3 expressions to cover most situations: solemn, earnest and solemnly earnest. There is a certain sense of amused charm that glows in selected scenes, however these are few and far between. The cinematography was lush and a joy to the eye. Oddly enough, the problems I had with this film for the most part were with the fight and flight sequences and not because I had a problem suspending disbelief, I recognize this film is a fantasy. It was the quality of the effects, or lack thereof that was striking *on occasion*. The first sequence involving the flight over the rooftops felt off to me in many ways. They looked like actors suspended from wires for the most part. They would change direction by pushing off a wall or a rooftop except that it was plainly obvious their foot hadn't touched the surface of the roof or wall. In the Matrix there were similar scenes but one always had at least a vague sense of a body's *mass*. With Crouching Tiger sometimes this would be conveyed and at other times it wasn't. I think it was the inconsistency that bothered me the most. The most compelling fight sequences were those involving Michelle Yeoh and/or Ziyi Zhang. The writing was good, but not exceptional. It's interesting that the thrust of the martial arts tends to be inner harmony and mental discipline, yet every film of this genre seems predicated on revenge and Crouching Tiger certainly doesn't break the mould in that respect. For the genre it was exeptional and I can see it being nominated and winning Best Foreign Feature, but Best Picture? That's a stretch."

","While I enjoy the occasional ""foreign film"" (foreign in my reality is either not American or not in English), I tend to be suspicious of those that arrive with tremendously high praise. I rarely find them as good as the billing. I think for some reason foreign films tend to be overindulged by reviewers. My pet theory is that English-speaking reviewers see a foreign film and are so happy to be able to follow it, the reviews suddenly are out of sight.<br/><br/>With that comment setting the stage, I believe Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was beautifully filmed, and had a plot that mostly made sense. Still, I have to say that the ""flying ninja"" scenes were silly, and there must have been some concepts that didn't translate in my Western mind because I didn't understand the ending at all (even if I speculate, it seems like such a waste).<br/><br/>Now, now. I know the flying ninjas were graceful. And the fight in the treetops was daring. But I can only suspend reality so much. OK, fine, so this was a fantasy film, I guess. But even as a fantasy it looked silly. Why did they keep churning their legs as they flew? Wouldn't it make more sense to simply leap with straight or flexed legs and keep the air drag down? Why not windmill their arms and wear capes while they are at it? Where do you stop?<br/><br/>The fight scenes were terrific overall, and not too repetitive. I've never liked martial arts movies because I could make no sense of a fight when five blows seem to have no effect, but 15 seconds later one blow of the same type knocks out an opponent. In CTHD, the fights take place in different settings and for different reasons, and don't feature wave after wave of faceless opponents who go down after taking 25-30 blows each. That was a nice surprise. <br/><br/>The plot felt like an epic, moving back and forth in time to fill in back stories on characters. And it had one of the best plot devices of all, revenge and retribution.<br/><br/>Still, the ending, while dramatic, seemed senseless. If a person grows through sadness and mistakes, in the Western world they become a better person (though the hard way). If they do what Jen finally did in CTHD, that is considered a coward's way out. But I suppose in the East, that takes courage. I dunno.<br/><br/>Anyway, I gave CTHD an 8, because of the settings, for its epic story and because of a truly hilarious line about one man's home being a ""warehouse."""

","I walked into the movie theatre not knowing much (having only seen the trailer), but I had high expectations.  Those expectations were blown out of the water just ten minutes into the movie.  Not only are the action sequences beautifully orchestrated, they only supplemented an excellent love story.  I was thoroughly surprised by the acting in the film, with the three main characters turning in great performances.  The ending left me speechless, and when I exited the theatre just about everyone had the same look of amazement and deep thought as I did.  Philosophically, the film poses some very important ideas on love, regret, and teaching.  Overall I highly commend this film, and will be seeing it again soon enough.  It's been maybe 5 hours since I saw it and I'm still thinking about the ending. Hope you enjoyed the film as much as I did."

But given all the praise heaped on CTHD lately, I felt a tad disappointed upon leaving the theater. There were a few moments in the film that were really breathtaking, but for the most part the film as a whole was not spectacular. Also, I always hate to rail against the endings of movies, but this one I just did not get. It was completely abrupt and seemed out of place given the two hours of story that preceded it. Despite these criticisms, it was still certainly a good film (far better than Gladiator), but probably not worthy of the excessive adulation that has come its way."

","I arrived at the theater to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with a great deal of emotional baggage.  I've seen the great kung fu films and enjoyed them, the hype for CTHD had been building up for a while so I went expecting a masterpiece and nothing else would really satisfy.  Actually at the time I was a bit worried, going into a film with that kind of expectation and finding something merely good can ruin a decent filmgoing experience... and could Ang Lee (who's made some wonderful character dramas) really do a film with martial arts?<br/><br/>Several hours later I was numb on my seat and practically weeping.  And I wasn't the only one, the audience burst into spontaneous applause (something I've just never seen before at a film)  What makes this film so extraodinary is not its action scenes (which are gorgeous, but probably not as technically sophisticated as some of the classic Jet Li/Jackie Chan flics), or it's characters, its beautiful scenery, the romance, the humor,  or the sophisticated philosophy at it's core.  Rather it's the combination of the elements working in harmony to produce a perfect cinematic experience. Something which, in my humble opinion, is a necessary requirement in any truly great film.<br/><br/>This is, strangely, an extraodinarily American film in it's focus on concepts like honor, sacrifice, duty, and a yearning to rebel against societal roles and relationships.  And in it's use of self and genre-referential humor and the focus on production values.  Which, I suppose explains the strange dichotomy of the IMDB boards where ordinary Americans rave about a subtitled, art house, foreign film while bemused non-yanks complain about its low action content and loose plotting.<br/><br/>All I can say is go see this movie with an open mind and you won't be disappointed."

Go figure.) This movie has everything! For the guys, thrills, spills, action and not only the gracefully gorgeous Michelle Yeoh but also the profoundly impure-thought-provoking Zhang Ziyi. And for the women - has there ever been anything more heartstoppingly romantic on the big screen since the golden era of Douglas Sirk in the 50s? Titanic, Ghost, Pretty Woman? Pah! I'm a fairly cynical person, but when we get to the line 'I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you.

The charismatic actor is well-known for playing steely characters in super violent action dramas, such as The Killer<br/><br/>
Michelle Yeoh succeeds in portraying a strong woman who suffers from Li Mu Bai's denial of their love.<br/><br/>
But the real surprise comes from newcomer Zhang Zi Yi who plays the pivotal role of Jen whose portrayal of a rebellious aristocrat is convincing. <br/><br/>
                 With help from action director Yuen Woo-ping, who was responsible for theamazing fight scenes in the smash hit The Matrix, the film generates applause from audiences at movie theaters for kung fu fighting scenes whichsometimes substitute for words in the movie. Of particular note is the incredible fighting scene at the top of bamboo trees. <br/><br/>                 Furthermore, the film was shot at beautiful and exotic locations, including the Gobi Desert, under the direction of camera wizard Peter Pau who has shot many of Hong Kong's martial art films, including The Bride With White Hair. <br/><br/>                 The film also contains elements of humor.<br/><br/>

","CTHD has numerous plots, but they are all hidden.  Why hidden? Since CTHD is subtitled, it takes more than just viewing the movie to understand the plot. You actually have to have an ""open-mind"" while watching this film.  While doing so, you can be more aware that the ""plot"" everyone is searching for is right under their nose (subtitles). I also heard that a lot of people believe that the plot in the movie was bad.  I truly believed that revenge/honor/romance/tragedy in CTHD makes it the best movie in it's genre. How about Gladiator?  I mean if you take out all those gruesome killing in the movie, what will you have then? Absolutely NO PLOT!  Practically 99% of the movie is based on killing people, but if the fighting scenes were taken off from CTHD you'll still enjoy the movie. Since CTHD is not based on fighting alone, you'll still have the opportunity to watch the romance, honor, and fairy tale that this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>Another issue that bugs me is the negative comments I hear about the flying. I heard some say that the flying was ""unrealistic"".  Well first of all, this movie is a FAIRY TALE. Just like how we have superheroes here in the US, China also has their own.  When Superman was born, he immediately had powers and started to fly!  In the Matrix, they had information downloaded in someone's brain, and well, the guy started to do some KUNG FU! But CTHD, they explained how the wudan fighters had to go on rigirous TRAINING to achieve their skill.  Not because they were born with it, nor because it was downloaded from their brain.  Now tell me, which one is more realistic?<br/><br/>I read this quote and I believe this is somehow related to this movie, and can also be a statement that needs to be read by those who cant appreciate a Great Film...<br/><br/>""As often as a study is cultivated by narrow minds, they will draw from it narrow conclusions.""

When I first saw them skip-flying over the rooftops I thought for a second it was kind of silly, but quickly I was silently saying ""wow"" to myself over and over.  It puts ""The Matrix"" to shame in that respect.<br/><br/>It's not a martial arts film, so if that's what you want then it's not for you.

","This film is getting a lot more attention than I ever thought it would.  I am amazed that a film of this genre has been so well received here in America.  As a fan of Hong Kong cinema, I am glad to see such films getting more attention here.  However, this movie is getting more attention than it deserves. <br/><br/>First of all, the flying warrior genre is not new.  It has been done many, many times before.  Personally, I have never cared for wire-assist stunts. Really, THE MATRIX is the film that has broken the ground for films like CROUCHING TIGER to get acceptance.  But in THE MATRIX, the wire assist stuff was minimal.  CROUCHING TIGER has people flying all over the place.  The big problem I have with the flying warrior genre is the effect never really looks right.  The people are sort of running through the air, and their feet don't ever seem to hit at the right time when they are supposed to be jumping off stuff.  I just find it irritating!<br/><br/>Next, CROUCHING TIGER is not a lot different from IRON MONKEY.  Same basic concept.  Same basic plot, and yes, IRON MONKEY was ridiculous.  The big difference, and saving grace, is the big epic love story in the middle of the movie.  I am a huge fan of action movies, but really, the best part of this movie was the love story in the middle.  The fight scenes were OK, but they have been done MUCH better.  Not to mention, the fight scenes were largely unmotivated, and I hate that.  Also, some of the fight scenes did not have enough light and it was difficult to see what was going on.  I suspect this was due to the fact they had to use stand-ins extensively because Chow Yun Fat is no martial artist.  <br/><br/>The acting was good, the love story was good, but overall the movie was long and the plot was typically over-complicated.  I don't know why its getting all the attention that it is, but I think it is just a case of right place/right time.

There are just some audience members who have a hard time understanding that the movie is a fantasy and have difficulty accepting the ""flying scenes,"" yet they accept the flying monkeys in Wizard of Oz or Mary Poppins' extraterestial umbrella.

","Tsk, tsk, I had rated ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" a 9.0 after seeing it the first time some weeks ago. Ashamedly, I have to declare that I'd made a terrible mistake.  Let me explain.  Last night, I went back and saw it a second time, and unabashedly I have to agree with most of you folks out there, who have the remarkable conviction to recognize this film as a cinematic masterpiece..... before I do.<br/><br/>My anticipated second viewing of this movie is nothing short of spectacular since knowing the story, I intend to dispense with the annoyance of reading subtitles and allowed my concentration to focus exquisitely on the superb craftmanship of director Ang Lee, of cinematographer Peter Pau, of action choreographer Yuen, of composer Tan Dun, of musician Yo-Yo Ma, of actors Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi et al.  To me, this is a fabulous ensemble of professionals who have individually poured their collective hearts and souls into this mere $15 million project and burnished it into a shining celluloid gemstone.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, a funny thing happened on my way to the cinema. Notwithstanding the fantastic visuals, it was the storyline again that I was lost in enchantment a second time. How so ? Well, before setting out for the theatre, I took the time to read all the comments on this board to get a handle on how to approach this second viewing.  Many of my fellow moviegoers, have eloquently paid tribute to this movie and reading their favorable comments had greatly impressed me. (Others are not fit to mention; scat subjective pieces written solely to antagonize, by those who just don't get IT !) Like a connoisseur who had been freshly instructed on how to properly de-shell an Atlantic lobster in order to exquisitely enjoy its delicious succulent meat, ( pity, the poor boors who detest seafood ) I returned to watch ""Crouching Tiger"", fully prepared to savor the sublime a second time round. Armed with the prescience afforded me by some of the well-written comments posted here by some passionate reviewers, I was ready to synthesize the multiple stories that unfold within Ang Lee's masterpiece. What a revelation! Like an intricate puzzle, the final piece falls into place perfectly and it all makes sense.  I bet that 90% of us who saw the movie could not  grasp the significance of the film's coda.  Ang Lee, still constrained by sense and sensibility, leaves only subtle clues to this somewhat unwholesome ( to  some of us, anyway ) yet tantalizing plotline which explains the final moment of the film. Let me leave a few clues to what I am referring to:  ( Warning to those who sadly haven't seen the film yet: Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>If you are going to a second viewing of CTHD, take time to:-<br/><br/>a) Relish the sexual tension between two of the the protagonists when they first met. And I don't mean, in the desert!<br/><br/>b) Notice their eyes glazed over and became limpid when they stared at each other over their crossed swords. Can anybody spell R-E-X complex ?<br/><br/>c) Think over why she dispatched her handsome brigand lover; after all he travelled great distance to come to her. And inspite of the red hot passion that had earlier transpired between them, why did she turned cold ?  Really puts the flashback into perspective, eh?  She could have so easily followed him back into the desert to evade the marriage, but she felt so utterly confused and guilty.  Having been smitten in a 5-minute encounter, she chose to punish herself for harboring irrational and wildly desirous feelings for a total stranger that she subjected herself into going ahead with the loveless marriage. Is this a way to curb her unheathly desire and put an end to it ? Is this an act of atonement for forsaking Lo after her runaway feelings for someone else ? Isn't irrational love at first sight and irrepressible desire for someone you meet for the first time, a rhetorical crouching tiger, hidden dragon ?<br/><br/>d) Consider the overladen implication of Li's offer to Jen to have her follow him to Wudan Mountain as his disciple ? This is indeed a proposition fraught with dangerous precedence and implications.<br/><br/>For Li Mu Bai: This is my chance to break this wrongful discriminating Wudan tradition of not imparting martial art skills to women. This injustice had banefully brought us to this sorrowful Jade Fox treacherous episode. Also, I need to turn Jen away from the Dark Side and show her the Way (Tao)of the Giang Hu.  Lately, my meditation has not gone well ( he confided to ShuLien but not in so many words ) because I am in conflict with myself.  I am determined to give away Green Destiny and not pursue this rather dubious revenge ( after all, Jade Fox is as much a victim) and yet it pains me because I am bound by honor and tradition to exact it. I thought I can submerge all this Giang Hu righteousness and repair to a serene non-martial life loving ShuLien and now this happens !  Didn't someone said that those who lives by the sword -------.<br/><br/>For Jen:  I thought my love for Lo is strong but what is this strange feeling coming over me ? Am I spellbound by Li Mu Bai ? Is this an re-enactment of the dangerous liaison between mentor and pupil ? Is this dejavu all over again as with Jade Fox.  Yet I am so much drawn into this maelstrom.  I envy ShuLien for her Giang Hu life when I met her.  Now it seems that I am just jealous of her.... like two sisters in love with the same man.  Maybe it is best that I steal Green Destiny a second time and lose myself in the Giang Hu world and not succumb to my desire for an older man.<br/><br/>For Yu ShuLien: Oh no, don't let this happen, I may lose him to youth.  Jen has fallen for him, the same way I did even though I was bethrothed then to his brother-in-arms, years ago.  After my fiance's death, Li and I suppress our feelings out of despair and unsurmountable guilt because we have our suspicion that my fiance sacrificed himself to save Li in battle after stumbling upon our secret love. ( this is my conjecture, ha ha ).  After all these wasted years, Mu Bai has finally transcend his guilty feelings to be with me ..... And now this has to happen ! I am beginning to detest her.<br/><br/>For Lo:  Whatever has happened to Jen? She has changed.  She has lost that lovelight in her eyes! *Sigh* I have come this far to Peking for naught.<br/><br/>For Jade Fox:  I had to kill Li Mu Bai's mentor for stealing my innocence. Now, I will have to kill Li Mu Bai for stealing my innocent.<br/><br/>e) Savor the dripping irony in the kiln scene where a drippingly wet and sensual Jen holding tightly onto the sword, stuporified with Jade Fox's potion and stupefied with sudden unseated emotion, issued a challenge to  i Mu Bai to come clean' with a double entendre, pregnant with possibilities, ` Is it ME or the Green Destiny, that you come for ?'. (Emphasis is mine.) Li Mu Bai was taken aback by Jen's forthrightness.  His mojo was shaken, for sure.  The undercurrent is so thick that only a Green Destiny can slice through.  The first time I saw the scene, I was nonplussed. The second time: epiphany !<br/><br/>f) Experience the split second pain and consternation that shot through Yun ShuLien when she stumbled onto the kiln scene, catching Li Mu Bai laying hands on Jen to extricate the drug from her body. It's honorable; not what she thought but the expression on her face goes: What the heck is going on....? Oh holy bogdhisattva, my worst nightmare has come true !<br/><br/>( And I mean, this is before Li Mu Bai took a vicious purple Yin poison dart in his jugular!)<br/><br/>g) Feel the dreamy passion playing on Jen's face when she took flight at the end, leaving Lo as an also-ran on the bridge.  Lo's demeanor seemed to show a zen of understanding as Jen plunged or soared (your pick) to join her deceased hero. Truly, Jen's is a magnificent obsession  to the end.  Puts a whole new meaning to the words: Fatal Attraction, isn't it ?<br/><br/>( By the way, only the charismatic Chow Yun-Fat has the sheer magnetism to pull that off -- to stir a young damsel's blood and set her heart a'flutter; Jet Li just won't cut it being Li Mu Bai.  When Chow came aboard replacing Jet Li, it was a godsend and Ang Lee judiciously tailored the script, insert the innuendo of Jen's infatuation and expanded Li Mu Bai's screen presence to showcase Chow Yun-Fat's screen presence. )<br/><br/>h) Finally, some wag in some review, has called Green Destiny, a phallic symbol. Li Mu Bai's.? Very allegorical and very true.  Many a true word is spoken in jest. Yes?<br/><br/>Like I've said, only Ang Lee with the assistance of his very capable writers, Shamus et al, can construct such a powerful yet subtle masterpiece. Truly this film is a Sense and Sensibility  with martial arts.  With deference to those who disparagingly called this a kung phooey movie with nonsensical flying, I said to them: ` Take your blinders off, my friends and let your hearts take flight', if not, then ""Take a hike"".<br/><br/>`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of the top 10 films of all time. Well done, Ang Lee. Hopefully, you have paved the way for further celluloid excellence to be followed in this new century.  Hollywood, please take note.<br/><br/>In case you haven't noticed, as ""Wo Hu Zang Long"" goes up from 10 to 9 on the IMDB Top 250, my vote for it goes from a 9 point to a 10. Giving it any less is a sacrilege !<br/><br/>Hey, everyone move back and make room on the bandwagon for me. Glad to join you all on board.<br/><br/>And Mr. L. Santoro ( love your fantastic review ) extend me your hand, help me climb aboard before we all get hemmed in by the arrival of the Oscars."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","0","16 February 2001"," Bad-ass martial arts in zero gravity!
","This is definitely a very unique film, but it clearly went a little too far in some elements. Is the martial art genre so done to death that the only thing left to do is come up with martial artists who are not subject to the laws of gravity? The whole flying thing was just too much. But on the other, hand, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is still a great movie. There are some incredible fight scenes, in particular. This movie had women fighting with swords in scenes that were faster and more impressive than anything that I've ever seen from Jackie Chan or Jet Li. This was by far the best element of the film, by the way - the stunning fight scenes, particularly the ones that were executed while the fighters were on the ground as opposed to flying inexplicably through the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film that you really have to watch more than once in order to fully understand it, not only because of the complex plot, but also the fact that there is just so much going on that there is a lot that you can miss in only one viewing. Sure, it's subtitled, but is that really such a big deal? A lot of people complain that they can't really watch the movie because they are always trying to read what's going on in the subtitles. Well, if it takes someone so long to read one line of dialogue at a time that they are unable to pay attention to what is actually happening on screen, then it might be a better idea to stay home and work on reading skills instead of going out to the movies. You can almost always be sure that a foreign film will be good, because foreign countries don't ship out their crappy movies for the world to see. The best ones are weeded out and those are what we get, and Crouching tiger, Hidden Dragon is no exception.<br/><br/>(spoilers) The incredible martial arts strongly overshadow what would otherwise be the main plot of the film, which is that of a young woman, the daughter of a nobleman, who is being forced to marry against her will, and yearns for a more dangerous and exciting life. Having been sheltered for most of her life, she wants to experience the excitement of a different life, and when she enters into that life, she obviously finds many more problems and troubles than she had anticipated. She encounters a goofy guy who steals her comb (providing for some good laughs), and a rather unlikely but surprisingly effective romance develops between the two.<br/><br/>
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon contains a lot of fairly strong feminism. Women are portrayed as being very powerful and independent, which is a refreshing thing to see in the movies. There's nothing worse than seeing a movie where the female characters are just stupid bimbos. That may sound kind of extreme, but my point is that in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the role of women stands out because the difference is so strong that it really grabs your attention. For some, the ending may have been a little too strange or too ambiguous, but it definitely has meaning. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a beautifully photographed and very powerful film that should not be missed."

","WOW! is all that I have to say for this film, the cinematography, the direction by Ang Lee, the superb cast (especially Zhang Ziyi) and best of all, the kung fu sequences are TOP OF IT'S CLASS!  Out of all the movies for 2000, this has got to win my vote for Best Picture of the Year because who would of thought that a romance/kung fu flick would sell over here in North America, this movie just looks stunning and the fight sequences, which are overdone with the flying but this is based on a fairy tale so it doesn't matter is probably the best ever done in cinema, kudos to Yuen Woo Ping. <br/><br/>

"8cd","10","0","0","16 February 2001"," The power of poetry.
","Every five reviews or so, there is one harsh criticism of the movie bordering on hate. Yet, a look at the review ratings shows that the number of people rating it from 1 to 3 doesn't even represent 5% of the membership. A movie that elicits that kind of labour of hate from a vocal minority must be special. And it sure is. When I first saw it back in December, I was shocked to see the number of older couples in the theatre. This cannot be a kung-fu movie. And it isn't. Comparing it to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan is at best ludicrous, at worst intellectually dishonest. When, fifteen minutes into it, Jen flew over Bo and onto the roof, the realm of reality became blurred with that of dream. When the drums started beating as Shu Lien sprang after Jen, the dream became impossibly real, its rhythm being that of our own heartbeats. There is something magically real about Crouching Tiger: the magic stems not from the ""floating"" but the je ne sais quoi, a haunting mood that only fairy tales and myths can achieve; while the reality stems from the archetypal characters with their universally recognizable feelings of honour and dignity, of betrayal and loss. The human dimension elevates it above and beyond the mere wizardry of the Matrix. Freud wanted to show that myths are dreams conveying outwards expression of repressed emotions. Crouching Tiger is a dream and its balletic physical prowess is but a metaphor for  repressed love and aspiration. No metaphor has ever been so viscerally thrilling. When Li Mu Bai chased after Jen on the treetops of the bamboo forest, we know it is not a physical battle but a deeply spiritual one. The swaying branches, the occasional clash of sword, the meeting of eyes, they all have resonances in the dance of conflicting wills. ""What do you know about a true heart"" said Jen defiantly. The material world is just a backdrop. It is not about reality the same way it is not about the comb. Objects, materialness are to reveal their symbolic significance in the world of myth; and the world of myth is to reveal itself in the bending of the laws of materialness. Crouching Tiger is a transcendant movie and like poetry, it is not for everyone."

I'm especially happy because I saw it on the big screen. Believe me, if you have any desire to see it, see it in a theartre.<br/><br/>
         The film has so many great things going for it. The acting, the story, the love, and how could I forget the action.<br/><br/>
         The acting is very good. Chow Yun Fat delivers a superb performance. I was especially impressed with Rachel Yeoh's performance, she was great. But the biggest surprise for me was that of the young actress who played Jen. She should be a big star in the future.<br/><br/>
         The story is very good. I'm not going into plot details because I'm sure if you're reading this than you know what the plot is. But the story is well put together and shot.<br/><br/>
          The two love stories in the film are very well executed. The unspoken romance betwwen Chow Yun Fat and Rachel Yeoh was very interesting to watch. But the one between Jen and Lo was touching. The scenes in the desert are pretty funny.<br/><br/>
           Now of course how can you talk about the film without talking about the action. The action is so well done I wanted to cry,(not really). The fight scenes are always spectacular. There are I would say five or six big fights in this film. Each one of them is different and interesting. The fight scenes go from them flying around each other and climbing walls like Spider Man, or two woman using countless numbers of weapons, (they all keep breaking). I have been to thousands of movies. And I've never seen an audience stand up and applaud the film in the middle of the scene, they did after the first chase/fight scene.<br/><br/>
            I went with my friend who couldn't quite grasp the fact that this is a fantasy. He liked it but he thought some of the flying got rediculous. But I don't care, it was always awesome. The film has my vote for Best Pic at the Oscars. First it was Gladiator, then Traffic, but I'm sticking to this film. This film is a magical expierince, a must see. 10/10"

","(This might contain some spoilers.)  Okay, so my family and friends think I am nuts for having gone to the theater 6 times for this particular film. Still, no matter how many times I go, I still cannot get enough of it.<br/><br/>No movie has touched me deeply as CROUCHING TIGER did.  And no character has such a tremendous effect on me as Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien did.  I am all praise with Yeoh's performance.  She truly is amazing.  Never had I thought an action queen can deliver such a formidable dramatic performance but she did - beyond expectations.  She made Shu Lien come alive as a woman very much aware of her power and skills yet possessing inner strength and exuding serene, gentle presence.  Yeoh employed subtle approach in her acting yet one can see how her character provides balance and harmony to the movie; how she stands equal to other warriors especially the great Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), her soulmate, and still possess that genteel bearing which, incidentally, drew other men and women to find comfort, refuge and inspiration; how she speaks in humility yet her words carries tremendous insight and great wisdom that counteracts and tempers any impulsiveness exhibited by other characters.  I cannot take my eyes off Yeoh or else I will be missing a smile that's so comforting; or a glitter in her eyes that speaks thousand words; or the dropping of her jaw that conveys inner conflict.  For me, understanding Shu Lien provides a gateway in entering the core of the film and learning about the essence of the ""way"" and, capturing the spirit this film wants to convey.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this is a spiritual movie which Ang Lee has helmed with such care and great attention.  Lee truly establishes himself as a 1st-rate director with a universal heart and spirit, having captured the universal theme of love and yearning, that even though this particular film is set amidst the backdrop of China's Ching Dynasty, manages to speak to everyone spanning generations, race, classes, gender and age.  The cinematography is truly breathtaking and the haunting music simply heightens the emotions that are already there.  Even after the curtain closes, one is haunted by the unforgettable characters that lingers in the heart and mind for days; the gravity-defying martial arts scenes; and the poignant story where one has an impulse to change but after some thoughts, is bound to respectfully leave it as it is.<br/><br/>This is truly a remarkable film I encourage each one not to miss.  A one-time cinematic splendour!"
"seandman","Null","0","0","17 February 2001"," An explanation for those who didn't get it
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based not only on Chinese Mythology, but of Zen as well. Zen is a philosophy that professes that in truth everything is substance, but substance is nothingness, therefore everything is nothingness, and nothingness is everything (This is EXTREMELY basic, but that's the main idea). As such, our goals in this life should be centering the spirit and discovering our nature within the universe. Once we have done this, thus are we enlightened, and we discover how everything before that moment was empty and nothing, and can now move on to purifying the spirit and working towards the next stage of enlightenment. <br/><br/>It's a deep and dense philosophy that takes many people a lifetime to understand and master, and I guarantee a bunch of people who read this will think it's stupid because they weren't raised to think beyond themselves.

","A simple but beautifully told story of love and regret...set against the gorgeous backdrop of China, full of mind-numbing action sequences and the quietly powerful performances of its cast...Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon raises the bar from a mere action movie to a dreamlike fairy tale with characters all too human...despite their superhuman physical abilities.<br/><br/>
A mighty warrior (Yun-Fat) grows weary of his violent life and entrusts his legendary sword to his longtime partner (Yeoh) to safekeep. The sword is stolen, leading the two warriors on a chase to recover it and rescue a rebellious nobleman's daughter from the manipulations of their ancient enemy, Jade Fox. The story strongly illustrates the clash of desire against traditional duty in a culture (in the film) very much different than our own. It shows the destructive potential and loneliness in a life without structure, and at the same time...the emptiness that can come by ignoring your dreams. The movie is gorgeously shot and put together. The choreography in the fight scenes is fantastic...almost dance-like in its beauty. From an action standpoint, it will take your breath away...moving from locale to locale with the rapidness of Star Wars. The cast is talented and performs their parts with all the dignity and wit the story demands.<br/><br/>

Every single shot in the movie is exquisite and a pleasure to look at. Of course, there are the fight scenes. These scenes are some of the most amazing I have ever seen on film; they easily eclipse the work of The Matrix, Woo-ping Yuen's last movie as fight choreographer. The actors move with such grace and fluidity; watching these people do battle is truly poetry.

It's a myth where these warriors fly about with grace and skill. It's a myth where these same warriors do battle to find out what they really are.

"Sunny99","10","0","0","15 February 2001"," Intelligent, subtle movie. Good plot or BAD plot???
","First, I am happy that CT,HD got 10 Oscar nominations.  This fact makes it a lot easier to discuss if this movie has a ""good"" plot or ""bad"" plot.<br/><br/>Although I haven't watched enough movies to say if this is the best movie of the year, still it is indeed a very special, high-quality movie, and well deserve viewing in the big theater.  A movie so special and different really doesn't come to this country too often.<br/><br/>Besides it beautiful scenery and balletic action, most importantly, its plot is intelligent, subtle, and humane...these are what make CTHD stand out far ahead among other Kung-fu or action movies.  Some people argued here saying there were some other better chinese Kung-fu movies, I think they totally missed the point.<br/><br/>We are not talking about Kung-fu movie here, we are talking about a high-quality film, a complete movie experience.  I don't think any ""pure"" Kung-fu movie will ever deserve 10 Oscar nominations (like CTHD), unless it contain this level of emotion, humanity, and intelligence which make it an excellent drama and romance as well.<br/><br/>Don't think the critics are all fools, they liked CTHD because it is very intelligent compared to most movie showing nowadays.  For example, Gladiator is a powerful movie, and very good looking thanks to it high budget. (Gladiator costed 80 millions to make, but Ang Lee only had $15 million to spend on CTHD.)  But taking away the killing and fighting, you don't really remember much from Gladiator.  The story is just straightforward and 99% of people understand it so nobody complains about its plot.<br/><br/>CTHD is very different, it takes some careful efforts and sensitivity to understand the plot completely.  To be honest, I did not fully understand it at my first viewing.  However two of my friends, who are more sensitive and experienced than me in life, told me a different interpretation of the plot and totally enlightened me.  My rating for this movie shooting to 9-10 right away after talking to them.<br/><br/>I am not going to give the clue out here since some reader have not seen this movie yet.  But just my hint: To understand this movie, you need to realize there was a 'hidden, unspoken love' going on.  No, I don't mean the love between Shui-lien and Mu-bai, since even the most insensitive viewer will know they were in love.<br/><br/>It is from someone other than Shui-lien, and supposedly no one else in the movie realize it until it is too late.<br/><br/>This hidden, unspoken, one directional, confused love clue is what make CTHD's plot intelligent, complete, humane and powerful.<br/><br/>If you come out of the movie and feel the plot confusing and inconsistent, you are just like me at first... you missed the important clue that make this movie complete.  You did not see the struggle, confusion, complain and sadness within that character.<br/><br/>If you come out of this movie feel it is intelligent, subtle, touching and complete -- congratulations! you got the right story Ang Lee intended to tell in this intelligent film.<br/><br/>Therefore, I think one can complain CTHD's plot is too subtle, but complaining it has a ""bad plot"" is totally unjustified.  It is a good plot; it just take some intelligence, care and sensitivity to understand it completely.<br/><br/>Should a great movie has straight plot like Gladiator?  or subtle one like Crouching Tiger?  You viewers decide.  But clearly if nobody goes to see CTHD, there will be less and less directors who would bother to give his movie an intelligent plot.  That's definitely something I don't want to see. Therefore, thanks God, Oscar did not disappoint me this time.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is a very special movie. Go see it in the big screen before it is too late!<br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10"

","Predictable when it wasn't bizarre.  The floating and flying were too much, even if it were a cartoon.  None of the characters were real.  The scenes in the desert were plunked down in the middle of the film.  This was the only real character development in the film, and it lasted too long and it happened too abruptly, and it wasn't particularly good or even necessary. There wasn't enough focus on the relationship between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien.  Not a particularly good film, but plenty of people may be self-impressed because they saw a foreign film and maybe some people think non-stop miraculous feats make a good movie."

","You know what I find so appropriate about the title of this film? It has managed to stay hidden in the background from critic eyes and yet it literally crouched up onto the competition and take everyone by surprise at the last minute. If you look at all the films selected for Oscar nominations, every one of them has been playing in the theatres for a long time or has been a major box office hit. The only film that is remotely similar in feel is Chocolat and at best it is a long shot to win Best Picture. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came onto the seen not too long ago and not with a lot of marketing hype and yet it has managed to garner the second most Oscar nominations next to the goliath film, Gladiator. This alone should say a lot about the film but if you want more, just ask anyone who has seen the film. Chances are they will say they liked it.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a martial arts film despite popular belief. There is martial arts in it but it is not a martial arts film. The movie is about love, honor and loyalty. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a legendary warrior and the guardian of a powerful sword. In preparation to retire from military life Bai decides to put the sword in the protection of a governor. Intertwined with this storyline is Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Bai's long time friend. The audience is allowed a glimpse of the underlying love that exists between the two but an archenemy, Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) complicates life by trying to steal the sword. To help her is her apprentice Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) who we find has a history of her own. The film revolves around the sisterly relationship that develops between Lien and Yu but the director (Ang Lee) lets us see the love stories that revolve each of these characters. If it sounds like a complicated storyline, I apologize but Lee has been able to tell it beautifully and has also done what few directors dared to do: make women the strong central characters.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautifully shot. The audience is given a sense of the magic about the land and the history behind it. The fight scenes are more of dance sequences than pure fights and I have to say they are quite dazzling. Although for many, the wirework will be a little hard to get used to, it is integral to the feel of the film. For those who think that the wirework was a bit far fetched, keep in mind that this is a fable. Nothing about it is meant to be real and don't forget, nothing about Matrix was real either but to use state of the art special effects on a film like this would only take away from the story. I've been watching films like these all my life and I can say wirework has always been a part of films like these.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film but for you hardcore critics out there, if you look for flaws, you will see them whether they're really there or not. Take this film for what it was meant to bea story about a legend, inner strength and undeniable honor."

I have seen much more fantastic action style in Hong Kong's WuXia movies. But this one is really different. Wu Hu Zang Long have much more depth than other traditional Wuxia movies. And the fighting style is very clean and beautiful. I found it very interesting to combine the elements of Taiwan's arty films with Hong Kong's WuXia style. It is Better than my expectation. It's also a very  good indroduction to chinese traditional WuXia movies (usually based on famous WuXia novel,such as ""King Uing"" series). But I'm very worried about the translation to English.

","Though I have seen many movies of the wuxia genre (think of it as the Chinese old west with some historical significances thrown in from time to time), I have somehow grasp the human drama for the first time.  Behind all the great fighting sequences and posturing between two great warriors in a duel, the wuxia genre is always dramatic, noble  and tragic.  Yes, the fight is always between good and evil. The choice between our young heroine's responsibility to her family and her personal desires are embodied in the magical sword as the means to her freedom to choose. As the master Liu Mui Bai tries to teach her that the power of the sword resonates only thru the righteous owner that uses it with discipline.  Whatever virtues one might be able to draw from such analogies, the story always contain a moral.<br/><br/>Because wuxia always contain characters that struggles with those sins, the battle, therefore, is always between the good and evil.  Indeed, the movie does apologizes for itself in the over-exagerated martial arts in a scene where Michelle Yeoh explains a heroes code of ethic to the young Jen. The fighting action sequences serves as eye candy but a good wuxia movie will always explore the main character's development as a human being to capture the audiences' endearment in a dramatic fashion.<br/><br/>The moral of the story is not hard to grasp.  Much like the comic book hero Spiderman when he discovered his powers that ""With great powers comes great responsibilities"" which was only realized after the death of his uncle Ben. Thus, only thru tragic turns of events can the person learn the consequences of his/her wicked ways and that is the main point.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon should open up the wuxia genre to the American audience by a recognized director Ang Lee.  I don't think this film is a masterpiece because it is not a timepiece of the human condition.  This is a good action drama that might open the floodgate to already made wuxia movies much like the re-released Jackie Chan flicks."
"MovieAlien","Null","0","0","14 February 2001"," A big letdown!
","While this isn't a bad movie, it certainly is not the GREAT movie like what everyone says.  Calling this the ""best movie ever made"" is a mega hyperbole.<br/><br/> Let me start off with the story; (no spoilers) Yun Fat and Yeoh must retrieve a stolen sword from this female fighter gone awry; the co-protagonist is a young woman who is trapped between two sides and doesn't seem to identify with anyone. (The finale, which I won't give away, shows her personal decision as a result of this identity crisis.) Mr. Lee could have been a little more complex with the story, which has been done better in countless other films. Maybe I'm not a stickler for love stories, but the interpersonal relationships here just didn't interest me.<br/><br/> The editing wasn't very good. (For example, you see someone at one place, and then it abrubtly cuts to another location. Where are we?) The sound FX editing could have used some work (During the rooftop ""traffic scenes"" you can't hear even the slightest sounds on the pavement. If this was on purpose, it wasn't realistic.)<br/><br/> There's validity in the claim that the chop-sockey sequences were excellent. (They used wires and then digitally erased them to give the effect of some airborne martial arts moves.) But I don't think any of the sparring scenes redeem the movie as a whole.<br/><br/> I'm not surprised that this and Gladiator (A gladiator named Maximus never actually existed!) got several Oscar Nominations, including for best picture, and I won't be surprised if either one of them wins.<br/><br/> Just remember, the Academy chooses the winner for Best Picture of the year, just as the courts choose which politician won an election.

As you can imagine I was expecting something revolutionary. When the first fight/chase scene started I was enraged. I turned to her and said ""This is a Kung Fu film!!!"" She told me to stop being such an art-house snob. So I did, and what I discovered was a truly beautiful piece of film.<br/><br/>Wo hu zang long is a lush, fantastic thing to behold. Ang Lee has truly outdone himself, and Peter Pau has created such a rich visual texture for the story to unfold within. This is one of the few movies I'd like to see without subtitles just so I can concentrate on the visuals.<br/><br/>When I finally cast all prejudices aside, the fight scenes were mesmerizing. The scenes of the cast flying across the rooftops and in the trees were so subtle and light. In fact all of the special effects were so light handed you almost missed them. I've heard some comparisons to The Matrix for some reason and I do not agree. I think The Matrix was too thick with effects. This movie, like Asian culture, strikes a balance between the subtle and the sublime.<br/><br/>The story was broad in scope, shifting between a love story and a battle between good and evil.

","What's the big deal about this movie?  All I can think is that because it was an art-house movie, art-house viewers were blown away by a movie that was more exciting than watching paint dry.  Yes, it has great fight choreography, beautiful scenery and great cinematography.  No doubt it should win an award for best cinematography.  Best picture?  I don't think so.  Nor should its screenplay be up for best adapted screenplay.  There is not much dialogue, which is only to be expected when about seventy per cent of the movie is fight scenes. Plot?  That's pretty minimal, as well. Basically, the plot is: girl steals sword, fights people, brings it back, takes again, and the good guys chase her and catch and there's a big fight scene.  There is little to no character development.  All the characters are pretty much stock characters who don't really change or grow.  Mostly they just have big fights.  First you have the wise teacher/fighter (Obi Wan Kenobi, anyone), then you have the young, enthusiastic and highly skilled, but impulsive and often wrong-headed neophyte (read Luke Skywalker and countless westerns), the embittered evil villain who is extremely skillful, too (Darth Vader), and, of course, the charming, cute renegade good guy, here the Mongol raider, Han Solo in Star Wars. To be kind, I guess we can call these arch-types.  The motivations of the main character, whose name seemed to be Jen according to the sub-titles but sounded like something else entirely when they said it, were unclear, other than to set up another fight scene.  Why does she want to stay with this guy in the desert, but then goes back, but then refuses to marry him when he comes for her, but then runs away that same night.  And why does she want this sword?  Especially the second time.  The fights are balletic, and I did enjoy the huge sword vs. every other weapon in the arsenal scene between the two women, but I found the flying scenes and the bouncing around in the treetops scene more silly than either exciting or pretty.  The actors are good actors, I think. Michelle Yeoh has a beautifully expressive face.  But, again, mostly what they do is martial arts, and great martial arts isn't the same as great acting."

","This is the best film I have seen so far this year. I went in expecting kung fu action, but not the involving story which I enjoyed just as much as the amazing fight scenes.<br/><br/>There is a romantic story set in the middle of this film between the two younger characters when they first meet, which I felt was a tad over-long. I thought the love-you feelings between the two 'wandering warriors' was much more believable. Not being a fan of romance, I found this very sweet never the less. For some movie-watchers, they will be very disappointed with this, because despite the chemistry between characters, you never see nudity or sex scenes (!)<br/><br/>The kung fu battles were amongst the best I've ever seen! The 'flying martial arts fighters' gave the fights a new perspective! Reading the reviews, I'm surprised at the number of people who couldn't accept the abilities of the flying fighters. These would be the individuals who will happily accept Tom Cruise sliding alongside his speeding motorcycle on his non-smoking shoes while successfully shooting the bad guys and performing the sloppiest stunts (Mission Impossible 2). <br/><br/>Those who go in expecting to see a Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan flick will be disappointed. This film is also sub titled. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION? Beautiful scenery! I will probably watch this film again!"

Zhang Ziyi is one of the most beautiful oriental girls i've ever seen, and the way she performs all the fight secuences develops a dancing effect that i've never seen before. It's not that it never existed, it's just that it's almost romantic. I think of it as the way Leon (The Professional) kills, so sadly. Gee, this flick has it all. Outrageous photography, breathtaking fight scenes, amazing landscapes, real romance and great acting from all the leads. I was impressed by the way this movie came to me from the screen.

","I grew up in Taiwan and now live in the US for almost 20 years.  I loved the wuxia movies in childhood which were much different than the Jackie Chan's comic Kung-Fu movies.  The old style wuxia typically had a plot more interesting than the Jackie style and lots of times based on the wuxia novels.  It's in a way like the western style science fictions with people doing unbelieveable things such as tumbling against gravity, or with special power.  As long as it's within the context of the plot, there's nothing wrong with it in my opinion.<br/><br/>There are so many classic wuxia movies by the diseased director King Wu that someone should put them all in a huge DVD collection for a broader audience here in the U.S.  In a way director Ang Lee did not create the wuxia style movie, he just introduced to the U.S. audience what have been deemed an art some long time ago already in a far away place.<br/><br/>I am excited that what this movie would revive the interest in wuxia and with modern technology in movie making, I wouldn't mind seeing more bamboo tree top fights as long as it's beautifully choreographed."

"behester","Null","0","0","11 February 2001"," The film that will be remembered from the year
","I've just read a good sample of reader reviews and I would only note that this film generates passions on both sides. A sign of greatness? Perhaps.<br/><br/>I believe this is a great AND unique film.  Although grounded in a martial arts genre that has been popular for years in Asia, it transcends its sources. All Great (or to borrow a term from literary critic Harold Bloom) Strong films ride the delicate tension between homage and originality : those that claim jackie chan movies are really better remind me of musical purists who criticize,let's say Elvis or the Beatles for pirating the genuine contributions of others--unable or unwilling to acknowledge the important syntheses of styles these artists represent(great artist don't rob, they steal, right?). Does this film belong in the Top Ten? Who knows? I would argue that such ratings, while conducive to cocktail debates, are at best problematic and at worst inimical to any thoughtful understanding of film. To argue, for instance, that the Godfather or Citizen Kane is the greater film is reminiscent of those abstruse medieval debates concerning the number of angels dancing on the head of a pin. So back to the film in question: I believe Crouching Tiger (and this is a statement of faith, subject to invalidation by the Unknown Future)will be essential to the discussion of films of the early 2000s because it represents as well as anything I've seen in media the newly emerging sycretism of east and west in global culture.  Crouching Tiger may be viewed as a landmark in weaving disparate cultural traditions into a satisfying and intelligible global lingua franca. A film like CTHD could not have been made before the wide dispersal (due I suppose in part to the sorts of technology we are using to have this very ediscusssion) of formerly isolated genres.  The cross-pollination that CTHD represents will only widen in the future.  There is, of course, a fair amount of anxiety and dread associated with such a process. This, as much as any particular strength of the film (and there are many, will make CTHD essential to any meaningful discussion of cinema in the early 2000s.  That, my friends, is a useful definition of greatness. But that's just my opinion."

Next to that there was of course the excellent martial arts choreography and rope work one expects from this kind of movie, but here it was a mere part of the whole movie.

","So many people have complained about the flying, and unfortunately I have to agree with them. There needs to have been an emotional connection made between the flying and the story.  This emotional connection is called meaning.  To expect us to accept that Wudan fly without creating a context in which they might seems rather careless.<br/><br/>The non-flying fight scenes were not filmed well, most of the time only the end of a sequence was actually captured, leaving most of the action out of focus.  I understand that their movements were quick, but were supposed to have been invisible as well?  Maybe that is another talent inherent to the Wudan.<br/><br/>The love story between Fat and Yeoh was notably strong, noble, and timeless. In contrast, the love story between the younger characters was unfocused, often long-winded, and relied on steamy bath scenes and skin. By the end of the movie, however, I thoroughly enjoyed Jen's character. She was the center of the desperate passions that swirled throughout this movie, and the passions are what nearly make this a great movie. 7/10"

","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is truly aesthetic from multiple perspectives, genuinely deserving of a 10/10 rating.  I can rave about the fight scenes, the cast, the love stories, the cinematography, the music, etc., but i'll only be repeating what so many have already iterated here in their posts. I shall therefore only state those parts of the movie that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>First, am I the only one here who loved the character, Jade Fox? Masterfully portrayed by Cheng Pei Pei, I felt she was the richest, most intriguing character in the movie.  She is wicked, feared, manipulative, flawed, fierce yet cowardly at times, and a great fighter that is also not above resorting to anything to win.  She is not invincible like Li Mu Bai, noble like Shu Lien, or breathtakingly beautiful like Jiao Long (Jen).  In other words, she is the most ""down to earth"" warrior of the four.  I was thrilled by her first fight scene where we get a glimpse of her past and her motivations.  I would have liked to see a longer final conflict between her and Li Mu Bai in the end, but I felt it was appropriately short, given that they were not the main two characters and that their conflict was not the main plot.  I have to add, I just loved her facial expressions!<br/><br/>I was moved by the final love scene (if you can call dying a love scene) when Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien actually embrace.  I am usually not a big fan of I-love-you, I-love-you-too moments.  However, I felt this scene had just the right touch to express the deep love and passion between the two, without crossing over into the realm of nauseating, sappy, drawn-out, or over-acting.<br/><br/>Despite the superficial rantings of others about the ""flying,"" I felt it was a necessary element in this movie to reflect the fact that this is a folk-lore told in the spirit of bards that so often exaggerate the abilities of the heroes.  Get over it people!<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Jen's relentless pursuit of her comb as a display of her overwhelming ego and inability to admit defeat.  She always has to have the last word, and will never let anyone get the upper hand.<br/><br/>The restaurant scene was a terrific parody of the traditional kung-fu movies that so often had fighters with long-winded names, bizarre and imaginative weapons, and inexplicable desires to start fights for little reason.  Of course, there was the kung-fu monk, the monk!  I was thrilled to no end to see Jen giving them all a sound beating - a delightful way for this movie to trounce the old kung-fu flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was perfect.  I would have been furious if Jen had arrived with the antidote in time to save Li Mu Bai, and they all lived happily ever after...."
"Jodecaspe","10","0","0","10 February 2001"," Not just a Kung Fu Movie...But an Exceptional Film
","I would like to start by clearing up one misconception about CTHD:<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A KUNG FU MOVIE!!<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has episodes of kung fu in it, but it doesn't necessarily make it a kung fu movie.  The kung fu serves as a generator to the movie, a backdrop.  Comparing this movie to the movies of Jackie Chan and Jet Li as I have read in some of the comments is absolutely ridiculous.  Those movies aren't even in the same class as this movie.  One user wrote that Yun-Fat Chow shouldn't have even been casted in this movie because he isn't a Martial Arts expert. Well, that goes to show you, that this movie isn't just about martial arts, this movie has much more substance than just fight scenes.  I am sure if it was intended as Kung Fu movie Jet Li would have probably been cast, and I am sure Ang Lee would have not directed it, and this would have been a totally different film, a kung fu film.  Yun-Fat Chow was casted in this movie because he is an exceptional actor as is Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang.<br/><br/>If you go to the theater thinking you are going to see only a kung fu movie, you will be seriously disappointed and you are misinformed.  If you go see this movie for poetic dialogue, incredible cinematography, a moving score, superb acting, a subtle yet undeniable love story, and yes, incredible fight scenes that are in place, then you will enjoy CTHD.<br/><br/>In regard to all the negative comments about the ""flying people"" as some of you have put it.  This isn't anymore ridiculous than say James Bond jumping out of a plane without a parachute and surviving somehow or Arnold gunning down 30 men armed with automatic weapons with two hand guns. This is the movies, not real life, if I wanted a dose of reality I would hang out on the street corner and watch life unfold in front of me.  This movie is a fantasy set in an ancient time, fantasy movies shouldn't only occur in the future. We go to the movies to be dazzled, amazed, astonished, enlighten and moved. These are the qualities that I found CTHD to contain.  Definitely, one of my all time favorites. Highly recommended."

","CTHD is probably the best movie I've ever seen.  This is one of those movies that truly grabs you're heart.  After walking out of that theater, I already committed myself on seeing it again.  This movie contains so much symbolism and I believe it takes more than viewing it once to appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece.  I must admit I never felt this way about a movie before.  To me, it feels like any other movie that I will watch in the future after seeing CTHD will totally suck (hehe). Everything in the movie was just perfect; superb cinematography, magnificent choreography, well casted, awesome soundtrack (I wanted to cry after hearing the song played at the end), breathtaking scenery, a great director (Ang Lee), and a well-written plot.  Basically a wonderful love/romance/trust/betrayal/justice/revenge foreign film.<br/><br/>I overheard some of my classmate's comments on CTHD.  Some believe that the subtitles were boring, hard to watch, a hassle to read and made the movie stupid.  Well this is what I had to say for them.  ""First of all, how slow do you read? I mean they tried to keep the sentences to 1 or 2 so it's easy for people to read, and they also show the subtitle ahead of time.  If CTHD was dubbed in English, well that would just ruin the movie.  I really think it was a good idea to keep the movie in Mandarin to keep its uniqueness. Wouldn't the movie look like one of those old Chinese movies where they talk and the words come out a minute later?  If the movie was also dubbed, the actor's tone of voice and expressions of the words will change, and will lose their significance in the movie.  The subtitles were poetry themselves, and some words in Mandarin can't be accurately translated in English.  For example, a word in Mandarin can sound so engaging, while in English it's just like an ordinary word"".<br/><br/>Many may also believe that the ""flying"" was so unrealistic and the fighting scenes were so stupid that people laughed.  Well how about X-Men, Superman, Batman, Matrix, they didn't complain about the flying on those movie did they?  All of these Hollywood movies are fantasies and we accept that. But why is it when Chinese makes their version of a fantasy movie (that includes flying) people criticize it?  I believe these people should open up their selves to seeing idea from different culture.  Because this movie is not from ""Hollywood"", you can't assume that it's stupid.  I've read that audience from some theater laughed at the fighting scenes.  I have no idea why, but my only conclusion is that they probably haven't been exposed to any sort of martial arts, and they probably think that those fighting scenes were a chicken dance.  The fighting choreography in this movie is superb. I've seen so many martial arts movie, but not as superior as this one.<br/><br/>This movie is so good and was definitely worth every bit of the 7 bucks that I paid, and perhaps another 7 bucks for another viewing.  It only happens once in a great while, where a movie can just grab you and just wont let you go, and CTHD can absolutely do that.  Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie go see it, and if you had, go see it again!"

This movie is nothing compared to greats such as the Godfather and the Shawshank Redemption.  The only thing this movie has going for it is the beautiful cinematography and great choreography.  China is a magnificent country and its splendor is really well shown in this movie. Also, the fight scenes here make The Matrix look like it was shot in the backyard with an 8mm camera.  The people are actually fighting and trying out different moves rather than trying to clap hands (which is what it often looks like in The Matrix).<br/><br/>However, the good things end there.  The plot is rather convoluted (some small SPOILERS coming up).  A great warrior decides to give up fighting, gives away his sword which is stolen, then recovered, then stolen again, and recovered again.  Along the way we meet a girl who doesn't want to get married because she loves someone she met in the desert.  Not overly remarkable.  According to David Mamet, a movie must rest on plot. Cinematography is a plus, but not essential.  The test for a great movie is if you could close your eyes and listen to it, would you still like it? This movie fails that simple test.

However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.<br/><br/>The story begins where Chow Yun Fat (some of the movie names are hard to remember) is telling Michelle Yeoh how he's giving the Green Destiny (a really nifty sword that's extremely powerful) to Sir Te, who lives in Peking. So Michelle takes it to Sir Te and meets Governor Yu's daughter, Jen, who is about to marry by arrangement, not by choice, which she's not too happy about. But then the Green Destiny is stolen by one of Jade Fox's (she's a criminal that a lot of people are after) assistants, and now Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are trying to get it back while also dealing with Jen and her rebellious ways.<br/><br/>The story was good, and so was the dialogue. But it's not worthy of any screenplay awards or anything. It wasn't really good at keying with you like the dialogue in films like ""Traffic"" or other emotional tappers.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and the players of Jen, Sir Te, and Jade Fox all gave great performances. My personal favorite was Lo, Jen's secret lover. While he didn't have the biggest role, he added some comic relief to the movie and the actor who portrayed him gave Lo a sense of charm and politeness behind his somewhat ""rebel"" ways.<br/><br/>This was a cinematic beauty. The special effects were breathtaking, the music was wonderful, and the camera placements were well-done. It ranks up there on my list of cinematic greats, along with films like ""Traffic"" and ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>This was certainly one of the year's best.

The editing, the cuts between the shots were well done, but the transitions between scenes themselves could have been improved. The movement of the cameras can't just all of a sudden change because of a scene change.

Like a classic Greek tragedy, our hero and heroines are prevented from true happiness because of some flaw. The male lead, Li Mu Bai, is an almost supernatural warrior, but yet his deepest desire for love and happiness is prevented by his own sense of honor. He has a chance to turn away from his `green destiny' but he cannot. The young nobleman's daughter, wishes to be a great warrior rather than a housewife but her own angry and arrogance prevents her from her only chance and in the end, she knows it. When all is done, only those who realize that they can never get true happiness or those too naïve will be able to survive. This is a provocative story will surprise many people who are not used to seeing such concepts in a film."

","[I comment the ending in this review and some people might consider it to be a SPOILER]<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon did not live up to my expectations, but then my expectations were higher than usual and that was perhaps unfair to the film. Don't get me wrong; CTHD is a good film, but not the masterpiece I thought I was going to see at the cinema today. But the film is beautiful: great cinematography, fantastic choreographed fight scenes, stunning scenery, and a brilliant score. I have to say that for me the high point of the film was the desert romance, it was romantic and rather amusing as well, and who wouldn't fall in love with a man like Lo (Chen Chang), I wonder? Funny, charming, handsome Well, anyway, it's a great love story. I also think the ending is perfect, sad but beautiful. Not Ang Lee's best, but he's certainly an accomplished director. (7/10)"

Now experience is that such enthusiasm for a film - that isn't from the USA, (where hype comes as standard), or from the UK, (where local reviewers are just pleased to see anything!) - is justification for an early view before the art houses file their prints away in the ""no-one came"" drawer.<br/><br/>Well!

Michelle Yeoh & Ziyi Zhang; and let's not forget - Ang Lee.  I'll admit it.  Fifteen minutes into the film I nearly stood up and applauded the first roof top fight sequence.  It was that good!

","I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, mainly because of all the rave reviews it got in all the press out there. But to my astonishment I was very disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (CTHD) is pretending to be this very deep and philosophical fairytale about Jedi Knight-like warriors who transcend earthly bonds and jump around like they can fly. The best one of this pack, a role by Chow Yun Fat, is sick and tired of his warrior existence and decides to quit and give his sword, Sword of the Green Something, to some official in Peking and call it quits. But there we have his arch enemy, Jade Hyena, who killed his master and who has trained an apprentice. This apprentice, Jen, played to excellence by Ziyi Zhang, has her eye set on the sword to become the next greatest Wudan (the order) big-shot. Along the way there are some love-interests played out, but these just take way to long.<br/><br/>All in all a nice premise for a fantasy fairy-tale set in China. Unfortunately director Ang Lee chose to keep the pace a little too slow. In many scenes I was bored out of my skull and I even fell asleep regularly during the whole desert sequence, I'm sorry. The acting was good enough from some people to not annoy me. It was nice to see Chow Yun Fat return to his native language, as was Michelle Yeoh, who by the way made no particular impression on me. Fat's death in the end made no impact at all on me, as was the totally incomprehensible ending, what was up with that?<br/><br/>The real merit for this movie goes out to the production designer. Timmy Yip did a great job of creating wonderful settings and decors. The costume design was great as well. Props also. There was nothing wrong with these elements. The fight scenes was very well choreographed, but they could have been a little bit less long. They seemed sometimes to go on and on without really going anywhere. The fact that the Wodan warriors had the ability to fly didn't make me like the movie more, on the contrary, it distracted me from the actual fighting going on. In The Matrix this type of choreography for fight scenes was perfectly in place, it was right on target given the surroundings. But in this movie it was just too much over the top. One more thing, shouldn't swords be just a little more rigid as opposed to what the swords looked like in this movie. They looked like they could bend and crease very easily.<br/><br/>I must be invoking just everybody's wrath by now, and before people start trying to kill me for beating down on this supposed gem, I'm gonna quit this review. I award this a 7 just for the production design.<br/><br/>7/10"

The story is fictional and adapted from a fantasy book.  By the way, it should be nominated for best adapted screenplay.  Anyways, the reason they can fly is that they have mastered marital arts so much they can even defy gravity.  If you notice, only 4 characters in the movie can fly.  It's a fairy tale, not real a life true story.<br/><br/>Ending:  Jen did not die at the end.  At first I didn't understand it either.  If you see the movie again it's pretty clear that she didn't die. Also, this movie was adapted from the fourth installment of a five book series.  Jen I believe is the main character in the fifth book.  By the way, a prequel and a sequel is in the works.<br/><br/>Why couldn't she fly to get the antidote:  Because she almost drowned and then was drugged by Jade Fox and couldn't even lift her sword.  How the heck could she fly?<br/><br/>If you critics watch the movie over again you will realize much of the flaws are contrived in your head and don't understand the movie.  There are only minor flaws in this movie just like any great movie.

Beautifully shot, well-acted, well-choreographed, Wo Hu Zang Long stands as a cinematic thing of beauty; still, I thought the plot was very thin (many of you have summed it up in few words), it's characters placed in a very secondary position. For example, Yun-Fat Chow's role was more implicit than anything else- how little we've learned about the history of his character; how little exposure we were allowed of his life.

Overall, yes, an entertaining movie... ...but, it has a luandry list of faults.  <br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat never really fights in the movie, even though he's the quintessential warrior of his generation.  Why is this?  Because Chow Yun Fat doesn't know martial arts.  Do I hate Chow Yun Fat?  No, I like him a great deal.  Do I think a great Kung Fu movie ought to star someone who knows Kung Fu?  YES!<br/><br/>The plot is all over the place, the importance of the sword is built up a great deal at the beginning, and then its forgotten about until the end when its given some passing consideration before being forgotten again. <br/><br/>
I realize that flying over the tops of trees is a legitimate style of Hong Kong action flick, but it still left me a little cold.  The actual fighting was cool, but I could have done without the Mary Poppins stuff.  *SPOILER ALERT* At least until the end, when the young warrior girl needed a horse to go get an antidote instead of just flying there.<br/><br/>The reunion of the two younger lovers was completely unrealistic.  Her reaction to him made me wonder if I had missed something that happened between them before they were separated.<br/><br/>Sure, some of these are nitpicking and personal preference issues.  But some of them are legitimate flaws.  This is not a perfect movie as everyone seems to be suggesting.

"Terrapin-2","10","0","0","7 February 2001"," A response to criticism of a great film
","There seems to be a real division among the reviews of this film.  I think this is only natural when you're dealing with a film which extends it's reach in a few different directions.  I believe this to be a case of exposure (or lack thereof) by factions of the global audience to a truly new kind of film.<br/><br/>Firstly, you have your hardcore Hong Kong action crowd who were weaned on Jackie Chan, John Woo, and Jet Li.  This crowd is offended by what appears to be lack-luster action scenes and what would be considered slow, overly emotional narrative.  Considering the action was choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping  (one of HK's most revered martial arts directors), I'm a bit confused by the first criticism.  I can only assume that there may be an issue with the cinematography of the action itself, which is given a less traditional treatment by Ang Lee (probably for the benefit of the Western audience) replete with slow-motion close-ups and unorthodox camera angles. I personally found this very refreshing, and felt it added some real drama to the fight scenes (especially the Zhang Ziyi/Michelle Yeoh showdown in the compound).  As for the emotional timbre of the film, I can also understand how this may be less than palatable for a traditional HK crowd.  Normally, there is simply no room in an action flick for real character development on this level.  It could be construed as extraneous, detracting from what this audience wants - some serious ass-kicking!<br/><br/>Much of the criticism from the North American audience seems to stem from grievous ignorance of the Western martial arts genre.  I find this most disturbing since, even if one had never seen people ""fly"" while running or fighting, it is this very aspect of the film that creates the sense of fantasy.  This type of action is so organic, so rooted in our basic human fantasy for flight, to dismiss it as comedic or unrealistic is nonsensical and just shows how insular the average North American filmgoer is.  It's a crime that a Western audience can laud a metallic, anesthetic action flick like THE MATRIX, and completely miss the boat on something totally refreshing.  Don't get me wrong, I loved THE MATRIX, I just find the dichotomy ironic.<br/><br/>I was one of the lucky few that got to catch this back in September 2000 at the Toronto Film Festival, with Ang Lee and James Schamus in attendance. It is the first time I've ever seen a festival gala audience give a truly genuine standing ovation after the house lights came on.  Ang Lee deserves similar accolades here (and on Oscar night) for bravely and successfully spanning several vastly disparate cinematic worlds."

This movie is more slow paced compared to other martial arts movies  dated back since 1980-s.

It seems to parody all those great kung-fu classics, and would be more suited to a film that does. And before you ask, I felt the same thing in the Matrix. The stunts unfortunately detracts one's attention too much from the story. People leave the theatre talking of the stunts and not of the story, which is a real shame. The plot could have been slightly better executed, and with a better put together screenplay, where the story flowed a bit more, it certainly could be classified as an all-time classic.

And a little gore. There is unexpected humor. But what carries the day amidst all this flash are the human stories. Two. maybe three (depending how you feel about the Jade Fox subplot), love stories are played out around the action plot. That action plot, which involves a missing mystical sword and a few revenge motiffs is nothing special. But its intertwining with the love stories really lift this movie into a special category.

Crouching Tiger (Or Wo hu zang long) is the fairy tale equivalent of the Matrix. Just as Matrix operates within sci-fi conventions, this film operates within Wudan principles. If you aren't prepared to accept the conventions of this film (ie the flying), you won't enjoy it. I myself was totally immersed in a film of pure character. Each fight sequence has an emotional level beyond the powerful choreography of The Matrix. Unlike MI2, this advances flo mo rather than using it as another cinematic device. Okay, for some it will be overlong, but the film for me goes beyond typical film ideas. In the words of  Mr Glass, ""This is art!"""

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a visually stunning, overwhelmingly powerful achievement that dwarfs any other film made in the year of 2000. Its combination of dazzling fight scenes and early-Hollywood style romance eclipses anything else this year. This is a film of epic proportions, without the oppressive running time of your usual epic film (this clocks in only at 2 hours and 8 minutes). The performances of the film's lead actors are so heartfelt that subtitles aren't even necessary -- the characters' thoughts and feelings are evident on their faces.

","I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" knowing little about the film other than that it had received consistently glowing reviews.

Ang Lee brings experienced cinematography, understanding of dramatic construction and solid film-making to the martial arts genre, with mostly splendid results.<br/><br/>There are times, however, where this blend showed signs of weakness; suspension of disbelief was sorely challenged by several flying sequences not supported well either by the storyline nor by the rather paltry special-effects budget. Additionally, the silliness of a few sequences (including the bar scene paying homage to old Westerns) seemed out of place.<br/><br/>It is not the best martial arts film ever, but the choreography is fantastic (that the choreographer also worked on <i>The Matrix </i> comes as no surprise). It's not the most unique or complex storyline, but the characters and plot are unquestionably richer than standard action fare.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a worthwhile watch for any type of moviegoer, but a few issues here and there keep this film just a notch below greatness: 8/10."

So I was interested but not overly so when we decided to see this movie because of the subtitles.<br/><br/>I left the theatre two hours later with tears streaming down my face, my voice cracking, the hauntingly beautiful Yo Yo Ma-performed score emblazened in my musical mind, and planning to see it a second time in the near future.<br/><br/>In short...I know now what I will be rooting for come Oscar night. I am one of simple movie tastes...check out other reviews I have here for the variety I normally tend to see. But I had heard nothing but good to fantastic word of mouth about this movie, and I finally gave in to my fiancee's pleas to see it, and I am so very glad I did.<br/><br/>From the first moment of the movie, the cinematography is amazing. And while the subtitles were made a bit more annoying in the first few moments by a doofus sitting directly behind us reading them aloud (then laughing!) for his 3 under-ten children (thankfully they left before the  movie was even half over), I found myself unconcerned by them in the first few moments.<br/><br/>This is NOT a movie to see if you cannot accept it as what it is. It is a lavishly produced fairy tale, not your average ""chopsaki"" movie. It is thoughtful in presenation, it's fight choreographer deserves a lapful of awards (although the wire flying was a bit annoying at times) and it's story presented matter-of-fact without any gloss or hype surrounding it.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought the scenes between the two young leads in the desert were the best in terms of action and dialogue. They had a chemistry that truly only comes off well in this sequence, and the director's execution of this entire series of sequences left me totally mesmerized.<br/><br/>For a guy like me, who used to rank stuff like ""Encino Man"" and ""The Karate Kid"" as his two favorite movies of all time. to like a movie like this is a bit beyond comprehension. But I didn't like it...I LOVED IT. And it now resides atop my list of my all time favorite movies. And if you can fly in an adult-oriented, chinese ""Peter Pan"" fairy tale, you too will be absolutely won over.<br/><br/>On My 1 to 5 scale......CTHD gets a 5+! A definate DVD keeper!

Why was it ridiculous and 'nonsense'? Was it not ridiculous to have people flying around and avoiding bullets in The Matrix?  ""But it's a fantasy"", they cry.  Well so is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon!  It's an old Chinese folk tale.  That's how they used to be and that's how it is still now.  In the West, we've endured Greek mythological films, big gorilla's climbing up buildings, supermen in tights, and muscle men taking rocket armed armies with a pistol.  An old Chinese fable gets told and we're laughing as if it's 'ridiculous'.  It's time for those who laughed to slap themselves and realise that they are the ones being ridiculous.<br/><br/>The film was brilliant and true to what Chinese culture is.

","To my experience there is a simple but quite reliable rule, when a new film surprisingly gets many enthusiastic, but even more moderate and almost no totally bad reviews. And the rule is: trust the moderate ones ... - which applies very well to CTHD.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is, that it's reputation of being awesome and extraordinary isn't due to it's genuine qualities (neither from the viewpoint of filmmaking, nor considering the plot or acting or fighting) but mostly stems from a) the current 'Zeitgeist' (meaning: the time was just ripe for it, since Martial Arts finally is losing it's ghetto smell in Hollywood), b) the important Ang-Lee-being-the-director art bonus and c) the obvious fact, that the greatest part of the audience (in western culture) hasn't got any material to compare it with.<br/><br/>CTHD is a good film and I really enjoyed watching it (and, like many other reviewers here was very annoyed when certain nitwits among the audience started to giggle about the flying sequences). But it definitely is no _great_ film, since it doesn't deliver something new or unseen (like, e.g. 'The Matrix' did), and also doesn't show something old and familiar from a totally new and original point of view. It simply was made in the good tradition of the King Hu / Hsu Feng films - but unfortunately without setting new standards.

There is too much action in it and many  incredible scenes where fighters fly in the air. It wouldn't have annoyed me if the plot itself were interesting. Even that was not interesting for me since the movie was concentrating on these fight scenes and irrelevant love stories in a Chinese background. The most of the plot is typically from Hollywood. Nevertheless it did not have a happy end which made it deviate from the Â‘normal' plots. Anyhow I was not really able to understand this end! I was disappointed this time from the director since I saw other brilliant of his works like `Eat drink, man woman'. The photography was good especially showing the beauty of the nature in China.

","This movie's a disappointment.  Having being weaned from a diet of Chinese martial arts movies ever since I could count, CTHD is _not_ Eastern.  It's made for the western audience with an Asian fantasy.<br/><br/>CTHD is not without merit though.  Its cinematography of hilly landscapes and waterfalls are characteristic of chinese paintings.  The music composition is beautiful too as I remember (Kudos to Tan Dun and Yo-yo Ma). Its predominantly Chinese cast and crew also bring prominence to some of the most talented yet under-represented performers on the global stage.  Its swordplay is interesting enough for the first 2 takes however, but when Chow starts flying atop lithe bamboo forests for the 27th sword-fighting scene, boredom sets in.<br/><br/>And although I am generally not in favour of dubbing, I wish this has been done for the credibility of CTHD.  This is due to the different accents of all its main actors.  Chow has a Cantonese accent; Yeoh a Yankee's <cringe>; Zhang's delightful mainland chinese accent and a taiwanese one somewhere.  To anyone whose mother tongue is Chinese, these jarring accents grate on the ear and distracts one from the overall enjoyment of the film."

"dcmarkham","10","0","0","3 February 2001"," The pinnacle of what a Chinese fantasy movie should be
","I lived in Hong Kong for nearly three years of my life and I learned Cantonese.  I've been married to my wife from Taiwan for over four years now, and I've picked up Mandarin.  I love Chinese culture, Chinese people, and Asian history tremendously -- however, I've never been a fan of kung fu movies.  Why?  Because most of them do great injustice in their presentation of the art of Kung Fu -- they over-stylize it, they become pop pieces of phony action sound effects, vomit-inducing camera movements, and shotgun editing.  And the stories -- sweet Buddha -- such tremendous wealth of incredible Chinese literature available, all but unknown to the West -- trivialized by bad acting, bad writing, quick-buck-turning productions. Some of Jet Li's Wong Fei Hong films are considerably good, and the kung fu can't be beat, but the stories are still slaughtered -- the characters (especially the female characters) are excruciatingly stereotypical.<br/><br/>
After viewing Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I came close to weeping for joy.  This is what Chinese fantasy films should aspire to. This is the film that Chinese literature has been dying for -- a very true-to-source adaptation of an excellent Chinese novel, incredibly acted and reconstructed.  The mood is subdued throughout, not wontonly hyper. The fight scenes are, for the most part, scrolling and steady, showing stealth and true physically acute movements -- not a rampant collage of quick cuts, zoom ins, and the same two swooshing and contact sound effects over and over.<br/><br/>I could go on with Ang Lee's genius, but I'll just recommend the films ""Pushing Hands"" and ""The Wedding Banquet"" as his other less-known masterpieces.<br/><br/>The story is an excellent example of traditional Chinese fiction, full of personal dilemma, altruistic heroes with deeply embedded values (Where has altruism gone in American heroes?), and more non-verbal than spoken communication between characters.  The concept of great personal loss is hardly something you see in American literature and film -- suffering can never be near as great as the forced good-feeling ending.  Loss is an eternal theme in Chinese fiction -- one must lose to gain deeper love and appreciation.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized the dialog -- well, no matter how well a language is translated in the subtitles, there are always inflections, hidden meanings, cultural references, and idioms that subtitles cannot communicate fully -- some that cannot be translated at all without deeper explanations.  (Imagine a Chinese person trying to watch ""Wayne's World"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" in Chinese subtitles -- how the hell do you translate THAT?)  Plus, subtitles have to trim expressions down to the basest level to have enough screen-time to be read.  Unless you are fluent in Chinese, do not criticize this movie for its dialog -- which the subtitles do a fair job of translating.<br/><br/>See this movie -- on the big screen if you can.  For those unfamiliar with Asian fiction, it's an extremely moving introduction to true Kung Fu ethics of ancient times and traditional story-telling style of the best of Chinese fantasy.  Keep one thing in mind, though -- most of the gravity-defying physical feats portrayed ARE meant to be fantasy -- they're representations of mythical feats of great Kung Fu secrets and mastery, enabling one to be superhuman.  If you're an action movie fan, and you don't scoff the good-guy's ever-loaded, perfect-aiming pistol in your favorite action movie, don't ""sheesh"" or ""yeah, right"" any of the beautiful gravity-defying movements in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
"Fat Dragon","8","0","0","4 February 2001"," One of the most overhyped movies ever...
","This movie was hyped as the fantastic Chinese blockbuster that would open the world's eyes to Chinese movies (or something along those lines). It has indeed worked very well, but here's my personal opinion:<br/><br/>1. Far better movies than this have been made in Hong Kong before. Smaller budgets, yes, but far, far better movies.<br/><br/>2. The movie has been overhyped. It's good, but not as good, and not as ""deep"" as the advertisers would have us believe.<br/><br/>3. No matter how much you read about ""Wuxia pian"" and it's long history, all the flying, running up walls and ""continuous jumping"" (they don't even land between the jumps, they just get near the ground before the cable pulls them up again), is just too ridiculous! You simply have to laugh, because here people are trying to make a serious movie, and suddenly someone stretches out their hand in a very ""Supermanly"" fashion and fly up, up and away! And there's no explanation as to how they can do this, either! What's really sad is that it totally ruins all the swordfights. Why? For the simple reason that fights must either be very stylish, like in The Matrix, or well choreographed/""realistic"" like in many Hong Kong movies. The fights in ""Crouching Tiger..."" are neither. They're not realistic, and totally unfair, because the main characters can use ""magic"" that their opponents can't, but they don't even look cool either, because of the ridiculous cable movements!<br/><br/>4. Acting. Even a non-Chinese can see that many of these people are not very good actors. Chow Yun-Fat is as always the greatest, but he has a very small role, so the female actors, who aren't nearly as good as Chow, ""carry"" the movie. Chow Yun-Fat's character is also the most interesting, and coolest character in the movie, so the focus on the female characters is, TBH, difficult to understand.<br/><br/>5. Story. The story lacks focus. It seems almost as if the director couldn't decide what part of the story was most important, and thus it lacks the focus that a great movie needs. Also, the characters sometimes act unrealistically (to make the movie last longer?). There's also some ""deep"", philosophical parts, that just don't work well. The ending is the worst example of this ""deepness"" simply being silly.<br/><br/>And finally, the Hollywood-feel of it all ruins it somewhat. IMNSHO this movie could've been made in Hollywood, and that takes away a lot of it's character. One of the greatest thing about most Hong Kong and Japanese movies is that they simply couldn't, and wouldn't have, been made in Hollywood."

","This film was touted very highly by many critics and commoners when it was released stateside as a feature.  Seeing it, I expected it to fall far short of all the praise, which it did not.  Ang Lee, whose previous movies were at best lackluster, (such as the vomitous period piece Sense and Sensibility) has molded a cinematic friggin' masterpiece!  Crouching Tiger starts off slow, and there are many other points in the movie where the dialogue seems to be a character unto itself.  Yet when the action does rear its head, it is spectacular.  You must allow yourself a certain suspension of disbelief when you view these scenes, because the premise is that Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh (as well as Zhang Ziyi and Jade Fox) have mastered a little-known and powerful technique that seems to consist mostly of leaping and gliding on air like flying squirrels.  Besides the slow pace and the ridiculousness of the technique, the action does nothing short of kick some serious ass.  And Zhang Ziyi, a newcomer to the Asian-to-American conversions, has an allure that eclipses even the shining charm that is Chow Yun-Fat.  She is destined for greatness with her obvious talent.  Chow Yun-Fat has always had an alluringly charismatic screen presence, but it is truly evident in this picture.  As the battling goes, none are as talented as Michelle Yeoh, and oftentimes her skill carries the film.  This movie is a hundred times better than most movies today, and even if the genre or the subject matter does not interest you, go see it just to admire a prime piece of cinema.  That being said, make sure to bring your reading glasses, because like all good foreign directors should, Ang Lee refused to let his film become butchered by dubbing."

It invests the extra time in character development, a smart choice given the superhero-like qualities they are given and the quality of the actors available to the director.<br/><br/>It's a story you're probably familiar with, with a few small twists, but this movie is one of the most beautiful and awesome presentations of it put to film and well worth seeing."

","As a Taiwanese, I am so proud of Ang Lee. He did so many innovations for the Wu-Xia Movie Genre which has been very important for several generations in Taiwan, China, and HK. The beauty of the movement goes in unison with the fine story. However, a viewer has to be a Chinese speaker to be able to understand the poor accent the actors have. But accent comes not so important when the production value of the whole film reaches a certain high level. It has been a sensation all over Asian, and I hope the western viewers can grasp the breathtaking beauty of the film."

","No other movie has driven me to tears, and made me leave the theater shaking and completely overwhelmed.  That is, until I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon today...<br/><br/>You already know the plot, so I'll just tell you that to me, everything fit perfectly into place...everything from the wire-fights (which I gushed over) to the slow pace (which, I admit, worried me going in...I thought I was going to be seeing Sense and Sensibility - the Martial Arts Director's cut.) It all fits together to make something that surpasses mere entertainment, and injects you into a a very deep fantasy land that you will not forget in the near or far future.<br/><br/>Don't expect to see a martial arts film, and don't expect to see a romantic epic...I think people's expectations of the movie are what is getting it the negative feedback on the board.  People that expect to see a kung-fu movie are bored by the thick, and admittedly-slow-moving plot.  People that expect to see a love story are bored by the (fantastic) fight scenes.<br/><br/>I know that there are better kung-fu films out there.  I know that there are better romances out there....but not since Kurosawa have I seen a movie like this, that tackles complex emotions, while delivering fantastic action at the same time...such a great departure from such overproduced hollywood films as Gladiator.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this isn't a genre film...if anything, it's a romantic fantasy in which all of the elements:  Cinematography, Acting, Direction are top-notch and deliver a moviegoing experience you will thank yourself for attending."

"bubakar","10","0","0","2 February 2001"," A World Masterpiece
","Ang Lee's film is a lyrical masterpiece, rightfully noted by the American Film Institute as ""bringing the world together."" Heavily weighted in Eastern philosophy and tradition, ""Crouching Tiger"" accessibly brings Asian film to Western audiences. The film begins by slowly setting the stage for the romance subplot between Chow Yun Fat's ""Mu Bai"" and Michelle Yeoh's ""Shu Lien"". The fan expecting all action may find this initial opening slow. However, the more estute fan will recognize this as the necessary build-up. Les the action fan get bored, the fights kick up a mere ten minutes into the film, and when they do, boy, is he paid off.  The initial fight scene introduces the audience to an audacious display of superior martial artistry.  Anyone who thought the use of the word ""arts"" in ""martial arts"" was a stretch will be proved wrong. The choreography in this initial battle is pure bliss.  Every time you think they can't outdo themselves, believe me, they do. With each subsequential fight, you think you've seen the best, but then Ang Lee, moving himself into the world canon of directors, tops them all with a fight at the top of a bamboo forest that will literally leave you in awe. This viewer has seen too many films in his lifetime, but ""Crouching Tiger"" really brought back the magic of going to the movies. It truly lifts you to a place where you've never been.  I, again, felt like the six year old who saw ""Star Wars"", and to recapture that feeling 25 years later was cinematic bliss. Go.  And then go again.  The new millennium has just begun, but Ang Lee has given other filmmakers a peak to reach for.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the ""Star Wars"" for the world economy. Subtitles or no, it is the greatest film in decades, and, I believe, for decades to come."

","Considering that at the moment IMDb users' rating of this movie is 12th best of all time, I was expecting a lot; I've rarely gone into a film with so positive an attitude.  Yes, the fight scenes are easily the best I've ever seen, but there really wasn't much more to it than that.  I was willing the story to do something unexpected, or to be different from that which seems so standard for this kind of film - the master who wants to stop fighting his enemy, the apprentice who won't listen, etc.  All pretty cliched really, but that's not necessarily a negative point!  Because nothing happened that surprised me, it struggled to hold my interest; but thank goodness for those fight scenes!!  Some of the cinematography is quite beautiful, and the action direction is splendid, but unfortunately the emotional bits (like a ""good"" character dying) often just came off as funny.  And what is that flying stuff all about?!  That pushes a story attempting to be at least slightly serious over the edge into downright silly!  (It did look quite cool though.)<br/><br/>Overall, fairly good fun, quite amusing (both intentionally and unintentionally), a little slow in places, and a lot silly.  Definitely not the 12th best film of all time, though - sorry.  6/10."

","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a movie that I had been hearing about for months. It's turning up on almost every film critics' 10 best lists all over the world, with just about every one of them saying how beautifully made and well done it is. I was hesitant about seeing it because it's a Chinese-Taiwanese film spoken in Mandarin language with English subtitles. I've never seen a foreign language film in my life (not in it's entirety), but I've heard so much about it, I decided to take a chance and see it. I'm glad I did. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a breathtaking moviegoing experience that I'll never forget. One of the main reasons why I wanted to see this movie is because I'm a big fan of Michelle Yeoh. After seeing her in the James Bond movie ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" I've become fascinated by her presence. I watched her in some of her earlier work in martial arts movies (I saw the dubbed versions of those films) and she's something else. She's remarkable in this movie, as well as the great Chow Yun-Fat, and the real scene stealer in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, newcomer Zhang Ziyi. These actors literally kick butt in this movie. The martial arts sequences are incredible, the cinematography is beautiful, and the story captavating. This was a one-time moviegoing experience for me. I don't think a foreign language film can top this one. I'd like to see this film dubbed into English and see how it plays without the subtitles. But as it plays now (with subtitles), ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a wonderful film. Congratulations to director Ang Lee (""Sense and Sensibility"") for putting together a truly awesome experience. One word of warning: I really wouldn't recommend this movie for kids. In the theater were I saw it, there were (to my astonishing surprise) alot of kids present. After the movie ended I overheard one young boy saying ""oh this movie was so stupid."" Another said ""I didn't understand that movie."" I believe they thought they were seeing something out of the Power Rangers school of filmmaking because that show and the movies feature lots of martial arts and many kids like martial arts. Let's get one thing straight here: ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is more adult oriented. I'm not sure if most kids will understand it. It took me a while in getting used to the English subtitles, but some kids may not. If kids want to see this movie, I would recommend their parents in telling them that it's a foreign film and that it's not like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. This is a whole different experience. Plus, it's not as cheesy as the Power Rangers. It's really well made.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","Unlike another amazing-looking movie I saw this weekend (THE CELL), CROUCHING TIGER actually has some substance. It's light on plot, but it has strong complex characters. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh speak volumes about their feelings for each other with just a look or a brief touch. Their characters are considered legendary in their chosen work, but when it comes to their hearts, they're just as uncertain as the rest of us. The visuals are, of course, amazing, but the film has as much beauty in its story and characters as it does visually."
"tonyruben","9","0","0","8 November 2000"," A masterpiece!
","Do you remember the feeling you had when you first saw Once Upon a Time in China?  You knew you'd just watched something pretty special.  I felt the same about CTHD.  I'm going to write this without including any spoilers, so apologies if something doesn't make sense.  It will do when you see the film!<br/><br/>Firstly, this is a film that breaks a lot of conventions.  Just when you think you know what is going to happen, it does something different. Characteristically of director Ang Lee, it is the female characters who are the strongest.  Michelle Yeoh is, as you would expect from her, excellent both in terms of acting performance and her martial arts.  But the star of the film is Zhang Zi Yi  who I regret I know nothing about, who shows amazing speed and agility and takes her role suitably seriously especially in some of the sequences that are direct homages to genre cliches.  And she's cute too!  Chow Yun Fat once again puts in a sterling performance, given that he is not a martial artist, he didn't look out of place wielding a sword, although I thought one or two shots might have been over cranked.  In a couple of his previous films he has looked a bit out of place when it comes to fight scenes, but here he was fine.  Shows what a versatile actor he really is.<br/><br/>The fight choreography is by Yuen Woo Ping, so you know it's going to be good.  Most of the fights are fairly stylised, lots of large sweeping moves and stances and all incredibly fast.  There is a lot of wire work of which I'm not a fan, but it's used to give the fights more of a ballet type feel and didn't detract from them at all.  The film has a steady sense of humour and keeps it up all the way through, which included interrupting one of the fight sequences with one of the best gags in the picture.<br/><br/>Downsides?  Well a couple.  Stylistically, the film can't decide whether to be shot in a Western of Chinese style, so there is a bit of both which seemed to me like a compromise.  Whilst most of the fights are done in wide shot, there were some sequences done in close up which was even more annoying than usual because they were back to back with the wide shots.   I also thought the exposition in the middle giving Zhang Zi Yi some back story was too long, the point this was making could have been done in a far shorter time.<br/><br/>I must say a word about the extras.  One of the things I always love about some of the old Shaw Brothers films is the fantastic faces you get on some of the extras.  CTHD has some of the best extras I have ever seen.  Loads of big, mean looking thugs with strange beards or moustaches carrying huge, weird and wonderful weapons.  It really adds a great deal to the character of the film.<br/><br/>The audience I was with loved the film, cheering and clapping during the fight scenes and in all the right places.  There were unfortunately a couple of bits of unintentional laughter but I suppose that is to be expected. Because this film was made for a Western audience as well as an Eastern one, the subtitling is excellent, always clear and readable and making complete sense.  Those of you who haven't seen this film are in for a real treat.  I just can't wait for a chance to see it again."

","Ang Lee has made a masterpiece of a film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is easily the best movie of the year. Actually it's probably the best movie of any year.

Michelle Yeoh is at her best in this movie, she shows us exactly why she's asia's top female action star. But I don't think that you can talk about this movie without at least mentioning Zhang Ziyi, who is amazing in this movie. She may just give Michelle Yeoh a run for her money. Ang Lee truly has a great eye for direction, the film is amazing to look at. And the scenes in the reastaurant and the ones in the forest are especially amazing. Overall if you are a martial arts fan, see this movie. If you like a good love story, see this movie. Or if you just want to see a really great film, see this movie. You won't be dissapointed."

"aslpoon","Null","0","0","3 February 2001"," A catch 22 ...
","This one is a catch 22.  To truly appreciate ancient martial arts<br/><br/>movies, one has to have grown up reading Wuxia novels and<br/><br/>watching martial arts movies.  However, such an individual (myself<br/><br/>included) may find CTHD to be mediocre at best, exactly because<br/><br/>of the Wuxia novel experience.  Top that with someone who had<br/><br/>seen Ang Lee's other films, this one was, to say the least, a bit of a<br/><br/>disappointment.  Casting Chow and Yeoh was, to me, unfortunate. <br/><br/>I was cringing in my seat when I saw them struggle with their<br/><br/>Mandarin dialogues (they are both Cantonese speaking).  It really<br/><br/>took a big chunk out of their ability to act.  Yeoh was not acting -<br/><br/>she was just reciting the script.  The same thing happened to<br/><br/>Chow in Anna and the King when he was trying to speak Siamese<br/><br/>and English.  There is a stark contrast between Chow and Yeoh<br/><br/>and the Mandarin speaking cast (eg. Sir Te - the actor who was in<br/><br/>almost all of Ang Lee's earlier films; Jen - played by Zhang from<br/><br/>Beijing); the latter is simply a lot more relaxed and comfortable<br/><br/>and are really acting.<br/><br/>The story follows a pervasive theme in Wuxia novels - once<br/><br/>becoming part of Guang Hu (the martial art world, somewhat akin<br/><br/>to cops and gangsters in today's world), one has no control over<br/><br/>ones destiny.  Again, the script and Ang Lee failed to  develop<br/><br/>more complex characters that accentuate the internal conflict and<br/><br/>helplessness experienced by members of 'Guang Hu'.<br/><br/>No doubt the scenery is beautiful.  It's actually the least of Ang<br/><br/>Lee's challenges to come up with such breathtaking locations in<br/><br/>China, a land abound with geographic beauty.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad movie, but definitely (shamefully) over-hyped.  I<br/><br/>might have enjoyed it more if I could watch it without my experience<br/><br/>with Wuxia novels and movies."

There are two things that just don't make sense in my head via this board...first; how come there are so many reviewer comments on this movie(unless it came out way before now). Where I live, the film just came out today. Second, this film is labeled, action, romance, adventure...but WHY NOT 'FANTASY'??? This is what the film is all about: fantasy. That's what makes <CTHD> so damn great.<br/><br/>
   Aside from this I'd like to say that I have not been so inspired by a film in a long time. I was crying in the end (won't reveal if it's out of sadness or happiness; I think both!)<br/><br/>
  This movie opened your imagination to a new realm of fantasy, where anything goes. If you never watch movies with subtitles, the first 15 minutes or so of the movie might worry you into thinking ""oh, no..what if this gets boring"". All of the sudden, you're laughing out loud, your jaw drops open quite a few times, and things get very emotional before you realize you've been able to keep up with all the action AND the subtitles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>   Two notes: Chow Yun-Fat does not have quite as big a part as one might expect(the story is mainly about a young woman), though he is a central character. Also, I've never seen Michelle Yeoh in any other flick besides this one, but she seemed kind of wooden in this role.<br/><br/><br/><br/>   This is already hands-down one of my all-time favourite foreign films.<br/><br/>

","This movie is a bit overrated right now but certainly one of the best movies of the year 2000. Ang Lee's technique may seem odd to our western minds - to combine chinese fairy tale elements and a tragical lovestory. But I was surprised by the good acting that left away all unnecessarities and distinguished itself by its high grade of stylization - a bit like Kurosawa. The action scenes were very well made and always had a funny touch by their exaggeration. The difficult task of retaining enough seriosity to make the lovestory emotionally touching was accomplished by the good camera and the acting. So this film should be credited for astonishing and funny action scenes as well as giving the viewer a glance in his eyes when the protagonists are entangled in  love. Additionally, this movie contains a grade of poetry and philosophy that is often missing in mainstream productions - if you like it you will watch it again. To enjoy this movie you have to have an affinity for martial arts, a little knowledge of chinese culture and a sensitivity for big emotions.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is fresh blood in the overaged and unspirited mainstream and hopefully will make more movies of this kind."

There are lots of eye candies, and I must admit that the scenery is simply breathtaking.  The acting were very well done, though I had trouble with most of the dialogue (I don't speak mainland Chinese, and I make a point not learning it.)  Well, sometimes you *do* come across a chop-suey chef who actually cares about taste.<br/><br/>Taste alone, however, does not cover up some of the movie's fundamental flaws.  First, ""Hidden Tiger"" goes way off tangent with certain characters so much that there is almost no time to develop other's.  This leaves the film very unbalanced.  Second, the fight scenes, the scenes which make ""Hidden Tiger"" a kung-fu movie than anything else.  It almost looks like there is only enough budget for guy-wires and nothing else.  In other words... people fly all over the place, most of the time.  Finally, the plot elements themselves are very cliché, and the pace in exploring these elements is nonetheless too slow for what they are worth.  For a veteran kung-fu movie viewer, this only spells frustration.<br/><br/>This is not to say that ""Crouching Tiger"" is poorly done.  In fact it is quite tasteful, and its quality surpasses most kung-fu films I have seen. But everything else is as creative as any 19th century English novel.

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","31 January 2001"," An achievement in pop, a good but not great film
","I read a great story on new Asian filmmaking in a New York Times Sunday edition a few weeks back. It posed the question, ""Does 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' work because it is Asian, or because it so not Asian?""  The film invokes a dead ancient culture of warriors and princesses in a very archetypal fairy-tale sort of way that works as an adventure film but not as a character study.  Likewise, it creates a mythic world, akin to the Western, that does not resemble the realities of the era.  Are we looking for a foreign culture to embrace in pop culture- take a look at Charlie's Angels.  There is a definite utilization of black and Asian icons and culture to add definition to a film that is otherwise stuck in the 80s.  I wonder if this film's popularity isn't part of that search.  Maybe, it's even partially something Lee himself is searching for as a Westchester County resident, some mythical honor-code culture that no longer exists to enliven his otherwise atomized, isolated white suburbia.<br/><br/>What must be acknowledged is that this film has done something very few people expected: it proved that a foreign language film doesn't have to be dubbed to succeed nationwide.  Jackie Chan might try releasing his next picture without dubbing over.  However, this may only be working because Crouching Tiger is an action movie.  I fear then that the movie is a fluke, and no film dealing with modern China and Asia, nothing by Wong Kar-Wai or Chen Kaige, is going to make its way into the multiplexes.(Instead we'll get more crap like Brokedown Palace.)  This is not to say Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not well made: it has wonderful cinematography and action sequences, along with good performances from Zhang Ziyi and Chow Yun Fat. However, it is not the best film of the year, certainly not the masterpiece critics are making it out to be.  In fact, in spite of my anger at Gladiator winning Best Picture at the Golden Globes, for action combined with all around great casting (Crowe, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris), cinematography, and writing, Gladiator was overall a far more provocative and powerful film.  Feel free to disagree."

Please refrain from cajoling us with such machiavellian crap: ""CTHD doesn't deserve a 9.0, so cast a 1 to bring it down to a 5 which it only deserve"" or stupid nonsense like this.<br/><br/>Fellow voters,  don't be seduced by the hypes and don't be manipulated by the venoms. If CTHD is destined to become a classic, so be it and if it falls from grace and is relegated to being a trendy flash like 'Fifth Element', let it be. Be honest, be true, be yourself .. just vote your heart as we are supposed to do.<br/><br/>And don't be influenced by me, either.<br/><br/>No hype: `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is great entertainment.  I was lost in it for 2 hours and I will lose a couple of more hours before I'm thru.  For the vicarious thrill, I rate it a comfortable 9."

","The movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a beautifully lyrical tale set in some unspecified ancient period of Chinese history. It details the unsuccessful struggle of a master swordsman to foreswear his profession, and to bring to fruition his personal relationship with the lady security consultant who is the object of his emotional desire.<br/><br/>They work together to try to recover his quasi-magical emerald engraved sword, which he has given in trust to his old weapons-training master, but which has been mysteriously stolen by a night-thief...The true identity and historical reasons for this theft provide much of the tension in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>The fanciful aspects of the story where the martial-artists seem to gain an increasing mastery over gravity---sailing from one rooftop to another, cannot be reconciled with Western ""literalness"", but are more fitted to classical arabian or oriental fairy-tales, or even of the Greco-Roman ""deux-ex-machina"" direct-interference of ""Gods"" in the plots of mortal men...<br/><br/>If taken as literal storytelling, the movie fails in ""believability"".. but taken as an allegorical, poetic, fanciful parable  it is a wonderful success...<br/><br/>This movie is suprisingly well acted---suprisingly by western standards-----the characterization and the plot development owe much more to Buddhist or Zen Koan philosophy, and to the very stylized manners of Japanese (originally Chinese) ""puppet"" theatre. Western viewers who have any background in watching opera will have no trouble with the ""stylized"" aspects of the acting.<br/><br/>Like moonlight through waving bamboo, the ending is moody, reflective, ambivalent, philosophical....ultimately enlightening.<br/><br/>This is far better storytelling and possibly better martial-arts than anything Bruce Lee ever managed to bring to the screen during HIS lifetime... The music score is alternately lush and exotic, with cello solos by Yo-Yo Mah giving it just the right touch of ""classical"" western melody. The cinematography is equal to anything from the epic films of David Lean.<br/><br/>I can't wait to go see it again!"
"Sharkey360","10","0","0","1 November 2000"," The World's Best Movie Of 2000!!!
","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the best movie I've seen in the theaters this year! The film's production is incredible and despite the reported $12.5 million figure for the budget, the film looked like a $70 million production! Just look at the number of extras used, the sets, the costumes, the locations (China is a very beautiful country!) the stunts, and the list goes on!<br/><br/>To stress out why the film is the best! The cast is virtually perfect! Chow Yun-Fat, who's more known with those gun man roles, is simply the best to play Li Mu Bai. Chow's calm, combined with the character's wisdom, showed that the role was like it was made for him. Michelle Yeoh's acting adds maturity to the story, and as great as she performs martial arts, she acts great! Ziyi Zhang is easily one of the most promising young actresses in the world, and you'll see why. The supporting cast is very great too! Pei-Pei Cheng's Jade Fox is very expressive, very wise and it gives the film a strong presence of ""opposition"". <br/><br/>The martial arts scenes are perfect! Woo-ping Yuen, who choreographed the martial arts scenes in the usually over-rated ""The Matrix"", worked harder and better in this film. As far as martial arts go, Crouching Tiger is easily the best of them all not just because of the amount of action, not just because of the kind of styles used, but because Woo-ping dedicated a lot of research and heart. The result is a martial arts fest that connects itself with character expression and story flow. <br/><br/>And if you think ""The Matrix"" is the greatest martial arts fest, you're very wrong! Crouching Tiger easily destroys ""The Matrix"" into a billion pieces! As if that's not enough, Crouching Tiger's story and character development is so deep it renders ""The Matrix"" obsolete and worthless.<br/><br/>Acting and action speaking, Crouching Tiger never failed me. Like the tradition of Chinese epics, we see the stars act and perform the action themselves! If you thought Chow Yun-Fat's only good with guns, you'll be shocked to see how he performs martials arts here. Even Pei-Pei Cheng, an old chubby lady, would shock you with her moves. Cheng showed that even women in her age and build can move fast and fight with greatness! Michelle Yeoh still fights as great as she did when she was young. As for Ziyi Zhang, she makes a great martial artist!<br/><br/>Heck, if you put Keanu Reeves up against any of the above mentioned stars (or anyone in the film), he would either chicken out or easily be defeated!<br/><br/>Ang Lee's direction reminds me a bit of Irvin Kershner's work in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Aside from the use of fight scenes and some special effects, Lee brought out a lot of expression and drama from the characters to the point where the viewer sees everyone here in a high level of being human.<br/><br/>
Crouching Tiger's story is one of a kind. A great sword gets stolen, then the story pushes on with unmatched expression, very nice twists, characters express a lot of themselves, viewers get to learn some very valuable lessons and morales, and the story ends with one of the most unique endings I've ever seen in any movie!<br/><br/>Use of music is done greatly, and it perfectly fits the mood and what goes on. CoCo Lee's theme song ""A Love Before Time"" is the best movie song I've heard in a long time. I feel it should be nominated for the next Oscars, and that goes the same with the musical scoring.<br/><br/>Now that I've seen this film in the theaters, I now look towards the upcoming DVD version. And to those of you who read this review, I highly-recommend watching this. You'll be amazed and entertained with greatness! This is the Year of the Dragon, and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is simply the best movie in the world today!"

","CTHD makes you feel like your five years old all over again. When I saw CTHD for the first time, it rekindled my love for films again. It just goes to show that with a little technical know how, and a lot of creative imagination, a standard love/honour story can be turned into a masterpiece in the right hands.<br/><br/>Ang Lee once again showed why he is one of the greatest directors of the modern era. In one scene he leaves the camera stationary so that all the action is coming into the audience's view. Then the next scene the camera follows the actors around, along the walls, skipping along water surface, and skimming along the bamboo trees. The balance between movement and non-movement give the audience a sense that they're in a roller coaster ride. If I come off sounding like Lee's biggest fan, you would be correct. I've followed him since  ""Eat Drink, Man Woman"". I am just awestruck by Lee's story telling and believe some day, Lee will go down as one of the greatest Authors of our time.<br/><br/>As far as the ""Unrealistic"" parts of the movie goes. The last time I checked, CTHD was in the Fantasy Genre right? I didn't see anyone label it a documentary. The same people probably watches The wizard of Oz and says, ""That B*llS**t, Monkeys don't fly"". Relax people, it's just a movie, Try and suspend belief and just have a good time.

","This movie gets a 9.9 from me. I found no flaws in it that really matter, but nothing gets a 10 :) It's a Chinese/Taiwanese kung fu movie... NOT a hollywood feature film. All the comments about the ""laughable stunts"" are ignorant, in that those are a needed part of the genre.<br/><br/>And to say Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan would have done it better is laughable. Chow played the role of a hero. NOT a braggard. He was reserved and knew he had the power to destroy, but needed to refrain in order to make things better for all. That never works, so he had to do his best to contain the needed violence.<br/><br/>The acting was really good for a kung fu flick, but that's not what I expect from them.

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had mixed reviews and I hadn't seen many non-english flicks before this. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy it. Enjoyment is not quite the word for this film...breathtaking would be a more accurate description.<br/><br/>Set in 19th century China, a 400 year old sword called the Green Destiny is given away as a present by Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a legendary warrior. However, the same night it is stolen from its new owner by an impressive young female fighter who has been trained by the infamous Jade Fox. This leads Li Mu Bai and his companion on a quest to recover the sword and reveal the truth about the thief. <br/><br/>It's simple - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is flawless, making it easily the best foreign film ever made, the best action movie ever and simply one of the best flicks overall. The performances from the largely unknown cast shine, Chen Chang should be a sure Oscar contender, Michelle Yoeh is a great heroin and Chow Yun-Fat digests his character and is a very watchable main man. The visuals are amazing and literally breathtaking, every minute of the movie I just had to remind my heart to keep pumping the blood around. Ang Lee is simply one of the most assuring directors around, this is his best film by a long shot, but all his films are crowd-pleasing and all demand continuous viewings.<br/><br/>Incredible, intriguing, memorable and utterly brilliant, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a deluxe achievement.<br/><br/>I rate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 10 out of 10."

","When I first saw the trailer for CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, I had no idea what I was in store for. I entered the theater at 10 O'clock on a Monday night, and I was excited because there were only two other people in the theater, who did not snicker or voice negative feelings during this film. There are definite pros, and unfortunately, some glaring cons in choosing to see CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON in the theater.<br/><br/>Let's discuss the pros first, shall we?<br/><br/>First, the scenery: No one should have any difficulty losing themselves in the visual delights that Ang Lee open up to us - from bleak deserts to serene bamboo forests, we are transported to a gorgeous world of mysticism and fantasy.<br/><br/>Next, the main characters: Chow-Yun Fat (Li Mu Bai)does a superb job playing the pensive warrior with a moral conflict. Michelle Yeoh (Shu Lien) is up to the task of playing a balanced lover/sister/fighter - and looks gorgeous doing so. Zhang Ziyi is the moral tug for viewers, as she reminds us that ambition/power alone do not give life meaning. What does? Watch the film - I won't ruin it for you.<br/><br/>Finally, the fight sequences: There are very few people who don't know that the fight choreographer for CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON also did the fight scenes in THE MATRIX - this means we are treated to eye-popping, hyper-kinetic fights that leave us salivating for more.<br/><br/>But there are cons too, folks. No movie is perfect.<br/><br/>Firstly, The subtitles: While the story is excellent, not every American moviegoer has the patience to multi-task between action and the translation of dialogue. DVD can bring around a dubbed version for those viewers. Next, there are too many assumptions placed on the audience: Some characters were placed in the story with a scant history; others had histories that went on far too long. Since this film is aimed at an Eastern audience, certain myths are assumed, such as the mastery of gravity. Most Americans can't enjoy this movie without a basic explanation of those myths - they are too grounded in ""reality"". Finally...You know, I can't think of a third con, since this movie succeeds on so many levels. But let me sum up with this:<br/><br/>Anyone can enjoy CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON: but there are a few prerequisites. (1)Don't get hung up on the subtitles. [This makes the theater quieter anyway, since folks have to pay closer attention!] (2)Don't get hung up on the anti-gravity stuff [I find it interesting that folks who cry ""That could never happen"" are the same people who have no trouble believing in Terminators, The Force, The Matrix and time travel.] These are _legendary_ skills, people...accept them as such. (3)Don't expect this to be a Kung-Fu film. CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is a fantasy movie with tones of honor, love, loyalty and moral choices. If you can't run with your imagination, then this movie isn't for you. But, if you can....run like the wind!"

","I went to go see this movie with high expectations, and wasn't disappointed at all. I would have liked to have seen more development between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat, but other then that, it was a great movie. I see that many people don't like it because of the ""flying"", and it could've been done very cheesy; but I've seen many Kung-Fu flicks and Ang Lee has pulled it off very beautifully. Characters soar and even fight with a grace that is very balletic in nature. I didn't find this movie boring at all, but very engrossing. I love movies that take me to ""another place"" and that's exactly what this did. The fight between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh was amazing, the bamboo forest scene was hypnotic, and the score was haunting; I can't say enough. It makes me happy to see amazing action sequences combined into what's actually a very good character driven movie. Ang Lee has opened a whole new door to the American audience, and has redefined the typical martial arts flick. Amazing, beautiful movie."

","Ang Lee is not George Lucas! This is a Good but not Great film. I've read comparisons of this film to ""Titanic"" and ""The Matrix"", but it is so much more closely related to the ""Star War"" series, in aspiration, philosphy and mood.  It is however far inferior to any of George Lucas's work and about on par with overinflated pulp like Titantic and/or Matrix. The plot is simplistic, the theme and tone, very dark giving the film an unresolved feeling, like a suspended chord, and leaving this filmgoer depressed. On the other hand, the cinematography is stunning, the action scenes are relatively convincing, although the freshness of the choreography has been blunted by similar fight scenes in Charlie's Angels (Argh!)and the heretofore mentioned The Matrix. In that CTHD is considered one of the top films of the year is more of a statement of the state of the cinema than of its inherent greatness."

"spyretto","6","0","0","30 October 2000"," Worth Watching, yet...
","Since so many people from Greece are commending about this film, I feel like there is room for one more 'unbiased' (?) opinion of a film that was heralded by some as 'the best martial arts movie ever'. First of all I have to say I'm a big fan of Chinese culture and civilization which to me comes second best only to the ancient Greek one ( lets be realistic ). Modern-day China continues to amaze me with the likes of Zhang Yimou in film-making or Faye Wong in music. So imagine my anticipation when I was about to watch 'Chouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger', especially after having read some of the reviews on this website. Nevertheless, I have to admit I'm not a great fan of martial arts films though I watch the occassional Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan film on TV. To set the record straight this film is definitely NOT one of the best films ever made, neither in martial arts nor in any other genre- nevertheless, it's a film worth watching.<br/><br/>The assumed strong aspects of the film ( plot, actors, direction, cinematography, choreography ) are all open to personal tastes. By that I mean that every person I asked who has seen the film gave me a diferent opinion of it, some liked aspects of it that I consider weak( such as the plot ) and others scorned aspects of the film which I liked ( such as, surprisingly enough,the 'flying'effects! ) All things considered, the strong points of this film in my opinion are definitely the choreography and fighting scenes ( almost like an arcade game ) - I nearly came close to believing the hype, that such people could exist- thus the fantasy aspect of it, in all. The leading actors are top-class too, especially Zhang Zi Yi, and, last but not least, the drama. Now the weak points unfortunately have to do with the story itself ( nice but too superfluous, and it can be summed up to the description 'a sword is stolen, retrieved, stolen and retrieved again' - not much for my liking ) and somehow I felt that the naivity of the whole thing does let down the movie ( it gravitated incessantly between realism and exaggeration, the latter maybe because they tried to mimic the occasional American blockbuster, action adventure- hey! snap out of it, China doesn't need that ) Overall, I grieve at how much better this film could be. If you like drama and romance don't miss out Zhang Yimou's 'The Road Home'. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a worth-watching film, nonetheless, and features great performances overall and an exciting new talent in the person of Zhang Zi Yi. No matter if it shows sometimes the icomprehensible tendency of Chinese art to poise between excellency and absurdity."
"MaxH","10","0","0","29 January 2001"," Wow...
","This movie may turn out to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  It has a mythical, fantastic quality to it, particularly the fight scenes, and the performances were superb, particularly young Zhang Ziyi.  I had to sit myself back and close my mouth a number of times at the end of more than one of this movie's stunning fight scenes.  However, the legendary qualities of a warrior's revenge, and the issues of politics in Sir Te's house might not translate well for viewers either not familiar or not interested in Chinese culture.  Even then, the movie is visually stunning, but the influences of obligation and duty on the characters may be lost, obscuring slightly the deep internal conflicts that each of the characters experiences.  I would still recommend this movie to anyone, regardless."

","I have a new fondness for director Ang Lee's work having seen this film and his underseen RIDE WITH THE DEVIL with Toby Mcquire.  I went with high hopes for this film and was surprised that it was not more dramatic. When the main characters start leaping and flying...its a bit much...but within the confines of the fantasy...its high spirited and fun to watch.  The desert scene is just pure hokum and should have been excised..its just not fitting for the film.  Its the best Asian film I have ever seen...but the friend I went with described it aptly as ""good but boring"".  I have to concur...though strangely several images from it keep wandering through my mind now several hours after seeing it.  The ending is a letdown. I noted the strong role of the women in the movie and that each of them in their culture was unique in the storyline.  The theme...dont waste time when it comes to love, restraint is not always the best way to go and sometimes to be truly independent...you may pay a price in the end - especially if your culture in your era wont allow it.  Thanks Ang Lee...I did get something from your fine film and look forward to your future efforts with great relish."

","As a Taiwanese immigrant to Canada, I got the information about 'Crouching Tiger' as soon as the local Vancouverites did.  Having heard about the hype and critic's acclamation for the film, my initial excitement was simply indescribable.  But after seeing it, I realized it's still way too early for me to call it a masterpiece, yet it's so close.<br/><br/>Unlike what most US viewers may think, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a splendid representation of the genre it belongs to - ""Wuxia"".  For the uninitiated, the world of Wuxia is a novel-spawn fantasy medieval China where fighters of all kinds develop their unique skills and disciplines, and they all lead their own life to survive in a world full of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' such as themselves.  It is a living based on vows, friendships, trusts, and a lot of street-wise.  In Hong Kong and Taiwan, Wuxia has become a phenomenal subculture itself, loved by youths and grown adults, whereas the old and more conventional generation oppose it for its 'unrealistic martial arts and bad influences'.<br/><br/>Of course, none of this background stuff can be properly explained in the film.  Many may complain that some of the action sequences (namely, flying) are too fakey, but that's really an accepted thing in Wuxia, with conditions.  And for me, seeing all what I've read in the Wuxia novels jump right onto the big screen, and discovering a beauty - in all the fights, dart throwing and chases - that are so new but yet so deeply familiar, is more than just enjoying special effects alone.  Of course, I'd say the techniques could have been done better... but that's minor issue.<br/><br/>The part of me left unhappy after seeing the film is the part looking forward to good story development.  The story itself isn't really bad;  in fact, it's complicated, deep and profound.  Yet most of the talking scenes went as 'boring' as they could possibly be.  Whenever the casts got into a slow, long conversation,(it's slower than average Chinese conversation) I became naturally unsettled.  Ang Lee could have tried to quicken the pace of talks and fly through the simple ideas, so that the grand theme of the film could be more visible, and hopefully stir up the dramatic feeling more easily.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of the scenes switched too unnaturally, and sometimes the plot development itself seems unnatural.  All have reasons, and I can always find reasons for the obviously out-of-her-mind Jen in her past days, but why didn't they just spend some time on the explanations (or at least hints) in the first place?  This is where I think the film really didn't do well enough.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but it's too bad that it still has problems that polarize viewer responses.  I will definitely look forward to Ang Lee's future films and sincerely wish him success..."

The plot was convoluted, with subcharacters weaving in and out, and new characters violently forced into the picture through looooong flashbacks or inexplicable meetings.  Most people (including myself) don't understand the ending, completely or at all (see below, for notes with spoilers).  Some of the fighting/violence was just grisly and cringe-inducing, and some of it was gracefully done and poetic.  Unfortunately, the two extremes often grated on each other, and produced uneasiness and lack of focus.<br/><br/>I could talk about this thing for hours, but here's a distillation of my opinion:  I had more fun in Dude Where's My Car.  I was more on the edge of my seat in Thirteen Days.  Neither of those films had the splendor or beauty that CTHD did, but in the end, I enjoyed them more.

The martial arts were not only spectacular on a basic level, but even the ""special effects"" were done so well that they became believable!<br/><br/>It's irrelevant that it happens to knock the Godfather/Shawshank off the top of the charts... this is not a comparison to them.  It is merely an accurate account of this film on it's own merits.  Little blood, no cursing, and sexuality without vulgarity - can you recall a martial arts flick with those qualities?  For that matter, can you recall any film with those qualities? I'm pretty strict on what my 10 year old sees, and I've have no problem taking her to see this one - the imagery, the traditions and customs, even the values taught are all honorable."

","This film is truly a masterpiece. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has redeemed my faith that movies really can take us to another place. The bad thing about this movie is that it is misunderstood. The truly sad thing about this movie is that shows how many people have lost that child-like wonder we all used to have when we went to go see movies. This movie is fantastic and can be enjoyed on many levels, but the part I liked  best about it is that it brought me back to a world where mystical powers existed, warriors fought evil and avenged masters. Like everyone else that saw the movie I too heard snickers and laughing, but not from everyone, only from a few. I go to the movies to be entertained, if I want reality I will watch CNN. This was a fantastic journey into a world that I hope to see more of. I think that every once and a while a movie comes along that you like so much and find so amazing, it makes you realize how much you love movies and you fall in love with them all over again. Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one of those movies, for me anyway. This movie not only had a great story, but was fantastically made. the cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking, special effects were amazing, and the acting was top notch. I hope this wins Best Picture, the only thing that might be holding it back is the subtitles, which is a shame because this should be Best Picture. In the end everyone has their own say and only you can say if you liked it or not. I do recommend this, but not to everyone. Many people go to the movie and when something happens that is unbelievable, they say this movie is terrible, that couldn't happen. I feel bad for you. you have to suspend your belief when you go to the movies. the movie was not supposed to be totally real, it's a movie. The story dealt with mystical powers and warriors. But who am I to complain? Feel free to Email me with your say on the movie, good or bad."

","When seeing a film that you have read about, and it has been<br/><br/>called ""great"", and hyperboles have been used such as ""...the<br/><br/>greatest film of all time"", it is hard to separate what you thought<br/><br/>about it from the critical reaction. I think there is an urge to really<br/><br/>want to go with the crowd and join the praise. It feels good to band<br/><br/>together and unanimously cheer something.  When ""Unbreakable""<br/><br/>came out there was a deafening silence about that movie. Nobody<br/><br/>knew what to think of it! Then someone said.....""this movie sucks!""<br/><br/>and like a pin to a balloon the condemnation slapped that movie<br/><br/>silly and it disappeared from theatres, and from Oscar hopes.<br/><br/>
     Now with the universal praise of CTHD almost as deafening, I<br/><br/>have to raise my little hand up in the air and speak my little piece of<br/><br/>truth which is.....what the he!! are these critics talking about? Good<br/><br/>movie? yes. Great movie? no. Disappointing movie? YES. (here<br/><br/>comes the tirade) I was extremely disappointed with this movie!<br/><br/>Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors and this movie just totally<br/><br/>lacks drama, man! It's like, kind of boring. I don't understand the<br/><br/>motivations of any of the characters and the pacing is dull, the fight<br/><br/>scenes come out of nowhere and don't resolve anything! They're<br/><br/>cool to watch but they don't really move the story, the drama, and<br/><br/>the action forward. I hate that! And from Ang Lee too! Who<br/><br/>mastered drama with 'The Ice Storm', subtle comedy with 'Sense<br/><br/>and Sensibility', human frailty and realism with 'The Wedding<br/><br/>Banquet', and building suspense with 'Ride With the Devil'. All of<br/><br/>those movies do something better than this one. I just wasn't<br/><br/>moved at all. Perhaps it would communicate more meaning to a<br/><br/>Chinese audience..(well, those subtitles were kind of distracting)..I<br/><br/>don't know. I just wished it were better. Or maybe it's just that I was<br/><br/>weaned on the overpowering Spielberg/John Williams ""we are<br/><br/>going to MAKE you cry, laugh, squirm, etc.."" formula and can't<br/><br/>accept something subtler and finer. I'll still probably buy it on DVD<br/><br/>so I can watch it without the annoying subtitles! My reaction to this<br/><br/>movie reminds me of my reaction to 'Princess Mononoke'. Amidst<br/><br/>deafening applause I sat there silently and asked, am I just a<br/><br/>dum-dum? did I miss something? did that movie make any<br/><br/>damned sense at all? Anyway , end of tirade. Maybe Ang could just<br/><br/>explain it to me. I hate feeling left out of the crowd. Maybe then I<br/><br/>could join the universal cheer and root for him to beat 'Gladiator' on<br/><br/>Oscar night. (In my heart though I still love Unbreakable- Go<br/><br/>Night!!)"
"jhclues","10","0","0","29 January 2001"," Transporting, Poetic Film
","The legends and myths surrounding the martial arts are extended and brought dazzlingly to fruition in `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' a sumptuous production directed by Ang Lee.  When legendary warrior Li Mu Bai's (Chow Yun-Fat) meditations take him to a place beyond anything he's ever experienced, a place of darkness and sorrow, he decides to give up the life that has sustained him for so long.  As a prelude to his new life he gives his sword, `Green Destiny,' to long-time friend and patron, Sir Te (Lung Sihung).  But when the sword is stolen and aspersions are cast upon the house of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), who (with his family and entourage) is a guest of Sir Te's, Li Mu Bai goes into action to reclaim his sword and elicit justice for the House of Yu.  To effect his goal he allies himself with the woman for whom he has long carried unrequited love in his heart, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who-- like Bai-- is a warrior.  At the same time, he reaffirms his vow to avenge the death of his master, who was killed by a renegade named Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei), who remains at large. 	Ang Lee has created a visually stunning, lyrical, poetic film that is engaging on a number of levels:  The brilliant choreography  (by Woo-Ping Yuen), especially in the sword fighting scenes, is absolutely mesmerizing, as is the ability of the characters to defy gravity and literally soar up the sides of walls, across rooftops and into the tops of trees; there are sequences in this film that will literally take your breath away.  And then there's the story itself, which is nothing less than a meditation on life and the quest for that often elusive butterfly of inner peace and the resolution and acceptance of one's own destiny.  Blended seamlessly together by Lee, it becomes an artistic triumph of the silver screen that is truly magical; the sheer poetic nature of the film is unforgettable, the images of which will remain in your mind's eye forever. 	The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat is perfectly cast as Li Mu Bai; there is a subtle, introspective quality he brings to the character that is sublime in it's sensitivity-- that of a  man of strength and integrity, worthy of the legendary status accorded him as a warrior, and the respect bestowed upon him as a man of principle.  It's an honest portrayal that rings of truth, which Yun-Fat conveys so succinctly and credibly.  Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as well, exhibiting adroit physical abilities in the action sequences, while also demonstrating her gift as a dramatic actress.  Most importantly, she makes Shu Lien real, and there is a definite chemistry between her and Chow Yun-Fat that brings the story even more vividly to life.  But the most exciting discovery of the film is the young Zhang Ziyi, who is absolutely magnificent in the role of Jen Yu, the Governor's daughter.  It's an extraordinary performance, energetic and charming, and Ziyi has a screen presence that is riveting and commanding of attention. She has a tremendous physical dexterity, and her martial arts engagements with Yeoh and Yun-Fat are melodious and utterly captivating, as is her skill with a sword. 	The supporting cast includes Chang Chen (Lo), Gao Xian (Bo), Hai Yan (Madame Yu), Wang Deming (Tsai) and Li Li (May).  Through the combined efforts of Lee's direction, the exemplary performances of his actors and the expertise of a number of technicians, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a film of ethereal magnitude that transports the audience to another time and another place.  Rarely has the screen been graced with with a film of such grace and beauty, and seeing it is a truly memorable experience.  One of the best movies of the year, it is not to missed.  I rate this one 10/10"

"mafisto","10","0","0","26 January 2001"," Superb film, if you understand it
","I've been a long time fan of the wuxia film genre, so when I first saw the Internet trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I was ecstatic. Finally -- Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh together, a (relatively) big budget and no English dubbing.  Expectations were high... ... and were met.  I was prepared to be the jaded viewer who had seen it all.  Hyperkinetic fight scenes?  Been there.  Amazing wirework?  Done that. My preparations were for naught.  I was stunned at how far technology and the masterful direction of Ang Lee took this film.  Peerless special effects, action, acting and story came together in a film that I will never forget.  Only a screen full of superlatives could do this film justice, and I ain't got the space.<br/><br/>If you've never seen a Chinese 'kung-fu' movie before, see this.  But keep the following things in mind before going (and before reading some of the earlier, negative reviews):<br/><br/>1.) Wuxia is fantasy, not reality.  This is not revisionist history, there is no attempt to keep things historically correct.  Suspend disbelief. 2.) Masters can become as light as a feather, strike with the force of a wrecking ball, paralyze with a touch.  They just can.  Get over it. =) 3.) Every Chinese film I've seen (and I've seen a LOT) has a different sense of sentimentality from that of Western films.  Some consider it to be too saccharine or perceive it to be insincere.  This is a sticking point - if you don't like it, you don't like it. 4.) This is a story about love.  Sure, it has staggering fight sequences, but the core of the film revolves around love and what it does - negative or positive - to those who are caught by it.<br/><br/>Experience this film.  You MAY not like it, but it's worth taking the risk. If you're lucky enough to be part of the 90% of us who appreciate Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you will be very, VERY happy you went out of your way."

","Being a martial-artist myself the martial-arts scenes of the Matrix was the biggest let down of the movie. And so much of that movie depended on them. ""Crouching tiger, Hidden dragon"" is quite different in most respects. The martial-arts are true and gives great justice to Chinese traditions (except for the flying and walking-on-walls part but thats just really cool). And even better is that the movie doesn't depend upon it. I think this is the most beautiful movie i have ever seen in terms of photography, scenery, etc. Even if you're not a martial-artist or even the slightest bit interested in martial-arts this movie is a top notch piece with great actors (i was amazed, i thought Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat only could _fight_ on screen), great script, great martial-arts, great greatness.

","People flying in the air, gliding on roof tops, running on water? Gee, I think I've seen this stuff before in some old chinese martial arts film, although the special effects in the movie makes it look more realistic - but the bottom line is ... it looks so silly it is laughable. If this movie's goal is to engage the viewers with the fight scenes from female martial artists, then I don't think it was that great - basically it is like watching acrobats in Lincoln Center Asian Cultural shows - NO BIG DEAL ANYMORE. Chow Yun Fat, no matter how good he is in other films, is just misplaced in this film - he is a naturally gifted martial artists that this film calls for...a guy like Jackie Chan, Jet Li or the late Bruce Lee would have made this movie 10 times better. The story line is also just too simple for a 2 hr movie - recover a sacred sword from a spoiled brat who happened to be a good fighter from the secrets she stolen. I don't know how well this film is doing in Asia, probably pretty good simply from star attractions - but for those who thinks this movie is so great, they should realize that the majority of fight scenes are nothing special compared to other great chinese martial arts movies and I much prefer Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee fighting than Chow Yun-Fat."

In the interview, he talked about how he wanted all of the fight scenes, and especially the one in the trees, to be real--instead of computer generated--because computers couldn't duplicate the effects of wind on individual leaves and the gentle sway of the trees.  From that comment I knew I would love the film, and I wasn't disappointed in the theater.  The flashback seemed a little out of place, but overall I think it helped the emotional impact.

","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. Like ""Star Wars"", ""E.T."", it is a perfect combination of art and entertainment. It tells a story that everyone can relate to, and everyone probably has dreamed of at some stage of his/her life. Who has not dreamed of flying, free from the limitation of our body, free from the restriction of the world? Who has not dreamed of becoming a master and walking through a troubled life with a brave heart? Who has not experienced, or would like to experience a love that you dare not express?<br/><br/>And how well it tells the story! Two loves, one mature, suppressed, yet still burning like a bright star in dark night, and the other wild and impetuous, yet at the same time innocent and tender. It indeed bears many similarities to ""sense and sensibility"". But what impressed me most is Michelle Yeoh, whose performance is truly remarkable. Her big eyes, restrained facial expressions can say a thousand things at the same time, and say them more eloquently than thousands of words. The other one I want to single out is actually Jade Fox. She is such a complicated character. The last words of her, ""Jen, my only love, ..., and my only enemy, ..."", give me such a strange mixture of feelings: compassion, pity, understanding, and relief.<br/><br/>And of course, I must praise the fight scenes. My favourite is the night chase. At first, I was not that impressed, but it graduately became more exciting, more elegant, and finally, a great dance that transcend the limit of gravity. I simply want to sit back and be grateful that Ang Lee has such a vision to realize a beauty that I have never dreamed of, and at the same time you want to join Jen and Shu-Lian and be part of the fight.<br/><br/>
The final fight scene at the top of the swaying bamboo trees is simply breathtaking. Despite all the physical activities, it feels like a long Zen meditation. It brings the same feeling as only traditional Chinese paintings can, a tranquillity that does not belong to this world.<br/><br/>Ang Lee also gives this movie a unique sense of rhythm. At one moment, your heart pounds so hard that it might just jump out of your throat, yet at another moment you hold your breath to saviour an impossible beauty, and seconds later you would burst into laughter. What a magnificent achievement!<br/><br/>Ang Lee said that he made this movie to realize his boyhood fantasy. He has at least realized mine, for which I am very very grateful. It is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen, and completely in a class of its own."

Not only he uses a lot of wires indoors but he also stages the fights on open ground like a lake or treetops! They reminded me of The Bride of White Hair not only for the action but also because its story is a moving one. It's a love story between the Chow-Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh character and a story about honor and friendship.

","Without doubt Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was one of the most visually stunning films of recent memory. The epic fight scenes were some of the best, martial arts of the highest quality combined with Matrix like 'flying' sequences that added to the impact. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh finally demonstrated to the wider world exactly why their stars have shone so brightly in Hong Kong. Fat again played the stylish suave character he has portrayed so well in his other films, although a little under utilized here, and Michelle Yeoh demonstrated how under utilized her incredible skills were in Tomorrow Never Dies.<br/><br/>The only problem with this film was in its story. Ang Lee did a superb job in weaving an engaging story in this film, but the film got bogged down in its dramatic aspects. Full marks to Lee for trying to incorporate dramatic elements into an action spectacular, but he would have been much better served in keeping more to the action side. The story lagged in several key areas, most notably the whole Desert Romance aside, and it needed one more action scene, such as a more prolonged and epic duel between Li Mu Bai and Jade Fox.<br/><br/>If this film had been leaning more towards a simple action film, no doubt it would have been one of the best ever, and I say that unreservedly. But by being too dramatic, in an effort to add some depth to the story, Ang Lee lost his opportunity for forging a place for Crouching Tiger amongst the greatest all time action films. Still, the story was engaging, and the action scenes will live forever in my memory. A highlight of this year without doubt. 8 out of 10."

","This movie is mesmerizing from the very start and never lets up.  This is a modern day masterpiece and is, in my opinion, the best movie of the past 23 years.<br/><br/>It features some techniques that surely you would not want to see repeated in other films because they would get old fast, but in this film, they are magical.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is brilliant.  I can't wait for the DVD."
"Headrock","10","0","0","25 January 2001"," Misunderstood masterpiece
","One of the first things that every actor learns at the beginning of their path, is that any physical action is a direct result of will. This somewhat vague phrase is the real basis behind Ang Lee's new film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, sadly misunderstood and mistaken by many to be a kung-fu or action film.<br/><br/>The film, presented in almost lyrical form, would be hard to understand for western eyes, such as my own. I know a few people who completely misunderstood the plot, and praised the movie for its action sequences. However, as I have mentioned before, these action sequences are not to be taken as stand-alone, as sadly most action-oriented movies have been asking us to do, lately. To fully realize how wonderful this movie is, one must look at the flight of swords as a dance, brought on by the conflicting viewpoints of the two warriors, Li Mu Bai and young Jen, as the aged warrior holds a stoic taoist calmness even as his sword flickers with the speed of an arrow throughout his battles to tame the tiger. <br/><br/>The true wisdom of the film can be discovered only by listening to the poetic lines that Yun-Fat Chow cleverly intersperses into his conversations, pearls that must be sought after. The struggle is transformed into a song which IS the movie, constructed in the same way that chinese legends had been told for ten thousand generations. The cultural gap between the west and the orient will make this task much harder to perform, but when truly deciphered, the movie takes on a completely different form.<br/><br/>While the story itself is sung to the audience, the brilliantly coordinated fight-scenes weave it together to create a complete entity. Neither may be taken separately, otherwise the movie will lose its original meaning. I take my hat off for Hui-Ling Wang, Kuo Jung Tsai and James Schamus, for transforming the wonderful book into a screenplay, and for Ang Lee, that has made a two hour film about love, inner-strength, and the taoist way.<br/><br/>To sum these up, I recommend to anyone who liked the movie to see it again with new eyes. Hopefully, this movie will set the way for a renewed intelligence and beauty in movies in this new century."

","That about says it. Might sound strange for a 'kung-fu flick' but this is more than just another action movie. Indeed, it is a martial arts masterpiece, but it also has romance, adventure and everything else one would expect in a true epic.<br/><br/>The luscious tapestry of this film seems to go on forever with one breathtaking vista after another. The interior sets are superb.<br/><br/>
The story and language of the film is poetic and full of metaphor and mysticism. At the same time it keeps marching forward to an infectious drumbeat, and the action is stupendous.<br/><br/>Like most epics, only the big screen can do this film justice. This production is a landmark, a milestone, by which I will judge every other movie that dares to take up the challenge!"

","After reading reviews about this film and seeing comments on TV and so on, you would think that this was not only the best film in the world but the most unique film you will ever see.  <br/><br/>RELAX!<br/><br/>I went into this film expecting to be blown away and maybe, just maybe that was my problem, but people please, come on!  This was a fun film.  It was intriguing and it was well choreographed but the best film of the year?  You have got to be kidding me.  Jackie Chan films are like this and so were all the after school-channel-twenty-chop-socki shows that I watched when I was a kid.  I think I have a hard time understanding the discrimination between what is art and what is fun...because this is fun to me, nothing more.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film gets some of its praise because it is directed by Ang Lee. He has made some other films that critics have drooled over that were actually just okay films.  See The Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility, they were critical darlings but just average films.  I am not saying that this is a bad film, quite the contrary.  But it is not in the same realm as Traffic and Gladiator as best films of the year.<br/><br/>What is to like about the film is the martial arts.  I love watching that one warrior that has been trained better than any other who just seems to be invincible.  Here, that is Chow Yun Fat.  He is one of the last of a dying breed of warrior that gets his training from an ancient religion.  You have to go to a mountain to receive this training and it takes all of your life to master it.  You are then something like a Jedi once you have mastered this.  Of course there are those out there that are vengeful and they want to steal the secrets and swords and such and this launches the journey that the movie takes us on.  The journey is to recover a stolen sword. <br/><br/>
There is nothing wrong with this film.  As a matter a fact, I like it very much.  But it bothers me when judgments are clouded by films like this this one and yet a similar film can be passed off as fluff or entertainment.  Why the prejudism?  Why is one film better than another?  <br/><br/>So my advice is simple.  Go to this film, see it and enjoy, but please don't be looking for another Gone With The Wind.  That is the critics job to tell you that.  But be your own judge. <br/><br/>8 out of 10- a great film and fun to watch, but don't believe the hype!"

","George Lucas used to say that the concept of Jedi is borrowed from some ancient Chinese warriors.  I always wonder what they are.  After watching Crouching Tiger, I finally see the original Jedi.  As a diehard Jedi fan, I really enjoy watching this movie. What an incredible experience!  I hope the Jedi in next Star War can fight like these tigers and dragons.  The clothes of Jedi even look like the Wudan warriors.  I watched this movie with a Taiwanese friend.  He told me that the concept of `the force' in star war is similar to the `internal strength' in Wuxia novel.  The Wudan School have ancient kung-fu scroll that teaches them how to meditate to gain internal strength so that they can jump much higher than normal people.  However, most of the Chinese know this `fact' so it wasn't explained in the movie. There are also something left unexplained in the movies that later I found out they were just common knowledge among Chinese people. For example, Bo was numbed by Jade Fox and later un-numbed by Li Mu Bai in a fight scene. I was told that this `paralysis touch' is very popular in Wuxia movie. Warrior with higher internal strength can poke on some certain spot (collectively termed as vital points) on their enemy and make them temporarily paralysed. Poking on other certain vital points can also make people temporarily deaf or dumb. And internal strength can also be transfused to heal other people, like in the end of the movie Li tried to heal Jen when she was drugged by some essence.  This movie is so excellent I can't wait to see the squeal. Spoiler ahead I was told that one of the clichÃ© in Wuxia novel is that people who jump off a cliff usually won't die but end up finding secret cave that has some kung-fu scroll. Wow! Can't wait to see Jen again in the sequel!"

The fight scenes are absolutely the most incredible EVER put on a motion picture screen, makes the Matrix fight scenes look like Barney vs. Barney.  The flying was taken one step too far.

"berliner","Null","0","0","22 January 2001"," Divided Opinion
","The opinions about this movie seem to be divided between ""Five Star"" and ""Five Rotten Eggs"". I know why: most of IMDB voters come from North America and Europe, not China or Southeast Asia. They are not used to the martial arts movies where<br/><br/>1. people ""float"" because they can make their bodies light as a feather and 2. if you hit somebody on the right positions in his body with your finger he cannot move until someone releases him and 3. there is a poison that can reverse the direction of your blood circulation.<br/><br/>As a result, some people are very amazed and say, ""This is better than the Matrix!"" while others unimpressedly say ""This has gone too far! What is this thing, walking on water and floating in the air!""<br/><br/>I come from Southeast Asia, and therefore am quite used to the martial arts movies from China. This is why I could concentrate more to the other aspects as acting, story, and directing.<br/><br/>The acting and directing part is superb. I never doubted the ability of Ang Lee or Michelle Yeoh, but before I watched Anna and the King I never really took Chow Yun Fat seriously. To me he was just another greedy actor from Hong Kong who stars in nine or ten movies in a year and still want to record an album just for the sake of money. I guess he has changed dramatically and do quite well in this movie, although it was not an Oscar performance.<br/><br/>I find the story a little disturbing, especially with the character of Jen Yu (original Shiao Lung) who seems to be too ""Flower Generation""-ish for the setting era. It was like, what, China in the third, fourth century before Christ, and the sex revolution has already begun in China. That is not how a chinese girl at the time would have done, and without proper explanation too! I mean how is it possible for a woman to hate and fear a man a minute, and fall in love and have sex with him the next.<br/><br/>Not that the character is shallow. Jen Yu is a rebel child who wants to get away from her parents' overprotective hands. And she has a frightening talent with the sword. That is a powerful combination that makes her so dangerous, but thirsty of love at the same time. But still I need an explanation about that sex scene.<br/><br/>But in the end, I should say that this movie is far different than any other martial arts movies I have ever seen (the ones that are usually directed by Tsui Hark and starred Jet Lee or Andy Lau). The story is not as simple as ""he-killed-my-father- now-I'm-gonna-have-revenge"". It is far more developed and complex, and quite touching.<br/><br/>So for all of you who haven't watched it, do so. It would give you a picture of what's happened (and happening) in the chinese movie industry for the past couple of decades. For all of you who have watched this movie, expect more from the new generation of chinese directors like Ang Lee, John Woo, and Tsui Hark. They're invading Hollywood like storm!"

","9/11  9:30 am CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (*****)<br/><br/>The best martial arts film ever made (and, quite possibly, the best film of the year).  The action scenes kick ass and the characters are rich and complex.  The drama and emotional stakes are very high and the film achieves a believable tone of fantasy.  Roger Ebert was in attendance at our screening.  I asked director Ang Lee after the film what compels him to make so many films with strong female characters and he started by replying, ""I'm not a macho guy.""  He went on to give a thoughtful and detailed answer which basically boils down to him being interested in strong women like his wife.  In answer to another question, Ang Lee stated that although this is a martial arts action film, he went about it as if he was making a musical, treating the fight scenes as dance numbers that are an extension and heightened expression of the characters."

","I thought this movie was excellent. The cinematography was breathtaking, the locations used were beautiful, the choreography in the fight scenes was very intricate and astounding, the acting was above par in all cases, and the cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma were beautiful.<br/><br/>However, i do have a few complaints about the film. I won't spoil the ending by saying anything specific, but the overall conclusion to the film was overly melodramatic, which i really don't like in a film, especially one that otherwise would've been much better.<br/><br/>And i have a problem with all the wire suspension tricks in the film. Certainly it gives the fight scenes an interesting style, but in a film like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which is for the most part very realistic, the flying stunts just don't fit. There were certain scenes when a character would jump, and another would grab that character by the foot, and instead of crashing to the ground, the jumping character would just stay stationary in mid-air, through some phenomenon that goes unexplained, except by the vague comment that Li Mu Bai makes, ""had enough flying?""<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a better historical drama than it is an action movie. Sure, the actions scenes are beautifully choreographed and shot, but the impossible wire suspension stunts remove the element of believability that is necessary to excite the audience. Despite it's flaws, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" succeeds as a drama, with some very memorable images and characters."

I know about Chinese myths, so I don't mind the over dramatization with long flights thru the air. BUT, it didn't look any good. It looked stumbling, not graceful. It was to slow. Actually the one time it looked good was the first time we only see a shadow darting through the roof. Some of the fight scenes looked Ok, but not the best I've seen(Tai-chi, Shoulin Monks, Judo Saga...).<br/><br/>
 When it comes to the drama of this movie, it stumbles to much. A mediocre love story. Not a very good plot. And the film change it's rhythm on numerous occasions.

","I'm really in the minority on this one but I did not especially care for this film.  The good points:  it was visually beautiful and peopled with stunningly attractive actors wearing lovely costumes.  The score was compelling.  I didn't mind the subtitles at all; reading the words as I hear them in another language, rather than being a hindrance, adds another level of depth for me.  But....<br/><br/>The plot sequence sometimes seemed confusing and choppy.  I often wondered where the action was taking place (except during the delightful desert scenes, which were my favourite in the movie.)  I thought the fight scenes were too long, hyperactive-looking (even frenetically robotic when compared with the graceful leaps across the rooftops), and not especially amazing. I love fantasy but didn't find much (beyond the deviance of gravity) that seemed fantastical.  I liked looking at the characters and their expressive faces, but couldn't empathise with them; character development seemed quite minimal to me.  I'm finding it hard to see beneath the story's surface and discover layers of symbolism and meaning there.<br/><br/>I don't watch martial arts films per se and don't know much about the various philosophies of such.  Does this position hurt or help me in understanding this film?  I don't know.  I suppose it hurts but the vast majority of the American public doesn't know much about Wu Xia, I suspect, and they love the film!  I wanted to like it.  Typically, I find foreign films fascinating and revel in seeing gripping stories of people from other cultures.  (I loved Raise The Red Lantern, which I kept thinking of during the viewing of this film.)<br/><br/>The bottom line is this:  I am a crouching pariah among rabid dragons!

Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu is superb as the young girl with enormous talent for the martial arts and Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox is her master that has been eclipsed by the student.<br/><br/>The sound track is one of the most compelling I have heard in a long, long time  It is subtle and enhances the scenes instead of detracting from them. It is powerful yet quiet  much as the character Li Mu Bai is.<br/><br/>The photography was beyond superb.  I just never knew what I was going to see next  from magnificent over-shots of the city of Peking, to the stark and barren desert wasteland that Lo (Chang Chen) inhabits to the verdant forest in which the best martial arts scene takes place.  This is a China that few people will ever see and it is worth going to the film just for the photography.<br/><br/>I am so glad this film was not dubbed into English  hopefully it never will be.  To see the characters moving their mouths in the beautiful Mandarin language and hearing something else would be a crime.<br/><br/>As I said above  there is a great deal here  too much to describe  it is a film that must be seen."

There is so much poetry in the telling of this story of love and denial. It has the power to amaze and awaken the heart because it comes from a deep place that we yearn to return to. The main characters each follow a different heroic path shaped by their individual experiences: the fight-weary master, ready to seek a peaceful existance; the strong woman capable of loving only one man; the restless adolescent, with dreams of greatness. Their stories unfold amidst the backdrop of intrigue and cinematic beauty. Their interlocking fate moves them toward an ending that has as much impact as any we could hope for.

"MetroRev","5","0","0","22 January 2001"," Okay...did i miss something?
","**Contains Spoiler**<br/><br/>I thought that I'd seen one of the worse Kung Fu movies ever made and instead i come to read tons of reviews praising it.  Did I miss something? The movie is decent compared to old 70's and 80's kung fu flicks, only it tried to provide some sort of plot that doesn't work in any sense. The characters seem to move about as if there was a great busing system and they toss in a lengthy back story about the young girl and the nomad only to never really use the nomad character again.   The effects are no where near spectacular and i've seen better fight scenes a thousand times, again, in old Kung Fu movies.<br/><br/>Next, Wudan is supposed to be some sacred art but everyone can do it.  And one lady learns it entirely from a book and then teaches it to another woman who apparently learned it well enough to keep up with the great swords man played by Chow Fat.  Thats one very well written book, let me tell you. On top of that the little girl learns it on her spare time.  I guess all that meditating isn't really needed is it.  Just grab a copy of the book and when you can, slip in a couple of training sessions here and there and BAM! You can do Wudan too! Then, my biggest gripe, the story telling.  The whole movie builds this sense that Chow and Jade Fox must fight and then they cheat you with that ending that takes five seconds.   Chow is hit with a poison dart and knows he will die!!! The horror.  Did anyone bother to think that maybe Jade Fox would have been smart enough to keep an antidote close to her in the slight chance that while making all ten thousand darts she may get pricked??? But no, so the little girl knows how to make it and decides to ride a horse (did anyone remember that she can essentially fly) to go get it and now, after everyone has seemingly been moving from place to place with no sign of travel time she takes an eternity to get the antidote.  Just enough time for Chow and Michelle Yeoh to say what they have to say before he dies and she continues on with her life of never loving him.  THEN! Which is the most bizarre moment, the little girl jumps off a bridge.  Leaving Michelle Yeoh and the nomad guy.  I guess they'll team up in the sequel.<br/><br/>The movie is, plain and simple, a typical kung fu movie with american production values, meaning a big budget.  If you like Kung fu movies then knock yourself out, it was fun to watch.  Otherwise go into the theater ready to read and try and figure out why...WHY they show the little girl, whose father is stabbed in the head, inviting the body guard guy in, seemingly for sex, and then never show her again(and the body guard guy basically fades away after that too).  WHY there are scenes where the characters sound as if they are talking in modern tongue (i.e. Nomad guy to young girl, ""i would have been here sooner but there was traffic???).  WHY did Sony put up money for a movie that has been done better for way less money, hundreds of times.<br/><br/>P.S.  I would like some one who really liked this movie to e-mail me and try to show me the light.  Try and show me what i am missing because i have been really shocked to find people who really thought this movie as something special.<br/><br/>OVERALL A FOUR(4)<br/><br/>Thanks."

","To the Chinese population and the unknowing others:<br/><br/>Don't get too excited about the hype. We Chinese folk have seen these films before, where people fly around and do their kung fu. Now don't get me wrong. This film is beautifully shot, has great music, and the fight scenes are magnificent (Makes 'The Matrix' looks like PBS).<br/><br/>Here are the major problems:<br/><br/>1. The 2 main characters: Chow Yun Fat & Michelle Yeoh and another character - Lo - are Cantonese speakers. This movie is in Mandarin. It is a little difficult, a bit funny, and quite annoying listening to them speak. I didn't know if it was better to listen to them or watch the English translation.<br/><br/>2. The main part had meant to go to Jet Li, but he dropped out to do Romeo Must Die, so Chow Yun Fat got the role. Chow Yun Fat doesn't know martial arts, so he basically doesn't fight in the movie. The fight scenes are left to the women. And it makes you think how great the movie could have been if Jet Li was in it.<br/><br/>3. Michelle Yeoh is unbelievable behind the sword, but her acting is shallow. It often seemed as if she was a bit fake and just reading from a script.<br/><br/>4. The plot line is actually quite shallow, with the ""we must find the sword and then fall in love"" ordeal. Luckily the artistry and action overshadows it.<br/><br/>** Now, don't get me wrong. This is still a fantastic film. And to the non-Chinese, this will be a dazzling experience . . . unless you don't like people flying around on those invisible strings."
"tranquil","9","0","0","22 January 2001"," An engrossing interplay of martial arts, romance, and emotions.
","Without a doubt, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the most dazzling films of the year.  The scope of the film is epical, like that of Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator.  Artistic visualization was superb, from the deep wheel tracks outside the ancient capital to the magical chase through air, water, forest, and land.  From the bleakly yellow, cracked earth of the desert outlands to the lush and vibrant forests of the mountainsides, from the sullen imperial magnificence captured in the panorama of the Forbidden City to the stout display of human will and fortitude depicted in the mountain monastery, the film is a vast ocean of visual similes and metaphors.<br/><br/>The characters are well fleshed out and poly-dimensional.  Respectful traditions clashes with youthful abandon as the old and young ideals collide.  Love, romance, hate, revenge, all the emotions are given a domain in the film and their interplay is what makes the movie a philosophical giant.<br/><br/>Fighting-wise, the movie holds up to its promise.  From the very start, characters wielding an interesting variety of melee weapons clash and chase. Masterful choreography helps blends the very limbs of the combatants into a thunderous whirlwind of strikes and parries.  The punches, wristlocks, and the amazing footwork will have the viewer dazzled.<br/><br/>If you still have not had the pleasure of watching this movie, you are missing out on something wonderfully refreshing and elegant.  Go for it!"

The ""flying sequences"" are so beautiful and so are the aerial shots of old Beijing (kudos to MANEX).<br/><br/>This film has already been called the MATRIX of swordfighting films. Why? The fighting sequences are graceful yet powerful. Unlike Matrix where superhumans fight, this film replaces that with a touch of graceful ballet like fights between characters. and guess what, just like the MATRIX, this movie might also get a go ahead for 2 more sequels.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is definitely one of the best swordfighting movies out there.

","Martial Arts movies are coming back!  I can't remember the last time I went to a subtitled movie in a crowded theater, but the hype around Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon must be working.  A recent Saturday matinee was packed.<br/><br/>People are going to see a film in Cantonese, but not all of them can handle it.  I heard a lady complaining that she couldn't keep up with the dialogue while we were leaving the theater.  (My nine year old son had no problems.) And there were a lot of giggles during the ethereal fight scenes. Apparently, some people can't suspend reality enough to be awed by martial artists trained in the Wudan discipline flying through the air.  (Okay, it looks kind of silly in print, but it works.)<br/><br/>I went to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with very high expectations. Most of the movie reviewers I read have it on their Best of 2000 lists.  I liked the movie very much, especially Peter Pau's cinematography, but I wish I'd gone into the film knowing a little less about it. <br/><br/>
It's a gorgeous movie with great acting.  Anyone who fell in love with Chun Yow Fat in The King and I will enjoy his Li Mu Bai.  He is the moral center who grounds the story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. <br/><br/>
But, the real surprise is the strength of the female characters in the film. Director Ang Lee seems to gravitate toward projects with strong female leads, and that's why his movies will continue to stand out.  In my opinion, the two best fight scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are staged between two women, and they are phenomenal.  Audiences are reacting to martial arts moves and cheering that girls are kicking butt.  That made me happy, as I've studied martial arts for over four years.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) is a great role model for girls.  She has dignity and manners, grace under fire and a knowledge of weapons!  Chen Chang (Lo) and Ziyi Zhang (Jen) are both wonderful actors who bring a youthful energy and at times much needed comic relief to the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, there's comedy and tragedy and a story and a very powerful sword all set in beautiful China surroundings.  I worry that if Ang Lee has started a trend, that the future movies with martial arts will not bother with anything beyond action.  For now though, get to this trendsetter, if you think you can handle it.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is rated PG-13 for martial arts violence and some sexuality.  And you need have the ability and desire to read the dialogue.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon earns 4 stars on my scale, 0-5.  It's stylish and subtitled, raising the bar for foreign films and leap kicking over it with jaw dropping action.  The best part is that the questions of who is the Crouching Tiger and who is the Hidden Dragon are open for debate.  Buddha's name be praised."

"deathstar_industries","10","0","0","20 January 2001"," Excellent, but not quite excellent enough.....
","Note: spoilers contained herein.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this film is a classic (already) and is easily one of the best films I have seen in the last couple of years (Fight Club & American Beauty also make the list), however when I went into the cinema I wanted to be amazed, and thrilled (which I was), but I also wanted to see a movie which would revolutionise Hollywood. Unfortunately this is not that movie. The fight scenes are spectacular and reminiscent of those classic Chinese kung-fu films from the 70's, incidentally the characters don't fly, they float (Ang Lee's words, not mine). Although these fight scenes are choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, they are totally different to those found in The Matrix (despite what you may have heard), they are much more balletic, and if you can believe it they are much more stylised. Take for example the first 'fight' where Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is chasing Jen (Zhang Ziyi); they jump from roof-top to roof-top barely touching the roof once. The fight continues on the ground where Shu Lien runs about thirty feet up a wall as if she were running on the ground! This type of action is obviously not to everyone's tastes; about 70% of the audience were, like me, in awe. 20% were sitting, shaking their heads and laughing, uttering things like, 'nah, nah maaan... they've taken it TOO far!'. The others, who had probably never seen a 'traditional' Chinese martial arts film, were simply thinking to themselves, 'What the F**K is this!'. I can appreciate how people would think all of these things, but if you let it, the film will drag you in, and by the time you witness the chase between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Jen across the cloud forest you could easily believe that they have total control over gravity.<br/><br/>As you may have gathered the martial arts scenes have stuck in my head (to the extent that I had to see the film several times), however it is not just the fighting which makes the movie. Romances between the lead characters are interwoven between the fights, and thankfully the romance lacks all of that Hollywood slush which everyone hates so much. In my opinion the romance between Jen and Lo in the desert is much more effective than the romance witnessed between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, this is because I felt that a few of Chow Yun-Fat's lines were erring on the wrong side of cheesy. Having said that the emotions are very well conveyed considering it is subtitled and could have easily lost the whole essence in the translation. On that same note, the humour, amazingly, remains intact. Something notoriously difficult to do, I don't think I've ever laughed at a subtitled film before, unless it was at the appalling translation. As many say, the secret to successful comedy is timing, and the translators have somehow managed to preserve the comedy in the film.<br/><br/>All of these things are wrapped up in some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen, and I wish the film the best of luck at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Bad points? Well like I say I was hoping for a revolution in the way people make and view movies, but this is an unrealistic hope, since I'm not sure any film in the history of moving pictures has truly changed the direction of cinema, perhaps nudged it off the beaten path, but never in a totally different direction. So, my only real criticism was the predictable ending (the instant Lo was relating the story of the boy who leapt from the mountain to make his wishes come true, you just KNEW what was going to happen at the end). Still better a predictable ending rather than an awful one.<br/><br/>I hope people won't ignore this film simply because it is subtitled, to do so would be criminal since it is undoubtedly going to be one of the best films of the year. I implore you to go and see it."

Yet, it was compensated for in the beautiful, breathtaking tree scene. Also, the part where the governor's daughter wipes out a sleaze filled restaurant was so poorly done, with overwhelming slapstick you would find in a jackie chan crossover-American movie. You'd think you were watching ""Rush Hour"" or ""Shanghai Noon,"" which were entertaining in a different sense. This film had the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. The end featured the devastatingly haunting battle in the swaying trees, the utopian melodious echoes of the cascading river, and best of all the very end featured the Wu-something mountain.

","I usually do not watch martial-arts movies and I would not have gone to see this one if id had not been for all the tremendous critical acclaim it has been getting since its release. I was not disappointed. Crouching Tiger is a drama, a romance and an action movie rolled up into one very fascinating package. <br/><br/>Of course the fight sequences are the heart of the movie. They are what gains the most attention and they deserve all the praise they are getting. I must admit though, that I found it a little irritating at first, that the fighters are obviously dangling from wires during large parts of those fights. But after a short while I came to simply accept, that for those fighters gravity is not a factor. And even when they are on the ground those people perform a few of the most amazing moves I have seen so far.<br/><br/>However this movie would not be so special if it was all about action and nothing else. There is more. The physical action is complemented by two very different love-stories. One is mature and sensible - and essentially unhappy. The other one is young and wild, passionate, socially inappropriate - and just as unhappy. Director Ang Lee found four excellent actors to impersonate the four people involved in those love-stories.<br/><br/>
The only complaint (if you want to call it that) I have about Crouching Tiger... really is, that it is too short. I would have loved to know more about these people. Unfortunately Ang Lee is not known to be a big maker of sequels. So since there probably will not be another - go see this one!"

The DVD contains an audio commentary by Ang Lee & James Schamus, 16X9, AC-3, etc.  Ang Lee has done another great job, especially for a person who has never directed a martial arts film before.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this movie great are the personalities and emotions of the characters.  Like Ang Lee's previous work, not only is the story engaging, it's the characters that makes the movie work so well.  Chow Yun-Fat plays such a cool & noble character; it makes him the perfect actor to play the role of Li Mu Bai.  Ziyi Zhang plays the role of Jen Yu perfectly as a reckless and uncontrollable teen who thirsts for love, power & independence.  For any parents who have her for a daughter, she would be their perfect nightmare.  Michelle Yeoh also does a great job with her role as Yu Shu Lien.  Chow Yun-Fat & Michelle Yeoh's accent does stand out, but their acting abilities and the story does not make it a distraction to the movie.<br/><br/>In Chinese folklore, the characters are known for making huge leaps over walls and water.  Watching the fighting scenes and escapes, it takes a little getting use to accepting the idea that these characters can literally fly in mid-air, but as Michelle Yeoh said on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" the story is fictional, but the emotions of the characters are real. So the martial arts scenes are beautifully done.  They are eye candy that really makes you really appreciate the actors' abilities, the pre-production, the choreography, and even the editing involved in the martial art scenes.<br/><br/>So most of all, the characters are the best part of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  On IMDB, this movie is listed as a ""Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Drama, Romance"" movie.  What a perfect description, because this movie has all of that!<br/><br/>I give it 9 out of 10. **** (A)"

","There have been so many wonderful reviews about this movie. I just want to clarify a few things for some of the users.<br/><br/>Many people criticized the heavily *wire* works used in this movie, thought they are not the *real* martial arts like Jackie Chan's movies. But what they might not know is that there have always been two types of these kind of movies in China and Taiwan. One kind is called martial art (like Jackie Chan's movies), realistic but within human limitation. The other kind is called Wu Xia, which only exists in Chinese wildest imagination.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger..."" is the later kind. It's unfair and ignorant to compare it with realistic kind of martial art movies!<br/><br/>Ang Lee did an extremely well job to capture and visualize that imagination for most Chinese who ever read Wu Xia novels.  I feel sorry for those who can only relate this movie to the Peter Pan. Remember, it's a movie made for Chinese! Not a fortune cookie made for Western audience.<br/><br/>
But what I found extraordinary about this movie is that Ang Lee first time directed this type of movies and attempted to create one which is very different from the thousands of its kind being done in the past, and he accomplished that!<br/><br/>I always thought the fun of movie watching is it transpots us to a different experience. If you were that type of people who can't leave cell phones at the door and allow to be apart from *reality* for two hours. Perhaps this is not a movie for you.

","Forgive me this moment of supposition but I think I may have just seen the film of the year. I know it's only January but this epic fantasy makes such an impression that it will take something truly special to challenge it. Taiwanese director Ang Lee says this was the film that he always wanted to make and after much critical acclaim for his recent Western character-driven pieces he has finally been able to realise that dream. The current fad in Hollywood is martial arts fight scenes and it seems that every action hero, and indeed villain, must be capable of   chop-sockying their way out of a tight spot. So it's great to see kung fu in it's natural environment, a romantic myth of love and honour in ancient China. These kind of stories are churned out at a frightening pace by the far-Eastern film industry, but Lee was able to assemble some of the biggest Asian film stars and a most experienced crew and combine them with his knack for drawing out well-rounded characters and picking great locations to produce something truly special.<br/><br/>The main story follows two warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), and their search to retrieve the famous Green Destiny sword after it is stolen by a mysterious intruder. Yeoh and Yun-Fat return to their old stomping grounds after attempting to make an impact in America and it's clear why they are two hottest properties in Eastern cinema. They show that while they are both known as action stars they are more than able to handle the sideplot of struggling with their unspoken feelings for each another. However, I get the feeling that the only reason they are credited above Ziyi Zhang ('The Road Home') is due to their crowd pulling reputation, as the young Chinese actress is absolutely riveting as Jen, the headstrong aristocrat who the experienced warriors try to tame and who rapidly becomes the films central character. If 'The Road Home' proved that rising star Zhang can act then CT,HD shows that she can kick arse at the same time and really is one to watch.<br/><br/>The kung fu itself is beautifully choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, he who stunned Hollywood with 'The Matrix' fights and although the wire work may not be realistic it is part for the course in this genre and employed to great effect. The duels scorch across the screen so that after each confrontation you find yourself scrabbling around on the cinema floor to try and retrieve your jaw. But CT,HD is made so much more than a succession of well-executed fisticuffs by the tale which holds it all together, conjuring up some really tearful, emotional moments.<br/><br/>It's a foregone conclusion that CT,HD will win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, but I would be surprised if it hasn't staked an outright claim for Best Picture too."

","This film contains some of the best individual scenes, whether of action, romance or humour, that I've seen in a long time, but I was slightly disappointed at the poor linking of these scenes into a movie, particularly the flashback thing in the middle and the change in location after the wedding, so that at the start of each scene it took me a moment to work out what was meant to be happening. The characters seem to turn up in a situation that justifies a fight in a way that makes the Matrix look coherent. Having said that, the fights themselves are incredibly well done, skillfully performed and filmed and often with a subtle humour to them, and between the fights the dialogue manages not to be too corny, even in subtitles."
"Sunny99","10","0","0","18 January 2001"," Great film! -- Answering why they need a horse when she seems can 'fly'?
","Answering why they need a horse when she seems can 'fly'?<br/><br/>
I think this is a very culture thing.  People understanding this Wu-xia culture will not consider this strange, but people with no previous exposure to Wu-xia (like several viewer here) may think this is not 'logical'-- if they can fly, why they need a horse?  I will explain this here.<br/><br/>I am a PhD student in engineering, and I think I am a person with reasonable sense.  I did not see this any strange or 'ridiculous' as other viewers think.<br/><br/>Let me try to help explain this.  The 'flying' in the Wu-xia is more like a 'great leap'.  These legendary fighters were trained whole life, often from they were still young kids, to be great fighter.  Some of the extremely accomplished ones were said can run very fast (Chin-Kung), jump extreme high (from ground to roof or treetop), and fight lightening fast.  Some old story said they carry some metal weights on their body everyday since young age, and increase it step by step, over 10, 20 years until the weight is many time their own body weight and they still can move as normal people.  Then when they finish the training, remove the weight, they can run/jump/move extremely fast/high like magic.<br/><br/>Don't tell me this is impossible--this is more like legendary stories passed from generation to generation.  We like the 'little mermaid' the American kid watched all the time, no one really charge Disney to ""show me a real mermaid"" or ""take your c**py cartoon back""? (I like the little mermaid a lot, by the way.  I enjoy setting my imagination free and feel the touching part of that story.)<br/><br/>
So why they need a horse when she can fly/run so fast?  Well, legendary heroes are still people.  They still got killed and they have tears and blood as everyone, as you can see from the movie. (That's why we like them so much.) Their strength also has limits, so they need to conserve their energy for unforeseen danger. They cannot waste their energy unnecessarily...(it is not like some Hollywood action hero, who have ""unlimited bullet supply"" with him so he can shoot unstop until all the bad guys are dead, and no bullet from bad guys ever touched him... which is, to me, more like video game than reality--but good entertainment, still)<br/><br/>We all agree Michael Johnson an excellent runner and jumper, and he have lots of energy, but is he faster than a horse when compete on a 5 mile track?  and if he know he may need energy to compete (fight) afterward, will he run for 5 mile or will he rather take a fast horse to get the medicine to save someone he cared? The answer is very clear.<br/><br/>I think picking the ""horse thing"" and criticize this film is plainly unnecessary and cannot be justified.  Please open your mind and you may enjoy the whole world (besides movies)  a lot more than you think possible.<br/><br/>
By the way, I am from Taiwan as the CTHD's director Ang Lee and producer Hsu.  I read the Wu-xia novels since I was in elementary school.  I can fully understand why Ang Lee say it is his childhood dream to make a Wu-xia film.  In Wu-xia, you can just set your imagination free, and let the heroes move/fight/jump as their deepest emotion flow...to right the wrongs, to save the ones they loved.<br/><br/>Didn't you ever wished you can fly like a bird when you were 5 years old?"

","This is a truly great movie. All the talk about the fighting sequences, flying and special effects don't really in my opinion begin to describe why this movie is so good. I think that Crouching Tiger is very similar to Titanic in that the story of the boat sinking and the cost of the film and the hype of Dicaprio's starring were really just distant background to a darkly intense story about courage and love. In the same way, the martial arts fighting in Crouching is really just background (a very interesting and exciting one) to a story about meaning in life. The real story is the integrity, loyalty, growth and honesty of the characters. From the innocent beginning of the master's telling of his difficulty in finding peace in his meditations to the devastating honesty of the ending - this movie is an emotional rollercoaster. The music/soundtrack is viciously haunting and mournful. The cello playing by Yo-Yo ma is so beautiful. I remember halfway through the film being momentarily stunned when I realized I was watching a subtitled movie. This movie should be released as widely as possible. I am sure it is in for a titanic of a ride."

","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of the most highly anticipated films in such an old-school, samurai-movie-lacking culture we possess in modern day America.

"Kaleem","10","0","0","16 January 2001"," Just a few explanations
","After reading all the critics from imdb, here is a few explanations. When I watch Matrix in London in summer 99, I have heard people in the cinema talking about how original and cool the actions in the film was. But as a person who grew up in Hong Kong, all those action in Matrix look familiar. The action designer or say choreography of Matrix Yuen Wo Ping (cantonese) had design action for bunch of WuXia or Kung Fu film in Hong Kong (the most famous was Jakie Chan's Snake arm and cat's craw). The Beijing born Yuen who himself is a WuXia novel fan, what he did was just put the WuXia style of duel in  Matrix and showed it to the western audience, not the other way round, which CTHD as a Wuxia film itself copy from Matrix.<br/><br/>Lot of Westerners were annoyed by the flying scenes. Basically this is a WuXia film, not a kung fu film. Wu Xia novels is a genre of Chinese novel which usually have adventures, martial arts, fantasies and romance (sometime politics and history) elements. In this world there are different style of Kung Fu masters, from different schools/styles the most famous of these schools included Shao Lin Temple, Wudan (the school of Li Mu Bai), Er Mei, Wah San etc... all these school have different marshal arts secrets plus other special powers such as healing with Qi Kong etc. Usually these masters have different occupations such as monks, robbers, royal guards, leader of society, hermit etc. There  are heroes (usually with sad endings) and villains. Sound more like in a fantasy world, ah? Yes, some Wuxia novels have historical background, but most are like fantasy. In a Hong Kong magazine, it tried to introduced the coming Tokien Lord of RIngs film to Chinese. It used the description 'A western style  Wu Xia Film'. It probably give you an idea what a WuXia world likes.<br/><br/>The most famous WuXia Novelist in last few decades are Jin Rong and Koo Lung etc. Another thing need to clarify is these warrior cannot 'fly', they can according to these novels, out run horse in a short distance , leap up 30 feets and can jumping from trees to trees, run up walls etc. This technique is call qing gong which through but physical (running and jumping with lead tight on legs etc) and breathing/meditation can maximise human potential of inner power and reach a state which can control body weight. This technique can usually use for short period time due its explosiveness use up a lot of internal energy and that's why Jen couldn't leap/glide all the way back to down when she tried to save Li's life at the end. All this doesn't sound scientisfical I agree, however Wu Xia novels have exist in China for hundreds of years, long before Newton define law of gravity. Classical chinese Wu xia novelists had use their imagination and myth to wrote all these stories and defined all these speical techniques. Some of these technique are true, such as lightning sword fight, acrobatic kick etc (I have lived Beijing for two years and seen lots of these both in live show and documentry programme on tv) but some could be fictitious , just like spells, alchemy or wizary for Western people, only appears on films, novels and myths. It would be as unrealistic if not to contain those leaping/flying in a movie base on a 19th century Wu Xia movie as not having hobbits and magic in the Lord of Rings movie.<br/><br/>Be frank, the flying/leaping scenes in CTHD is not exaggerate at all for WuXia film standard, there are some Jet Li films directed by Tsui Hak in early 90s (such as Undefeatable East etc) had Kung Fu warrioirs leaping up hundred of feets cliff and really flying (not even gliding).<br/><br/>My rating for the film is 9/10. The action part of the film is not the best I have ever seen in a WuXia/Kung Fu movie (hardcore martial art fan should go for Jet Li's Once upon a time in China series) but the cinematography, acting and music is unparalell for any movie of this genre, the plot is well develop (I speak Mandarin and I found some of the subtitles were quite misleading especially the philosophical ideas from Li). Which made the movie just beautiful in a scene that it's more like an art than a wu xia film."

","My girlfriends co-workers told her this movie had a lot to do with women and that they were basically the main characters in the film. They also said some men might not enjoy the movie for that reason. They were half right.<br/><br/>While the females may have received a greater amount of screen time, I didn't feel at all that the movie was ""based"" on women. I thought all the characters received adequate screen time in order to develop their characters. At one point the film takes close to a 30 minute departure from the main plot to explore the relationship between the governor's daughter and the leader of a group of thieves.<br/><br/>That said- each and every single character in the movie was fantastic. Not only in the actor's portrayal of them, but their significance in the film. I really found myself experiencing an emotion over each of them.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and showed such ridiculous imagination it was almost frightening. The very first battle scene alone made me quickly draw comparisons to the greatness of the Matrix, but quickly surpassed it as the movie drove on. I can't fully expressed how astonished I was left at the end of each and every single combat sequence in this film. I am taken back when I think of how the actors had to truly have knowledge in using the weapons they employed. Incredible respect goes to them.<br/><br/>The subtitles? Not a problem. I even thought after a while that I was beginning to understand the foreign tongue.<br/><br/>Scenery in this film was absolutely breathtaking. There's no need to elaborate on this- take my word on it.<br/><br/>Gladiator was another one of my picks for best movie of the year because of its sheer grandness, but ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" was enormously more anchored in its premise and creativity. This movie is outstanding."

","Warning: Decipherable spoiler ahead. Also hype-challenged curmudgeons, please stay away...in case your sensibilities may be violated.<br/><br/>Heavenly! Sheer heaven of a movie though heaven is not enough for Li Mu Bai. For him, Heaven Can Wait. With his last breath, he affectionately professed his deep abiding love for Shu Lien rather than used it judiciously to attain transcendence into 'heaven'. His love for her welled up so powerfully after such long cowardly reticence that, almost at 'heaven's door', he heroically expended his death gasp to say how much he loved her, thereby relegating his afterlife to that of an earth-bound but love-filled spirit by his lover's side. Not since 'Love Story' have I witnessed a more poignant and loving cinematic moment. Never mind the  sensational balletic fight scenes and the gravity-defying actions; they are merely icing on the cake in this remarkably romantic movie. Trust me ! This is one beautiful, exquisite epic with heart.<br/><br/>My suggestion: See ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" twice to do it justice. Once to read the subtitles so that you comprehend the richly-layered and provoking story. Then, with that out of the way, indulge yourself to a spectacular second viewing in order to be soulfully imbued by the superb acting and evocative nuances of superactors Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh; to be smitten delightfully by the chutzpah and acting abilities of young upstarts, Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen; to be arrestingly awe-struck by the fantastic fight choreography of Master Yuen; to be caressed blissfully by the enchanting Tun Dun's musical score sublimely rendered by Yo-Yo Ma; to be exotically fascinated by  Peter Pao's captivating and inspiringly lush cinematography, and last but not least, to be sent soaring off Wudan Mountain by what is truly a classic in the making. Perhaps, in the year 2020, CTHD will be touted as a genuine cinematic milestone and you can fondly tell your children or children's children that back in 2000/2001, you have the perfect vision to have already seen it as such. What more can I add ? ( Like I warned, I am testing the sensibilities of the curs.  If they read this far, they must be squirming.  Too bad !) In short:  Truly this is Ang Lee's coup de theatre san hypobole.<br/><br/>Footnote:<br/><br/>Don't be dissuaded from seeing this fantastical movie by the cranky 'small people' who post here, with their sneeringly snobbish 'fear of flying'. I guess they are the kind of deadwood folks who never experience exciting fantastical dreams in their sleep, who never ever believe in Santa Claus and who fail to ever laugh at themselves. Yet, very likely, these killjoys enjoy and are thrilled by tinseltown movies in which Arnold, Bruce or Sylvestor can evade harmlessly from thousands of bullets and bomb blasts; can stay healthy enough to fight on after having been beaten to a bloody pulp; can smash up cars and trucks to smithereens without being disabled in the process;  can jump, leap and careen from great heights and perform other superhuman feats and derring-do's in the most outrageous situations while defeating the enemies. I take it that these movie cranks do have suspended disbelief system -- the only problem is that their system is conveniently selective because they are jarred into reality whenever they have to read subtitles and/or on hearing foreign dialogues. If you are one of them, please do yourself a favor, skip this masterpiece and see the ""Dude, ...."" down the hall, instead."

","There's a lot of positive things to be said about this film. There's a lot of very good cinematography, the choreography is superb and all the actors are believable. I even believe that the basic story line was good enough. Unfortunately the overall structure of the film let's it all down.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is the central interlude which gives the back story of the royal daughter. This 20-25 minutes of film occurs just at the wrong point. The main story is just getting going, you're just getting to grips with all the strange things which are going on, you're interest is peaked. Then suddenly we're transported to a different time and place and you're left hanging.<br/><br/>Yes, it serves as an excuse to see some great landscapes, but it just broke the story in two for me. Either this should have been at the start of the film (but that would have been a very slow start), or cut completely. Indeed, the character who is introduced by this sequence is pretty auxiliary to the tale (I think he's there to give some reasons for the other characters actions, but it's not necessary), and I don't think the film as a whole would have suffered if he had never been there.<br/><br/>Ang Lee needs to learn that in a film that was essentially a crime thriller (Who did it? How? Where are they hiding?) you need to keep the audience focused, otherwise they loose interest. At least that's what happened in the theatre I went to see it in.<br/><br/>I've seen the word masterpiece used in conjunction with this film. I would say that those people are mistaking bad story telling with 'an intellectual experience'. Just because something is different, doesn't make it good. My view is that the story just wasn't told very well and should have had much more aggressive editing."

","Anyone raised on a diet of martial arts films starring Steven Seagal, or Jean-Claude Van Damme is used to revenge based plots, sprinkled with banal action sequences and appalling acting.  Jackie Chan helped to change the Western view of martial arts films, infusing them with humor and acrobatic fight sequences.  Few people outside China however have seen a traditional Chinese martial arts film in which fealty, moral dilemmas and spiritual purity are as important to the plot as the fighting.  Ang Lee decided that it was time to rectify this oversight. <br/><br/>Li Mu Bai, a legendary warrior monk, has grown weary of fighting and desires a normal life.  To that end he entrusts his sister-in-law, Yu Shu Lien with the task of delivering ""Green Destiny"" - a sword on par with Excalibur - to an old family friend.  The sword is immediately stolen, leading Li and Yu on a quest where they will confront old enemies, struggle with loyalties and possibly experience love. <br/><br/>I will start with several caveats about this film. Although the main actors (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) have recently starred in Hollywood films, this movie is Chinese, which means subtitles for anyone who hasn't brushed up on their Mandarin.  Some people may be put off by the fantastical elements of the story - characters fly after one another and perform feats equivalent to catching bullets with their teeth.  Finally, the plot can be somewhat difficult to follow at times.  Having dispensed with these minor unpleasantries, I can now focus on the positives.  <br/><br/>The locations and scenery border on the mythical - from the lush bamboo forests, to the cloud enshrouded mountains to the stunning recreation of Peking in it's ancient glory - the viewer is treated to a spectacular visual kaleidoscope.  The intricate action sequences are second to none - exquisitely choreographed by the same man who gave  ""The Matrix"" its oomph - they include amazing feats of gymnastics, a diverse selection of weaponry and last as long as ten minutes.   Finally, the story, in stark contrast to its Hollywood cousins, has substance, multidimensional characters that aren't just fodder for the hero, and examines the possible foibles of misguided loyalties and rigid traditions. <br/><br/>Ang Lee has crafted a striking film that will appeal to any viewer who appreciates fine cinema.<br/><br/>P.S.  bringing the live tiger to the premiere was a great touch"

","I had the fortunate opportunity to watch CTHD while visiting Singapore. CTHD is not a typical kungfu movie that's short on story, big on actions. Instead, CTHD spent time in character development and in its story. The actions and sceneries were breathtaking. There were many amazing fight scenes, particularly some very fast and furious fights and flying on rooftops and beautifully choreographed fighting scenes (flying and floating) atop swaying bamboo branches. The locations in Western China's arid desert and lush, misty Wudan Mountains were simply gorgeous and the period details were done into perfection. The movie's two big stars, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh actually had more of supporting roles as the older and wiser warriors. The movie really belongs to Zhang Ziyi, a new actor whose face bears a resemblance to Gong Li. Zhang was amazing as the governor's daughter whose youthful, arrogant, and emotional character is the center of the story. The best kungfu scenes are the girl fights between Yeoh and Zhang, including the first fight scenes, with the femmes flying on roof tops and fighting hand to hand, kick to kick. The love story between Zhang's Jen and Chang Chen's Lo, set in the Gobi Desert, lent a romantic feel to the movie. As always, Chow showed all charisma whenever he appeared. 60s martial arts femme Cheng Pei Pei is also in CTHD as the villain Jade Fox."

","Having heard of the charming and winsome girl/young woman in The Long Road (Wo de fu qin mu qin) whose eyes and smile were main strengths, it's interesting to see how she has grown.<br/><br/>In Crouching Tiger Ziyi Zhang (Jen) becomes a good/bad character. Early in the film her eyes betray a suspicious and crafty inner character who has much to hide. At this point, as we recognize that it is Jen, despite a mask, acting as a flying war machine we see a strong and capable feminist character. Women should love her. Not to be trusted, however, she steals the sword and escapes marriage to the man her parents have chosen. Portraying a character who smiles less and pouts more, you have to look behind the face to see her warm personality. She fights and flies like a magician. Very pretty, she has a couple of very mild sex scenes to show that she has grown up. Only at the very end, does the director allow her to become a nice person and then there are hints that she becomes a helpless little girl. Of course, we all know that she will go on to the master's school to get her Ph.D. in kung fu, although it is clear that she needs little improvement. Throughout the film, Jen has had a split personality (the good/bad part) who has had to negotiate between very powerful and opposing forces and you aren't absolutely certain what she will become. The funniest line, because it is supposed to be serious, is at the end when Yun-Fat Chow gives her his last and only piece of advice, ""No matter what you become, be true to yourself."" That's all she's been. He, on the other hand, is a Tolstoy character searching for the truth."

","Nearly every critic in the UK seems to have taken leave of their senses over this film. Just because it's in a foreign language, there's an infuriating sycophancy which assumes it must have some genuine arthouse kudos. RUBBISH! This film is stunningly average, with the impressive visuals only just stopping the excruciating dialogue and wooden acting from making it unwatchable. The storyline would be dismissed as childish and stupid by a programmer of Mortal Kombat. ""Sense & Sensibility with martial arts?"" - what are these critics thinking? If ONLY there were some of Jane Austen's craft and wit about this. Go and watch the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice instead."

","Every so often a movie comes along that reminds you of the first time you went to the theatre to see ""Star Wars"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It's not very often. But, it happens. And it happened to me with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Everything about this film was awe inspiring. We've all heard by now about the great fighting sequences. And they are truly amazing. But, the intrigal parts of the film, are the two love stories. And they are handled with such beauty by Ang Lee. It would have been easy for Lee to cast the love stories aside. But, the film, as great as it would have been, wouldn't be the masterpiece that it is. Michelle Yeoh has such a sublte yearning for Chow Yun-Fat that it moves viewers to tears. And the other love story  ( I don't want to give anything away ) is without a doubt, one of the sweetest, funniest, and most haunting realtionships ever filmed. I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not seen this film yet. But, the scene atop the trees is, quite frankly, astonishing. So, go see this movie, NOW!"

"lalanima","Null","0","0","16 January 2001"," You have been cheated... not by this film.
","First I would like to say that I am glad so many European and American movie-goers liked this film so much.  I like it too, but I may not praise it as much as many of the reviewers did here.  As a viewer with Chinese background,  I find the film enjoyable, but not so perfect.  Ang Lee tried very hard to stun the audience with traditional Chinese martial arts choreography, as well as the emotional dilemma of people living in the traditional Chinese society, but seems you just can't squeeze everything in to less than two hours. Also, since I watched the movie in Chinese, the flaw in Chow and Yeo's presentation (their native tongue is Cantonese but in the movie they have to discuss deep martial arts philosophy in Mandarin) becomes unbearable.  There is also some problem with the special effect-I have no problem with people flying, but at least let them fly more decently-not like puppets hanging in wire.  However, setting these thing aside, I would say I like it very much.  When I watch a movie, I look at the sincerity of the movie maker.  A movie without sincerity is crap,  like when you use millions of dollars, tons of water and thousands of death, not to express, but to impress, to achieve the purpose of manipulating audience's emotion.  In CTHD, I saw a director sincerely and eagerly wishes to express his dream, his anxiety, his emotion, and above all, the beauty and dilemma of his culture, in a way both eastern an western people can understand.  Whether he can achieve that is another matter.  For me, sincerity counts.<br/><br/>
Next, I would like to tell the audience in US and European cinema market, it is high time for you to realise you have been cheated by Hollywood-style commercialised crap for too long... and the cinema lines in your country keep feeding you these crap because they believe nothing else would make you happier.  It feels rude to say that, but after comparing the overwhelming reaction it produced in US and the so-so box office in Singapore, Hong Kong and other Asia regions that's what I can think of.  In that sense I'd like to thank Lee Ang for working so hard to give you guys a new variety of food. In recent years, many Chinese movies has made their way to the western world, however either they end up being award-winning ""art"" piece without appearance in the main-line cinemas, or they are just action-flicks with little presence of the word ""Chinese"".  So in order to let you guys have a taste of what I have been enjoying for so long, Lee Ang has to first demonstrate his directing ability in English, and then he is granted a chance to introduce you what ""Chinese"" is about, and he did it damn well.<br/><br/>Now, for those who think the movie is too much of a hype, I guess there are two cases.  First, Chinese martial arts fantasy with people flying around is just not your dish, and if so, I think there is nothing wrong with that. In the second case, you are not totally impressed by this combination of fighting, music, choreography, beautiful scenery of  China, and therefore noticed, and are unhappy with the flaw in plot, character, morale, whatsoever, then I congratulate you.  That means your sense of taste has not been blinded by this exotic Asian dish.  Maybe you have seen something like that before, like the ""Once upon a time in China"" series which stretched the martial arts choreography to the maximum, or ""A better tomorrow"" that talks about love, hatred, deceit and heroism, or the hidden and twisted emotion in ""farewell to my concubine"", ""raise the red lantern"" and ""in the mood for love"", and if you strip off all the stuff that is new to most of the US and European viewers, your feeling toward the movie would become similar to mine.<br/><br/>Anyway, all I want to say is, this is a good movie, and I hope it opens your eyes. And I would be truly happy, only several years later, when the audience realise there are so many other excellent movies in the world they could have missed if CTHD never entered the US and European market.<br/><br/>I give the film itself 7 out of 10, but I will give its mere existence 10 out of 10"

","...I don't know - I'm not much of a martial arts film connoisseur, so maybe I just can't appreciate the film's merits.  For anyone who cares, however, I'll tell you what I saw.  I saw a rushed storyline, littered with overly elaborate flashbacks that spread the plot far too thinly, leaving me wondering who it was I was supposed to be caring about.  Li Mu Bai?  Why should I care about him?  Okay, he's a great warrior, he's retiring, and he supposedly has this long history with Yu Shu Lien.  None of this is bringing tears to my eyes, but hey...maybe the movie's really about Jen Yu, the renegade daughter of the Governer.  Hmm...she's a brat, she's hard to like, and the only history of her I'm given is a flashback that takes up a quarter of the movie just so I can see how she met Lo?  All of the passion in this movie is extraordinarily superficial.  I never once got the impression that Li Mu Bai really *loved* Yu Shu Lien, and I'm sorry...Jen's love for Lo wasn't demonstrated well enough for me to understand her suicide.  Like I said, perhaps I can't appreciate why this film is supposed to be good.  It seems like a lot of ""I love you, I hate you.  Let's fight to the death."" The fight scenes were exhilarating at times, but the use of wires was way, WAY over the top.  Where I was expecting superhuman leaping ability, I received out-and-out *flight*.  It was much easier to accept in The Matrix where it was (a) the future, and (b) NOT REAL.  Nothing in this movie suggested to me that we were dealing with a fantasy land, so I was left wondering why Yun-Fat Chow was doing his best Mary Martin impression.  To put it bluntly, the script was shallow and predictable, and the fight scenes were exciting and well choreographed one minute, then completely overblown and down-right *silly* the next.  The acting was decent and so was the casting, but neither of the latter two are enough to make this a good film - CERTAINLY not the 27th best of all time on IMDb's list.  I think we're going to see that there because this film hasn't been exposed to a mass audience. People who love martial arts flicks are going to cream themselves over this one, just as people who like teen dramedies confess time and time again that Empire Records is the greatest film ever made.  It's these disgusting opinionists that are going to make me hate this film, but it won't take much time."

","CROUCHING TIGER has done the unlikely: legitimize a B-movie genre.  The film works on every level: story, acting, direction.  The action sequences are dazzling and the story is poignant.

There is much talk now about Oscar nominations for this film, and it is entirely deserved.  This is all the more impressive when you consider that no one speaks a word of English.

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, for lack of a better word, astonishing. It's easily the best film I've seen this year (a title previously held by Almost Famous).<br/><br/>Directed by Ang Lee, this is a movie that had me slack-jawed with wonder for most of its playing time.  The story is a retelling of an ancient Chinese folk tale:  warrior Li Mu Bai (a commanding Chow Yun-Fat), heartsick at killing, has decided to take the path of peace.  He asks his longtime friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, in perhaps her finest performance) to give his 400-year-old sword, the Green Destiny, to Sir Te in Beijing.  Shortly after the sword has been given to Sir Te, it vanishes, coinciding with the arrival of Governor Yu for his daughter Yu Jen's  (Zhang Ziyi) arranged wedding. What follows is an engrossing detective story involving plots and counterplots:  Lin Mu Bai suspects that it has been stolen by Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who may be posing as someone in Governor Yu's household. And Jade Fox may have an accomplice.<br/><br/>Tied into this plot are several subplots:  the unspoken yearning between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien; Yu Jen's desire for a life other than that as the wife of a bureaucrat; and her secret love for thief Lo (Chang Chen), a nomadic desert chieftain.  The scenes between Chow and Yeoh are especially touching; Yeoh is particularly subtle and nuanced in her acting.<br/><br/>As touching as the romantic scenes are, the fight scenes are explosive and unbelievably fluid.  People walk on water, they run up walls and leap from rooftop to rooftop as if gravity were just a nuisance, an idea to be ignored.  I was particularly struck by how carefully the scenes were choreographed:  Chow Yun-Fat's spare, economical style, befitting a master warrior; Yeoh's beautiful, natural style; and especially Zhang, who seems like a cross between Warner Brothers' Tasmanian Devil and a whirling Dervish, all angles and nuclear-powered fury.  But the best thing is, the fight scenes don't feel tacked-on; they are led to naturally from all that came before.<br/><br/>I have a couple of quibbles with this movie all the same: parts of it felt like they dragged or were longer than they needed to be, and the desert scenes between Chang and Zhang could easily have been put at the start of the movie.  But that's minor compared to the sheer artistry on display here.<br/><br/>Much has been written on the strong feminist streak running through this movie.  Women are the focus here, and with no apologies.  But it doesn't feel like an anti-male rant; it is, instead, a touching and affecting movie about men and women.  The diversity of the audience at the screening I attended certainly surprised me:  couples of all ages, a small army of teenaged Asian girls, the requisite wuxia fanboys.  At the end of the movie, the audience erupted in spontaneous applause and cheers.<br/><br/>And so, to sum up this too-long review:  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those rare movies that satisfies your heart and your head.  Go see it.  Go see it RIGHT NOW.  My grade:  A.<br/><br/>-terry-"
"smakawhat","10","0","0","14 January 2001"," This is the BEST FILM I have ever seen since renting Akira Kurowsawa's Seven Samurai 5 years ago.
","I went in to see this film with mixed emotions.  I had been highly anticipating it for months, like no other film in living memory that I can think of. I felt that all the praise and words that people told me of it would leave me disappointed in the film.  Rumors abounded that it would not play in my city, it was going to have a limited running (luckily all untrue).   It just made me want to see this film even more.  It's as if I was expecting too much from the film and it wouldn't deliver.  Would my expectations be to high?  On the other hand I felt that it had to be phenomenal, I LOVE martial arts films, I LOVE foreign films, and I have a special heart for Asian themes in cinema.  How could I not like it ?? With these conflicting thoughts I sat down and after the full movies runtime I could think of only one thing.<br/><br/>Every high comment made by either well know critics, or lesser known ones, or just from people on the street who had the opportunity to see it before I did are all right.  This movie can never be duplicated.  It is PURE MAGIC!<br/><br/>THIS IS THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE RENTING AKIRA KUROWSAWA'S 'SEVEN SAMURAI' over 5 years ago.<br/><br/>The film follows the lives of several Wudan warriors, who besides possessing fantastic marshall arts skill can defy the lives of gravity as they battle in stunning choreography.  Chow Yun Fat plays Li Mu Bai, a warrior who is giving up his way of life to settle down.  In doing so he asks a former Wudan warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to meet with him as he decides to give up his sword 'The Green Destiny' as a gift to a local governor.  We soon learn the 2 warriors have an unspoken special bond, yet neither of them will admit it since their roaming warrior lives have always kept them distant.  Within the Governors compound resides Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) a young woman on the verge of getting married.  She is entranced by the lifestyle of Yu Shu, a woman who picks her own destiny, goes on adventure, and is her own boss.  In contrast Jen, really bonds with Yu calling her 'older sister' and secretly wants to live the life of a warrior.  The idea of giving up a life to support a husband instead of living on her own seems a death sentence. But a disturbing thing happens.  Without giving away too much of the plot, after presenting the sword to the governor, it is mysteriously stolen by another unknown Wudan warrior!!  The story then revolves around finding the sword, wild adventures, and the outcomes of the characters backgrounds in the story.<br/><br/>First off on a martial arts level it is stunning.  Killer fight scenes, brilliantly choreographed and intense.  On top of this the films heroes and focus is on the women warriors and has to be the only film I have seen where the story is carried by female heroes.  Ang Lee's direction then goes into overdrive as he takes the actors (NOT THE STUNTMEN!) and suspends them on wires to make them do amazing things such as skip across vast stretches of water, climb walls and rooftops, and fight in a stunning bamboo forest. And like I said, 90% of it is done by the women.<br/><br/>I fell in love with these women (particularly Ziyi) after seeing this film.<br/><br/>Combined with these fights scenes are STUNNING shots of cinematography. Huge ancient cities, snow cragged cliffs,  parched sun burnt Western Tibetan deserts,  lanterned light night courtyards, giant waterfalls, and colourful costumes are all in abundance.  And the shots of the bamboo forest fight scenes are spectacular.<br/><br/>Now this film is NOT all martial arts.  It has a great compelling epic story.  The acting is impeccable from the stern Chow Yun Fat who steals every scene he is in, to the fiesty young Ziyi Zhang who is incredible! But the brilliance is in the story, that reads like the greatest adventure you have ever heard of.  With the great fighting are characters who are betrayed, humorous consequences (some that are VERY FUNNY you'll never think twice about loosing your comb), love and eloquent romance, memorable scenes characters and lines, and a story that means achieving your destiny that you so desire in a land that wants you to conform.<br/><br/>Such perfection will NEVER be duplicated ever.  I'd hate to say things you hear all the time but I will say them now anyway cause they are true.<br/><br/>If you can only see ONE film this year, see 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. I have see a lot of the great films of 2000 (Yes there were good films this year!) and this one is the best (even though I picked Chicken Run, Almost Famous, and High Fidelity).<br/><br/>Take everyone you know, all your family, and take all those other people you know who say either:<br/><br/>I hate subtitled films<br/><br/>I hate foreign films<br/><br/>I hate martial arts films<br/><br/>I hate Asian films<br/><br/>and change their life.<br/><br/>Rating 10+ out of 10.<br/><br/>PS - This is a MUST see 'In the theatre' film.  It will not have the same brilliance if you decide to wait for the DVD or video."

Excellent pacing and character development. And most importantly, the movie has the mix of fantasy, romance, comedy and drama elements to tell a good story that held my attention for two hours without ever looking at my watch (which I never did).<br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Ziyi Zhang and Chen Chang did the fantastic job of bringing their unique acting skills to excellence in the film, and that should make Hollywood hang its head in shame. Ang Lee has finally crafted the film that do not drag and meander, unlike his previous efforts. Rather he lets the pacing take its place on unfolding the motive and development of lead and supporting characters - even seamlessly transporting to the past involving the relationship of Jen (Ziyi Zhang) and Lo (Chen Chang) which do not halt the film to a grind; instead this give the characters more screentime in background so that we could empathize with them. Divulging the plot is absolutely unnecessary, since the story is as complex as Hayao Miyazaki's animated epic ""Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke)"". It's better to see the movie without knowing what it's about, which should guarantee a fresh and unforgettable movie-going experience.     <br/><br/>Kudos to all involved in the making of this now-classic masterpiece, including Lee's longtime screenwriting partner James Schamus who contributed the additional dialogues to the script by Hui-Ling Wang and Kuo Jung Tsai based on the Chinese novel by Du Lu Wang. Yuen Wo Ping should receive the prestigious honorary award for his contribution of stunts to films over the last 30 years. Ang Lee has made a spectacular achievement in his career from a low-budget filmmaker to an internationally renowned director who knows style and substance in film.  <br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" should win the Oscars, including Best Picture."

Please pay more attention on Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh, especial Yeoh.<br/><br/>As a Taiwanese, I am quite familiar and get used to the ""supernatural ability"" of the characters in kung fu movie .  To me, the amazing fight scenes in CTHD are not a big surprise.  I don't mean that the fight scenes are not worth seeing.  Contrarily, Ann Lee is the most imaginative director on performing kung fu masters' ability.  CTHD fulfills my imagination on ancient wuxia novels.<br/><br/>For those who don't like this film and think the flying fighting men in CTHD is ridiculous, just skip the fighting part (although I think it is good). Other than visual pleasure, it delivers a lot to audience as well. Basically, it is a story of love and suppression.  From Yeoh, you can see how ancient Chinese people suppress their feelings, and how the social system suppresses people's free will.<br/><br/>I would say, there is a dragon (free will) hidden in everyone's mind.  No matter you are a nobleman, kung fu master, or ordinary person.  Jen Yu tries to release her prisoned mind dragon (desire of pursuing freedom) by learning kung fu and getting connection with bandits.  Conversly, Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien plan to retire to pursue a peaceful life.  However, the results are all turned out to be disappointed.  The reason is that they all resist the responsibilities a feudal society gave to them.<br/><br/>Just like her love was ignored by most of people in the story, Michelle Yeoh's acting are ignored by most audience and critics.  She conveys a sophisticated superwoman who is yearning for love very successfully.  The clip of Yu's farewell to Li is really really heartbreaking and touching.  I think most movie association owe her an award.<br/><br/>If you are going to see the movie again, I suggest you pay more attention on Michelle Yeoh.  Of course, Yun-Fat Chow's acting can't be missed.  In my opinion, he is the actor second to none in Asia."

","CTSD is a beautiful movie on several levels.  The scenery is spectacular and extraordinarily well photographed.  The action sequences are graceful and powerful, without being gruesome.  The actors are physically attractive and very skillful.  The plot is a bit confusing at times, but this hardly matters; the story is strongly constructed and elegantly presented. Themes include honor (of course), revenge, loyalty, and the balancing of personal freedom with responsibility.  There is a special sword which has been commented on in other reviews, but it is not the movie's real focus; its role may be metaphorical.  The subtitles are easy to read and seem sensitively translated."

","my first comment (and only ""complaint"") about this movie is: THE FLYING LOOKS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! now, for those of you ""in-the-know"" about the purpose of the flying, don't get ticked off just yet. i have read some imdb reviews that try to explain why the flying is acceptable, and i have taken their word for what it is. especially those of black armbands:<br/><br/>""The reason that the characters' ability to do this is not explained in the movie is because it is understood in Chinese culture that kung fu is a practice in self-control, and thus at a certain point in kung fu training, warriors obtain the ability to control their weight and appear to glide through the air, much like they are flying. It is not meant to be comical or fantastical; Lee was just following the tradition and true form of kung fu in piecing together these fight scenes, and neither he nor the film should be criticized because of that.""<br/><br/>while ang lee is new to me, i have heard of his other movies such as ""sense and sensibility"" and would assume that he would take his movies very seriously. i therefore would highly doubt that he would put such ridiculously looking actions according to the ignorant viewer without having some justification for it.<br/><br/>also, about those people who have commented about the ""lack of displayed passion between two of the main characters"" - richard french. i am a chinese american, and know enough about my culture (and others) to understand that eastern relationships need not to have displayed passion! for example, i point to japanese culture. it is my belief that japanese people do a lot of communication from within, and need not to verbally or physically communicate to each other to actually communicate. i would assume the same with the ""lack of displayed passion.""<br/><br/>as for the overall review of the movie, i don't think i'll ever get sick of watching this movie. need i say more?"

","From the synopsis, it's not a film I would've gone to see without a good deal of persuading, but critics who say they're giving up criticising because they've so fallen in love with the best supporting actress that they need to spend the rest of their days gazing sadly into lily ponds and combing their hair with a melancholy air...they're not half bad at the old persuading. Admittedly, I wasn't going for the script, not after having read a few quotes on this site and on various others. They struck me as...well...twee might not be too limp a word for it. Exposition, that's what I'm talking about. It said too much...bold philosophy spilling from the mouths of mortal people. That didn't impress me on paper. I was set up for something rather more cinematic.<br/><br/>And lummy, did I get it. What it is...it's cinema. It might not hold me for so long on the small screen, but goodness, do these people know how to make cinema. Few words, unbelievable action. Including the fight scenes. I watch a film for the filmyness, not the movieness...I think that means for the script rather than the action. But it was the experience, the whole thing...it was more a dance than a film.<br/><br/>Front row in a little arthouse cinema. I could sink down right under the screen. I could feel myself lift with the floating scenes. I wanted more of the floating. I mean, you would, wouldn't you? If you knew you could do that, you'd never walk anywhere. The whole cinema smiled after the floating scenes. I really can't understand those who have any complaints about the floating...without floating, it would've been fighting. On the ground. Which is normal. Floating...that's straight out of the dreams of a five year old and did more for me than any decent writing could do. Writing. Huh. Over-rated stuff if you ask me. And the trees. The swaying fight in the palm trees. This wasn't quite cinema as I know it...more about movement than wit. It got me swaying in sympathy. And the humour. I mean, I thought Bo's paralysis was funny, and that was before the business with the comb. You would've thought she could've found a branch of Woolworths nearby. There you go.<br/><br/>And you know those twee little quotations? I got over it. I'm not jealous of the film because the dialogue wasn't that sort of dialogue. No moments of 'I wish I'd said that, in that sort of way'. But in such a period feeling piece as this - not just the setting, the tone: it had the clout of a George Eliot novel, and she philosophises left, right and centre - they felt almost at home. Like they'd been lifted from Confucius.<br/><br/>Stunning stuff."

","Upon arriving at the theater to see this film, I let down all my expectations so that I would go in with a clear mind.  I don't think going in with high expectations would of phased the outcome of my feelings about this film.  The year in film (2000) was almost a dull year for movies, and I don't remember being so lost in a film for a long while. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a beautiful movie in my perspective. It had all the major thematic elements a drama should (i.e. the different levels of power and wealth, the death of main character, the catalyst, the suicide element,  etc. etc.).  It's been a long time since that has been found in a film.  And what a beautiful film to find it in. The coreography in this film was so amazing, I was blown away, and in awe throughout the entire film.  There is so much to look at within it, and so much overwhelming story that I'm going to have to see it again.<br/><br/>After reviewing numerous other comments about the film, I see that many people watched the film not aware of the Asian culture and their way of telling stories.  The Asian story telling has always been very fantasized and very romantic and historical.  The wire work and 'flying' is true to the story telling of historical Asian works.  This film was a fantasy, and therefore the 'flying' blended in well.  'The Matrix' has indeed influenced many films.  Some films don't work out that well, and others do.  The wire work in this film works perfectly with the line of story telling.  The difference between The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is the culture behind it.  The Matrix was gritty and more 'realistic' in a way because it's American and has the American Influence and background; and it's our way of story telling.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon's fluid and smooth coreography is a perfect utility to the Asian culture and way of story telling. As Humans we all need to learn how to appreciate all cultures.  This film is a good start, because to many American's it may look stupid or inane, but where it derived from it's exactly what it's about.  And in my vision it works as a beautiful dramatic piece, with every element slipping into place perfectly without flaw."

","I found CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON very disappointing.  I was very excited to see it ever since I saw the previews on television and couldn't wait until I had a chance to see it.  But when I finally saw it, all of these excitements seemed for nothing.  The plot in CROUCHING TIGER could have gone in so many directions; it could have gotten deeper into the romance between the Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien or into the romance of Lo and Jen, it could have also been an action movie focusing mostly on the martial arts (which I admit, were pretty cool), it could have gone more into the woman liberation thing and how women should be able to learn how to fight as well as men, and it even could have been a comedy.  But the plot didn't go in any direction whatsoever.  It slightly brushed upon each of the directions that I said before and never went in very deeply with any of them.  I sat and endured the movie just to see if it would get any better. It didn't.  At the end of the movie I was so disappointed with how bad it was I didn't even have the words when people asked me what I thought of it. This movie tries to work on too many levels and ends up not working on any of them. If you are planning to see it, don't bother, it's not worth it."

","Everybody was kung-fu fighting- and I couldn't have cared less.  I was sold on the idea by all the critics and their ""top 10"" lists that CTHD was not only a visual-kinetic experience like ""The Matrix,"" but that it's plot and characters all connected to render the intoxicating feel of pure poetry.<br/><br/>Ha.  I had to fight to keep myself awake through most of this sloppy, stylish mess.  So what exactly is wrong with this film?  First, the dialogue sounds like something out of a bad Pokemon episode (of course, is there such thing as a good Pokemon episode?  Now that's zen.).  Second, the film's pacing is all in the gutter.  Ang Lee is a wonderfully talented director and I enjoyed ""Sense and Sensibility,"" so it stuns me that he could leave a narrative this stilted.  The film opens with the conflict over a mystical (natch) sword that is stolen by the spoiled daughter of the province governor.  Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh play ex-warriors who try to get it back.  That's it- that's the whole plot.  Oh, there are a few other items that are dropped in here and there with a headache-inducing THUD: something about a Jade Fox warrior who seems to have killed off the relavtives of half the people in China and now everyone wants dead and Ziyi Zhang's love affair with a desert bandit- a flashback sequence that is shoehorned into the middle of the film and stops the story cold.<br/><br/>Yes, the stunt work is something to see, even if they don't live completely up to their hype.  The first couple of sequences take place at night and are poorly edited so we are hard pressed to figure out who is beating the stuffing out of who.<br/><br/>Come down to it, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only drops hints to what kind of great film it could have been.  I was expecting passion.  I was expecting lyrical poetry, like in John Woo's ""The Killer,"" but all I got was pulp, instead."

For those of you who did not like this movie simply because of the fact that people can fly in the movie, then I feel that you shouldn't be watching movies at all.  The movie is set in sort of a fantasy China, where warriors are treated as demi-gods. It's as if there were dragons and wizards with magical powers in the old tales of knights and chivalry.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon IS NOT BASED ON ANY HISTORICAL FACTS.  This film is a fairy tale about four individuals whos tragic romance reflect each others.  It's hard to understand why people can be so unimaginative, but enough of that.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is simply the best movie I've seen in awhile.  In fact, it is the best film I have seen all year.  Everything about the movie is absolutely amazing, from the cinematography to the pacing, director Ang Lee has created a stunning classic.  Rather than simply making a kung-fu film with elements of romance, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a romantic film with elements of kung-fu.<br/><br/>This film is something that I for one won't be forgetting anytime soon."

""What's with all the stupid hats?  How come everyone's wearing a gun?  Couldn't that bar owner afford a real door?"" Well guess what, you've just seen something for the first time. That something might be designated as Wu Xia.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this.<br/><br/>I've taken the liberty of copying the following  material<br/><br/>""Wuxia"" apparently isn't usually translated exactly. Generally it can be called Martial Arts Fiction.<br/><br/>In a similar way, that Westerns refers to a particular genre of adventure stories with specific connotations of historical settings, types of action, and so forth.<br/><br/>Wuxia wraps into itself :<br/><br/>-historical settings<br/><br/>-machiavellian intrigue<br/><br/>-heroes and villains with superhuman powers and abilities at sword fighting<br/><br/>-kung-fu<br/><br/>-flying<br/><br/>-tunnelling underground<br/><br/>-healing<br/><br/>-paralysis touches<br/><br/>-and with liberal dashes of tragic melodrama.<br/><br/>Jin Yong is a recent master and the author of the wuxia novels that so many quite confusing HK films are based upon, eg, Kungfu Cult Master. ""Wu"" provides the martial arts part while ""xia"" more strictly means ""picaresque romance"" or something similar. Unfortunately, many wuxia novels are not strictly speaking picaresque romances. So martial arts fiction seems to be the most commonly accepted translation. Sometimes, as in this case, it is easier to simply lift the term used straight out of its language of origin and make it an English usage.<br/><br/>Wuxia seems to be an obvious Pinyin romanization. Presumably there is a Cantonese rendition. Don't know what characters this term is based on.<br/><br/>Also, I'm trying to remember where I saw the original reference. I know it was in connection with the fiction of Jin Yong (who is also called Louis Cha), a HK publisher, editor and writer who originally hammered out a whole raft of these wuxia sagas in the 1950's (??), 1960's through to the early (??) 1970's."

"cass-14","10","0","0","13 January 2001"," Don't forget the feminism!
","I saw this film about three weeks ago, and I am surprised that none of the reviews that I have read here mention the strong feminist message throughout this film.  As a lover of martial arts films in general, I have often lamented the inexplicable absence of women in this sport/art.  CTHD, however, has proven that women can make the better martial artists.<br/><br/>CTHD not only has a strong female protagonist(s), but it also makes harsh statements against the Wudan's exclusion of women from their teachings.  A strong man dies at the hands of an old women; many strong men die, are maimed or at least humbled by a young girl; women are the more elegant fighters - the very inclusion of such active female roles in this environment is unusual, yet alone the amount of film-time given to displaying their superior skills.<br/><br/>I have discussed this strong feminist strain with others, and the most common agonist in response has been mention of the 'tree sequence'.  This is where Chow Yun Fat arrives to 'finish off' the fight with young Jen that Michelle Yeoh couldn't win.  I believe that this apparent inconsistency was actually quite an overt criticism of the traditional rigidity of Wudan.  By rejecting the inclusion of women in their teaching, they were also limiting themselves to fighters who were not necessarily the best available. Therefore Michelle Yeoh could not eventually defeat the young Jen only because she had not been permitted to read the Wudan book of teachings; instead it was left to the Wudan-trained Fat to retaliate.<br/><br/>As well, Jen's own exploding combination of confusion, self-loathing, arrogance, skill, intelligence and passion is a comment on this enforced exclusion and social imprisonment of women from a patriarchy that inherently has failed to recognise its most talented members.  Her 'schizophrenia' as one reviewer has commented (no doubt someone who felt challenged by the complexity of forrest gump) is a reflection of this suffocating and inflexible environment that could have offered her so much if only she had been born a different gender.<br/><br/>And please, no more comments about how 'stupid' the flying is.

"KwanHoFans","8","0","0","12 January 2001"," Does ""Crouching Tiger"" live up to its hype?
","The phrase ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" refers to an age-old Chinese idiom that says society is full of dangerous people, like hidden tigers and dragons ready to pounce on the unsuspecting victim. The story of the movie revolves around lovers Li Mu-bai (Chow) and Yu Shu-lien (Yeoh), two Chinese warriors who have strong feelings for each other but have not had the opportunity to express them. The theft of Li's prized sword leads them to Jen Yu (Zhang), a nobleman's daughter who is about to be betrothed in a pre-arranged marriage but whose young mind is rebellious and dreams of being a warrior. The quest to recover the lost sword precipitates numerous extremely well-choreographed fight scenes (by Woo-ping Yuen) true to the Chinese martial arts or ""Wu-xia"" genre. Most notable are the two scenes where Yu chases the masked Jen up walls (literally) and over rooftops, and where Li fights with Jen amidst treetops, respectively. The two female leads, Yeoh and Zhang, steal the spotlight most of the time. Yeoh is effective in conveying her suppressed emotions with subtlety and nuance, while Zhang gives a strong performance as the untamed ""hidden dragon"" who ultimately seeks escape from her conflicting emotions through death. While some believe this film to be overhyped, North American audiences seem to love it. For some of us familiar with the ""Wu-xia"" genre, however, this film may fall short of our (fairly high) expectations."

","I envy anyone who has not seen a Chinese martial arts film (wuxia pian) before seeing CTHD because of the joy and novelty which await him/her.  A martial arts film is different from a kungfu film in that the former is a historical romance and fantasy in which the protagonists usually use fantastic weapons and make out-of-the-world kungfu moves.  They can ""fly"", make opponents stand still by ""striking their vital points"", use any object as a sword, just to name a few.  Anyone who is interested to learn more can read John Minford's translation of Louis Cha's martial arts novel ""Deer and the Cauldron"" published by OUP.<br/><br/>Like musical films such as Top Hat and Singin' in the Rain, serious martial arts films are few and far between these days.  I am glad that Ang Lee has made such a film to critical acclaim and hope that it will revive the genre in Hong Kong.  As a film buff and a Hong Kong Chinese who has been reading/seeing martial arts novels/films since 1970, I rate the film 8 out of 10 taking into account the costume design, action choreography, photography, acting, film score and other martial arts film elements old and new (e.g. sword fighting in a bamboo forest and tree tops has appeared previously in King Hu's film Touch of Zen).<br/><br/>By the way, I just got the Region 3 DVD today for repeated viewing in my home theater."

","I suppose that many people in the West are awed by ""Crouching"" and hidden animals... but in Hong Kong, every other month there is another period piece with characters who can run over hedges, and glide through the air, and do other mystical things.  The fact is too few understand anything of Taoism, but so many love to throw in the mystical Taoist crap, (similar to the recent interest in Wicca and the glut of teen-age witch programs on the WB network in the US...)<br/><br/>It is too bad, because I like Chow Yuen Fat, and Ang Lee films.  I really wanted to like this one, too.  In fact, each of the actors acted their hearts out, and the sets and scenery and backdrops were epic.  But the story hardly moved me.  I would have to be a pre-teen or teen-aged boy to go for the 'mystical sword, must return it to rightful owner, and avenge master' fare.<br/><br/>Hong Kong is the third largest producer of films in the World.  They have made so many films like this for both TV and cinema...  Oddly the two good guys (Michelle Yeo and Chow Yuen Fat) are Hong Kong stars, with Cantonese as their native language, but yet they do this film in Mandarin.  Most Cantonese speakers in Hong Kong don't speak Mandarin... so, their Mandarin might be hard on the ears of some of the Mandarin viewers...  But this is not the films flaw.  The flaw is that the plot is mediocre and the character development is weak... making the actors have to overcome this roadblock in order to be compelling...   Unfortunately, this film is shallow.  I advise viewers to watch ""King of Masks"" instead.  That is much better Chinese cinema.  If I want to see Chow Yuen Fat avenge someone in an action picture, I'll pull out my old copy of ""A Better Tomorrow.""  Or if you're looking for an action packed period piece requiring the suspension of disbelief see ""A Chinese Ghost Story""."

Myself being a white middle classed young guy who lives in a suburb and goes to malls like alot of other people reading this, you don't see too many women with even the potential ability to match the grace, the altheticism, and the acrobatics that are expressed by the women who star in this film.  Yes, i've seen guys who can perform the things they did in the movies, but never women, and i've been a martial arts student for a few years even.  Then I came to terms with the fact that, the women in this film are Asian, and that's a hell of alot different than the mall strolling Joe or Jane from America.  Also, I came to terms with the idea that no one can fly around like Peter Pan, as these characters do in the movie.  But having seen a few Japanese animes and having tasted a few Japanese created video games, it seems as though the flying bit is an assimilated part of oriental culture.  Thus, I think this movie deserves a lot of respect for ways which are very alien to most Americans, but seems to be very much an element of eastern ways.  Bravo."

Remember it is a fairy tale fantasy of mythical proportions.  It is not a documentary, so sit back and enjoy.  As most of us know, Chow Yun Fat has tremendous screen presence, and this picture is no exception.  My question is, when (PLEASE) will some Hollywood producer step up and allow Michelle Yeoh to become the major star she should be.  My tidbit on this one involves the beautiful (young) Ziyi Zhang.  She is cast with Jackie Chan in Rush Hour 2, due for release later in 2001."

","This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The plot was interesting and the acting was excellent.  The movie had an aesthetic beauty to it that is unlike anything I had seen before it.  The fighting was well choreographed and parts of it brought a surreal light to the film (ie, the wall running and the flying).  I would recommend this movie to anyone who's old enough to read the subtitles."

","Brilliant movie! Highly recommended! An Ang Lee (director of Remains of the Day and Sense and Sensibility) film, and quite similar to his other works in that none of the characters want to tell the others what they are really feeling. :)<br/><br/>Its spoken in Chinese, but with English subtitles, but don't go expecting a typical Jackie Chan/Jet Li-style karate movie, despite the presence of Chow Yun Fat. Set in a vaguely medieval Chinese setting  - the Chinese villages and temples and general scenery are great - and  rather fantastical in that people can run up walls and fight while standing on thin willowy branches (this, btw, is well done -the CG work is obvious, but subtle, if you know what I mean.) The fighting scenes are excellently choreographed, lots of hand to hand and sword battles. As Ms Kung above mentions, Chow Yun Fat does an excellent job of conveying the lead character's emotional burdens, while Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Chang also excel in their roles. The costumes are good, the music (esp. the cello solos) is absolutely soul-wrenching, and while the story is fairly simple, the action keeps you watching. Definitely go see this one."
"modius","Null","0","0","10 January 2001"," Poetically Beautiful, makes you want to fall in love with film all over
","I will be the first to admit that the year 2000 has not been the best year for film.  Films such as Charlie's Angels and such have been successful not because they are good, but because of their marketing.  Again and again we get the ""event"" movie and again and again we walk out even more disappointed.<br/><br/>This film, however is different.  This is clearly, by far, the best film of 2000, or if you like in the UK like me - this is the first best film of the 21st century (the 21st century started in 2001, not 2000!).#<br/><br/>Ang Lee's beautifully poetic, poigiant and brilliant film is wonderous to watch, marvel in and enjoy.  The flying scene's might not be understood and indeed I heard a few ""groans"" in the back rows - after a while they disappeared, they realised that the flying scene's reflect the inner beauty of this film.<br/><br/>The story is not as cliched as it sounds, it revolves around the brilliant Chow Yun Fat and the mesmerizing Michelle Yeoh (who looks as stunning as ever) who try to keep their feelings away from each other.  Their interactions are wonderously portrayed, especially from Yeoh - who's eyes seem to reflect the deep bottled up love to Chow.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are beautifully shot and cherographed.  But the film isn't about fight sequences, just as it isn't about the comb.  They are symbolic of the film.<br/><br/>The scenery, the backdrops and the whole feel of the film is one to fall in love with.  Indeed I was captured by its warmth and its charm.<br/><br/>Even the young princess who believes in escaping to freedom and uses the jade sword to accomplish her quest is wonderous to watch, she seems to lift every scene she is in.<br/><br/>What Ang Lee has done is to reinvegerate a flagging genre by combining and intertwining Western ideals into Eastern ideals and in doing so reinvegerate the kung fu genre - for too long it has been a joke - and for too long its been the product of action films and not romantic films such as this - for too long the kung fu films have been all about action and not about plot or characterization - this film is all that and more.<br/><br/>But it isn't just a kung fu film - its a romantic film, its poetic and it has a message of being true to yourself and others - even if that means losing a chance at true freedom (salvation).<br/><br/>In some respects, this film is what the Phantom Menance, indeed what the whole Star Wars films should have been like.<br/><br/>With this film, is there any real need for the over the top, low budget kung fu action we have had for the past twenty so years?  I don't think so - Ang Lee has forefilled the wishes of all those who read chinese books and poems - and all those who wanted a romantic, poetically brilliant film.<br/><br/>A truly beautiful and sublime film.  Its certainly the best film I've ever seen - and one worth enjoying again and again.<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10"

","This is probably the best Kung Fu movie I have ever seen !  Its fantastic ! As far as movies in general go its also great, I feel I could even take my mum to see it (not that I would). BEST FIGHT SCENES I'VE EVER SEEN and its got a decent story.  The only thing that would confuse people is the fact that the Kung Fu Dons in the film can almost fly (kind of skip and glide), but people have to understand that this is what the old school Kung Fu Genre is all about.  Personally I think people running up walls, across rooftops, through trees and across water, all whilst sword fighting, is fantastic. I'm sure some people would be put of by the subtitles, but it really doesn't matter - I think it helps you to concentrate on the plot and dubbing it would take the heart out of it. Its got everything, best film I've seen for a long time."

","Don't know what I expected, really. I guess I was hoping for something like Kagemusha or the original Seven Samurai. But Kurosawa's gone, and Mifune too, and this is Chinese rather than Japanese, so one should probably be grateful for the good acting and lush location scenery that saved this otherwise absurd martial arts picture. People cannot walk up vertical walls and fly, even if they go to special monasteries to meditate. You want fantasy? Try, ""Ladyhawke."" Overblown, overrated and beyond the pale."

","As we went from Peking deeper into the wilderness of China, the silly college boys sitting next to me finally were impressed.  To see people who are one with nature, the mythical practitioners of Wudan, is to see into the heart of legend of every culture, into our dreams and aspirations. <br/><br/>The perfect visual creation of the story, with flight, with the treetop duel, with an Arthurian dive deep into a pool for a sword--I know Arthur didn't dive, the Lady of the Lake held the sword above the surface, but again, this is a lady doing the diving--frame after delicious frame of the story draws us into the world of misty chasms and an altered consciousness. The powerful emotions that drive the conflict are clear: how much does one know about human capacity to desire power? to love? to feel respect? Gotta go back and watch this movie all over again."
"JohnnyPHreak","Null","0","0","13 January 2001"," A great fantasy adventure wrapped in a love story
","If you thought Keanu could fly in The Matrix, you haven't seen anything yet. Ang Lee (The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility) directs this action fantasy/love story about two warriors (Chow Yun-Fat & Michelle Yeoh) trying to retrieve an ancient sword from a young master (Ziyi Zhang). The story also involves a lost love, a notorious killer who has yet to been apprehended called Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) and a noticeable but never explored love between the two warriors. The story jumps back and forth between all these stories that at times interconnect. Ang Lee does an excellent job of displaying the areas and surroundings. This is one of those films that a person call tell was set in a far off place. His wide shots and landscape scenes capture the fantasy of the film. The performances are just perfect. Chow Yun Fat is excellent as usual, always cool and calm even under pressure. Although I am partial to him with a gun in each hand blowing people away, it was very cool to see him welding a sword and beating people up. Michelle Yeoh was also very excellent. She was strong yet weak and boy can she move. I don't know why Tomorrow Never Dies is her only American film. I want to see her kicking more butt over here. She can act and fight, a deadly combo. A surprise was from Pei-pei Cheng. She was very real and by the end of the film she had that ""care about"" characteristics. Something even hard to do with Chow Yun Fat & Michelle Yeoh in the picture but she did steal the show. Now about the action sequences a.k.a. the fight scenes. Whoa! You have never seen fight scenes like the ones in this film. Even The Matrix has a tough time competing with these. The defying gravity and the hand to hand combat, it's unreal. I know certain people will go see the film just to see the fights but trust me this film has a lot more going to it than that. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great accomplishment in film making. This is a perfect date film and overall a great fantasy. It's one the year's best and a experience all it's own. If missed in the cinemas you'll be kicking yourself when you see it on video. Trust me, you'll be saying whoa a lot, a whole lot."

"y2mckay","7","0","0","13 January 2001"," Just say NO to wire work
","Damn you, critics. You all hyped this movie up as the ultimate end-all, be-all of Martial Arts adventure films. Well, as someone who has been watching Hong Kong action cinema and Samurai films for years, I must honestly report that this film, while enjoyable and excellent in many respects, does not quite live up to the hype.<br/><br/>But let's discuss the good, first. Casting is excellent. I've loved Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat for years, and it was a genuine pleasure to see them together in this film. Both of them excel in both acting and martial arts abilities here. Also excellent is the beautiful young actress Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu, and Chen Chang, as the bandit ""Lo"", brings a much-appreciated dose of humor and charm to contrast the more severe and reserved characters played by Chow Yun and Michelle. Their intermingled stories of unrequited love are funny and heartbreaking and provide some enjoyable ""down time"" between combat sequences.<br/><br/>The Action scenes are also, for the most part, lighting-paced and exciting. I especially enjoyed the sword styles used in the film. The sword battle between Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang is amazing, and Chow Yun Fat seems to effortlessly make ""Green Destiny"" dance like a living thing.<br/><br/>However, the one thing that completely detracted from the film's magic was the overblown use of wire work. Characters seem to fly more than they walk in this film, and the whole thing takes on a ridiculous ""Peter Pan"" quality after a while. I know everyone thinks that wire work is new, a trend started by ""The Matrix"". The fact is that it's been used (and overused) in many Martial Arts films for years. I've never been a huge fan of it. However, I enjoyed the wire work in ""The Matrix"" because it was used relatively sparingly and punctuated the action perfectly. It was also much more believable once we understood that the world of ""The Matrix"" was a computer-created illusion, unfettered by real physics. However, I fear that the popularity of ""The Matrix"" has created a disturbing new trend of using wire work as a crutch to boost the action sequences, as seen in ""Romeo Must Die"", the horrific ""Charlie's Angels"", and now here. But the thing that bothered me the most about the wire work in this film is that it LOOKED like wire work. It was much more clean-looking and effective when used in short bursts in the ""The Matrix"". Here, however, characters float from roof to roof as if Peking were one big trampoline, and it is blatantly obvious in their movements that they are suspended from something (although the wires themselves have all been digitally erased, of course). While it didn't completely ruin the film for me, it did keep me from taking it very seriously a lot of the time, and that is too bad because this epic story was meant to be taken seriously. In my (not so) humble opnion, however, the best martial arts films are those that can display amazing physical feats while still observing the basic laws of physics. Perhaps that is why some of the old Japanese Samurai films (for example, the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series) are so incredible, because the strength of the action sequences flowed from the actor's skill and lightning-speed with his blade, rather than his character's supposed ability to jump into the air and run across his enemies' heads like stepping stones. <br/><br/>So, bottom line, this is a film worth seeing, and there is much here to enjoy. Just don't feel guilty about laughing at the excessive wire work, and don't go into the theater expecting it to be the Second Coming of Bruce Lee."

"kevinwu109","10","0","0","13 January 2001"," wise and true
","With regards to two gripes about the film (the flying, and the lack of relationship between the 2 main characters) i have some comments. if you have didn't like CTHD because of the above two reasons, read on!<br/><br/>First of all, it just bothers me that you weren't able to accept the fact taht people can just fly in this movie. It's a part of the literary genre, and even the whole discipline of kung fu is to achieve an enlightened state so one can levitate and defy gravity. So i think the story is totally logical. But even if you didn't know that, which i didn't before my friends informed me, i don't understand why one cannot accept the movie. It's clearly a fantasy, a myth, very much like matrix. And movies, what movies are supposed to do is provide an escape not only from our world, but also from the very physical rules that govern it. Seeing people leaping towards buildings shouldn't be any more startling than seeing James bond dive from a plane, a technician disarming a bomb, or a middle aged man trying to seduce his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. It's the movies!<br/><br/>And also, with regards to your ""lack of passion between the leads,"" I'm surprised you would make such a statement if you had liked ""the Ice storm"" Clearly the leads cared for each other in their facial expressions, the tone of voice with which they communicated, but they DID NOT show unrestrained passion like the younger lovers did. Obviously, this was set up in a ""sense and sensibility"" kind of way. Some will even argue that they had passion but it's suppressed because of their oath to her late fiance. I believe that there is not so much passion between them, but that doesn't mean there love is any less valuable, deserving or beautiful. They are more like soulmates on an emotional level, and their love was something great to behold-Just like the movie itself."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has finally made its way to Columbus, OH in its limited release across America, and I am happy to say that this is a very enjoyable experience.  Anybody who appreciates martial arts or stories of Eastern legend will love it!<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have made an impact in the U.S. already with movies like Anna and the King and Tomorrow Never Dies.  In Dragon, they both demonstrate that they can perform ably as both martial arts phenom and dramatic actor of considerable depth.<br/><br/>While at first blush this story seems to surround them and the chemistry between them, it becomes evident that this is really a story about the young princess they encounter in Peking.  While trying to recover a mystical sword, known in the subtitles as ""Green Destiny"", and dealing with the intricacies of dynastic honor and family loyalty, each of them discovers severally that this young woman has an extraordinary amount of talent and grace.  More importantly, she is at a crossroads in her life, torn between family duty, true love, and her inward passion for a life free of responsibility, which is aggravated by the seldom-seen villain known as Jade Fox.  The coarse of events in the movie ultimately centers around her transition into adulthood and the gravest responsibility of all; deciding for oneself what path to take in life, and dealing with the consequences thereto.<br/><br/>Enough about the characters for now.  The story is very well told, at some times severe, at others uproariously funny, at others heart-wrenching, at others introspective.  There is enough flashback and reference material that, even being thrown into the middle of the characters' lives, we can easily relate to the wide range of emotions and problems they face.  The ending wasn't what I expected, but is typical of Eastern legend and is in truth the best way to bring the story full circle.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous, showing more than the standard wide-angle Forbidden City shots traditionally associated with China.  Instead we are treated to a vast country with an astounding variety of climates, from lush green mountains to dense forests to barren deserts rivaling the most arid parts of central Africa.<br/><br/>But the true beauty of this film is in the action sequences.  Coreographed by Hong Kong legend and Matrix guru Yuen Wo Peng, the fights are lightning-fast, expertly staged, and loaded with fantasy elements thanks mostly to Wire-Fu.  All of the combatants are appropriately outfitted with superhuman elements of strength, speed and skill that make this a visual treat.  The highlight of the film is easily the nimble treetop swordfight between Li (Chow Yun Fat) and his young would-be student.<br/><br/>If this film comes to your town, or ever goes to wide release, take all of your friends and go see it.  Yesterday."

This ISN'T an American movie. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang's characters aren't two airheads running around like chickens without heads.  You can't compare this movie with any other movie that's been made.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is so original, it apparently hurts some people to admit to it.  I found this movie to be the best movie I had seen all year, and I saw a lot of movies this year. Everything about this movie was wonderful, and its a shame some people can't see past the visual representation of the character's strengths.  They don't fly because they're related to Peter Pan...Their ability to fly is a representation of their power as warriors.

","It is truly a superb movie. The actions and fighting scenes are different than the usual kung fu fighting. They are closer to the Shaolin fighting style, rather than usual Jacky Chen or Jet Li style.<br/><br/>The story itself is presented in special Ang Lee's approach. Calm and slow, while for most viewers might feel confused with the characters way of thinking. Well, just put it this way, this is a classic Chinese story, and involves lots classic traditional way of thinking. Pride, Family, Honor, Loyalty, and Revenge are some of the classic way of life. And if supported the plot towards making the story not so complicated, but make the characters seems complicated and difficult to understand.<br/><br/>The casts are well chosen, besides some objections about their pronunciations, they are well acted and off course, well fighting.<br/><br/>This is another example of how the movie technic supports the story and bring out the imaginary scenes which can only be seen through the mind's eyes at first.

It was as if the storyline and characters took a back seat to the immediacy of visual stimuli.  <br/><br/>About 30 minutes after I left the cinema I began to realize that the best things about the film were the very things I hadn't noticed as I was watching it.  The story is strong and combines so wonderfully with the incredible character development that I feel I HAVE to see it again to learn more about the characters, because I know there are things that I missed the first time around.  Oh yeah, I suppose it will also be nice to see the action sequences again, which, by the way were the best in any movie of this type I have ever seen.<br/><br/>So there you have it.  It is a film that features some the best kung-fu scenes of all time.  But the kung-fu scenes are not the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>One more thing.  I know that there are people in the USA that will refuse to see this film because of the subtitles - one guy walked out after about 90 seconds of the showing I went to.

","It's been an hour since I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and my throat is still burning and my eyes leaking as I write this.  I was startled to find myself crying tears of amazement and joy half way through the first astonishing heart pounding action sequence, then later was racked with helpless sobbing as the story moved inexorably towards its conclusion, and be warned, it's not a Hollywood ending.  It's been ten years since a film has affected me this deeply, and it wasn't a Hollywood effort then either; it was Depardieu's Cyrano de Bergerac.<br/><br/>In fact, Crouching Tiger shares some elements with Cyrano, not to mention Beowulf and Homer.  It's a simple, classic story, and (note to Hollywood) it's the simplicity of this picture that makes it so exquisitely poignant. No interminatable orchestral crescendos, no shouting in lieu of acting, no ""Aargh!  Ya got me!"" pauses and grimaces during the action sequences. Instead, we have a single but insistent drum or a haunting chello, reserved, measured emotion that builds genuine interest in the characters, and important elements in the action sequences that are gone so fast that you'll miss them if you so much as blink.  You have to actually *watch* Crouching Tiger, it's not shoved down your throat.  Don't eat, don't drink, don't even *breathe* or you'll miss something.<br/><br/>What strikes me most is the the contrast with the Hollywood trailers that preceeded it. ""ACADEMY AWARD WINNER JOE BLOW!... ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE NANCY McBLAND!... IN A FILM THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!... YOU WILL BE MOVED!... YOU WILL BE THRILLED!..."" blared Voiceover Man desperately, as Hollywood's finest screamed at each other, pounded their chests and sweated testosterone, and I wondered why I should care.  But then they all went away, and for for two hours I was reminded that movies can actually work magic.<br/><br/>The only downside was that I had to watch it with other people.  Granted, the theatre was nearly empty, but there was still one idiot that I heard give a panicked whisper of ""Is it all in Japanese?"" to his girlfriend about two minutes in.  Yes, it's all in ""Japanese"" (Cantonese and Mandarin), and if that scares you, stay well away.  Likewise, if you don't like crying at films, don't bother going; you'll spend the last ten minutes gritting your teeth and hissing ""Real. Men. Don't. Cry."" and feeling lots of those pesky emotion things.<br/><br/>However, go in with an open mind, and you will be astonished and moved. You will gasp and you will sob - and you will wonder why on earth Hollywood can't make films like this."

"Mr White-3","10","0","0","7 January 2001"," A breath of fresh air
","Crouching Tiger. is the latest film from director Ang Lee  (Sense and Sensibility, Ride with the Devil).  This is yet another example of the diversity of this talented director, who is surely as open minded as the Coen brothers when it comes to their scope for possibilities in film.<br/><br/>Presented in its original Mandarin language, with English subtitles, this film presents a bold statement for how much more open-minded cinemagoers are becoming.  It's a pleasure to see so many people going to see this; purely justification for the risks Lee took.<br/><br/>The film is set in early 19th century China, which is presented here in all its mystical and mythical glory, including a fantastic image of the splendours of Beijing (here presented as Peking as befits the time period). Chow Yun-fat plays Li Mu Bai, an expert swordsman and master of the martial art style of Wudan.  He has long spent time in meditative reflection, but has come to realise that something, or someone has been missing from his life.  That someone is Yu Shu Lien (played here with enormous dignity by Michelle Yeoh).  He returns to her to tell her that he is giving up his sword, the Green Destiny, a mysterious jade sword four hundred years old. He entrusts her to take it with her to give to an old friend in Peking. While in Peking, the sword is stolen by a thief in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>You realise at this stage in the film that it has been moving at a relatively slow pace, because suddenly it bursts into action, with a tremendous chase across the rooftops, and (literally) up the walls of Peking.  I've no wish to reveal much more of the film, as it's best left to discover its hidden secrets for yourself, and behold the wonders of a master director at work.<br/><br/>The performances by all involved are superb, Chow Yun-fat's Li, has a calm well being to his character, with a burning inner desire.  Yeoh's Yu, has a spark of danger to her character, while being protective of Li and the Wudan ways.  However, best of all is the performance by 21-year old Ziyi Zhang, as the evocative Governor's daughter Jen Yu.  She has a gentle beauty, which disguises her internal rage, where she is split between two destinies - which will she choose?<br/><br/>The film is presented straight-faced, which I found refreshing, with little seeds of humour planted sparingly throughout the film.  China has never looked better on film, with its lush mountain environments coming to the fore, and presenting an unspoken character within which all the legends are based.  The music also presents an emotional quality often missing from films these days, mixing a sophisticated Western orchestration, with the fragile melodies of traditional China.<br/><br/>The film mixes strong characterisation and narrative with explosive scenes of breath-taking and at times jaw-dropping action.    If there are similarities to the action in the Wachowski brother's seminal SF movie The Matrix, this is because the same choreographer was used in both films, although to a much greater and expansive use in Crouching Tiger.<br/><br/>This film deserves to be seen by as many as possible - hopefully by people who can be open minded to watch a film which operates on at least two levels, rather than your standard action fare."

","Director Ang Lee has elevated the *Martial Arts* film genre to an entirely new level. Using the tried and true story of revenge common to all HK Kung-Fu films as the basis he has created a masterpiece!<br/><br/>Everything about, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", works to perfection. As Master Li (Yun-Fat Chow) says, ""The sword is but a piece of steel, mastery comes from the arm that wields it"". And use the *Green Destiny* they will! Skill without knowledge is the lesson here. This is both then an action film as well as a spiritual journey as the characters develop their relationships to each other and to the *art* they seek to master. Li Mu Bai & Yu Shu Lien, they share a love tempered by the ways of honor, bound by the old traditions of Wudan. Lo (bandit) & Jen (princess) find a new love unbound by tradition even though they come from different sides of the *tracks* as the story goes.<br/><br/>Thus Jen must find a balance between *skill* and *Wisdom* to become a Wudan Master.<br/><br/>This story is a wondrous adventure, covering a landscape beautifully filmed by Peter Pau. The costumes by Timmy Yip are all first rate as is the set direction. The martial arts choreography by Woo-Ping Yuen is without equal and to answer a question about cultural differences between *West & East*, re: flying.....what's the difference between flying over rooftops and Hercules picking up a 10 ton stone and tossing it 15 meters? We deal with mythos here where logic gives way to imagination.<br/><br/>The only question I ask myself when leaving the theater is, ""was I entertained?"". In the case of CTHD it went far beyond being entertained to a magnificent cinematographic experience.<br/><br/>Thank you, Ang Lee, cast & crew."

","Not the transcendental experience promised by some critics, but very, very good nonetheless. A beautiful, moving, elegant picture. I read that ""Crouching Tiger"" is to the martial arts film what ""Stagecoach"" is to the Western - it represents the apotheosis, the absolute zenith of the genre. I wouldn't disagree with that. It's by turns exhilarating, hilarious and heartbreaking - what else do you want from a movie?<br/><br/>The irony is, Ang Lee's previous two film were also excellent. They were in English. Now this Chinese-language film looks like being his biggest hit in both Britain and America. Isn't that strange? Why did no-one go to see ""Ride With The Devil"" or ""The Ice Storm""?<br/><br/>I think we should be told."

","Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully choreographed, beautifully scored.  I just can't get past the fact that people fly in this movie- just float away in the middle of an otherwise breathtaking fight scene.  My wife chalked it up to a ""cultural difference"" that I couldn't possibly understand.  Perhaps.  Is there some Chinese legend I don't know about that says true martial arts masters can fly?  Bending the laws of gravity is one thing.  But when a character raises one fist and lifts off the ground a la Superman, my suspension of disbelief stops there.  I could have seen my way past it if it had even been explained within the context of the plot.  But it's just put up there, and we're meant to take it on faith that for whatever reason, these people can fly.  The flying didn't even seem to serve a true purpose, except to make the film even more ""visually stimulating.""  I thought the fight scenes were so good, the flying was an unnecessary effect that tainted my view of the rest of the movie.  I'm disappointed that my most lasting impression of this otherwise stunning film will be of people floating away to the snickering of the audience."
"imayne","Null","0","0","8 August 2000"," a great Chinese film
","As a Chinese from Singapore I just love the exposure Chinese talent is getting in Hollywood, John Woo, Jet Li, Jackie Chan and now Chow Yun Fat and Ang Lee.<br/><br/>CTHD is a smashing film. It is none-too-bloody, subtle and delicate in its handling, and that makes it a great contrast to your overblown Hollywood pictures. Chow Yun Fat plays Li Mu Bai, arguably the greatest swordsman in the ""Kiang Hu"" (the world of warriors) who tries to avenge his teacher and also retrieve his famous sword, the Green Destiny, capable of slicing other swords in half. The sword has been stolen by a masked thief under the tutelage of Chow's nemesis the Jade Eyed Fox. The thief is actually Jen (a name I HATE, her Chinese name is Yu Jiao Long, meaning the ""Nimble Jade Dragon""), an aristocrat stuck in a pre-arranged marriage who wants her way out and living with Lo, a Mongol bandit she has fallen in love with. (I also hate the name Lo, his Chinese name is Lo Xiao Hu, meaning ""Little Tiger""). This couple is in fact the ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Hidden Dragon"" of the title. <br/><br/>The first thing that struck me about the film was Peter Pau's photography, it captured the Spirit of Chinese landscape painting COMPLETELY. In Chinese landscape painting, what is UNSEEN is just as important as what IS SEEN, the belief of ""form before emptiness"" to create refreshing poetic visuals is a part of Chinese painting philosophy. In this film we have large deserts in which humans become puny figures, a waterfall descending from high, as in the words of the Chinese poet Li Bo, ""like the milky way falling from Heaven."" Mountains emerge from a sea of mist and temples on the mountains look as though they were castles in the air. Wheere we have blasted to oblivion by loud, crowded action vehicles, this is indeed a welcome change.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are needless to say, wonderful. In one scene Jen takes on twenty competitors using the Green Destiny in a tavern single-handedly while reciting Chinese poetry. In another Michelle Yeoh's character, Yu Xiu Lian, fights Jen with an entire arsenal of Chinese weaponry. One other scene between Li Mu Bai and Jen is also wonderfully played out, and Chow Yun Fat shows he kicks ass in period garb just as well in modern garb.<br/><br/>The actors are charismatic and excellent, best of all is Zhang Zi Yi as Jen, she is beautiful, wilful, passionate, stubborn, feisty and cunning, and manages to bring out the complex motivations and layers of her character. Chow and Yeoh are solid as ever, Chow's a dream to watch: he's cool under fire, skilful and unwavering even in the greatest crisis.<br/><br/>Storywise, it is more than a straightforward action picture but a story that explores the differences between two generations, Li Mu Bai and Yu Xiu Lian are the conservative older generation bound by Confucian ethics and principles. Jen and Lo are the passionate new generation who believe in following their hearts as they please. It also takes time to explore the relationship between lovers, as well as that of master and disciple. And like many of Ang Lee's previous films, one's bond to the family.<br/><br/>The only flaw I can think of is the four different Chinese accents of the leads, Chow Yun Fat has a thick Hongkong accent, Michelle Yeoh a thick Malaysian accent, Zhang Zi-Yi who plays Jen is a mainland Chinese, and Zhang Zhen who plays Lo is a Taiwanese. The interaction of four accents is laughable. And also the diva ballad belted out by Coco Lee, the Chinese Celine Dion, is groan-inducing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's a beautiful film. The title is actually a Chinese proverb meaning ""incredibly powerful, talented individuals who hide away from public attention"" or ""hidden dangers"". Here it is a pun for Jen and Lo, who hide noble spirits under their exteriors as a spoilt aristocrat and a bandit. CTHD explores a vision as sweeping as the Chinese landscape, and as unfathomable as the Human Heart. This is a VERY GOOD FILM.<br/><br/>Rating: 89/100"
"modius","Null","0","0","6 January 2001"," Beautifully poetic, makes you want to fall in love with film again
","I have to say that the year 2000 has been very disappointing for film, films such as Charlie's Angels, Snatch, Gone in Sixty Seconds, etc have all showed Hollywood's hollowness when it comes to film.  The only good film was Gladiator, that was very well done - however Ang Lee's beautifully shot Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes its mantle as the best film of 2000, or if your in the UK (like me) the best film of 2001.<br/><br/>This magnificent and poetic film is wonderous to watch and to marvel in. It's tough not to get a kick out of this operatic movie. There's fateful romance, legendary themes of honor and determination, strong heroines, and fantastically choreographed martial arts which finally put films such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2 or the Matrix to shame.<br/><br/>The fight moves, masterfully choreographed by The Matrix's Woo-Ping Yu have a definitive poetic flow to them which suits the films mood and melodramatic beautifully.  The fly-by-wire scene's may get a few groans from Western Audience's - but there is a beauty in those sequences that weren't captured by the Matrix or other previous films.<br/><br/>The two main characters played brilliantly by Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who looks as stunning as ever!) carry off their roles with charm, and the melancholy of their unspoken love has real pathos.<br/><br/>There's also plenty of backstory to fill the melodrama, amongst the intertwining plotline - there is Jade Fox's disciple, the beautiful Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), an aristocrat with a delicate exterior but the heart of a fighter. She's preparing to marry into wealth, but has a dream of escaping with Pirate Lo - and a dream where she can do as she pleases and is not constrained by her family or wealth.<br/><br/>One of the film's centerpieces is a perfect reflection of its sheer beauty - Chow Yun Fat and Jen swordfight among the wispy treetops, soaring and climbing to the quiet strains of cellist Yo-Yo Ma.<br/><br/>It has many messages, such as that life constantly devoted to the study of Martial Arts is not a beautiful one, but one filled with sorrow.  Or messages such as finding your own path may lead you to destiny.  Also towards the end the haunting message that Chow gives to Yeoh about being a ghost by her side rather than rise to the next level in life is mesmerizingly beautiful and sad.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's achievement is to reconnect the flagging martial arts genre with its latent sense of decorum and romance, qualities which have been ignored by other martial arts films who seemed to confuse martial arts with action.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger exposes the fatal secrets of martial arts with those of meditation and even calligraphy, and persuades us to take them equally seriously.  Added to the maticilous skill in rendering the delicate touches of the principals' hidden love, he has an epic sense of space and landscape, moving lightly from Peking to the desert: Ang Lee puts a girdle around his earth in seconds.<br/><br/>This film is what the Phantom Menance should have felt like.  And Ang Lee must certainly win the best picture award at this year's Oscars, but knowing Hollywood, they'll give Ang Lee the best foreign picture - which is a shame, because this film is certainly the best I've ever seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Overall: Sublime, Superb, Brilliant.

","Wow, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in one word 'Amazing.' Surely due for a few nods from the Academy Awards, this film is nothing less than extraordinary.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is above all a story of love. First of two aging fighters, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who are courageous warriors yet cannot seem to push their feelings toward each other out into the open. Next, it tells of the love between Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), a brilliant martial artist who happens to be the daugther of a governor, and Lo (Chen Chang) a desert bandit who is filled with ambition but who focuses his talents on robbing the wealthy. Lastly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is about the needfullness of Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) to pass her traits of brilliance in fighting for all the wrong things onto Jen Yu using stolen secrets of ancient masters.<br/><br/>Filled with photography to rival that of some of the finest 'big production' movies ever made and action sequences that bring the art of eastern kung-fu films to our screens in the US like no other film before it, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon doesn't seem to miss a beat throughout its entirety.<br/><br/>I recommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to pretty much anyone, whether you see it for the beauty of great film art, its story of love, or the surreal action scenes you will leave it feeling fulfilled. I only have one regret as far as this film in the fact that the same choreographer shares their name on the credits as the choreographer of The Matrix. Don't get me wrong, The Matrix was a decent movie, but if Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was released before The Matrix there may not be anything mistaken between classic kung-fu conventions and borrowed action sequences.<br/><br/>To sum up this film, I hope that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can add to the bridge for us in the U.S. who are given mediocre 'blockbusters' because we haven't, as a majority, tasted real cinema except in a few rare instances, since the 70s."

The movie has very little character development. The relationship between Michelle and Chow is not explored enough. Also,  there is a twenty minute side story in the middle of how Zhang Ziyi's charachter met a rebel and fell in love with him.  When they get back to the main story they barely touch the relationship between the two young stars.  Instead they have Zhang beating up a bar full of men to wow the audience.  I guess I am the only one who doesn't have this on my top ten list.  Almost Famous and Wonder Boys are much better films that develop there characters.

","For me, this film was an exquisite fairy tale. For my boyfriend, a martial artist and lover of all things Asian -- including Taoism and Buddhism, sensibilities of which are evident throughout the movie --  it was an exquisite betrayal. We both had our breath taken away by the costumes, the locations, the props, the sets, the choreography, the cinematography, the music, and the acting (especially by Michelle Yeoh, who broke both our hearts repeatedly). I felt the story made perfect sense and fulfilled the prophecy of its own stated philosophy in  a logical and meaningful fashion. The fact that I could predict each element of the plot as it was dramatically foreshadowed only in this case enhanced my enjoyment, because this is apt within reason for the genre of legendary or pseudo-legendary fantasy.  However, my boyfriend felt personally betrayed by some of the ""wrong"" choices made by a certain character. <br/><br/>To me, his anger speaks to the power of the film. He loved the world created for this film and some of the characters in it so much that it physically assaulted him when another character caused them injury.  While I was totally speechless and utterly choked up at the end of the film, it was because I was swimming in a sense of beauty beyond words -- and totally beyond what I expected from a fluffy little kung fu film.<br/><br/>At certain points in the film, after some of the fight scenes, various members of the audience (which was a predominantly affluent, middle-aged audience in a subdued suburb north of Boston) broke out into cheers and applause. <br/><br/>At the end of the film, everyone in the audience (except my boyfriend) went ""Oooooooooooooh.""<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, it is simple, tender and rich.

","I went to see this movie with a lot of expectations, based on the great press it had received.  True, it was a beautifully photographed, and perfectly-directed and -acted, as we've come to expect from Ang Lee. Unfortunately, the tired old plot (everyone has to avenge their master, father, sister, cousin, whatever) and silly supernatural effects put a huge damper on what would have otherwise been a decent adventure/love story.<br/><br/>
It was kind of like opera, where all of a sudden two people will jump out of their conversation into a big aria; here, they literally jump off the ground and start flying around in a way that makes a complete mockery of the martial arts.  The fighting in this film has been compared to the fighting in The Matrix, but the comparison isn't really fair.  In The Matrix there was at least a sense of physics, even if it was an exaggerated physics, and the audience gasped with delight.  In this movie, the audience I was in just laughed, repeatedly, at the silliness of it.  This would have been tolerable if the actual combat was any good, but really, it's no more exciting than what we've come to expect from Jackie Chan and co., and here it ends up looking more like dancing.<br/><br/>The only really compelling part of the film was the romance in the desert, and even that sequence stretched out well beyond the point of interest.<br/><br/>
This is the only Ang Lee movie where I started looking at my watch an hour before the end.  I hope he'll go back to making brilliant, innovative masterpieces like The Ice Storm and Ride with the Devil, and avoid trendy set-pieces like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

","I was very lucky to watch this movie when it comes out in some parts of Asia at a much early date--July, as opposed to the Dec. date in America.  Lee Ang's new film, crouching tiger hidden dragon, belongs to a specific type of film we Chinese like to call ""wu shia"" (may not be a correct translation) Which has gained a special place in the hearts of Chinese around the world. These films have exciting fighting scenes in which the characters perform seemingly impossible tasks, such as ""flying"" 20 feet and able to break walls and tear down buildings.  But it may be because we have seem so much fighting, CTHD's fighting scenes are not what excites me, but rather the humans described in the film, with their flaws and personalities, as usual in Lee Ang's films, are what's exciting and thought-provoking.  And the intense conflict will put you at your seats, both internal and external.

","After reading through many of the user comments on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I noticed that a lot of negative attention has been focused on the ""unrealistic"" fight sequences in which the characters ""fly"" and appear to run up and down walls, as well as balance themselves on flimsy tree branches.<br/><br/>The reason that the characters' ability to do this is not explained in the movie is because it is understood in Chinese culture that kung fu is a practice in self-control, and thus at a certain point in kung fu training, warriors obtain the ability to control their weight and appear to glide through the air, much like they are flying. It is not meant to be comical or fantastical; Lee was just following the tradition and true form of kung fu in piecing together these fight scenes, and neither he nor the film should be criticized because of that."

Maybe then can I explain how this movie moved me, touched me and raised a storm in my head  and became the best movie (all categories) I have ever seen, after 6 years finally pushing `Heat' down the ladder to a venerable second. I want to savor this moment. I almost want to resist. But how can one resist `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?<br/><br/>Set in China some time in the middle ages, two warriors, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai (Yeoh and Yun-Fat) battle an elusive enemy called the `Jade Fox' and are surprised to almost meet their match in a disciple, led astray and onto the wrong path by the Jade Fox (the Anakin-Skywalker-syndrome). The adventure revolves much around a sword that the Master warrior Li Mu Bai gives away as a gift, after deciding to give his warrior life up. But before he can give it up completely, he must face his Master's nemesis. The film is filled with stunning scenery and photography, violent and riveting martial art, a dialogue so poetic and justified it made my head spin. Refreshing and wondrous in the art of storytelling, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has made a profound impression on me.<br/><br/>I am relatively new to the Hong Kong movies, and movies where martial arts play a considerable role. Therefore, I don't know how far Lee and his crew has pushed the ideas and the filming  but to me, this film was so deeply compelling and spellbinding, I have a hard time imagining anything like it. It's not a `martial arts movie'  it's much more of a drama, a love story and a retelling of Chinese lore. Magic is the essence, the aerial ballet of the fight scenes and the absolute control over every move in close combat, trigger and inspire a sense of wonder and adds beauty to the art of killing that Li Mu Bai is tired of. I understand that Ang Lee must have borrowed a great deal of material from Hong Kong movies, but like I said, to someone unfamiliar with those, this film appears quite revolutionary. There's poetry in every single detail: the story, the dialogue, the characters and their every trait, the scenery, the camera work and, of course, the fighting  violent and almost feverish. Colors, sound, the language, the trees, the desert and the warrior code. It all nailed me to seat and kept me on the edge of it until the very end. This is the kind of experience I so often want but seldom get. When the awkward position I had doubts that I could take for 2 hrs has been completely forgotten, then there's something great afoot.<br/><br/>I say if the film feels absolutely spotless, if there are no flaws that appear on the first viewing (be it goofs or serious flaws in the storytelling), then the makers have achieved something extraordinary. Those films are few and far between. `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is of that special brand that not only appears flawless, but entirely perfect. I'm not saying that it is perfect  I'm saying that the depth and scope of the film makes it seem so. And that is not something that happens very often, not to me anyway. I think the last one must have been `Heat' or maybe `Se7en'. Before that...who knows.<br/><br/>A clearer case of 10 out of 10 I have yet to see."

","Riveting. From the opening scene to the last, each frame of film is compelling -- first for the raw beauty of the scenes, characters and costumes and for its cinematographic excellence, but also for the intensity in story telling, the jaw-dropping fight choreography, and the way that the film unfolds in such a way that it is nearly impossible to predict the ending.<br/><br/>For the fighting scenes, which are spectacular, the ""wire fu"" techniques are used to heighten the film's sense of mystery and esoteric, ancient fighting techniques -- the manuals for which have been stolen by the antagonist. Not all of the fighting relies on wire work, such as the swordplay fighting scene between young Jen Yu (ZiYi Zhang) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) in the practice room at Yu's headquarters. The footwork and speed alone is breathtaking. The wire work, used more judiciously here, adds mystique and a sense of magic and wonder.<br/><br/>See it. You won't be disappointed. Even the fact that it is all in Chinese with English subtitles works well in this film. Yo Yo Ma's haunting cello work in the soundtrack helps solidify an already magnificent bit of film.<br/><br/>

","It's been about 5 hours since I walked out of the theatre, and my mind is floating thinking about this film.  Ang Lee has put together a film that truly gives everyone a little something, and most a lot more.  If you watched this merely for the action scenes, you would go home so fulfilled you'd probably call this the greatest action film ever made.  But, it is so much more.  <br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yoeh, and Ziyi Zhang have a chemistry that has not been seen in quite some time.  When a movie can convince us that there is chemistry between the two leads, we applaud it.  What can we say when the chemistry is so strong between three actors?<br/><br/>Many want to compare this to the TV movies they watched on Saturday afternoons when the baseball game got rained out, but this is so very different.  Sure the outlandish fighting scenes are there (in a way never seen before), and the lost article and avenging hero is in place, but this is so very different.  The visuals are so brilliant that one walks out of the darkened theater and the bright lights don't seem that bright.  This film leaves you with a glow that only a few films can. <br/><br/>
It isn't a perfect film, none are, but it is an important film.  This will do for Asian Films, what Pulp Fiction did for English speaking films.  One thing that is great about this movie, is that despite the violence there is not much gore.  Children of practically all ages could enjoy this film.  All violence and sexuality is implied.  <br/><br/>If it weren't for the fact that Chow Yun Fat was in ""The Killer,"" I'd say this was his best film.  Michelle Yeoh was amazing.  Ziyi Zhang, left me speechless.  She is the true gem of the movie.  Go out and enjoy.  This is definitely one of those films a 19"" screen doesn't do justice."

I was really annoyed at how everyone kept giving that bratty girl Jen more chances to clean her act up when she had no respect for anyone, whether it be her lover, Jade Fox, or the warrior couple.  If these warriors were so smart, why did they keep giving her more chances?  She was so irritating and petulant I wish someone would have killed her already, and smashed her stupid comb while they were at it.<br/><br/>
And since when can martial arts experts fly like Peter Pan?!  The whole time I was watching that all I could think about was Tinkerbell.

","First, I should say that I am not a martial arts fan nor a devotee of Kung Fu movies.  I've seen maybe two Bruce Lees and that's about it. But I was encouraged to see this film from the reviews and I will probably see it again. I am told that its plotline is a common KungFu story, but it reminded me of Maxine Hong Kingston's semi-autobiographical The Woman Warrior, in which the daughter of Chinese immigrants to the US seeks refuge from her family's attempts to control her fate in her fantasy of becoming a character from Chinese myth, the woman warrior who saves her family by learning the martial arts as a mystical discipline. This film too is altogether women-centred--the first thing I noticed as the film opened was that none of the women's feet were bound, although they would have been at almost any period in Chinese history. So this is not history, but myth, myth in which a young woman (ZiYi Zhang) seeks to avoid a forced marriage by becoming, clandestinely, a powerful warrior. That she must do so outside the discipline of the training school leads, inevitably, to complications and excesses, but never are we led to condemn her search. It is an utterly beautiful movie, more a ballet than anything else, and the fight scene in the tree tops is absolutely not to be missed. The film is playing here in an IMax version as well, and while I haven't seen it, people I know who have were less enthusiastic about it than I: apparently the effects are so spectacular in this format that they overwhelm the film. I am, however, puzzled by the PG 13 rating for violence.  The violence in this film is notional; I can remember only one splash of blood and there are very few apparent deaths.  Younger children might have difficulty with a subtitled film and they might find some of the exposition a bit slow, but they certainly would not be harmed by seeing it."

","`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'<br/><br/>Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee has made some fine English-language films, such as `The Ice Storm' and `Sense And Sensibility', but bravely he has returned to the Chinese language and culture for his latest work in a totally different genre  and it is a triumph. The story is taken from the fourth volume of a series set in the early 19th century Qing dynasty and written by Wang Du Lu in a magical style known in Chinese as wu xia'.<br/><br/>At heart, this is a double love story. The first relationship  silent and simmering  is between veteran warrior Li Mu Bai (played by Chow Yun Fat of `Anna And The King') and his close friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh from `Tomorrow Never Dies'). The other relationship  a much more combustible and passionate affair  is between the young bandit Lo (Chang Chen) and the beautiful Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi).<br/><br/>Astonishingly, these very different relationships are played out in the context of a martial arts movie which contains some absolutely stunning fight scenes, choreographed by Yeun Wo-Ping who did similarly brilliant work on `The Matrix', and it is Lee's genius that combines personal passion and martial miracles to such dramatic effect. In this mysterious new world, there is even a sword called Green Destiny', a villainess known as Jade Fox, and a fight scene in the tops of bamboo trees.<br/><br/>Since I've only recently returned from a tour of China, I loved the wonderful sets and rich costumes. Shot in Beijing and the Gobi desert, the scenery is simply breath-taking, the photography glorious and the drum-beat music stirring. In short, this is set to be both a cult and a classic."

Many good words have been said about CTHD, and I have no wish to repeat them.<br/><br/>It is simply a wonderful experience that combines the best of both worlds. Ang Lee has captured the essence of the Wuxia genre from the traditional Chinese cinemas and add some Hollywood production values to it. The result is a romantic-martial-art-fantasy epic with breathtaking cinematography and a hauntingly beautiful score, that I have never seen before.<br/><br/>Most Westerner viewers, who have no previous exposure to the Wuxia genre, are dumbstruck by the action sequences. The actions in CTHD are very very good but you can find more outrageous (if not better) fight scenes in Jet Li's in China series and Donnie Yen's New Dragon Inn and Iron Monkey, just to name a few. However, these above-mentioned flicks are usually filled with a weak plot and hollow characters.<br/><br/>Some minor complaints:<br/><br/>1) The desert flashback sequence does seem a bit too long even it is essential to understand Jen's character.<br/><br/>2) The way that Ang Lee handled Mui Bai and Shu Lien's relationship is great but I wish there is more screen time on it.<br/><br/>3) As a Chinese, I do notice the actors' varying accents but it doesn't bother me as much as other Chinese viewers.

Zhang Ziyi is a find who holds her own well with the veterans who also include the Taiwanese icon of Ang Lee's youth, Cheng Pei Pei.

Still, I thought what if such a film had even better production values, more superbly skilled acrobatic actors, and more gorgeous, rarely seen backdrops and locales. My wish has been answered with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>Plenty has already been said about this great movie, apparently by others much more versed in the genre than myself. So, I will simply mention a few favorite things....<br/><br/>Yun-Fat Chow, as the semi-mystical warrior-master type. I am not a big fan of his, and think he is rather wooden, still he gives just the right aloofness and reserve to the character. Michelle Yeoh, while not a stunning physical presence, has the mastery of moves and obvious physical strength to make her very compenent character real. Zhang Zi-Yi is stunning both for her physical beauty but obvious acrobatic grace. Chang Chen, primarily in his more playful moments in the desert, strike just the right note. And Cheng Pei-Pei is a real delight in her witch-like role...not only does she have the pedigree, but such a great face!<br/><br/>I have been to China many times, and find most of the populous areas to be drab and wasted in appearance. So what a joy that the movie shows such beautiful vistas and sets. Every character rings with a nobility or at least strength, showing a great people at their best.<br/><br/>I am pleased to find that the movie is really more along the lines of Chinese folklore/mythology/epic than a simple martial arts film. The twin doomed love stories plus the ancient customs and stories (sometimes only hinted at) make this so much more.<br/><br/>The action, while not as 'real' as, for example, a Chan film, rises to a level of beauty that matches the grandeur of the story. These people are all fine physical actors, but the wire work and apparent digital cleanup (or other form of editing) is necessary. Yes, the action is not perfect, some is too shadowed, some a bit fuzzy, still that sound you hear is not just the drums...its lots of jaws dropping to the theatre floor."
"MIles-11","Null","0","0","27 July 2000"," Let's keep things in perspective, folks.
","Admittedly, I didn't see this film on the big screen like most of the early reviewers here, so that should be taken into account. However, I think I've seen enough films of this genre to say that while this is far above average, it's hardly the best. The plot is too disjointed and flat, breaking the ""show don't tell"" rule at every opportunity. Consequently, there is never any real feeling of emotional involvement or identification with the characters, nor is there a foreseeable climax that the film is constantly progressing towards. As if this dearth of dramatic impetus weren't enough, there's a flashback right in the middle of the film that's at least 20 minutes long, further removing the viewer from the storyline. Some may appreciate this unconventional approach, but I'm of the mind that certain genre conventions are developed for good reason. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is fine, but the increase in budget does little to separate it from the Hong Kong swordplay films of the early '90s. The costumes and sets, authentic or not, lack some of the color of those of other genre films. The wirework is generally not very well done; in a Tsui Hark film, wirework looks like exactly what it's intended to; in this film, it looks like actors being pulled around by wires. <br/><br/>For all my criticism, I did enjoy the film. The direction, choreography and scenery drastically improve in the final half-hour, and the character study approach is somewhat interesting, even if it does sacrifice forward motion. Despite the early, disappointing fight scenes, some of those in the second half are up to par with any other film of the genre. Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi's battle is particularly impressive, even if they are obviously doubled for the longer, more complex takes. It's a good film, and certainly looks like a masterpiece in comparison to the current competition from Andrew Lau and company. I just can't honestly say it was more impressive, exciting, or emotionally involving than comparatively cheap films like The Blade, Dragon Inn, or the Swordsman series."

My only reservation about this film is the lack of sexual boldness with its female characters, but that is because I love to see the beatiful Asian female form in more full display. The smoldering emotional subtext more than makes up for this traditional reserve. This one is not to be missed. I shared a delicious Thai meal of Pad Thai Tofu with an old girlfriend from the east after taking in this magical film, and the inspirational energy of Lee's vision carried over into an unforgettable evening that brought the whole experience to a fulfilling climax.

","CTHD was a loving and clever tribute to the martial arts movies that Ang Lee grew up with in Taiwan, and presented in a way only Lee could do.  The brilliant casting of Cheng Pei Pei should have given it away to any ""serious"" fan of the genre.  Movies such as Golden Swallow, The One-Armed Swordsman, Blood Brothers, Men from the Monastery, only to name a few, were the backdrop for this wonderfully complex story.  Everything about the movie told us something about the 5000-year-old culture, philosophy, and mythology of China. The fact that Lee did not have the movie dubbed showed that he wanted us to experience something that was truly Chinese.  The dismissal of the use of wire work in its fight scenes certainly dismisses the culture and mythology of China and only shows the closed-mindedness and ignorance of a few viewers. The overwhelmingly positive comments about the CTHD shows more that just a few people ""get it,"" notwithstanding those self-proclaiming fans of the genre as an excuse for not ""getting it."" I am not an expert on martial arts movies, but like Ang Lee, grew up with the aforementioned movies and countless others of that period."

"khu","Null","0","0","26 December 2000"," A breathtakingly beautiful film set in the Wu Sha genre.
","American audiences not familiar with the genre of 'Wu Sha' may need a quick lesson: Wu Sha is essentially the Chinese equivalent of sword and sorcery, but instead of magic potions and spells, the characters use a blend of incredible athleticism and meditation to achieve a state of physical power not unlike comic superheroes. In wu sha, if you are in the proper mental and physical state, you can literally become lighter than air. You can leap tall buildings (or bamboo groves) in a single bound. You can move faster than a speeding bullet. These assumptions aren't explained in the movie itself, which is why many American audiences have slight problems with 'realism' or 'suspension of disbelief' -- they're missing the point because they're just not used to the entire context that CTHD is set in. CTHD is not *supposed* to be 'realistic' in a physical sense. These people possess superpowers that are supernormal. Physically, CTHD is set in the realm of the super-normal. It's the emotional story which should be real. If you come to the film with this understanding, I believe you will enjoy this film a lot more. It's a shame that many Americans, ignorant of this context, giggle at the incredibly beautiful fight scenes and reject the entire story based on this ignorance. I almost wish Ang Lee had elected to give some brief explanation of wu sha at the beginning of the film to head off this potential story-telling obstacle."

"sora-2","Null","0","0","27 December 2000"," The Greatest Compliment
","Is 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' the best martial arts film ever made, as some people say?  I hesitate to agree.  A serious fan of the genre, I have spent many hours watching the notable entries - 'Enter the Dragon', 'Once Upon A Time in China', 'Drunken Master II' - analyzing the conventions and aesthetics, and deciding what I like and dislike.  Compared to those other works, I say no: no new ground is broken. For sheer physical skill, Jackie Chan's 'Drunken Master II' or Jet Li's 'Fist of Legend' win out.  Fans of fantasy kung-fu can turn to 'Chinese Ghost Story' or the superlative 'Zu: Warriors of Magic Mountain'.  If over-the-top action with rapid-fire editing and tons of ""wire work"" is your piece of cake, check out 'Iron Monkey' or 'Fong Sai Yuk'. Even thematically, the angst-ridden heroes of 'CTHD' have graced the screen before.  Doomed warrior-lovers Leslie Cheung and Brigitte Lin  in the 'The Bride with White Hair' are tragic cousins to Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh in 'CTHD'.  Not to mentioned the powerful yet lonely beings that inhabit the poetic 'Ashes of Time' (which has a dessert setting similar to the middle act of 'CTHD'). So Ang Lee's 'CTHD' is not the best martial arts film every made, in my opinion.  But that's okay, because it is not a martial arts film anyway. It is a film about martial arts. Now let me clarify before I'm accused of using academic double-speak.<br/><br/>Most martial arts movies, be they Chinese kung-fu flicks or Japanese chambara (swordfight), Italian gladitor adventures or American B-movies of the 'Best of the Best' or 'American Ninja' variety, use fighting as window dressing.  Action is employed to generate visceral thrills, to visually provoke that rush of adrenaline and satisfy the desire to watch someone ""kick ass"".  They are rarely analytical, exploring what it means to be a warrior, to live a life of violence, and the consequences that follow.  At best, they make cursory (and cliched) statements about honor and loyalty (The ""Ha-ha, you killed my father, prepare to die!"" element). There is nothing wrong with this.  Escapism is important.  Having fun is important, and I myself have watched 'Blade' more times than I care to admit.  But I think there is something wasteful about using martial arts, or, more accurately in this case, martial arts story-telling, strictly for kicks.  Especially since, as 'CTHD' shows, they can be used to say a lot about the human condition, no less than poetry or song. In an interview, the late great Bruce Lee, both a true martial artist and a bona fide movie star, said that the hardest part about being a martial artist was to express oneself truthfully.  And from my own experience (6 years in aikido) and looking at history, being true is the only way one can really succeed in all arenas of the martial arts - learning, teaching and fighting (where ultimately, no amount of lies or bluffing will protect you - either you can or cannot). There lies the conflict that propels the drama of 'CTHD'.  Li Mu Bai (Chow) and Shu Lien (Yeoh) are torn between their love for one another, and their pledge to honor the memory of Shu Lien's slain betrothed, who was Li's friend.  Li Mu Bai is also faced by a host of other conflicting choices: his desire to put down the sword and his duty to avenge his master's death, not to mention mentoring the young Jen (ZiYi Zhang).  On the surface, Jen is a woman of class and gentility, but inside lies a warrior, and a burning passion for the rugged thief Lo (Chen Chang).  And as a warrior, she has the choice to follow the righteous path of Wudan master Li, or scoundrel ways of Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-pei). What these characters - superhuman, powerful - are unable to speak, is expressed in their skill.  While the dizzying fights choreographed by veteran Yuen Woo-Ping might not be the great standouts of his career in and of themselves, it is the manner in which they are used.  Jen's impetuousness versus Shu Lien's discipline, age and experiences are not described but shown in vigorous one-to-one fight set within an enclosed training hall. The dichotomy between the characters' ability to literally fly free of the earth, and their entrapment within roles, responsibilities and traditions makes them especially poignant.  The superheroes of their world, they do not have secret identities (well, some do), but they do have secrets; deep, repressed longings, which keep them from being as truly great as they could be.  As Li Mu Bai says near the beginning of the film, he is not yet enlightened. As the film progresses, though, everyone is peeled away layer by layer. Jen emerges as a great fighter, even better than her evil teacher Jade Fox, but is not truly a warrior yet.  In their mutual deaths, Jade Fox and Li Mu Bai finally reach the full truth, as Jade Fox's insecurities and hatred come to fore, and Li Mu Bai's love for Shu Lien finally is given expression. Li Mu Bai's death is a final lesson for the film, given to the next generation of potential warriors symbolized by Jen and Lo.  Shu Lien tells Jen to live true to herself, and Jen takes a (literal) final leap, thought not one of faith, but of being."

There are plenty of marshall art movies that blew me away even withouth the benefit of big screen. To name a few, Once Upon a Time in China I & II, Drunden Master II, Fists of Legend and Swordsman II. BTW, Jet Li was originally offered Chow's part.

With dazzling special effects and Yuen Wo Ping's (The Matrix) virtuoso martial arts choreography, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" leaves recent kung-fu flicks ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Romeo Must Die"" in the dust.

Not coincidentally, perhaps, Zhang looks very much like a youthful Gong Li.  Matching Yeoh's athletic prowess with her balletic grace, Zhang plays Jen as an on-screen contradiction of innocence and sensuality.  At one point in the film, Zhang asks Chow Yun-fat, ""Is it the sword that you want, or is it me?"" echoing the inner-thoughts of the males in the audience.  With a balanced script, the breathless cinematography of China by Peter Pau (The Killer), the star-power of Zhang, Chow and Yeoh, and the perfect mix of action and drama by director Ang Lee, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" seamlessly combines the genres of action and ""art"", raising the ante of martial arts films for years to come."

There's a sort of art to everything...even the fights, while brutal at times, are always fluid and dance-like. There are a few problems.  First, the fact that the fights are dance-like, while making them beautiful in some ways, also removes some of the emotional impact of the battle in others.  Some of the battles come off more as martial arts exhibitions than actual life-or-death struggles, which can take away from the enjoyment of the film and emotion of the plot.

On the other hand, 'finding yourself' is Hollywood's idea. I do not like it but this movie is aimed at world audience.<br/><br/>(3) Ang Lee, Tan Dun, Yo-yo Ma and Chow Yun Fat are the most important men in their own fields in our generation. After 2 or 3 hundred years, their work still will be appreciated by our great grand children. Only a handful of Hollywood movies made today can claim the same. (4) There may not be a better performance by a new actor/actress as Zhang Ziyi in this movie even she is not recognized in Oscar - see how protective are Oscar's folks. (5) I like Coco's theme song than the one won the Oscar. It seems to be the same reason as #4 why it did not get an Oscar. (6) Who is the most beautiful woman in the movie? You're wrong. Chen Pu Pu is when she was younger. (7) Chow is a real actor and Jet Li is more a Kung Fu Master. Jet Li, the original choice, may not do that well in this movie that requires good acting. (8) Another HK actress more beautiful than Zhang was approached first for the role. She turned it down due to too much work for the money. Did she know she missed the chance of a life time? (9) HK is making this kind of movies since 1960s. Lee is credited in introducing to the general audience in the west but he did not create this kind of movie. On contrary to some users' view, I'm glad Lee did not introduce the culture from scratch as it would make the movie too boring. (10) Village Voice had a bad review on this movie. They had a point though I do not totally agree. However, some users gave this movie the worst rating with racial remarks. It reminded me of a Nazi's kid saying some movie is bad becuase there are so many Jewish names in the credit. (11) If this one is your first Kung Fu/ Fantasy movie from Asia and you like it, check out Iron Monkey, Chinese Ghost Story..."

","When I went to see this movie I was expecting an intricate plot, some eye-candy, and memorable scenes. I was not let down. I have to admit that even for some of its flaws, I LOVED the movie! It contained a whole mix of genres, and did a okay job of it. Fantasy mixed with drama, add some martial arts, an exotic setting, and you get a movie that needs to be recognized as an epic(That is if the acting wasn't bad). I would have to agree with some that this movie was overestimated but that is a price for being a really good movie. There is never a balance(It seems) because great movies are either overestimated or unappreciated. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was not immune to this. Now the people with a hard time with the characters flying: You too have a right to be heard, but come on. Last time I checked there was no book written which states,""Thou shall disregard a movie due to the fact that characters do things to which there are no explanations"". I thought the flying added a flavor rarely seem in a martial arts/fantasy/romance/drama. And note the word fantasy. Come on, say it,F-A-N-T-A-S-Y. We need to stop going to the movies and expecting it to awe us and give euphoric highs. And remember a movie is to entertain but it becomes better when it leaves something with us(preferably good). And this movie does that."

","What a movie! The best of China/Hong Kong came together to teach Hollywood a lesson about making films. Ang Lee, the director, is best known for great dramas(Sense And Sensibility, Eat Drink Man Woman, The Ice Storm, etc...) from both China and the U.S. So he comes out with a brilliant action movie, one of the best ever made anywhere. Chow Yun-Fat, for sure an action star, never was really a kung-fu type. He did the Two-gun heroic bloodshed thing now of course a staple of Hollywood and Tarantino movies. So he picks up a sword and becomes a Martial Arts master. Then there is Michelle Yeoh. The coolest woman on film. Probably the biggest female movie star worldwide. Here she gives a dramatic performance that is worthy of an Oscar. And that's just for starters. Also a great performance from newcomer Zhang Ziyi. She will be a Hollywood staple as soon as she can speak English. Did I mention that also Mr. Chow and Ms. Yeoh didn't speak the language the film was made in. Let's see Hollywood make something comparable to this. An Epic film that will be remembered forever and only cost 10 million to make. Not a chance Hollywood. not a chance."

There is an interlude of about 30 minutes during a flashback in the desert where no special effects are used, and the story is captivating. The rest of the time, it was forgotten.<br/><br/>If you remember Star Trek, The Motion Picture, you will recall long drawn out scenes of special effects for no purpose other than to have fancy special effects.

","With an IMDB rating of 8.8 and rave reviews, if you don't like it, then I guess you just don't understand the beautiful complexity of this film.  Here are a few notes:<br/><br/>1.  This is a multi-layered film, of suppressed romance, Taoist spirituality, martial art choreography, tragedy, and much more. Even the title suggests (in Chinese) that everybody in the film is a kind of ""hidden dragon"".<br/><br/>2.  The story is from a 4 volume (Chinese of course) novel of the early 20th Century.<br/><br/>3.  The music includes the genius of Yo Yo Ma's cello and Coco Lee's singing (she was a Miss Chinese America pagent winner).<br/><br/>4.  It may be obvious but needs to be said: CTHD is refreshingly NOT a Hollywood film! There is so much cultural style and depth!<br/><br/>5.  The women AND men are strong and full of 'eye appeal', and both excel in the fight scenes as well as exhibiting genuine emotions. A marvel of brilliant marketing!<br/><br/>6.  The ENDING, which seems to confuse many viewers, must be interpreted at a symbolic, spiritual, and perhaps mythological level. If you only see it on a superficial level, then you will only get the unsatisfying superficial meaning.<br/><br/>7.  The SCENERY includes the Gobi Desert, Yellow Mountain, and a bamboo forest.  Breath-taking!<br/><br/>8.  The script, story, costumes, acting, cinematography, editing: all 10 out of 10.  It is rare to see all of this superbly done in one film.<br/><br/>A MASTERPIECE THAT SETS NEW STANDARDS IN FILM-MAKING."

","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long) is simply one of the best films ever made.  The movie lives and breathes power, charm, and imagination.  The movie is like a dream mixed with amazing cinematography and beautiful music.  The movie shows happiness and despair.  It's like a movie that is so unique with amazing actors and beautifully choreographed fight scenes.  <br/><br/>Chow Yung-Fat is inspector Li Mu Bai who decides to give up his amazing sword (the green destiny) and live the rest of his life peacefully.  Li Mu Bai has been in love with Michele Yeoh's character Yu Shu Lien ever since Yu Shu Lien's husband died.  The twist in this love story is that Li Mu Bai's brother was Yu Shu Lien's husband.  Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien have prevented themselves from falling in love in memory of Li Mu Bai's brother. <br/><br/>
Then one night Li Mu Bai's green destiny is stolen.  Yu Shu Lien fights with the robber but he escapes.  Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) is a confused daughter of the governor of Beijing.  In disguise Jen Yu is really the thief who stole the green destiny.  Jen Yu also has a secret love that she has kept from her family and her evil trainer Jade Fox.  Jade Fox is also enemies with Li Mu Bai.  To make things even more confusing Jen Yu and Yu Shu Lien have just become good friends when Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien travel to Beijing.  All these conflicts meet to show love, action, and a beautiful story. <br/><br/>
The Movie itself also puts females in roles normally played by men.  Yu Shu Lien and Jen Yu are two amazing Kung Fu fighters who defeat all their male foes and battle in an amazing Kung Fu scene that will be remembered in movies for all time.  The movies amazing director Ang Lee and amazing crew pull this story together to make it an amazing tale.  Without all the amazing acting the story could have only been another Kung Fu movie.  The movie was nominated for many Oscars and won the second most awards out of any film nominated.  This is an amazing feet considering the movie is a foreign film in mandarin Chinese.  <br/><br/>If you could only watch 5 movies in your lifetime I would definetly recommend this one.  It has opened my eyes into Kung Fu movies and has made me enjoy foreign films.  Jen Yu was probably my favorite character and I hope to see her in more movies.  What an achievement!<br/><br/>10/10!"

This film made my two teenage daughters want to know more about China, which shows how engaging it is. Lee gets marvelous help from a very talented cast, leaves out all the unpleasant aspects of pre-Sun Yat Sen China (poverty, footbinding, opium, brutal Manchu overlords, etc.) and creates a visual feast.

It simply is a great movie with kung fu in it. You know...like Road House?! Ha ha. J/K<br/><br/>I thought the idea of being able to fly =ing your emotions or control of your emotions or the purity of your soul was a great idea. Chow Yung was a master of his sprituality and was able to fly to heaven in the end. The girl Ziu Zang wasn't necessarily Evil (or NE for you D&D peeps), she was simply free-spirited. As for Jade, she couldn't fly so on and so on.<br/><br/>The only part I hated and could have been done better was when Jade fired off all those darts and he sliced them all up. It reminded me of the part in Robin Hood: Men in Tights, when the guy with the dagger diced up the arrows and I started laughing to myself.<br/><br/>I thought this movie should have gotten Best Film and Ridley Scott getting Best Director at the Oscers.

To me, this is one of the most over-rated movies of all time.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are pretty well done, I suppose.  But there's that little thing about the ""law of gravity"" that I just couldn't get over.  At times, gravity was bent more than in The Matrix (which at least explains that they are indeed bending/breaking the law of gravity).  Running up walls, or flying with their legs kicking like they are somehow propelling themselves with their legs just bugged me.  If you disregard other things that are real about life, then you can make lots of other things cinematically pretty and fluid too.  But its just not believable.<br/><br/>I found the plot pretty boring too.  I didn't find anything ""great"" about this movie at all.

I think you can see other comments to know how great this movie is, so I just want to comment on something that can make it better, at least I think...<br/><br/>I am a big fan of chinses kung-fu fictions (or wuxia novels). The kung-fu world in wuxia novels are fantasy that I grew up with. People in this fictional world can leap hundred feet effortlessly, if they have a good ""Light-Kung"" (one kind of kung-fu that you can channel your internal strength, or ""chi"", to your feet and make you jump much higher than common people). Most critics call it ""gravity-defying ability"". Anyway, light-kung is something that you have to take it for granted when you read a wuxia novel. However, people don't just fly. You gotta bounce on something. Worrior with high-level light-kung can even bounce on a twig or water. When Jen leap over water for hundred feet, I took it for granted. But when Chou Yun-Fat raised his right hand and did a superman style flying in the bamboo forest and other scene, me and my friend both yelled ""that's impossible"". I guess most die-hard wuxia novel fans will feel the same because there is no kung-fu that can make people fly. It's a rule, period.<br/><br/>Chou Yun-Fat did several ""fly"" in this movie and it looks so ""made-up"". But I guess I'm too hard on him. I just saw a review from Ebert. He asked Ang Lee if computer trickery was used and the actors were not really 40 feet in the air holding onto the bamboo tree. The truth is that Chou Yun-Fat was really hung in the air, with his wife 40 feet down on the ground crossing her fingers. For that, I have to say he did a really good job."

It's the same thing with a better budget, better cast, and of course...better computer graphics. Movies like these and the Matrix (horrible acting, horrible movie/choreography) are not impressive, they are not real, and do not contain actors, who are actually dedicated professionals skilled in their martial arts.<br/><br/>What they do contain is, few weeks of training, and some ropes.  Therefore anyone who is exceptionally fit, can perform these ""martial arts"". Hence The true form is lost.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, had a sentimental story line, basically what all movies of this type of genre have failed in.  In terms of Martial Arts...CRITICS PLEASE WAKE UP....movies like these have been made well in the 80's..they just werent showed in the WEST..<br/><br/>Therefore I DISCOURAGE, any and every MARTIAL ARTS fan from this movie.  As this movie does not contain any true form of realism, but 2 weeks of training MAX, and good use of ROPES.<br/><br/>Honestly from a point of an avid martial arts fan, this movie is horrible, and should stay as a romantic film, not as a martial arts/action film.  All I learned was how ignorant the western media is, and they better get a clue to these movies, before they start commenting.<br/><br/>In essence, movies like these are only imitations that just look pretty in front of the Western Media.  Yes, it is probably entertaining, but certainly is not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>SKILL, and amazing choreography are found in movies such as: Fist Of Legend, and Kiss of The DRAGON.  Both these movies contains international martial arts champions (i.e JET LI), amazing choreography, acting, and decent/creative plots.<br/><br/>When you watch movies like these, among many Bruce Lee movies, you will understand what real martial arts ""FILMS"" are about (not real life).<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!"

","This could have been one the best films of all time, but Ang Lee didn't know what kind of film he wanted to make. Is it an epic, a fantasy, or an action film? The result is a film with a great story, that gets bogged down with an overabundance of fight scenes that are completely too long and unbelievable. I was told by friends that the effects used to create the movement of the characters was revolutionary. Upon viewing, I felt I was watching an oriental version of Peter Pan. It looked as if they were riding invisible stationary bicycles. Their legs would move furiously, yet they would not be touching a wall, and they would climb to the roof of the buildings. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the cinematography.<br/><br/>      Cut down on the overindulgent fight scenes and the hokey motion effects, and this would have been a film that Kurosawa would have made, if he were alive today. Thus, for the base story and the cinematography, I could only give this movie a 5/10."
"beingstevebuscemi","8","0","0","24 December 2000"," Regarding reservations about the ending (spoiler warning)
","I understand where a lot of people would have reservations, if not disappointments, with the ending.  But I feel the open ended ending Europeans and other non-Americans are not so opposed to versus the wrapped up in a bow Hollywood ending Americans are force fed should elicit contemplation not complaints that it didn't have a perfect ending.<br/><br/>Coming up with that universally satisfying ending is very difficult because one must consider a common denominator the biggest cross-section of people will respond to.  Given that there are few truly satisfying endings that one doesn't have to think about because it is so obvious, I think the ending to CTHD was designed for one to meditate on versus one just to merely accept.<br/><br/>
Everyone's take on what the ending meant for the main character (in my opinion Jen is the main character) can mean different things depending on where you are in life and how you'd identify with her situation.  You have to fill in the blanks and what those blanks are to you is how you perceive the meaning of the movie at the time of viewing.<br/><br/>IMHO... what the ending meant for me was Jen, feeling great sorrow over causing such chaos in other people's lives because of her ""selfish"" desire to live life on her own terms simply wanted to be transported back to a time before she caused all this chaos with possibly an insight to the consequences of her behavior so she can avoid the same mistakes on the second go round.  She makes a genuine gesture to make everything like it was before by taking a leap of faith.  Like I said, my little, humble interpretation.  It makes perfect sense to me and rounded off the movie just fine.  But that might not be it at all.  I might have it all wrong.  But that's OK... that is the beauty of an open-ended ending.  No one is right or wrong.  It is whatever makes the movie complete for you."
"mucronate","8","0","0","22 December 2001"," Hidden between the fighting
","Let me begin by stating that I take almost childish delight in watching martial arts movies. I love the acrobatic movements and perfectly synched fighting while the story is often just a vague framework linking the eyecandy fights.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as it refers to the hiding of yourself to someone else, is much more than just another Hong Kong martial arts movie. Quite the opposite to why one is used to watch Hong Kong movies, the fighting scenes are more like interludes between the different parts and acting out of the story, rather than being its main purpose.<br/><br/>
This movie was not quite what I expected, it came out way ahead of that. The twin story of love makes up the main plot, circled by the subplot of a stolen sword. However, anyone who plan to see this movie for its fighting scenes will perhaps get a bit disappointed since it make up only a tiny fraction of the total time. (But do not fear, the quality and choreography when it happens makes it well worth waiting for! It is breathtaking!).<br/><br/>Perhaps it should not even count as a Hong Kong movie at all? Many scenes rely on subtle glances and facial movements, making the movie slow and perhaps unbearably boring to anyone who expects action and fighting throughout, but nevertheless is most important to the story and the ""crouching and hiding"" of the characters to each other.<br/><br/>My advice is instead to concentrate on the main story and how it comes to a full circle in the end as what was hidden finally is brought to light. The story is beautiful but not always obvious. Watch for what is hidden and crouching, what happens when it is brought into clear vision, and the ache of understanding why it had to be.<br/><br/>I loved it, not for being a Hong Kong movie, but for not being it.<br/><br/>See it. Just see it."

","Director Ang Lee said that this is not a realistic movie and that the china depicted in it is one that only existed in his dreams. Realism (which is overrated) is out the window however believability (which cannot be overvalued) is not. There is breathtaking action that will probably sell a lot tickets but what makes the movie interesting are the interpersonal relationships and the human drama. There are simply too many plot points to go over here but there is a recurring theme dealing with how honor and revenge cause needless suffering. Where as most films are similar to novels this one is more like a poem with feeling and mood being more important than cohesion. Unless you hate subtitles this movie is for you."

"divaclv","Null","0","0","15 November 2001"," A simple story, beautifully told
","The world presented in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a world of fairytale.  It's inhabited by larger-than-life characters--legendary heros and cunning villians, spirited aristocrats and noble theives--who are governed by broad, big-ticket emotions like Love and Honor.  Their story is painted in sharp, abstract lines that don't leave much room for subtlety. But this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Rather, this artsy martial-arts film directed by Ang Lee is like an abstract sculpture, beautiful in its simplicity.  Lee called his film ""a dream of China,"" and a lovely dream it is, set against rich palaces, imposing mountains, and stunningly verdant forests.<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh carry themselves with great dignity as a pair of seasoned warriors trained in Wudan--the discipline that apparently enables the effortless leaps and weightless flight which is the film's trademark. (The gimmick is not a new one in the Asian cinema, but it is well-used here)  Zhang Ziyi has the most standout performance as the young noblewoman who feels confined by her assigned role in life.  Sweetly demure one moment, fierce and vibrant the next, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is really about her journey to find the true desires of her heart.<br/><br/>For all it's artistic merit, ""Crouching Tiger"" is still a martial arts film, and as such the fights take center stage.  These are choreographed and filmed with expert skill, and the resulting product seems at times less of an action sequence and more of a passionate dance, or a surreal acrobatic display such as might be viewed in Cirque du Soleil.<br/><br/>The Acadamy-Award winning score is a perfect compliment to the film.  It adds the perfect touches at all the right moments, and like the movie ends up being both exhillarating and tender."

CTHD is the most satisfying movie I have seen in years (supplanting the Matrix). 	A common complaint about most asian martial art flicks is that in spite of the excellent fight scenes the plot and production values tend to suffer.<br/><br/>	So I came to this movie for its state of the art fight scenes, and was absolutely blown away. But wait, there is a story here and boy, it is well told! Action, romance, intrigue, betrayal, redemption, fantasy, and even effective comic relief! It's got it all folks! 	In his other films Ang Lee has shown great mastery of balance and tone. And here he has created a whole new bag. 	The fantastical flying elements do not detract, nor overwhelm the story. Everything fits. Even the flashback segment, usually the death rattle of many a poorly concieved plot introduces a romantic thread which elevates an already passionate tale to unexpected richness, it is gorgeously funny and sexy! Very sexy! 	The fight scene on the bamboo tops is at once thrilling and sensuous. Much of the action in the hand to hand department involves the female characters, and these are among the best shot martial art scenes on film. Chow Yun Fat is so cool. 	The dialog is in chinese with subtitles, but don't let that keep you away. The plot develops at a pace akin to a flowing stream, rolling with eddies over stones but always moving, always refreshing itself. 	This is a movie of excellent quality and beauty, and it is a great date movie!"
"dkhoo","10","0","0","16 October 2001"," Wonderful film!
","Spoiler alert! Plot details revealed ahead!<br/><br/>I thought that this film was absolutely wonderful on many levels. Aside from the obvious ""WOW"" factor from the brilliantly choreographed martial arts sequences, the plot is also rich and engaging.<br/><br/>This is ultimately a movie about the human struggle against destiny. The lead character Jen is a noble daughter whom the standards of the day would have condemned to a banal life as a subservient wife to a pudgy aristocrat in a politically arranged marriage. She tastes freedom when she is secretly trained in the martial arts by the dangerous fugitive Jade Fox and is captured by (or perhaps escapes into the arms of) the desert bandit Lo. When the ancient Green Destiny sword is shown to her, she takes her chance to at last break her shackles by stealing the sword and fighting friend or foe who would take her freedom from her again. She turns away the man that she loves, the mentor who trained her, the hero who would redeem her, and takes on the whole world in her struggle to be free. However, in the end, only after her actions bring about tragedy does she realize that even more important than her freedom is her responsibility to those who really care for her. Brilliant!<br/><br/>The other main characters also struggle in their own ways. The hero Li Mu Bai and the heroine Yu Shu Lien love each other deeply, but cannot express their love for each other because of an old taboo. Their agonized awkwardness in each other's presence, which eventually dissolves into tenderness when Li is close to death, is acting at its best. This is not Hollywood romance, but something far deeper. Li is also haunted by the blood he has shed in the name of duty and wants to give up his sword and be at peace, while Yu also wants to place warfare behind her and lead a simpler life (Li's giving up the Green Destiny sword sets the movie's events in motion), but this is eventually denied both of them.<br/><br/>The film is also full of clever moments and beautiful visuals. The cinematography is elegant, unobtrusive and simply wonderful. On a technical level, the film is nearly perfect. There is very little I can find fault with.<br/><br/>However, the movie suffers from several weaknesses, none the fault of Ang Lee of any of the actors. Since it is a movie in the ""Wu Shu"" genre, it requires a decent grounding in Chinese culture to interpret correctly, particularly the concept of ""Jiang Hu"" and Confucian social organization. Most Western viewers don't realize that in this genre, people walking on walls or flying through the air is completely mundane (in fact, most Wu Shu movies are far, far more outrageous: aerial kung-fu sex, anyone?), while a noblewoman having the audacity to fall in love with a barbarian and to practice anything more strenuous than calligraphy, let alone martial arts, is what is unbelievable. This is a movie which looks completely different through Eastern and Western eyes.<br/><br/>Also, the movie suffers from a language problem. It is in Mandarin, which Chow Yun Fat, and I think Michelle Yeoh, don't speak (they're Cantonese). Their pronunciation and line delivery sometimes sound a bit wonky as a result of their having to learn a new language. However, I don't think this movie would have been quite the same in Cantonese, which is ""sharper"" and less lyrical than Mandarin.<br/><br/>In summary, I think this movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. It has everything, if one only has the eyes to see it. I recommend everyone, especially Wu Shu movie lovers, go watch it if they haven't already. 10/10"

At least  I have never seen anything like that before.<br/><br/>However, one thing without which no movie can even be regarded a good movie, the ability to move audience's heart is COMPLETELY missing. The plot is non-existent, which is contrary to any other movie that is regarded as an epic. <br/><br/>The goal that hero of the movie is fighting for is so pathetically trivial that it means nothing to me whether he succeeds or not. He is NOT fighting for love, for romance, for country, for honor, for family, for good(against evil), but instead he is pursuing a spoiled teenage girl who has come into possession of a ""book of martial arts secrets"", and  has shown some talent. He is willing to give up his life and his heroine's life so this retarded girl will accept his as his teacher.<br/><br/>As I said above, this movie has characters that do not have any higher purpose. An emotionally unstable girl is hardly a worthy cause for a man of hero's capabilities to be wasted.<br/><br/>Ang Lee wasted an opportunity to create one of the greatest Romantic epics. He could have exploited the opportunity for creating a romantic triangle between the two leading women and the hero. Instead he focused solely on the cinematography and martial arts choreography (and did a tremendous job) and created a movie without any objective or purpose. Two many noble characters wasted for NO cause at all. The battle in this movie is not between ""Good and Evil"", but between ""Obsessive (hero) vs retarded (heroine)"" (who have NO feeling for each other what so ever)."

","The Best: all the most amazing fights (despite Matrix-like) but these were so good that the Matrix ones are bad when compared to these. And visually the movie results as eye candy, that was very well edited and the action musics were good, but the best was the cinematography, and Ang Lee succeded in transporting us to a China that everyone would be delighted to live in. The Worst:  despite of being passed in some kind of Fairy Tale (AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!), when they were flying you could really tell they were attached to wires, even though you couldn't actually see them, even by the positions they flied. The love story background was supposed to be short but actually it occupied 70% of the film. 4/10<br/><br/>I think that in this film I won't even loose my time describing the plot (call me an idiot schmuck but halfway in the movie I was just thinking of the battle scenes nothing more). Kudos to Ang Lee once more by his job, and to Michele Yeoh. Chow Yun-Fat, I don't like him.

"rypeter","7","0","0","3 September 2001"," Entertaining, but what was the big deal?...
","First, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the film overall, and if I seem somewhat critical, it is because I've seen so many people rave on and on, and I just don't get all the hoopla.  My biggest problem is likely the lack of explanation.  I realize this is a martial-arts ""fantasy,"" but in most films, there is at least some attempt to explain the setting and, if any, differences from reality.  For example, in ""The Matrix,"" we're given an early glimpse of the powers of the freedom-fighters, and eventually we discover that they are bending and breaking rules in ways that seem fantastic, but still make sense as they are explained in the movie.  In ""Star Wars,"" we are introduced to ""the Force"" and the wondrous abilities it can bestow.  In ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the masters have these amazing abilities (beyond fighting skill, I mean) that are never in anyway justified.  I can take some of this on faith, and simply enjoy the story and effects, but it started to bother me after a while.  For one thing, the commoners (or at least, the non-masters) don't seem to think anything amazing is going on.  ""Oh look, the thief just leapt over that building.  I won't gape in amazement, I'll just continue the chase...""  I could live with the characters having enhanced abilities, this is fantasy after all, but I think major physics-defying capabilities deserve an explanation.  Why can this person push off from a wall, fly across a courtyard, and without touching anything, change direction UPWARDS?  Where do they draw the line? It just seemed a little hokey.  Having said all that, I'll reiterate that once I looked past these things, I was able to enjoy the film for what it is."

","The action in this movie is explosively beautiful. Quite simply, its a violent and magical ballet the likes of which I have never seen before. The script is taught, the acting pitch-perfect, and the cinematography some of the most lush in recent years. 	But, WHATS UP WITH THAT ENDING? It was a real artistic and dramatic letdown. Although the tall-tale nature of the story necessitates the suspension of disbelief early on (somewhere around the first Spiderman impersonation, where one of the fighters runs up a wall), aside from the fight scenes the rest of the movie maintained an element of reality. The creative direction was so masterfull that it transformed potentially ludicrous fight scene where characters leapt like flying monkeys between trees into something of acrobatic beauty and near artistry.<br/><br/>	Sure, my desire for a feel-good American Holywood schlocky ending was somewhat deflated (I'll leave out why for those of you who havent seen it yet). But what I'm most upset about is the very last scene between Jen and Lo--not the dialogue, which is forgivably predictable, but the image of Jen flying off into the world, spinning like some music video image. She looked like a milk bottle, and the ridiculousness of the over-the-top literalism of the fable turning into reality just left me with a lingering bitter taste despite what was ultimately a feast of a movie. 	Does anyone know about Chinese legends/folk history or what the sources for this movie were? Im really perplexed about the decisions in the last quarter, the directions that each of the parallel love stories took. Please let me know if you have any comments: moviebuffgirl2001@hotmail.com"

","This is quite simply one of the most impressive films I've seen in the last several years. I can't find a single flaw with any of it. The story is appealing on a very deep, mythological level, and the performances of all the principal players are touchingly authentic. I was especially impressed with Michelle Yeoh's delicate balancing of feminine and martial characteristics. Each character is fully developed; I can't remember any film that manages to give such rich insight into so many characters without losing focus. The plot is well-paced, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the sets and costumes are a delight to the eye. Of course, the martial arts sequences have received a lot of attention, and they *are* exciting, but with so much more to offer, pegging this movie as just another ""martial arts movie"" doesn't do it justice. It may well turn out to be the crowning achievement of Ang Lee's career."
"youngkj","Null","0","0","31 August 2001"," Comments on ""Accents"" and ""Flying""
","Is Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh speaking mandarin with accent a big flaw of the film? Not really at least in my opinion. It will be great if they can speak standard mandarin, but the acting and emotional quality they bring into this movie have already been invaluable.  There is no perfect option for Director Ang Lee so he has to give and take. In addition, I don't recall that Ang Lee allows his films to be dubbed just because actor/actress do not speak standard language.  The reason is understood: to preserve sound quality and emotions for the characters. Overall I think CTHD has provided the goals at a level only the best Chinese films can achieve. If you want to see the difference, please compare it with some Chinese films from your local video store.<br/><br/>The flying (actually should be called leaping) scenes have attracted many negative comments from western audience.  I think it is unfortunately due to cultural differences.  But whether you like it or not, the leaping stuff has been in Chinese culture for a long time.  People grow up with this fantasy. People know it is not real but they like it and accept its existence in the fantasy wuxia world.  Ang Lee wants to realize it and tries to make it look 'real' on the screen.  Although not perfect, he has done the job much better than all the previous Chinese wuxia or kungfu films. His courage and efforts in making this film should be and has been recognized.<br/><br/>
Based on the creativity and overall performance, I give this film 10 out of 10."

","In my opinion Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was the best film of 2000 and one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>CTHD was  beautiful mix of romance, drama, action and adventure. Some say that the movie is unoriginal, i can not vouch for that since i have seen no other movies similar in any way. If i had to clasify this movie into a genre, i would say it is a romance/action. This may seem odd, but if you have seen the movie, and taken time to understand it, this statement would make perfect sense. My reason for saying this is because though they did recieve an abundant amount of praise, the fight scenes are not the main point of the movie. The practically unatainable love between two warriors is. That being said it is understandable why some people expecting a great action movie were dissapointed.<br/><br/>Another complaint i often hear is that that  plot is lacking depth. I would have to argue this, since in my opinion the movie had a wonderful plot, though i admit it may not be completely fresh, i have never seen it done in such a way. The fight scenes were breathtaking. They were importent to points of the plot, just did not deserve to be noted as the main focus.<br/><br/>In general, i would say any open minded person with no strong expectations would be able to completely enjoy this film. Some say that the story moves too slow, i would again have to argue with this, but i dont imagine a child having much fun sitting through this movie for anything more than the fight scenes. a great film, and i would rate it a 9.5-10/10"

","2000 really wasn't a great year in movies, but if we are to remember anything about it, it should be that one film united the world.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has instantly become the most successful foreign film of all time.  Although it definitely isn't the greatest foreign film of all time, it is, perhaps, the best martial arts film ever made.<br/><br/>It is being called the Star Wars of Taiwan, but I think that's a bit misleading.  Star Wars was popular because it took place in an entirely different world where the rules were broken.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon also takes place in a fantasy world, but it is more realistic.  Sure, some people can fly around, but the characters aren't yelling catch phrases and comic relief in the heat of the battle, such as in Star Wars.  This is a more serious film, but it is a rewarding one.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are absolutely breathtaking.  Just compare them to Gladiator's choppy, overrated battles.  In Crouching Tiger, it is made very clear what the battlefield looks like, where the characters are in it, and what they are doing.  In Gladiator, there really isn't any way of telling what's going on, we just see a few strange shots, like a tiger's leg, then a sword, etc.  Crouching Tiger's, battles are beautifully choreographed and graceful, and that's why they can stand the test of time better than Star Wars or Gladiator.<br/><br/>It's about time the martial arts genre finally cooked up a rewarding and compelling experience, one that makes you think and look in awe.  It's a unique experience and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to look at subtitles to see a superb film.<br/><br/>O  O  O  O  O  O  O  O 1/2"
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","10 August 2001"," dazzling but imperfect film
","Ang Lee's martial arts drama `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' earned its niche in movie history as the first foreign language film ever to gross over $100 million dollars at the U.S./Canadian box office.  It is, of course, a film of other distinctions as well.<br/><br/>The factor that sets this film apart from all previous martial arts films is, principally, the fight scenes themselves, which involve the characters defying the laws of gravity by floating in the air, walking along walls and even conducting a sword fight high above the tree tops of a windswept forest.  These sequences, which achieve a sort of heightened surrealism, are indeed breathtaking to behold in their originality, boldness and technical perfection.  They provide the unforgettable imagery that very few films these days seem able to achieve, giving the audience the all too rare sense that it is seeing something wholly new and visionary. <br/><br/>Based on a novel by Du Lu Wang,  `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' tells a quite fascinating story of a stolen sword and the attempts of two warriors, one a man, the other a woman, to retrieve it.  Like most movies set in an Asian past, Lee's film conveys a tone of quiet contemplation, even when great issues of war and peace, life and death, duty and honor are being fought over and discussed.  There is a lyrical, poetic beauty to much of this film, even  or, perhaps I should say, especially  in the non-martial arts sequences.  As the two warriors, Chow Yun Fat, a fighter grown weary of his past and yearning for the quiet rewards of peace, and Michelle Yeoh, a woman unique to her profession yet feeling deeply her unrequited love for the man she follows, bring a sturdy maturity to their complex roles.  They provide the human warmth that, in the first section of the film, in particular, keeps the work rooted in reality.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is a scene about an hour into the movie, when a young aristocratic woman, destined to be married but yearning for the liberation that would come with being a warrior, has a long romantic flashback, chronicling her strange affair with a handsome young barbarian.  Although the scene ends up being crucial to the understanding of the rest of the film, it really isn't on an intellectual par with the main story of the film, coming across instead as something of an embarrassing bodice-ripper in tone and style.  Although the film does return to its main plotline eventually, it never completely recovers from the detour it has taken.  As with most movies with a midpoint sag, the audience is never really able to completely tune back in.  What a pity  for `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' clearly has the elements to make a truly great film (and, judging from the reaction of many critics and writers on this site, a large number of people feel it is).  Luckily, after the flashback, the film manages to get back on track, as we witness the complex interplay between the unthinking arrogance that comes with youth and the restraining wisdom that comes with age.  This is the most powerful theme that runs through this visually gorgeous film.<br/><br/>Thus, despite its minor imperfections, any lover of cinema would be well advised to see `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' for the many wonders it contains."

","When a film immerses us in its surroundings and makes us feel as we have traveled to an exotic locale and been amongst its inhabitants, it succeeds in delivering quite a satisfying movie-going experience. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, however, transcends the move-going experience and is something more of an experience in itself.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a deft mixture of Shakespearean drama and stunning swordplay: set in ancient China, Yun-Fat Chow stars as a former disciple of a powerful Wudan master, Wudan being a form of martial arts mythic and magical in its proportions. When he decides to retire the Green Destiny, a sword of unstoppable strength, and settle down with lifetime love Michelle Yeoh, someone steals the sword. At the same time, there's a love affair going on between a soon-to-be-wed-through-arrangement bride Ziyi Zhanga and her unaccepted true love.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger has some of the most show-stopping, stunning, and most fluidly photographed and choreographed fight sequences ever captured on film. Though often violent, the fights are something to behold and will surely have you in awe of their beauty, as actors gracefully fly through the air, run swiftly and effortlessly on rooftops, stand on flimsy, dangling tree limbs, and engage in cunning, kinetic swordfights. It's especially interesting that the most intense battles take place between women,<br/><br/>Aside from the jaw-dropping action, Crouching Tiger also denies all Hollywood conventions: the villain in the film is a woman as well, and she is deadlier and exerts more control over her male counterparts. The action also centers around women, and they are no atypical movie creations: they are strong, stalwart, and equally if not more foreboding and intimidating than the male characters in the film. It's a fresh, thoroughly novel approach, especially in a film packed with so much force and action that a testosterone-fueled story is expected.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is also surprisingly a lovingly crafted romance film with an underlying theme of breaking away from traditions: all the character want to break free of the mundane rituals they've had to follow all their lives or will have to follow. Chow Yun Fat tires of his seemingly endless thwarting of evil and years to live a peaceful life with Yeoh. Zhanga also wishes to break free of her arranged ties with her soon-to-be husband and live with her outlaw boyfriend. While the latter story may sound cliched, it's handled with such humor and warmth, it hardly seems anything but genuine thanks to the two younger actors.<br/><br/>In Crouching Tiger, director Ang Lee has effectively meshed two genres that have been meshed tritely, messy, and unbelievably before by Hollywood hacks and has come up with a visionary tale of swordplay and romance. This film is not only entertaining and a landmark in the martial arts genre, it also almost makes up slew of disappointing films this year. With awe-inspiring action and a moving love story, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is easily one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

While Shu Lien still thinks there is virtue in such discipline, Mu Bai has become disillusioned.  He has outdone his masters and achieved a meditative state of complete radiance, but for him it was unfulling and painful.  Because of the impersonal nature of Nirvana, Shu Lien could never be there with him as an individual.  Since they are deeply in love, yet chaste, Mu Bai has realized that no fulfillment exists for him apart from Shu Lien.  That is, author Du Lu Wang has rejected the classical Chinese program of salvation through mental discipline in favor of the Western ideal of romantic love.<br/><br/>Lu Wang also rejects the Confucian ideal of submission to social order. Sha-Long is approvingly portrayed abandoning her husband from the marriage arranged for her by her aristorcratic parents.  Again, the Western ideal of romantic love is given to us as superior to classical Chinese values.  The willful Sha-Long is allowed to experience the freedom of unfettered romantic love in a desert sequence with the equally independent Sha-Hu.  This sequence is essential to the storyline.  It shows the kind of freedom which Lu Wang takes to be the `right kind' of freedom, as opposed to the mean, totally self-centered freedom exemplified by Jade Fox.<br/><br/>The problem, of course, is that romantic love does not provide the meaning of life any more than does meditation or scrupulous observation of social rules.  We need only look at the Western experience, steeped as it is in willful romanticism, to notice the shortcomings of romantic love as a religion.  In the closing scene, Sha-Hu is grieved.  He knows that Sha-Long's leap from the bridge is impossible.  It will not close the gap between them, nor bring them to a realm of romantic freedom.  Sha-Long's leap is about herself, not them.  It cannot be otherwise within a Western humanism centered on personal fulfillment.  It's success depends on the unreality of those portions of the human heart that perpetually foil the human quest for meaning.  There is no non-theistic answer to the question of the meaning of life.<br/><br/>That said, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a great film.  The music is great.  Yo Yo Ma is great.  The cinematography is great.  The sense of yearning and unfulfillment in the film's characters is portrayed with gracious understatement.  Their passion is expressed with poetry in the dreamlike, yet personal, martial arts sequences.  Only in the segments exhalting romantic love are sex scenes necessary or even relevant.<br/><br/>
`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a beautiful reductio-ad-absurdum of its own ambition."

","It's hard to imagine magical kung-fu fighters who run up buildings, fly across rooftops, and skip across lakes as being the ideal characters for a romance movie. Perhaps that is what makes this movie so absolutely stunning - it is both a delight both because of the visually amazing fight scenes and engaging story line. It's got something for everyone. Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi deliver top-quality performances as the mystical fighters whose major concerns are the state of their personal lives. These are not the stale, undeveloped action characters one might be used to in other martial arts films. And although the plot may be confusing in some parts (there are quite a few hard-to-follow twists and turns) the viewer never gets lost and is never bored. The movie somehow reaches that perfect balance where the action stays constant enough where the movie never lulls, yet finds a way to fully investigate and explain the characters in between. Much has to be said for the movie's setting and special effects. The storyline is set in ancient times, against a beautifully captured oriental landscape - the lush forests and misty mountains that the warriors leap and fly through effectively transport the viewer back to the mystical ancient. And the fight scenes, coreographed by ""Matrix"" guru Yuen Wo-Ping, are slick, fast-paced, and imaginative - yet very subtle. Never does the movie go overboard and never do the battles get tiring. They are expertly woven into the plot. In conclusion, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a rare film. It reaches the precise point where all the crucial elements of drama, romance, action, and martial arts meet - and manages to stay on target for the full run of the film."
"FlickJunkie","7","0","0","1 August 2001"," Fighting interspersed with an actual plot line!
","An epic in every sense of the word, this film combines some of the coolest fight sequences ever put to the big screen with majestic cinematography and an all-encompassing tale of love, honor and fantasy. And by fantasy, I mean people literally flying across rooftops and fighting against one another while standing on skinny tree branches. That's right, you can pretty much forget about the concept of gravity in this movie! People fly while running, walk across water and run up walls in this film. Real cool stuff if you get ""into it"", but definitely unbelievable if you're, well, not ""into it"". Which brings me to the actual story of the film. A hundred times better than most Hong Kong martial arts flicks, I can't say that I was mesmerized by this sorted tale. In fact, I thought some of the scenes were a little boring, especially the middle ones in the desert, which went on too long. I also didn't really get emotionally attached to any of the characters, or feel much for them by the end of the film. The story wasn't a bad one, it's just that some of the plot points nagged at me somewhat. Here are these great warriors searching for the evil Jade Fox, and even though she's the governess of the girl they're quite familiar with, they don't recognize her? And what about their relationship to the girl? Every time they see her, they either fight or embrace her. A little too ambiguous for my taste. But maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>I did however enjoy the overall story which effectively combined dramatic elements with humor, action and even a touch of romance. For me, the best parts of the movie were obviously the battle scenes, which just blew my friggin' eyes away! In fact, I suspect that most people who see this movie will love it just for the battle scenes alone since pretty much everything else is so-so. People will also find themselves staring at the screen and wondering how the hell they managed to put together all of those cool moves. But again, if wire-fu stunts don't do it for you, and fast-motion fight scenes ain't your cup of tea, don't go into this movie expecting ""Gone with the Wind"". It's a wonderfully photographed picture, with beautiful details in the settings, its authenticity and the obvious language spoken (the film is in Mandarin with English subtitles), but its wonder resonates most with its fight sequences, and if that sort of thing doesn't impress you, this film likely isn't for you. And for once, all of the actual fight scenes were filmed flawlessly. Really believable. For me, those were the elements which worked best in this film. Awesome, awesome battles, beautifully shot and an okay story.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","I saw this film based on much of the hype is received. Had it not received all of the Oscar nominations and critical acclaim, I probably would have liked this movie better. However, I saw this movie after all hearing all of the acclaim, and I believe it is a wonderful film, however slightly overrated.<br/><br/>The camera work, the locations, and the choreography are all outstanding. While many folks will say the fighting scenes are ""Matrix"" rip-offs, I disagree. It's important for viewers to realize that in addition to being a romance and a martial arts film, it is also a FANTASY. So when some characters obviously received prior special training to allow them to fly, just accept it.<br/><br/>Where the movie fell flat was the storyline (yes there was one), and even Michelle Yeoh's outstanding acting job as Shu Lien could not carry it. The remaining characters were pretty shallow -- especially Jen (Ziyi Zhang), a self-absorbed brat.  Chow Yun-Fat's character, Li Mu Bai, is rather cliche as a warrior shunning retirement for one more mission, to avenge his master's murder.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone, clearly. You have to enjoy martial arts movies to like this one at all. Don't expect an emotional romance or a real moral to the story.<br/><br/>I'd give the movie an 8 out of 10."
"Eli-57","Null","0","0","28 December 2000"," Magnificent...Pioneering a new genre
","Ang Lee's brilliant film ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is quite unlike anything I've ever seen.  It's being called a martial arts film by many people, but it's not, really.  In most martial arts movies (and indeed all action movies), the plot is generally just a way to produce fight scenes, car chases, explosions, whatever.  ""Crouching Tiger"" is just the opposite; in this movie drama comes first, and the action is simply a logical extension of that drama.  This is an intelligent, moving drama that is filled with thrilling and spectacular action.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Tiger"" is impeccable.  Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh headline the cast, and both turn in excellent performances.  Chow Yun Fat is particularly good at conveying complex emotions without saying very much at all.  The best performance in the movie, I think, is from Zhang Ziyi, who plays Jen Yu, the most prominent character (even though Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh get higher billing).<br/><br/>It's hard to evaluate the writing of the movie after it's been translated from Chinese to English.  As one would expect, it seems that the script lost a little something in the translation, and subtitles never work as well as spoken dialogue.  The movie is not dialogue-heavy to begin with, though, and all in all it doesn't suffer much in the translation.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most incredible element of ""Crouching Tiger"" is the cinematography and visual effects.  Ang Lee, the director, has a prodigious talent for capturing the inherent beauty of a landscape, be it barren desert or bamboo forest.  The fight sequences are flawless: impeccable choreography and brilliant camera work combine for some of the best action footage ever. The choreographer also did ""The Matrix,"" but his work on ""Tiger"" trumps even that paragon of martial artistry; there is a genuine beauty to the fights in this movie, while ""The Matrix,"" is still just another action flick.<br/><br/>One part in particular of the fight scenes has particular resonance, and that is that the lead characters can, for lack of a better word, fly.  The flight is done in such a way -- it seems rather like an exceptionally long running stride more than it does a swooping bird -- that after a few moments, the audience believes in it as much as they do in air or water.<br/><br/>All the action sequences are quite marvelous in every respect, they are captivating and wonderful to look at.  Rather than the pounding crescendo of violence seen in American action movies, ""Crouching Tiger"" makes the fights seem more like a work of fine art.<br/><br/>The cinematography remains excellent throughout, not just in the fight sequences.  A wide variety of landscapes were used, and Ang Lee uses each one to great advantage.  Everything in this film just looks _beautiful_.  I don't know how else to put it, but I think if you see it you'll understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Another element that makes ""Crouching Tiger"" unique is that it does not take place in any particular time period.  It can be placed around the early eighteenth century, but only when one specifically considers the setting. While watching the movie, no time period is set and none is needed.  Indeed, the lack of a fixed time aids the aura of mysticism and magic that pervades the film.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is a one-of-a-kind film experience and easily one of the best movies of the year."

","Spoilers ahead not attended for people who haven't seen this movie yet......................................................................<br/><br/>Ang Lee did great good directing this film and the costumes were fabulous. Unfortuanately, the storyline was clumsy and it drags us slowly throughout the story and leaves nothing to take with us. So simple points.<br/><br/>1) Flying in this movie is laughable, but acceptable. The landing of the flying however is a unacceptable. The Flying style is like that of the Matrix but the difference is when the people land they take seconds to recover even the agents. Crouching Tiger on the other hand offers no explaination for the flying ability and when they land they aready are running except when the girl flys through wall and tumbles to defense position (direct ripp-off of the Matrix) which  is remarkable consireding that she is suppose to be this great warrior: where is the control. 2)  Sitting through a third of the movie we get a sense of everything going on until someone out of thin air breaks into the girl's room and then we spend half of the movie watching a flashback of how they meet. You forget so many things from the beginning that by the time they come out of the flashback you can't remember where the plot is heading. 3)  The Girl is starts off the movie being selfish and is a dislikeable character and as the movie progresses she is suppose to learn about companionship and how greed only tears us apart. That self-centered whore even in the end she leaves her sister empty. The same sister that spared her ignorance throught the movie while she brought the enemy to power with one last deadly stand. No she jumps off the bridge for her boyfriend. I hated her from start to the end. leaving me with more dispear at the end then the beginning.<br/><br/>Finally, what is this smack about this being superior to anything Hollywood has put out in 20 years. You must be talking about Hollywood, Indiana or something. Or everything from now on will be refered to as ""pre-tiger, post Dragon"", that's funny last time I checked everybody was taking their movies to Industral Light and Magic so they can look like The Phantom Menace, not to China. Sorry, to be the barer of bad news but try Pre-Menace/Matrix, Post-Menace/Matrix"

With all the hype I expected something better than a real good chop socky film.<br/><br/>    As a huge fan of Jackie Chan, I have long been frustrated with the conventions of the Hong Kong cinema, namely that the script need not make sense, the direction can plod except for action scenes, and the main character must have the same first name as the actor playing him.  Finally here is a script for a Hong Kong film that features interesting characters behaving rationally.  Michelle Yeoh is marvelous, and Chow Yun fat seems much more at ease here than in his English language pictures.<br/><br/>   But--I've seen cheaply make chop socky films where characters seemingly flew, and it looked silly.  Here, they use state of the art effects and . .. it still looks silly.  It's better, but it's still just a wee but over the top.

","As I write this review, ""Crouching Tiger"" is at spot #18. As I look through the whole ""top 250"", I think it belongs somewhere below #150. I own the DVD and it is a very nice one. The sound, the print, all beautiful. But the story is a very ordinary one. After a life of crime-fighting, the master wants to retire and set his sights upon the woman he never had time for before. A new warrior and an old nemesis show up, complicating things. Chases and fights, and a couple of plot twists later and you have this story. It has been told many times, in slightly different ways, in any number of films and books.<br/><br/>What is unique here, is the setting in old China. The fighters reach a non-human plane which allows them to float in the air, or run up walls, and fight among the bamboo tops. Although done differently, it is not substantially removed from the fighting we see in such recent films as ""The Matrix"", ""Charlie's Angels"", or even ""The Mask of Zorro."" Not to say that any of these films are intentionally similar, but upon closer examination really are very similar, both in story elements and in fighting style. So, I give this one a rating of ""8"" of 10. It is one I will enjoy viewing many times, but it is not the ""greatest film ever"" as so many reviewers feel.<br/><br/>This is a movie, and I have no trouble with the ""gravity-defying"" scenes. However, my biggest complaint is that the feet movements are not consistent with the rate of body movement and that makes it look fake. It seems that with all the trouble they went to for the special effects, they could have attended more to this issue.<br/><br/>A word about the languages. The DVD allows a selecting of English dubbing, and I watched it that way the first time. Although it is very well done, the speech pattern is very consistent with the actors' mouth movements, it doesn't sound ""real."" It sounds like ""dubbing done in a studio"", and detracted from the realism. The second time, I watched it in the native language, with English subtitles, and I found it much better that way."

This is the situation here, with Ang's ""Crouching Tiger, hidden Dragon"".<br/><br/>The plot? Childish. Kindergarten morals (same as in Spielberg's films) simplistic emotions and overreacting wannabe heroes.  A rather boring story without any particular value for any intelligent viewer.<br/><br/>The acting? Well, reminded me of the good ole '60's or '50's films - too theatrical, too ""over the edge"" for the refined taste of an audience who has seen something beyond Hollywood blockbusters and bad Hong Kong action films.<br/><br/>The cinematography? Oh, right. Here I couldn't say anything. Simply, perfect. Beautifully filmed, this story wouldn't make for a 1/10 film if it wasn't for the great director.<br/><br/>The effects/fight scenes: Good lord, these are for 12 year olds - and even that's too old! Nothing more to say about those, just one thing: At the first scene (on the rooftops... or above them) I started laughing out loud - actually in a 400 seat theatre, about two dozen people started laughing as well.  Absolutely justified laugh, don't you think so?<br/><br/>The Film in general?  A fairy tale, who begs us to accept it as an art movie - and fails blatantly. Only some ""hype"" and mainstream critics, or some guys who'd love anything coming from the east carrying the label of ""art movie"" are enthusiastic about it. And that shows us that the worst critic to a movie is the one who makes a living out of it - the film just had to be promoted.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't watched it, you better forget it.

Just a collection of typical plots rolled together.  The revenge story, the unspoken love story, the aristocrat's daughter wishing for a different life story, thrown together with some fights.<br/><br/>I had heard all these great things about the fight scenes in this film. Well, yes, some of the movies used are pretty cool, the way they were done became tiresome and actually provided a great laugh.  All the flying around and running up the sides of buildings completely destroyed any realism to the film.  Willing suspension of disbelief and all but when a 200 pound man is standing on the bending branch of a bamboo tree or flying around through the forest it just gets a bit hard to suspend that disbelief.  The wires and fast motion camera don't serve to make the characters look like great fighters, they just demean the film.  The wires became boring after the very first fight and just escalate from there.  Maybe it's because I'm not a big fan of The Matrix style of action, but at least there's a reason given in that movie as to why these people suddenly have the ability to fly and run along the side of buildings.  These scenes also set a bad presidence for the rest of the film making you wonder why they would use horses at all when they can jump so fast and so far.<br/><br/>Sure some of the scenery is nice and the attention to detail (well, except all laws of physics) is pretty good but then what?  I basically waited for this movie to end wishing that it wouldn't push too far past two hours.<br/><br/>
There is nothing to really separate this film from a typical samurai movie. In fact, save your money and rent Lone Wolf and Cub (or something like it), at least then you'll understand that the movie is not to be taken seriously and they don't try to pass themselves off as something they're not."

","A must-miss film, unless you want to waste your time AND money. I went to this movie for one reason - it got an A average by the 10 reviewers in Entertainment Weekly who rate movies. I'm now convinced, having been burned on American Beauty, Traffic and Thin Red Line, that critics LOVE these utterly worthless excuses for entertainment because they are (drum roll) utterly worthless excuses for entertainment (UWEFE). By that I mean, the average critic has seen 10 billion movies. The average excellent movie that entertains most of us (say Castaway or Finding Forrester or Gladiator) is simply some form of rehash that the critic has seen a thousand times. So, when some UWEFE comes out, they love it because it is different. Not good, but from their uppity perspective ""Thank God it is different."" And, they superimpose their relief on the rest of us with some idiotic critique justifying it.<br/><br/>Here is why I nearly hated this movie:<br/><br/>1) The book was highly superior, and I not only didn't read it, but don't even know if one was ever written!<br/><br/>2) All movies have an obligation to lay out the physical rules - if they are different than the known universe - within which they will operate. There was NEVER one single reference made in any way that the players were not human. We were simply led to believe that they were trained by the greatest master(s) in the world. But, I'm here to tell you something. SPOILER ALERT: I don't care if they were trained by JESUS 24/7 for 100 years, they wouldn't be able to fly and walk on water! At least not if they were human. That was so ludicrous that nearly everyone around me was snickering with embarrassment for paying to watch it. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)<br/><br/>3) I HATE SUBTITLES! Now, in fairness, I could have (should have) known going in, but I didn't. The only worthwhile subtitle movie I ever saw as Das Boot many years ago. I am going to a movie to be entertained - not to have to be fearful of looking away for even a second. I do not like to have to go back and forth between the two. Period. It sucks. I hate it. And, I would NEVER do it intentionally. Big negative. (Minus 1.5 points and that's being generous.)<br/><br/>4) Here are the movie names of the players (just skim to save time). Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien, Jiao Long Yu (Jen), Xiao Hu Luo (Lo), Sir Te, Jade Fox, Bo, Madam Yu, Tsai, Auntie Wu, De Lu, Gou Jun Pei, Gou Jun Sinung, Mi Biao, Fung Machete Chang, Monk Jing. Now, here is the problem. We not only have to remember their names coming at us one after another (when we have no points of reference), but we also have to remember just as many ping pong, ying yang, hop sing places. And, believe me, they don't make it easy on us. I don't go to movies to have to spend half my time trying to remember which Moo Goo Guy Pan is trying to carve up what Chow Mein - if you know what I mean. If it was Bob, Ted, Carol and Alice in Philadelphia and Baltimore, hey, I've got the reference points. No need for wasted brain cells. Ironically, one of the lines in the movie was ""Who could remember all these long names."" (Minus 1.5 points.)<br/><br/>5) WAY TOO LONG. IF a movie is good, then 2 hours plus is ok. If it is bad, then it better be 1:40 or less or it gets a time deduction! (Minus 1/2 point.)<br/><br/>Some aspects of acting, cinematography and fighting were good to very good. Some weren't. Some of the fighting scenes were too long and too ridiculous. However, there were enough positives in these areas to outweigh the negatives, so a net wash.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this. I possibly could have given this movie of 7 or 8 if it weren't foreign. Too many problems associated with it - not the least of which was culture. Frankly, beyond all my specific criticisms, I just didn't get it. What the heck is jumping off the cliff all about? And, who the heck cares? And, what on earth does the name Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon have to do with anything? And, who the heck cares?<br/><br/>But, back to the foreign issue. Perhaps it deserves best foreign film, but best film????!!!! Give me a break!

","(Sorry, the name was too long for the local theater marquee, so the title was truncated to fit and became a little of a local joke amongst my friends and I.)  ;)<br/><br/>Anyways, I gave this film an 8, I saw it with subtitles on the big screen and left the theater speechless. To tell you the truth, I wasn't entirely sure what I thought of it, but it is technically astounding.<br/><br/>I came into it realizing that it was a martial arts fantasy movie about some big time heroes and heroines that were larger than life and as such would be able to do things that ordinary folk couldn't. My biggest complaint is about the 'flying' on wires. Assisted jumps would have been spectacular, but the lengthy roof-skimming flights were a little too far out there. Maybe I was hallucinating, but I thought I saw one of the 'fliers' trip, hang suspended in mid-air for a moment, then put his/her feet back down. The actors/actresses really needed more training or practice with the wire harnesses.<br/><br/>I often describe this movie to those who ask as 'One part thinking, one part fighting, and one part love story'. I think that's apt and not all that bad as some say. Most of the negative talk I hear locally comes from the dubbed version, so I guess my advice is: If you can read well and quickly, see the subtitled version on as large a screen as you can get."

","The story takes place during the Ching Dynasty in the 19th century. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is considered one of the greatest martial art warriors of all time in China. Li asks his girlfriend, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), to give his sword, The Green Destiny, to a friend of his father's. Li Mu Bai is determined to give up his fighting days and settle down with Shu Lien. Once Sir Te stores the sword away, it disappears and a greater mystery is unveiled, involving a long-time foe named Jade Fox, the beautiful daughter of the Governor named Jen (Zhang Zi-Yi), and her past lover from the desert. Age and culture hold no barriers to the film's purpose. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an adaptation of the fourth book (out of five) from a popular Chinese literature series by author Wang Dulu. Despite it's revered presence amongst the young crowd in China, film watchers around the world will be able to identify with this film, making the story an international epic. Although the events take place several generations ago, the story is one that all of humanity can identify with, for the film addresses issues that are innate to everyone: loyalty, revenge, love, and honor.<br/><br/>Director Ang Lee accomplishes a tremendous amount of merit in this picture. The backdrop setting for the movie is nothing but breathless. Ang Lee brings this classic story to life by choosing locations that are, in essence, picture perfect. Also contributing to the ambience of the movie experience is a beautiful, and well-written score by Yo-Yo Ma, which mimics every emotion of each character through each somber note. While English-speaking audiences might feel the frustration of reading the subtitles and watching the action at the same time, the acting by the performers is almost enough to figure out the storyline without the use of translation. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh deliver their best performances in this picture, with little doubt as to whether or not they will receive accolades for their work. Also coming forward as a future rising star in Asia is Zhang Zi-Yi (who plays Jen). Only 19 years old, Zi-Yi did not have any knowledge of martial arts at the beginning of the shooting, and was trained completely on the spot. Rrrrright.....action and acting combined? Believe it or not, Ang Lee succeeds in doing this. Rather than random shoot'em ups, bloody fistfights, and kung fu that simply looks cool, the action is as pertinent to the movie as the dialogue. The fighting scenes are obviously enhanced through the use of special effects, yet they are every bit breathtaking as a lightsaber dual. With all of this combined into ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the movie should not be compared to that of ""The Matrix"" or any other kung fu movies. Rather, it stands on its own as a distinct and true masterpiece that serves as epic storytelling that can still exist in a cynical modern society."

","Sure, Gladiator was a cool flick if you wanted to see a movie with pure action in it, but Crouching Tiger had more to it than just action.  this is one of the most wonderfully done films I have ever seen, mostly because it mixes genres so well.  Ang Lee proves he can mix action, drama, comedy, and romance better than any director I know about, which is why he deserved those two Golden Globes he got for best foreign film and best director, as well as the Director's Guild award he won.<br/><br/>The character development was very weak, but that didn't matter since Jen's character developed very well in those two hours, and the relationship between Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai blossomed very well, so you end up not caring about their personal development.<br/><br/>The story, though many thought was flawed (listen to half of these user comments)was actually a perfect fantasy based story, and a joy to listen to-- well, more so a joy to read.  I salute the screenwriters: Mr. Ling, Mr. Schamus, and Mr. Jung.<br/><br/>The action sequences are unlike anything I've ever seen.  while the flying turned many off, the wirework was, in fact near perfection.  The fights were choreographed so well, that the Academy should think of creating a new category for best Choreography just for the sake of Yuen Wo Ping.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the Oscars.  Ten nominations and four wins is an excellent achievement for any foreign film.  The award for best score couldn't have gone to anyone except Tan Dun, because of his amazing use of strings.  The award for best Art Direction could have either gone to CTHD's Tim Yip, or Gladiator's Production Designer for their terrific depictions of 19th Century China and Ancient Rome, respectively.  Tim Yip may have deserved it more because he didn't use CGI in the film at all.  Peter Pau deserved Best cinematography without a doubt, because he captured the fight scenes perfectly and never had us miss out on any of the action.  Other awards I think it deserved were Screenplay,  Director, Costume Design, and Best Film.<br/><br/>Overall, Crouching Tiger is the best Film of the year, let alone best foreign film.  It's better than Gladiator and Traffic combined, and it is the best theater experience I ever had."

","I am Chinese.  Being Chinese, I think I can understand the movie in ways that English speaking population can't.  (No offense, I don't think I understand some films here the same way you do).  That been said, I think the movie received higher praises than it deserves.  There is no question that it is a good movie, visually, musically, and even the story.<br/><br/>
But if you have true fan of chinese movies, especially the ones about the older generation and the way they think, like ""Raise the Red Lantern"", you will realize that this movie's true aim is to criticize the old way of thinking and how it robs people their freedom/happiness.  (which in subjective)  I think it an old theme and should be laid to rest long time ago.<br/><br/>I also have a big problem with the character Yu Jen, played by Ziyi Zhang, she is not the victim, like many would think and she is, by no means, the hero.  She is a spoiled brat that walked all over everyone else's interests in achieving her own.  Her choice in the end of the movie is not some heroic outcry against the society, it is fitting, however, for someone that is full of pride and selfishness."

After Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, I expect no less from him and he has certainly delivered as expected here.<br/><br/>The only thing I'd change, as a Michelle Yeoh fan, would have been to focus more on the motivations and history of the characters of Shu Lien and Mu Bai.  But it looks like the brilliant Mr. Lee is going to oblige me since he's already looking into a pre-quel -- I can't wait!<br/><br/>This is also the sort of film the world needed to see to that honors an often misunderstood genre; that of the world of martial arts, its magnitude, depth and complexity . . . and its simplicity.  I fear that within Hollywood, and by extension the film-goers, it is often tossed around as just a form of action as it is so visually beautiful.  This film digs deeper so that it's not so much about martial arts(even though the form is treated with more respect here), it's about love, honor, pain and dreams. <br/><br/>
Hopefully, with the showing this film made at the Academy Awards this year, the industry will take a closer look at the film making talent outside of the US and allow us to honor more films such as this one."

","I never did understand the hoopla behind this film. Yes, the special effects were great. So were those in the Matrix. Yes, the fighting scenes were amazing. But I prefer the realism of Jackie Chan doing his own stunts any day. As for the subplot...<br/><br/>I've heard several different opinions about the true meaning of the movie. But none of them could convince me that this movie actually made any kind of point. It basically seemed to drift from one sequence to another. First we have some story about the sword. Then it's stolen. Then they try to find the thief. Not bad so far. But then they go into all sorts of nonsense about the girl's bandit boyfriend, which is about the time that the movie starts drifting into meaninglessness.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but if you're going to make a statement about the negative roles assigned to women in ancient China, then at least be a little more upfront about it. Focus on them more, and do it equally. They had three women playing important roles, but only two of them were given any kind of major character development. Personally, I was waiting for Chow Yun Fat to kick the snot out of that pretentious little brat. Sure, she was cute, but her character actually irritated me to no end. I was actually rooting for Michelle Yeoh.<br/><br/>Honestly, give me Operation Condor any day. Sure, it's story is meaningless tripe. But it never claims to be anything more than that, which is my biggest complaint about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

","Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Sorry if this sounds at all snide... Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a visually stunning movie, but so was Twister.  So was Jurassic Park.  So was (shudder) Armageddon.  What actually made Crouching Tiger so much better than these other movies, and worthy of Academy notice?  OK, so the fight scenes were incredible... better than I've seen before, certainly.  But weren't the tornadoes in Twister equally impressive?<br/><br/>Plot?  The plot of Crouching Tiger wasn't much deeper than these other films I've mentioned.  I know many will disagree with that statement, and feel free to.  Let's see... Sword stolen... wild teenager with incredible power... two seasoned warriors chasing after... this could be the plot of a Conan The Barbarian movie, couldn't it?<br/><br/>Was it the acting, then?  Forgive me for sounding like a typical American, but it is hard to judge acting in a language you do not understand.  It seemed excellent to me (and, yes, far better than the ""acting"" in Armageddon) but nothing that really made anyone's hair stand on end.<br/><br/>Directing/Cinematography/Sound?  OK, so this was clearly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  It was truly masterfully done.  But is that enough?  Again, this comes back to the whole comparison with other ""pure"" visual movies.<br/><br/>Actually, the movie this seems most fitting to compare to, for me, would be ""A Thin Red Line"", another visually stunning, well acted (but not TOO well acted) essentially plotless art film.

The more closely you watch this film, the better it gets.  It is crafted with a seemingly superhuman attention to detail.<br/><br/>The lengthy, structurally audacious flashback serves as close counterpoint to the consistently extraordinary scene settings and several first-order cinematographic coups involving the synthesis of other-worldly beauty through framing and digitally clarified color.<br/><br/>And it's not just art -- some of the fight scenes and a few clever shots so quick you better not blink are outright fun!<br/><br/>OK, I admit it.

As it is, with the amount of buzz this movie got, if any movie wanted to live up to it, it'd have to have been personally directed by God.<br/><br/>Secondly, since I know lots of people consider this a big deal, this review is based on the English dub.

","Yes, there is lots of hype for this movie, but in this case I think the hype is well deserved.  Unlike various other movies in this genre, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon manages to stand head and shoulders above the competition.  Why?  Simple, incredible acting.  Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and newcomer Zhang Ziyi are incredibly gifted actors, and truly show off their acting talents.  This move could have fallen flat and felt more like a videogame than a story, but it doesn't.  <br/><br/>I can't wait for this movie to get a broader national release so that more people can experience this movie.  If you have not seen this, or if you're a bit warry of seeing a movie that is in chinese with english subtitles, don't be.  Visually this movie is stunning, the fight choreography is spectacular, and the love stories are well done.  In most movies that I see, action and adventure in particular, the love story is thrown in as more of an afterthought to ""get the girls"" to come and see the movie.  I found the love story in this movie to be both very interesting and touching.  Another gripe that I hear people saying is that the flying and wall crawling are silly.  I just want to remind them that this is a particular style in China, much like Tolkienesque fantasy that we have here in the west.  I don't think it detracts from the movie but enhances its appeal.<br/><br/>Musically this movie is beautiful.  Yoyo Ma did various cello pieces in this very traditional sounding yet maintaining the modern feel to it.  I see now why they were calling Chow Yun Fat the Humphrey Bogart of Asia, and I think he is better than Bogart at conveying emotion.  I think Michelle Yeoh stole the show with her performance.  I've been a huge fan of hers since I first saw her in Supercop, and have followed her ever since.  The other person that I'm really starting to respect is Wo Ping.  The fight scenes that he set up are just spectacular.  I found my jaw dropping at what I was watching on screen, and shouting and cheering the fighting.  It was beautiful, graceful, and stunning.  It also emphasizes the story, which is rare. Usually the fight scenes take away from a story to just show off a different type of ""special effect"".<br/><br/>So to reiterate, this is by far the best movie of 2000.  I encourage everyone to see this movie, it is simply incredible.  I also agree with another reviewer here, I can't wait to get this on DVD. :)"

","This film has some pretty good fight choreography.  The weapons battle near the end of the movie is one of the best.

The ""love stories"" in this movie are not very good, either.  The one involving the young prodigy is essentially worhtless.  Her love interest really serves no purpose in driving the plot, and you could probably remove that entire sub-plot without losing alot of the movie.  The love story involving Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat is actually pretty interesting, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is pretty good overall.  It's certainly not all that great and not the greatest thing since sliced bread.

"Skidmark","Null","0","0","26 June 2001"," Superman Can Fly...So, What's the Problem?
","I don't often feel compelled to comment on movies here.  In fact, this is my first.  But after having read the overwhelming negative comments about CTHD, I feel the need to express my two-cents.<br/><br/>First of all, what most people seem to be addressing in their negative reviews is the preposterous notion of these martial artists flying.  The people who criticize this aspect of the film simply don't get it.  No one seems to have trouble accepting the fact that Superman flies, or that other super-heroes have amazing powers and abilities, so why should there be a problem here?  Movies of all genres are full of completely preposterous notions of superhuman abilities.  The westerns and Rambo-style action movies have the amazingly fast (and accurate) gunfighters who can shoot up a whole town in minutes while the bad guys always seem to miss, modern car chase films have guys driving cars at high speeds and eluding hundreds of police, and musicals support the notion that absolutely ordinary people break out in song and dance in the middle of the street (with full orchestral accompaniment, no less).  The fact is that Chinese and Japanese mythology is full of all kinds of crazy legends of superhuman ability, just as our own western culture has comic books and the like, and, like the Ninja, there is an element of truth to them.  To really enjoy this film, I think this blind acceptance, so easy for Superman, et al., must be achieved before the full beauty of this film can be absorbed.  I pity the poor souls who refuse to open their eyes to this.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think the film does an amazing thing; it parodies (quite successfully) the genre from which it came, and at the same time it pays great homage to it.  Anyone who has seen a bad martial arts film can see the same sorts of action sequences, beautifully choreographed but shabbily done. This film, obviously of higher budget, takes the time to do it right.  The sequence where Jen terrorizes the saloon while touting her invincibility is hilarious and is a brilliant exercise in exploiting the bad martial arts films.  Yet, at the same time, the scene fondly tips its cap to the genre. The concept that people fight each other for the pure joy of fighting and for one-upmanship is not at all unlike the great duels in westerns, or the song and dance pieces in musicals, and this aspect is exploited fully both here and in the bad martial arts films which spawned it.  Also, notice that no one dies in this film other than three people who die for subtle reasons necessary to the plot.  I think that's a nice touch.<br/><br/>Finally, one must acknowledge that the subtleties of the story follow oriental traditions quite closely.  While inconsistencies exist, such as Shu Lien possessing such high rank for a woman, and doing such things as riding on horseback, other subtleties, such as her desire to resolve the stolen sword situation without embarrassing anyone involved is a nice touch. Michelle Yeoh's scenes with Chow Yun Fat have this odd chemistry of oriental reservation and tradition, and the feistiness of Jen is ruthlessly hilarious as she goes about her business just because she's bored and wants to have ""fun"" like any other spoiled little rich girl.  A tip of the hat must also go to Ang Lee.  This film clearly looks as good as any Kurosawa film in the way he captures nature, and that aspect is one that closely follows the traditions of oriental art.<br/><br/>All in all, this film has distressed me greatly because I must now go to the trouble of expanding my top-ten favorite movies to a top-eleven.  I can't understand those folks who don't feel the same."

I've seen the old style choreography, the modern kickboxing, the Jackie Chan style of prop fighting, the new wave wire fu of the 1990s, etc. I'm not one of those people that'll go into the film and criticize it because it's unbelievable. After all, I watch films to escape from reality, not to let it get bogged down.<br/><br/>The plot deals with the events that occur following the theft of a legendary sword. These events affect the lives of a swordsman (Chow), a governor's daughter (Ziyi), a master criminal (Peipei), and the leader of an escort service (Yeoh). It's not really important to discuss those in detail.<br/><br/>A lot of the film's praise goes back to the fight scenes. Well, they're good. Yuen Woo Ping is one of the masters of choreography. The swordfight is especially good, probably my favorite cinematic sword fight. But on the whole, it's nothing new. Chow holds his own, but isn't spectacular. Zhang Ziyi looks decent but people like Donnie Yen could do the same things without wires. Michelle is excellent as usual, I think she was underused in the fights, she only gets two scenes (which are the highlights of the film). However, like I said, it's nothing new or ground breaking. And for people that criticize the flying people, IT'S A FANTASY!<br/><br/>The other praised aspects of the film is where the line between those who know the genre and those who don't gets defined. This is not the first martial arts film to have a good musical score. Just watch the Swordsman series or the Once Upon A Time in China series. Those movies have awesome scores and far more memorable songs. This is not the first martial arts movie to have a good storyline. Once again, check out the Swordsman movies or the Once Upon a Time in China films (well the first 3) and there you get good stories. Jet Li's Tai Chi Master and Fist of Legend also have good storylines. There are dozens of martial arts films out there that have good storylines. This is also not the first martial arts film to have good cinematography, acting, or characters. People treat it as if it were the first. Sorry people, that's not the case.<br/><br/>It's really an insult to Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Yuen Biao, and a lot of the other classic Hong Kong action starts when people praise this movie so much. Why? Because they've been doing this stuff for years (often times without wires and computer enhancement) and yet they've not gotten the same wide respect from American audiences. Also, it's insulting to them that a film with few actual martial artists (Michelle Yeoh is the main exception) gets so much praise, when the people that really know the stuff can't get the same.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this to say that this isn't a good film. I'm saying that it's overrated and nothing new. People who say this is the greatest martial arts film ever really need to go back and watch a lot of the classics of the genre to understand what I mean."

"moroboshi-3","Null","0","0","24 June 2001"," A very good film, although quite overrated
","Ang Lee is without question a talented director. He directed one of my favorite films, Eat Drink Man Woman, and went on to shift from heartwarming romantic comedy to... a martial arts film?  This will tip you off that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not your usual kung-fu slap fest.  Whether or not this is a good thing depends on what you are looking for.  If you are judging Crouching Tiger in comparison to the cinema as a whole, it's great. But if you're comparing it to other martial arts films on their own terms, I've seen better.<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes are amazing, most notably the duel between the two female leads wherein they use pretty much every weapon known to man.  But some of them are a little on the silly side, with more of a floaty, matrixy feel to them than I would have liked.  One of the most disappointing scenes is where the younger female takes on a variety of silly combatants in a restaurant. This scene, ignoring it's similarity to countless others in martial arts farces past, is just too stupid to be funny, and is completely out of place in a movie of this variety.<br/><br/>As you have no doubt heard, Crouching Tiger is pitched as the movie to entertain both sides of the audience (""Mom will like the romance and drama, while Dad and the kids will cheer for the fastpaced fight scenes!"")  If you ask me, those looking for Chinese atmosphere and sweeping romantic drama will enjoy this far more than martial arts fanatics, and that is not putting down martial arts fanatics.  The best thing about CTHD is the sweepingly beautiful cinematography, and the peerless direction by Ang Lee. In fact, the scene that stands out most, looking back on the film, is not a fight scene, but a graceful scene of Chow Yun-Fat practising with the green destiny in an empty courtyard.<br/><br/>In short, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is either a good martial arts flick or a great film. It's just that some are labelling it among other things ""The most beautiful movie ever made"" and ""The best martial arts movie EVER"", both of which are untrue. It's a shame that this mindless hyperbole has had to stain my memory of the film."

Schamus, a co-writer and producer of the film, shares the track with Mr. Lee.  This guy's presence becomes so irritating.  He's fatuous, supercilious, insulting to Ang Lee, annoying and he hardly ever shuts up. <br/><br/>
It took me about three sittings to finally make it through to the end of the commentary.  Near the end, interestingly, Ang Lee makes a comment about Shamus that, evidently, touches a soft spot and Schamus whines while asking Mr. Lee to not make fun of him.  That was ironic because, on a least a dozen occasions during their prior conversation, Schamus ""makes fun"" of Mr. Lee on any number of subjects, including Mr. Lee's prior film (poor box office), ""Ride With the Devil"".<br/><br/>I thought everyone should know that, in my estimation, this commentary track (which might have been really enlightening) is NOT a reason to buy the DVD."

","Just saw this and was overwhelmed with all facets: its direction, stars, cinematography, special effects and subtlety. I was reminded of fairytales told to me as a child, complicated fables with characters who were brave and foolhardy but who accomplished great deeds.  Here in a China of indeterminate time, the women are strong and fierce and are trained as warriors, sometimes surreptitiously, in spite of the male dominated society. The story involves a sword, Green Destiny, which has wonderful powers and strength, a la Excalibur. The special effects alone are so well done it is worth seeing for just these.  I watched the director's cut also to see how they had accomplished this, as it is obviously not digitally.  The actors had to take a lot of risks with harnesses and gliding over such enormous distances.

"Chessack","10","0","0","27 December 2000"," A truly great film in many respects.
","Watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is almost like watching your own dream evolve on the screen. I mean this in only the most positive sense. It is pleasantly surreal, and works like the best of the dreams you have ever had. It follows the story of fictional characters a couple of hundred years ago in China, revolving around the theft of a legendary sword, and the revenge of a student for the death of his master. It is extremely satisfying on so many levels. I will try to name just a few of them.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is superb. Michelle Yeoh doesn't actually get top billing in this movie, but she deserves to. She is utterly outstanding, and shows her talents as both an actress, and a martial artist. In one scene, she uses just about every martial arts weapon you've ever seen, each with equal skill. Add to that an earlier scene where she fights bare-handed, and you have some of the most highly skilled martial arts acting ever filmed. Newcomer Zhang Zi Yi is also wonderful. Not a martial artist herself, she clearly took her training for the film seriously, and learned well -- well enough to hold her own credibly with the likes of Michelle Yeoh.  Zhang is also a terrific actress, portraying an extremely complex character very credibly. <br/><br/>The cinematography and directing are also outstanding -- nothing new for director Ang Lee. The fight scene I mentioned above, where Michelle Yeoh uses just about every martial arts weapon known to Man, also includes some very clever camera work. My favorite part is where they showed a rather long part of the fight sequence from directly over-head -- a rare angle in any fight sequence, whether in a martial arts movie, or in Star Wars or Zorro, and it worked well. I hope other directors follow the lead of Ang Lee and show that angle more often. But Ang Lee didn't just do a good job filming fight sequences. There is a ton of feeling and emotion in this movie, including two different love affairs, and equal attention and care was given to the quiet scenes. Ang's directing was both subtle and skillful.<br/><br/>The sound track also bears comment. It is moody and dream-like, adding to the impression that you are almost watching someone's dream unfold before you. <br/><br/>The combination of the factors mentioned above makes for a truly great movie.  Ang Lee intermixed drama and comedy so cleverly that I was amazed. I found myself thinking, ""I wish I could dream like this once in a while."" I know Ang Lee not only has no plans for a sequel, but has vociferously rejected the idea, since he likes to try something new each time he makes a film. Personally, I hope he changes his mind. These are wonderful characters, it is a wonderful world... and it is a wonderful film. I want more, and I'm sure you will feel the same, after seeing it.<br/><br/>My score: 10/10."
"dfranzen70","5","0","0","23 June 2001"," Hackneyed acting, stiff performances
","When this movie was released in the theater, much was made of it, particularly of its visual appeal. It was said to be a masterpiece, compelling, with luscious scenes and magnificent cinematography. ""Goodie,"" I thought. ""I can't wait to see it on video."" Well, it's here. And I have just finished watching it. Those of you who have known me or who have been on this list for a while know my feelings about foreign films in general. I usually don't like to read subtitles, because it detracts from my enjoyment of the film. When I learned that this movie was dubbed, I was more interested, because I did not wish to be distracted from the striking visual scenes.<br/><br/> However, the problem is that the movie's not terribly good. One major knock against Hollywood films - and a justly earned knock, too - is that more attention is paid to the special effects of a film than to the story. Well, newsflash - that knock applies to some foreign-made films as well. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a delight, as long as you don't pay attention to such trivialities as plot or character development.   Remember those old martial-arts films with Bruce Lee (and even the newer ones with Jackie Chan) that featured hilariously bad dubbing? Those movies were infamous for their dubbing. The tradition continues! That's one strike against the film. Oh sure, you must be thinking, of course the dubbing doesn't seem as flawless as it would be if the actors were using their natural voices. That's to be expected. But it wasn't that the dubbing didn't match up with the facial expressions of the actors, it was that the readings were absolutely soulless. The readings are usually terrible! And when they're not flat and uninspiring, they're overly dramatic. If this was a purely American enterprise, people would have hooted at it. The plot concerns the disappearance of a mystical jade sword, owned by the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). Li decides to give his sword to an old friend, but the sword is soon stolen by a mysterious assassin and her protege. Soon the protege has the sword, Li is fighting everyone in sight, people die, and there's a lot of mysticism. I might be oversimplifying the plot a little, but considering how needlessly complicated the plot is to begin with, I think I'm doing you all a favor in that regard! It is certainly true that the action scenes are unbelievable. You've all doubtless seen the commercials where one attacker walks up the side of a building. That's only the first trick to come out of the bag. As a martial arts film, this is a Picasso. But for those of us who prefer multilayered movies, ones featuring more than just a smattering of nominal plot devices, this is fingerpainting more suitable for a refrigerator."

"jchandbab","9","0","0","21 June 2001"," An modern epic that isn't glossed over. Hooray!
","It has been quite noticeable how heated the Gladiator versus Crouching Tiger debate has been after one triumphed over another.  These two films show the difference between a real Hollywood Studio Epic, and storytelling which is firmly in the control of the director.<br/><br/>This film, on the surface, tells the events of a Chinese mythical tale.  It has leanings towards martial arts, and, due to its 'fairy tale'-like style, it also contains unbelievable scenery.  However, this film also succeeds in that it doesn't try to force its issues ( loyalty being the most recognisable), and neither does it have cartoon-like villains or heroes, unlike the all too unbelievable story of 'Maximus' or Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace.  The final thing that really made this a 'special' movie, was how interesting the quieter bits of this film are.  Not many films can keep tension so effectively, and it seems to be something that Ang Lee is particularly good at ( look at the Ice Storm).  The ending to this is also so serene and understated. It's truly wonderful when a film can give so much respect to its audience, and not be overbearing with a big orchestral score, or pretensious and unrealistic speeches by its lead character. <br/><br/>
This movie doesn't directly answer any of the moral questions it puts foward, and although this could be considered laziness, I think that it also allows you to consider what you have scene totally open mindedly, rather than having conclusions shoved down your throat (like that awful speech in Pearl Harbour.  A movie which is totally enjoyable.  Essential."

The character focus shifts rather arbitrarily, the large flashback seriously damages the flow of the story, and the plot is weighed down with elements that are not at all supported (why is the sword so special, for example).

Every fight seen was filmed with actors hanging on wires.  There's not explaination as to how they can do this, you just have to take it for granted and it looks so incredibly fake all of the time.

What twists?? The movie barely had any discernible plot. The ostensible bad guy (Jade Fox) seemed like a minor character -- no buildup, no establishment of why or how she was so bad, no demonstration or even explanation of how the antagonism developed between her and the heroes. <br/><br/>There was the extended flashback that was waaaay too long, and didn't contribute to the overall story.

Seeing that character with the blade mounted on his forehead seemed fake and comical, not tragic or horrifying.<br/><br/>I wasn't bothered like some over the lack of realism in the fights -- running on walls, flying, and all that. It was a fantasy, okay? That aspect didn't bother me.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was indeed better than your basic cheesy martial arts flick, but that's not saying much."

The combat scenes were breathtaking, and the emotional friction between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien was palpable.<br/><br/>
After reading through reviews of the movie, I find it sad that many people seem to derogate from the movie because they heard previously how wonderful it is and must disagree for the purpose of disagreeing.  Many people complained about the simplicity of the plot and the dialogue.  Have we advanced so far as a civilization that we cannot enjoy the simple beauty of love?  Do sunsets have to come with closed captioning?  Just feel the movie and you will experience one of the best movies of all time.  Don't go into the movie feeling like you must find fault in it simply because other people have enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>This was a movie that I will ponder long after the ending.  Not because of the complexity of the plot, but because of the beauty of it's simplicity. I was left wanting more, and not wishing the movie to end, which is a huge compliment in the modern era of 3 hour plus marathon movies.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie with an open mind.  Sometimes the most wonderful moments in life are the ones you can't describe in words."

","To indicate what a master of deception Lee is - most people think this film is about a green sword and its theft.  They also believe the film belongs in the genre of ""Kung Fu"" or martial arts movies.<br/><br/>Personally, I think we are wrong on both accounts.  Lee has created an epic film with his usual sensitve, gentle style that is really about deception, illusion and he informs us that our eyes cannot be trusted as faithful interpreters of reality.<br/><br/>Lee implies much in his film while saying actually very little.  The dialogue is extremely efficient and the characters are generally warm, sincere and very easy to identify with.  It is really a film about finding ones destiny, the impossibility of capturing the past, and in many ways the limitations of cinema in spawning the imagination of the viewer.  We are constrained by our previous knowledge of film and Lee takes this prejudice and both laughs at us for it, and loving uses it to create strong emotional scenes (such as the later ""ballet among the trees"").<br/><br/>It is an extremely important existential film with multiple layers of depth. One can see within the work of Ang Lee the influences of Bergman, Hitchcock, Truffaut, Fellini, Welles - all the masters, and he takes no shame in ""borrowing"" from them, and yet his own style characterized by an uncommon gentleness and contrast is so powerful that by referencing the masters, Lee (rightfully so), establishes his own chair among the pantheon."

"Auselan","10","0","0","12 June 2001"," The paradoxical ideology of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, like the final piece of advice which Michelle Yeoh gives to Jen, true to itself.  Its aesthetic principles are the same as its practice.  There is no desire without restraint, and repression only heightens passion we are told; this is lived out in the film, and experienced within the audience as it is brought to tears, in the final scene between the hitherto restrained lovers Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.  After years of privation, self-control and stifled desire, these two finally embrace.  Preceded as it is by such restraint, it is a moment of ultimate cathartic release: passion breaking through dignified respect.  Yet it is also an expression of complete powerlessness: the love is thwarted and can never lead to anything.  The paradoxical nature of this (finding love only in death, finding release only in repression) proves the humanity and feeling of the film's Zen philosophy of order, of balancing opposites, upon the reader's pulses.<br/><br/>The film looks at opposing forces: youth and venerability (or innocence and experience) classicism and romanticism', form and content', spirituality and materialism', sense and sensibility' (one of Ang Lee's previous films). In such a context, Jen represents the romantic materialism of youth (and the aristocracy) while Michelle Yeoh stands for the classical spirituality of experience (and working class stoical morality).  The latter preaches the philosophy of form and discipline to the former, but Jen will not accept the wisdom of the older woman's sensibility: she has been corrupted by a wicked master.  Jade Fox, the film's villain, has already taught her to dream of fame and freedom, independence and self-rule (romantic principles).  As a result she is suspicious of Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's philosophy of restraint and submission: when he tells her, during a sparing fight, that the only way to find herself is to loose herself, she scorns him for talking like a monk.<br/><br/>Jen is the hero of the film: she is the one that survives to enjoy the truly happy ending because she has been bold enough to love.  However, it is made very clear that her happiness has been bought at a price: her romantic adventurous fun perniciously brings Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat into martial confrontation, necessitating the subjugation of their love.  They harm none, but rather protect Jen from her own romanticism and this proves the superior strength and humanity of their classical restraint and formal discipline.  The benevolence which classical restraint is capable of administering is thus emphatically pointed out, especially in penultimate scene where, although her life has been ruined by Jen's impetuousness and the latter deserves to die for her folly, Michelle Yeoh stops the raised sword before it touches the girl's neck as a sign and a real implementation of the mercy of restraint (as opposed to the cruelty of passion).<br/><br/>
On the other hand, the film is not a straightforward advocation of the ascetic self-privation of monastic life: Chow Yun Fat's last words express his regret at having wasted his life in pursuit of spiritual excellence rather than love.  The materialism of Jen is part of her youth, her zest for life; while the spirituality of Chow Yun Fat is deathly and pale in comparison.  Jen chases the desert bandit in pursuit of her hair comb (green  the colour of life) and is equally obsessive about securing the green destiny sword.  She relishes the beauty of these two fertility symbols (the green comb and sword), risking her own death, after Chow Yun Fat has thrown it over the waterfall, to retrieve the sword.  Although her passionate romanticism makes her the film's hidden dragon , a secret poison that destroys, like her wicked master Jade Fox, it also makes her the film's nectar, its life force."

","Simply put, this movie is a true modern-day classic and deserves all the praise and accolades it has received. Ang Lee must be commended for taking a well-worn genre and injecting new life into it by combining the fantastical with his own expert and subtle direction. 'CTHD' isn't as crazy as some wuxia movies of the past; there are no disappearing ninjas or flat-out gymnastics taking place in the sky, but it perfectly balances the somber, contemplative tone with out-of-this-world martial arts. I'v seen hundreds of films from this genre, 'Duel to the Death', Tsui Hark's classic 'Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain', etc. and I'm happy to say that 'CTHD' ranks with the very best of them.

"hansboxer","Null","0","0","8 June 2001"," LIFE IS NOT A DREAM, BUT EVERY DREAM IS A LIFE
","This movie is not about martial arts.  That's why it is special.  A great love story is never about love.  A tragic tale of chivalry is never really about chivalry.  It is not painful to see a lover go because that only makes the return so much sweeter.  Insight is not bliss, but sadness that is too heavy to bear.  Thus, it is essential to stop looking at this film as a martial arts film.  But then, how to see?  The assumption that the true martial artist must conquer gravity is, I believe, the keyhole to view the film.  Gravity is the weight of the world, but also the weight of our emotions mixed up with the emotions of other people.  The film is not only about gravity, but what gives gravity meaning, the ground itself.  Every martial artist or dancer knows that the ground is the first friend or foe in any battle or performance.  Indeed, one's relationship to the ground determines the outcome of many battles.  You can leap from the ground, but you must come back.  And here, the metaphor of leaving is similar to the dream, where the soul leaves the ground of the body to pursue its own fancy. But it is back in the body, upon waking, that the dream can transform the way that the dreamer relates to his or her body.  When the Jade Fox complains bitterly that she was not given access to the secrets of certain symbols, she is bitter over the ground of life, although she could fly she could not soar, she could not let the uninterpreted symbols be filled by her own imagination, and herein was her downfall.  The real meaning of every text is the imagination we bring to its mysteries, and no one can interpret them for us--not teacher nor student.  The power of the student is to understand the unknown with imagination, the power of the teacher is to claim that what was once imagination is now ""reality."""

And these are older movies I can never get enough of - Die Hard (original), Much Ado About Nothing (Shakespeare), Robocop, Terminator 2.

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great movie.  It really is.  The fight scenes are probably the best ever filmed, the special effects are completely convincing without relying on computers, the performances and production design are without flaw, and the cinematography is gorgeous.<br/><br/>But in all honesty I must report a couple of minor quibbles.  First of all, the story is a bit too complex and sometimes the subtitles are too fast to be easily understood.  Obviously those problems would be irrelevant after seeing the film more than once, and the film is certainly compelling enough to warrant repeated viewings, so I don't really consider those complaints very important.  But even if you completely understood everything, though, the movie would still be flawed.  About an hour in, the story is suddenly interrupted by a very long flashback sequence involving the warrior princess and a bandit she encounters in the desert.  The sequence is much too long, not very interesting, and very oddly placed, completely stifling the film's momentum for about 25 minutes.  Information conveyed in the flashback is definitely vital to the story, but I would have admired the movie much more if that segment had been shorter and more smoothly integrated into the flow of the film.<br/><br/>Really, though, who cares?  The movie is excellent and has one of the most oddly powerful endings I've ever seen.  Go see it."
"sQuint","10","0","0","5 June 2001"," The parsimony of spirit amongst moviegoers
","It's bothered me for some time, the sort of superficial slagging off this movie has received from some commentators here. Having just watched it again, I feel compelled to add to my (much) earlier comments on this picture and respond to a couple of other comments.<br/><br/>First, I would like to address the issue of plot. Some have described it as ""paper thin"" or ""cliche."" The extreme over-reliance on plot over story is the Achilles heel of many a film. I realize some people like a complicated plot, but in the language of cinema plot is a framework. Many films today -- I daresay most -- are not made in the language of cinema, and are made in the language of expository prose, including many pictures I like quite a lot. Many films have a complex and intriguing plot yet fail to tell a compelling story.<br/><br/>My point is that the simple ""plot"" (love stories, stolen sword) and indeed the genre trappings in the picture serve as the framework for a story that is told almost exclusively visually. Almost all of the emotional punch of this tale is told visually, in cinematic language rather than clunky exposition. And what is this story about? Simply, about letting go of who you are, in the face of the fear of who you might be becoming, in order that you might become whom you need to become. The plot is simple, the story, complex and mutlifaceted.<br/><br/>If that sounds like hokum to you, perhaps it's best that you move on to a standard chop-socky picture. Chances are you will not enjoy this rich and wonderful film.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to comment on the supposed ""woodenness"" of Michelle Yeoh as remarked by some negative posters. Ms. Yeoh's performance is, in my view, a tour de force. Her character has a world of things happening within, but her culture imposes restraint in so many areas, restraint eloquently expressed by Ms. Yeoh with simple gestures and expressions. It is for precisely this reason that the fight scenes between Ms. Yeoh and Ms. Xiyi have such an elemental and raw power to them. It is as if all that has been repressed is released with extraordinary focus.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to address two painful comments made by other posters. One opines: ""If you want to see a good plot, watch Gladiator."" ""Gladiator"" is a good example of ""all plot, no story,"" and as hackneyed and recycled plot as has been seen onscreen in many a year. It seems to have been assembled, as so many have commented, from old ""Spartacus,"" ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" and ""Ben Hur"" screenplays. The dialogue is ludicrous and even the critical plot points dazzle in their banality. The incredibly paranoid, wimpy and unskilled Roman emperor will get into the ring with the deadliest gladiator of all time? Why? So the plot can continue to grind its way forward, clockwork-like, and the emotions of you, the viewer, can be manipulated with appallingly predictable results. Are you not entertained? And yet, what is the story about? There really is no story. Only plot.<br/><br/>Another poster offered: ""If a movie had great special effects, but terrible acting and a paper-thin plot, the average 2000/01 moviegoer would scream about how terrible Hollywood was getting. "" Cf. my comments re: Gladiator above, and the screaming of every cineaste I know when viewing ""Pearl Harbor"" or at least 75% of the tripe that is rehashed, assembled from a kit, reheated and served up lukewarm, with a cold and manipulative calculation, to willing audiences who at least appear to lap it up.<br/><br/>CTHD is a unique and heartfelt work that works on levels well below (and above) the superficial level of plot. That people who disdain it do so because of the ""paper-thin"" plot yet extol the virtues of ""Gladiator"" explains the ascendance of plot over story, of simplistic exposition over visual storytelling, and ultimately, the slow demise of film as a legitimate popular art form.<br/><br/>Many people, it seems, don't want to be bothered looking below the surface, in art or indeed in their lives. They would much rather have things spelled out and spoon-fed to them. It's so much easier that way, isn't it? One doesn't have to think too much then.<br/><br/>How we feel about art is often a good indicator of how we feel about ourselves. Are you not entertained?"

However, after having watched it myself I must say that I'm a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>While there is a great deal of emphasis on the martial arts choreography in this film, that seems to be the overriding -and only- leitmotif here- do whatever it takes to start another fight sequence.  The performances were good, but I got up thinking that I missed something.  I didn't.  There just wasn't much there, except for some brilliant fight scenes.  But in and of themselves, fight scenes do not make a movie great.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent, and perhaps deserving of an Oscar -but the original score was totally forgettable.  Hans Zimmer should have won the Oscar hands-down for his scoring of 'Gladiator'.  <br/><br/>'Crouching Tiger' was an entertaining movie, reminiscent of all those cheesy Kung Fu Theatre marathons I saw as a kid.

","""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" holds your attention for two hours by its sheer efficient use of time.  Imagine six fight scenes, some that would make The Flying Nun pay attention, two interwoven love stories, a short discourse on Eastern philosophy and Eastern manners, and an homage to the American Western from the pacifist themes of ""High Noon"" and ""Friendly Persuasion"" to retribution in ""The Unforgiven"" to the omnipresence of ""Shane"".  Director Ang Lee chose native dialogue with English subtitles as a way to showcase classic Chinese cinematic techniques - the understood rather than the spoken, the facial mannerisms that reveal what is in the heart.  The main characters (Chow Un Fat as Li, Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien, and Zhang Ziyi as Jen) won't smother you with their screen presence - they fade in and fade out without fanfare - but it is probably not coincidental that Lee made Jen to resemble Queen Amidala from ""Star Wars, the Phantom Menace""        and the Jade Fox to look a lot like The Wicked Witch from ""The Wizard of Oz"", comforting characters from comforting films.  The well-orchestrated martial arts action scenes are worth the admission -  one on rooftops, one between tall tree branches, one between a woman and another woman, and one shoot-em up involving a whole gang of men and one woman that adds new meaning to the word, 'gang-bang'.  In addition, we are educated to centuries old Eastern thought - loyalty to one's master, search for meditation over confrontation as well as woman's issues - condoning arranged marriages, accepting womanly behavior.  The romance in this film is particularly well done - from the reluctance to touch the hand of one you love to the enticement of a warm bath to win the heart of a rebelled maiden.  The ending is both an enlightening and a fitting resolution to a film that successfully merges all the good elements of both the Western genre and the gung-fu fighting cinema with the heartfelt compassion of Eastern thought and philosophy."

Don't get me wrong, it was a nice film with a sweet plot and some amazing action sequences (which were pretty awesome), but a huge amount of the time while reading several reviews, I was saying ""I've already seen this, and this movie wasn't anything new to me."" So, I'm sorry to be the dissent victim here, but I found nothing overwhelmingly original about it. And that's usually what catches my attention-originality. This applies to everything- movies, music, taste, etc. This movie did not capture that experience for me. I saw this movie on opening night, and although the acting was well-done, and the editing was great (kudos of Mr. Lee), I didn't find a lot of what I was looking for: exceptional acting, astounding action sequences, a beautiful love story (sorry I didn't think this one sufficed my romantic thrills enough). :)<br/><br/>A good effort, and a good job. Not one of the best movies, or one I would likely remember with gushing excited behavior. C+"

","Would the Taiwanese filmmakers please return the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and give it to ""Amores perros""? Come on, Chinese warriors have been flying for decades, martial arts have been choregraphed for centuries, and Buddhist philosophy has better illustrators. But now since Ang Lee has become an Occidental ""acquired taste"", since Chow Yun-Fat has gained ""mainstream respectability"", as the King of Siam, and a nod for Taiwanese cinema (or politics?) is needed, everybody's gone crazy and placed this silly tale among the best films ever made.

","Up to now i wasn't much attracted to martial arts movies. When I first saw the trailer of ""Wo hu zang long"" on tv i thought that it was going to be just an interesting movie and nothing more. How wrong I was. Before i begin my commenting of the movie I'd like to say that describing this movie as a kung-fu film would be a truly great injustice.<br/><br/>The story line is quite complicated partly because it involves the lives of many characters and until the end of the movie you keep asking yourself if you understood everything or missed something from the plot. I won't describe it here partly because it would spoil the fun of future viewers and partly because it would take too much time and space. In my opinion the great quality of this movie are its characters. If you watch it closely you'll notice that although it deals a lot in a fantastic environment the characters are very realistic. There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is in a  particular position because of his/her past and experience. i believe that all the actors do their best and the result is more than satisfying.<br/><br/>The other strong point of this movie is the relationships between the characters. Love, hate, friendship, abandonment and rejection continually change places and mark the lives of all the heroes. It could be a love story but as it often happens in real life true love is most of the times hidden and silent. This movie also treats death as a form of catharsis and redemption, the way most great tragedies do.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the fight scenes. I thought so. I won't say anything about them because i believe that people should see this movie for the movie and not for the fx.<br/><br/>Someone said that if this was a Hollywood movie everyone would be ranting against it. I would like to add that if this was a Hollywood movie : firstly it would have won the Oscar and secondly it wouldn't have captured the true eastern philosophy. It would turn out to be another martial-arts-great-sfx-but-no-meaning movie and i think that ""Wo hu zang long"" is a lot more that that. And personally i like when movies like this never win in the Oscars because quality and emotions can never be measured with prizes. Just see the movie and learn to respect your emotions."
"Dietrich","10","0","0","3 June 2001"," A modern day classic
","To anyone out there who may be thinking, ""Is it me or was this movie not that great?"" Guess what....it's YOU. This movie works in every single way movies should work. Ang Lee must be praised for taking a genre and injecting new life into it by combining eastern filmmaking ideals and classic Chinese folklore with his own gift for lyrical restraint and expert direction. The movie feels like the beginning of a 'new-school' type of martial arts film, where the very idea of wuxia warriors and Taoist fighting as a means of reaching enlightenment is treated with respect and not as an excuse for stupid, ridiculous fight scenes like so many Jet Li and Donnie Yen flicks.<br/><br/>In short, if you want a wall-to-wall action flick with fighting from beginning to end, look elsewhere because 'CTHD' is not it. Sure, there is fighting...but the film is also very slow, contemplative, haunting and downright beautiful. Forget the hype, forget the critics, just sit back and enjoy.  PS-this film must be watched in the original Mandarin. I've heard parts of the English dub on the DVD and it is awful.<br/><br/>**** (out of ****)"
"doom1701","Null","0","0","2 June 2001"," I know why everyone has such praise for this movie...
","If you don't understand it, it must be good.  People are afraid to pan this movie, because they think somebody will come along and say how much of a neaderthal they are.  Well, face the facts, folks, the movie isn't as good as you are afraid it might have been.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the plot; I'll go to the other end of the spectrum--it's not that beautiful of a movie.  Ang seems to be going the way of a sitcom director--focus in close on people's faces.  When there is a wide enough shot to actually see the scenery, the action is so hyperfast that you can't enjoy it.<br/><br/>One other thing that really visually distracted me--the poor effects.  The wire work wasn't that great--I'm supposed to believe that these people, who have reached such a sense of oneness with the universe that they can fly, are going to be flailing their legs all over the place while flying?  If you really want to portray the majesty of flight, let's really get a feel for them flying, not waving their appendages to keep their balance on the wires.<br/><br/>And the infamous plot (I never said I wouldn't criticize it, I just wanted to start somewhere else) was pretty much as bad as people say.  In fact, I should say both plots weren't great.  On the one side, a man decides to give up his current path in life, only to find that he can't.  He's in love with somebody, too (doesn't he have to be?).  On the other side, a girl falls in love with the Dread Pirate Roberts--sorry, wrong movie.  Same difference, though.  At least Princess Bride had some humor.  Cookie cutter, all around. Too bad they took two hours to tell it--it was a 15 minute story, at best.<br/><br/>All that said, I'd still give the movie 5 stars out of 10--it's not bad, it just isn't great.  Rent it or buy the DVD, and fast forward through chunks of it."
"blowfelt","Null","0","0","29 May 2001"," Best Movie of 2000
","After reading a number of negative comments I felt compelled to add my opinion on why I felt this is the best movie of 2000.<br/><br/>Let us dispel one myth right away; at its core, this is NOT a martial arts film. It is a mythical love story deeply influenced by eastern religion and philosophy.  The martial arts sequences are not fight scenes but instead physical representations of the feelings and emotional tension of the characters.  They are more synonymous with dance then combat.<br/><br/>
So why martial arts?  The moviemakers made an intelligent choice in using the framework of a standard martial arts story to tell their intended tale, as it makes the film more familiar and less foreign to Westerners by using the only feature most North Americans understand of Eastern culture.  But the martial arts are really used as a red herring, making the film more approachable to audiences while setting them up to insightful commentaries (both negative and positive) on eastern society and culture notwithstanding themes about the overall human condition.<br/><br/>Many critics focus their attention on the universal plot and script that seems very simple and shallow.  But like Beethoven's 5th, this plot is much more than four simple notes.  It is clear that the script was carefully constructed and contained many subtle layers that required many viewings for me to grasp.  Also, unlike many modern films that treat us like children, no firm conclusions were given, only subtle questions about human love, sacrifice, honour, discipline, sense of purpose, our individual place in society, and faith are all authentically explored within a Chinese context, which made it both interesting and entertaining. The audience is left to draw their own conclusions about the films central themes though there were some modest messages the filmmakers wanted to communicate.<br/><br/>The acting was subtle and understated, and the performances were excellent. If such performances were given by American actors they would have surly garnered much more praise.<br/><br/>Another common criticism is the need for the audience to have had too great a suspension- of-disbelief to make the story credible.  Too those I say you only have to look at our own myths to understand that mythical characters are not human.   They are human projections (meaning they are flawed like us in other ways) that are given mythical powers to increase their authority to provide moral messages.  The fact the main characters can fly is not used as a device to provide more thrilling action sequences but instead is used by the filmmakers with the purpose of separating the main characters from the regular people in the film.  Their super human abilities were a sign to us in the audience that we needed to pay attention to these central characters as they convey the main messages of the story.<br/><br/>The final aspect of this film I would like to touch on was its overall use of tone.  I think it was exceptional in this movie.  The stunning visuals and breathtaking sounds including the musical score and the temper of the dialog create the proper sensory impression.  I now understand why Lee used Mandarin Chinese over other forms of Chinese language as its cadence and tone fit perfectly to the story.  English especially would have felt out of place.  Once you have a great auditory landscape you need to create vivid images and Lee's team were equal to the task.  The magnificent cinematography work of Pau combined with the gorgeous and very well chosen Chinese locations gave the film the scale it required.  When you add this to the authentic set and costume design you have a very rich atmosphere providing a spectacular canvas to set the epic story against.<br/><br/>
Great films like great art communicate complex themes in a simple and non-compromising fashion, yet if looked at from a different perspective you might uncover hidden gems of inspiration.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one such film.  I recommend to all those who have written such harsh criticism to take the chance to view the film again, and not concentrate on the obvious literal layer, but instead try to understand the underlying purpose of each shot, each piece of dialog...because in those carefully planned collection of moments I am sure you will find a story worthy of Shakespeare's Hamlet, Welle's Citizen Kane, Coppola's Godfather etc."
"Mr. Pulse","9","0","0","23 December 2000"," A Very Enjoyable Martial Arts Film
","I finally found a theater near me playing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I've heard raves about it, and for the most part I was not disappointed.  Is it great?  Yes.  Is it one of the best films of the year?  Absolutely.  Is it one of the greatest films of all time?  I think not.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, the cinematography gorgeous, and the direction strong.  And of course, the fight scenes are simply magnificent.  The long climactic battle between two of the characters as one keeps selecting weapon after weapon is a adrenaline pumping joy.  Another scene, in which one character takes on a bar full of masters, is also very exciting, and suprisingly funny.<br/><br/>But as good as this film is throughout, it lost me on the ending.  The final scene left me confused, I didn't quite understand the motivations for the characters.  Why did they act the way they did?  I left the theater slightly unsatisfied by that (Especially disappointing because the last forty-five minutes of the film build to the finish so well, each scene better than the last right til the end).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is one of the best movies of the year, packed with both exciting action and interesting characters.  And for goodness sake's see this thing on the big screen if you can."
"VVB","Null","0","0","29 May 2001"," Possible Reasons for Success
","It appears to us that the primary reasons the movie is so successful include:<br/><br/>1) It skillfully exploits the principle of `presenting large events through small groups of people'. Specifically, it gives us a peek into a whole imaginary Universe of supernatural martial arts in an ancient world Giang Hu. It is not an epic movie though for it never gives us a global bird-eye view of it but just enough for the thrilling sensation of peeking through a window into something immensely grand.<br/><br/>2) It is set in a magic fairy-tale-like environment reminding us of the warm fuzzy fairy tales most of us have had as kids. This effect is quite subtle and, apparently, very difficult to achieve for overdoing it quickly makes a movie overly specialized. The film does the trick mainly via the flying abilities of the heroes as well as the gorgeous mountain backdrops that look like they were taken straight off old Chinese ink drawings. The closest feature to this film along this dimension might be `The Monkey King' Chinese cartoon.<br/><br/>3) Most people appear to enjoy the thoughts of flying (freely like birds but not in airplanes, that is). Children often fantasize about it and adults frequently have it in their night dreams. It is not entirely clear why human beings crave flying (which is accordingly excessively popular in most countries' myths and tales). Regardless of the mechanism, the movie uses it in several ways. First, as pointed out above, the flying abilities emphasize the fairy-taleness of the settings. Second, the brilliant camera-work makes the viewer feel as if they are flying together with the heroes. Third, it takes the viewer through an imaginary quest to some magic hidden areas high in the mountains. In doing so the viewer flies over the trees, above the lakes, waterfalls, etc. Many people seem to have imagined/dreamt of doing a similar travel at least once in their life.<br/><br/>4) The plot uses the `an accident in the middle of normal life' paradigm. In other words, the viewer feels as if they were strolling along with the heroes in their daily routine when suddenly something extraordinary happened and they all got pulled into a whirl of unusual events. This seems to be a more immersive `formula' for it is easier for us to receive magic and supernatural events IF they happen as an exception to the ordinary life RATHER THAN as regular phenomena. The net effect is that we feel more engaged into the supernatural events ourselves. A number of successful movies and stories have used this framework. `Back To The Future', `Terminator - 1,2', `Matrix', `Star Wars' (with respect to Luke's initially `ordinary' life), `Evil Dead - 2,3' are just a few. <br/><br/>5) The movie is philosophically rich. Technically, perhaps, the only direct philosophical scene is the dialog between Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) where Mr. Bai tells her of his failure in reaching the inner eternal peace prescribed by Taoism and other Eastern philosophies. However, this short dialog, together with the rest of the movie subtly supporting his tragedy, probes fundamental philosophical issues more than most of the recent movies have. It does so by addressing one of the deepest cravings of humanity - the inner peace and happiness. Most people's life is a quest for these and yet very few appear successful. Taoism offers a solution further extended into the physical world by Tai Chi and certain martial arts such as Jeet Kune Do. Very crudely speaking, it tells us that the only way to achieve the true happiness is to empty yourself of flittering desires and follow the Tao. The movie questions this postulate through the character of Li Mu Bai who fails to achieve the happiness while supposedly exercising the Taoist approach. This `counter-example', as the movie presents it, can be interpreted in a number of ways. However, it achieves the goal by stirring our imagination and thinking in this area. It makes us want to reflect on our own related experiences on the topics of the utmost interest to most humans. <br/><br/>6) For those interested in romance, the movie seems to offer a subtle love triangle though the ties are delightfully light in their presentation and it is mostly left to the viewer's imagination. That by itself utilizes one of the successful artwork principles summarizable in a bumper-sticker version as `leave some food for the viewer's imagination'. It even makes us want to come back and see the movie again to pick the intricate details that we feel we might have missed on the first viewing.<br/><br/>7) For those longing for drama and tragedy, the movie delivers a non-Hollywood ending and some saddening plot developments.<br/><br/>8) Finally, a number of people appear to enjoy martial art related sequences. Viewers so inclined will find them in abundance throughout the movie (NB: such sequences probably took up most of the filming time...). This, on the other hand, can also be considered as a weakness of the movie since the overly-theatrical appearance of the sequences far-removed from the real life fighting will be obvious to any people in the field. Fortunately, there are fewer of them than the more impressible audience."
"Donnacha","9","0","0","29 May 2001"," Ah, who knew brutality could be so poetic!
","Cinema Unbreakable<br/><br/>Right, for my first little review of a film I decided to share my opinion of Ang Lee's epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon since I'm sure that any other film that would be more mainstream is already earmarked for praise and jeers from everyone else. If you haven't heard of this film, you will. It's one of those critical darlings, an Oscar favourite, on a parallel with those new ones like ""Traffic"" or ""Cast Away"". Well seldom have I shared the critical view with those journalists. Hey, first time for everything, because this film is SPECTACULAR. Some might be turned off by the sweeping story, the breathtaking visuals and the distracting subtitles... but hey, it's got GREAT fight scenes. <br/><br/>The obligatory plot summary: In turn of last century China, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) returns to his home after years of meditation, a venture to absolve himself of his legendary life as the greatest warrior in all of China. In an effort to forget his past and try to lead a new life, he gives his friend Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) the sword of Green Destiny (which he used throughout his warrior days) to give to his old friend in Beijing, Sir Te. It is at Sir Te's that Shu Lien meets Jen Yu (Zhang ZiYi), the daughter of the governor. Since Shu Lien's past is also filled with legendary war stories, the young Jen is fascinated with the image of the roaming warrior, partly due to her growing up hearing exaggerated stories about Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, and partly because of her planned marriage. However, all is not what it seems, and when the sword is stolen, the story twists and turns as unstoppable enemies, past lovers and suppressed feelings all work against the main characters. Naturally I wouldn't want to give too much away since the story is so entertaining once it gets started. What I just summarized is only the first fifteen minutes. And then the fight scenes start... <br/><br/>Well, what can I say? If all you liked about ""The Matrix"" or ""Charlie's Angels"" were the fight scenes, then watch the masters go to work! This film has five-to-ten minute two-person battles with impossible jumps, graceful action and excellent, EXCELLENT fighting. But don't see this just for the masterstroke fight scenes; this movie is also a beautiful love story. While Jen yearns for her true love in the face of a life as either a stationary wife or a travelling warrior, Shu feels pain about never being able to show how much she loves her intended. <br/><br/>Okay, if I've lost your attention by now, I'll remind you it's got great fight scenes. <br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat (Who knew he'd be better with one green sword than two handguns? If you don't know what I'm on about, see his Hong Kong work) is brilliant, even if he's not the main player in this film. Michell Yeoh and Zhang ZiYi are fantastic as the central characters (the title corresponds to them in the underlying theme of the film), always at odds with each other when all they want to be is allies. <br/><br/>Oh, I'm sorry, I went into the theme again. Did I mention the great fight scenes? <br/><br/>To sum all that up, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wonderful film for any fan of foreign, action or movies in general. See it with anyone, because it's got something for EVERYone. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; the best film I've ever read. <br/><br/>(And if you don't like subtitles, it's got great fight... okay I'll shut up.)"

","Let me start by announcing to you, dear reader, that I am not a martial arts fan. Okay, so choreographed fighting is an interesting prospect and can look good in front of the camera, but I have always been disturbed by the notion that the backbone of such a movie relies on how many different ways a man can be thrown through a window/door/expensive painting. This said, I absolutely loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Possibly, the reason is I entered the darkened movie theatre expecting to play the eternal cynic. However, five minutes is all it took to quash any of my preconceptions and realise how much I assume about a movie when buying tickets.<br/><br/>My second thought was: why are so many people walking out of this all-too-evidently-fantastic movie? Then I realised people weren't willing to enjoy this exquisite piece of art because it was subtitled. More fool them, I say. If they can't see the effort Ang Lee poured into Crouching Tiger, they don't deserve to be part of the audience. The sheer beauty of this oriental historic masterpiece is the glue that sticks you to the seat. Of course, the camera work, intricate storyline and kick butt fighting are layers of the proverbial icing on the deliciously rich cake that is Crouching Tiger (bizarre analogy, I know). See this movie even if you hate flying fists and deadly weapon work- chances are you'll love the subtle romance and attention to detail in the scenery."

","Although I am not a fan of martial art films I must say that the fighting scenes was the big upside of the film. Unreal - sure, silly with people flying in the air - sure, but it is filmed in such beautiful and magic way that you just want the saga and special effects to continue. The effects reminds me a bit of Matrix. One unusual but positive thing about the film is that it has women in the center of the fighting scenes. One scene when one girl practically wrecks a whole 2-floor restaurant with a whole army of warriors within it spurs the audience to laughter thanks to the girlsÂ´s snappy lines and cocky way.<br/><br/>The story is apprehensible but the way these Chinese people think and reason is beyond my understanding. Moral, ethics and an understanding of what life is really about seems to be the core message through the film.

","I have only one word to describe this film in a nutshell: beautiful. I don't necessarily mean visually, although it is visually beautiful.  I'm referring to everything in the film:  The story, the cinematography, and just the emotions that this film generates in the viewer.  This beauty is the reason that I've seen the film four times in the theater, and am planning on purchasing it on video as soon as it becomes available.<br/><br/>Acting: Chow Yun-Fat delivers a typical excellent performance.  The real focus, however, is on the two woman who really drive the story, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi.  Ziyi in particular takes an increasingly central role as the story progresses, and her acting talents become more and more notable.  I look forward to seeing her in later films. The thing that most impressed me most about the acting was the emotions that spoke through the language barrier.  The third time I saw the film I paid less attention to the subtitles and more to the acting.  I can testify that nearly all the performers are excellent.<br/><br/>Action: The action scenes are not actually the centerpieces of the film, although they are good enough to be.  Yuen Wo Ping's choreography, coupled with Ang Lee's directing make for exciting, adrenaline filled fights.  At first I wasn't sure to laugh or not at the flying scenes, but after I got used to it, they became some of the most fitting moments of the films.<br/><br/>Cinematography: I love almost any film with good cinematography, and this film was full of it.  Sometimes it tends a little toward the dark side, but I think that may have been the effects of a dim theater.  Especially well done were the scenes from the extended flashback in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>Score: Tan Dun's score won a well deserved Oscar.  It sounds a little odd to my Western ears, but some of the pieces spoke volumes to me even without the visual images in front of me.<br/><br/>Story: Ah, this is the best part of the film.  The story manages to fit this film into a variety of genres.  This story is an action film, a drama, and a romance all rolled into one.  This story is capable of being both uplifting and sad at the end.  The ending is slightly ambiguous, but still manages to be perfect.<br/><br/>Basically, I believe this film comes close to being perfect. I give it 10 out of 10."

","When I was nine years old, I saw a movie that touched me so deeply, it would inspire my childhood imagination and leave such a lasting impression, that I can still recall smells, sounds and tidbits of memories from the movie theater when I first saw it. I've seen it many dozens of times since, and although I am 34 now, there are still parts of the soundtrack that send chills up my spine as I associate them with that miraculous magical childhood moment.<br/><br/>I have since lamented that I would never be affected by a movie like that again, assuming that one, I am not a child any more and simply am not as impressionable, and two, the magic that I felt from that movie is just so rare I would never be lucky enough to experience it again.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon proved me wrong. This movie is pure magic - fantasy for adults. It was released at just the right time for me, as I am a long-time film lover, I have lately become jaded by movies. I think most of what comes out of Hollywood is crap. And if not crap, then simply roller-coaster extravagance - fun to watch (see Matrix, Independence Day), but not particularly awe-inspiring. The combination of the poetic action and storyline combined with the haunting soundtrack produced an effect on me not felt since I saw the movie I mention above when I was nine years old - Star Wars.<br/><br/>I find it difficult to believe so many reviewers here found the movie to be ""silly,"" ""shallow,"" and found the 'flying' to be ridiculous.

","Wow! Ang Lee's latest film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a martial arts masterpiece that certainly has punch and kick added to it. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh, who both are very athletic veterans of the genre, head the all-Asian cast in this film. I don't know a great deal about the old kung fu films, but when I watched it in the movie theater (twice). I felt like I had learned something yet I can't put my finger on it.<br/><br/>The film's story follows the furious pursuit of a legendary sword (The Green Destiny) that has been stolen and how two warriors (Fat and Yeoh) reunite to find the suspect(s) who are involved in the theft. But that's only one of the movie's two main subplots and the other one consists of a bearucrat's daughter (Ziyi Zhang) and a notorious bandit (Chen Chang) who fall in love.<br/><br/>Besides the story, the musical score that's masterfully composed by Tan Dun, the breath-taking cinematography by Peter Pau, and the film's harrowing fight scenes also stand out here. Out of all the fight scenarios, the one that breaks out in the restaurant is my pick.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a movie-goer's dream come true and should have earned BEST PICTURE at the Oscars."

","I guess I should burn in hell now.  Oooh, I just badmouthed the *wink wink* superior ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  Well, if people can badmouth ""American Beauty,"" I have as much right to give my not-so-satisfying opinion on this flick.  It's all a matter of opinion.  I, personally, can't fathom why it recieved the Number 12 Spot on the Top 250, but I'm not going to start whining.  <br/><br/>Others were amazed by the film's ""breathtaking stunts and fight scenes.""  I thought the scenery was great and so was the cinematography, and Ang Lee is in fact a talented director--check out his earlier drama ""The Ice Storm.""  I just didn't feel the romance and the goofy-looking martial arts blended well together.  <br/><br/>People keep saying, you shouldn't look at this as a martial arts flick; it's a love story.  Yes, it is.  But a special one?  Hardly.  Hollywood hasn't exactly been fleshing out the best love stories in recent years, but I see nothing that makes this love story involving the pursuit of a comb--that's right, don't take it out of context--special.  <br/><br/>Sure, I know this is just a movie, but when I watch people running up trees, running across water and flying off roofs--I don't give a damn how many Oscars the movie was nominated for!  I have to laugh!  Am I supposed to be stunned?  If you are stunned by that kind of stuff, good for you.  I couldn't help but find unintentional comic irony.<br/><br/>The acting is good.  I like Ang Lee's decision to use subtitles, as opposed to ludicrous dubbing.  That would've made it look sillier.  Ang Lee definitely put his best efforts into making the film; I just didn't appreciate the material.<br/><br/>I do think that people are exaggerating the film's effect on audiences, though.  Talking about how it was ""applauded at the Caanes Film Festival"" and that was only after the first fight sequence.  Well, naturally!  The director is in the theater with the viewers!  Don't be surprised to spot a swarm of butt-kissers!  Let me tell you what happened when I went to view the movie at MY local cinema:  A man behind me, with his wife, felt like he was in a damn concentration camp!  He kept complaining to his wife, ""Can we leave now?"" and blurted much more profane comments.  I didn't feel torchered watching this film; I was just glad to find proof that it is somewhat overrated and not EVERYBODY is in love with it!<br/><br/>I've never been a huge martial arts fan.  I mean, I like Jackie Chan flicks, but his movies are original and quite funny.  But the standard Hong Kong-imported karate flicks involving people flying in the air and action that's quicker than the human eye is able to perceive never greatly appealed to me.  <br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is more than a goofy martial arts flick, but not much more.  The acting is better, the scenery is better, but nothing is ""spectacular.""<br/><br/>My score:  5 (out of 10)"

","I find it funny that most of the negative reviews on this board come from people exclaiming that CTHD is worse than the countless other kung-fu movies they have seen. That is where the comparison is flawed. CTHD is not a kung-fu black belt theater film. It has on its surface, kung-fu fight scenes and swordplay and magical powers, but on a deeper level, this epic is a much more complex story. It tells of hidden feelings and search for truth in one's journey of life. It tells of wrong choices made in life and the yearning for freedom and independence. CTHD contains thoughts of societal pressures and the guilt one experiences when trying to please others and not one's self. Of dual indentity, both symbolically as well as literally.<br/><br/>
Sure, the fight scenes are spectacular, but the interplay between the characters and the troubled emotions displayed as they relate and hold back their inner conflict is priceless. CTHD was the best film of 2000."

","The wire work takes a little getting used to; sometimes it seems unintentionally comic.  The times when I was most sold on it where when a character would race up the side of a wall, spinning, the wall suddenly the plane which the ground would have been.  This makes the most sense; if, to whatever degree, we're dispensing with gravity, then why is all of the flying simply up/down rather than on other planes?<br/><br/>That aside, the story is quite good even if I have some reservations about the ending.  That ending probably reads differently to Westerners than Easterners; what we see as a final selfish act might be considered noble halfway around the world.

","Ang Lee has compared this film to an Asian version of his own Sense and Sensibility. Well, yes and no: the film is rich and visually splendid, and the story's structure closely follows the adaptation of Jane Austen's premier novel, but Lee's latest lacks the character depth and heartfelt sentiment that Emma Thompson infused her Sense screenplay with. On top of that, one of Crouching Tiger's main characters (Zhang Ziyi) is a woman devoid of any loyalty and therefore likeability. However, this film has much to recommend it, mostly awe-inspiring martial arts sequences that complement the excellent direction and drama very well.

","Well I can really appreciate a movie like this. This is certainly the way martial arts films are supposed to be like. The fight choreographer must have been some damn good martial artist. He should get a tonne of credit. After I saw this movie, I saw Matrix and it made it look like a slow motion, school yard romp. Not to take anything away from Matrix but this movie's choreography was the best I've seen in a film since older Jet Li movies and maybe even Bruce's movies. Zhang Ziyi was very impressive, not to mention she's a total fox. Michelle Yeoh was phenominal and the only part that I didn't like in the movie was how Zhang's character was able to handle Yeoh's character so easily. To be  more realistic, Yeoh would've mopped the floor with her, in reality and according to what i understand from the story. If they make another one of these, I hope they include Jet Li (which i heard was originally offered the Fat man's role but turned it down), or Donnie Yen from Once upon a time in China 2, Highlander End Game and Iron Monkey. These two are phenominal martial artists and Donnie Yen is highly under rated. Hey maybe they should throw in Bolo Yeung too. I give this film 9/10 cause its great but it's no Fight Club."

","I was terribly slow to get to the theater for this much-heralded Best Picture nominee but was quite pleased to finally see it this afternoon. This film actually seemed a bit too short for the range of locations that it reveals in the course of its convoluted plot.  I was a bit stymied that a tie-in book or novelization hadn't been published to promote this studio release;  generally, I do like to review the original material before seeing the film version.  Several of the director's previous films (RIDE WITH THE DEVIL, SENSE & SENSIBILITY, and THE WEDDING BANQUET) prepared me for his masterful use of ""big"" scenes.      The delightful ""choreographed"" fight scenes evoked the same awe that I felt while viewing the very parallel THE MATRIX.  The highly charged conflicts between the forces for good versus evil were similarly refreshing if highly fantastic and distant from any realistic customary movie. The striking clash of aggressive female leads predominates as the retrieval of ""Green Destiny"" to its male ""owners"" stays in secondary position when all is said and done.      This is a 10/10 film for its superb visual accomplishments.  In a longer version with additional scenes to explain some of the plot's energetic 180 degree changes, the hyperactive attributes would be less taxing.

","I've always thought that a truly good movie would transcend boundaries, and I still believe in that, but CTHD is not one of these films.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that most Asians think it's bad, and Westerners hail it as the greatest movie ever, and it's really funny, because I'm a Singaporean, which means that I am an Americanized Asian. My hair is black and my skin is yellow, but I watch ""Ally McBeal"" and ""American Beauty"". So who's side should I be on??<br/><br/>This point is, that for this movie, there is no side. I love Lee Ang's films (once and for all, it's Lee Ang, for goodness' sake. Chinese people put their surnames in front, so stop Americanizing our names as well), especially Ice Storm and Eat Drink Man Woman, so I've no bias against the director.<br/><br/>
It's just that the topic involved is too ""cultural"" (I can't think of a better way to put it). If you haven't been brought up on Hongkong martial arts flicks, you wouldn't understand why we can't accept this movie in some aspects. I'm Chinese and I know for sure that the dialogue SUCKS! BIGTIME. No Joke. It's like if you watch Quills or The Patriot, you hear sons calling their fathers ""Pa"" instead of ""Father"".<br/><br/>And it's not just the dialogue, it's the pronounciation. Chow Yun Fatt has a Cantonese accent, and Michelle Yeoh has a Malaysian accent, so it's really creepy hearing them speak. I have to look at the subtitles myself sometimes. The only person who doesn't give my that headache was Zhang Ziyi, who obviously is a Mainland Chinese. You have to learn the language before you know what I mean. Unfortunately, Singapore Chinese films have that problem as well.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the battle scenes between the women are great, but the bamboo forest scene?? It is really pretty, that edmerald green and the silent rustle of the leaves, but Chow Yun Fatt couldn't make it. Didn't anyone see him almost slipping after that scene, when he landed on this rock?<br/><br/>And I know some people scratch their heads after watching those flying stances and people being ""frozen"" after being poked on some parts of their bodies, but it's really, all in all, just a Chinese thingy. How come you don't ask yourselves why Superman can fly?<br/><br/>It's a mythical thing, called ""qigong"" which means that these swordmen (and women), are somehow able to channel their ""energy"" to propel themselves into the air, which explains why they have to step on something after sometime, to gather their ""energy"" to propel themselves upward again, unlike Superman, who can fly as long as he wants. They are still bound by gravity, so they can't fly into space.<br/><br/>About the poking thing, it's really very simple actually. The Chinese believe that there are various points on the body which i think controls certain parts of the internal organs. It's like accupuncture, so when you press on a certain point (hard enough, that is) on the body, you trigger a sort of reaction. That explains why they can poke people and make them freeze. You can't just poke anywhere and make them bark.<br/><br/>
So,as you can see, it's really hard for Chinese people to accept an Americanised Chinese flick. We are accustomed to the usual martial arts stuff on TV, so it's hard to change our tastes. Of course, there are Asians who love it and Westerners who slam it, so ultimately, it's up to the person. >"

The story has a plot that is so mindless and stupid the audience I was viewing it with just had to laugh at certain bizarre parts.  It goes like this a young woman is secretly a talented ninja, an older woman is a skilled fighter too, and Chow Yun Fat plays the male lead totally unconvincingly.  They are all either trying to get or protect a special sword and that is pretty much the story.

While I was watching this film I found it exciting but rather slow in between the fight sequences (due to horribly boring dialogue) but by the end I felt ripped off.  If there is one positive thing I can say about this whole bizarre CTHD phenomenom is that when I watched the oscars I had a bad feeling this stupid foreign film might grab best picture because since it took best director at the DGA awards it was pretty much a shoo-in for that category, but when the best director was announced and Steven Soderbergh won I was so relieved, and even better was when the much more complex and exhilarating Gladiator took home best picture."

But there are several sub-plots, including a classic love story, part of which moves the action from densely decorated and crowded sets in the city and palaces to the vast amber-coloured, empty desert. The acting is in a different convention to the general run of American or European movies, being more stilted and formal, but this is soon replaced by exuberant displays of energy, agility and mobility in the fight scenes!<br/><br/>One feature of the movie which has perhaps not received as much attention as it might is that this is a great feminist movie.

","I am thoroughly impressed. It was breathtaking. I came to see Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh -- I am satisfied. What a matching pair -- together they are simple stillness and ""yun"" (Chinese respected virtue of tolerance & restraint) personified. I also discovered the talented Zhang Zi Yi who portrayed Jen -- a pulsating performance! I felt the title ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is very much about her character: one who's seemingly tame (so young and green) on the surface, yet such skills and potential underneath. She is the center of the story being woven. Chow and Yeoh are essentially complementing Zhang -- the influence and outcome of her character Jen. There are revealing life lessons for the impetuous Jen, a cloistered talented one lacking guiding disciplines and worldly ""Giang Wu"" experience. [""Giang Wu"" literally means (heroic warriors) roaming the rivers and lakes]<br/><br/>Director Ang Lee's last film ""Ride With the Devil"" 1999 (with Tobey Maguire in the lead role, also included Jewel, another young female talent discovery) was very much an epic film with sweeping civil war scenes and horseback ridings, integrated with the storyline of exceptional friendships and a bit of romance.<br/><br/>In ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", there are multiple levels of friendship depicted and it's more involved on romance, be it subtle or exciting. First off is the mature, quietly understanding relationship between Mudan masters Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien (Chow is a pillar of steadfastness and Michelle gave us the demure dramatic side of her); then there's the fiercely energetic pair of young lovers Jen and Lo; also the conflicting bonding between the weary-beaten Jade Fox and her conceited protégée. Sure sounds awfully complex. Yet Ang Lee unfolds the story in such flowing and serenely exciting rhythms: there are well-designed martial art movements delivered; well-planned photo angles captured -- especially those wide and high aerial (location/scenery) shots that defined transitions; befitting choices of music, be it straight drumbeats, a lyrical piece, or the heart-strings a-pulling cello playing by Yo-Yo Ma, all complemented the exceptional performances from the cast. <br/><br/>Sony Picture Classics, once again, gave us a rewarding film to relish and enjoy. It's a definitively well-made film. Bravo to all involved in this productionthe three screenwriters and all! <br/><br/>While Jackie Chan's "" The Legend of Drunken Master"" 2000 USA, a martial arts film (about Wong Fei Hung) full of amusing moments and actions, is successful in pleasing the audience on a less cerebral level, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is successful in its artistic integration of dramatic storytelling and superb martial art movements on a just as entertaining level, with suspenseful moments and climatic scenes one after another. They are different yet both worth seeing -- both demonstrate appreciation of the martial arts.<br/><br/>Along the lines of worth seeing Chinese films (with depiction of Chinese women's status), ""Genghis Khan"" is not to be missed. It's an epic film about the glorious legendary figure in Chinese history, and it's very much a story about Khan's mother being the staple strength behind his successful career; plus the photography of the battle scenes are artistically rendered in painterly soft hues -- retaining the sensitive strength of the script. Another must see if you appreciate filmmaking."
"stavros-13","Null","0","0","16 July 2000"," good and bad
","This movie was both good and bad. I thought the storyline was rather weak and hard to understand, as there were too many plot holes and unneeded scenes and characters, such as the police inspector, as the influence he had on many characters was short lived. The ending was lousy as it did not resolve many things. Chow-Yun-Fatt showed the same expression on his face during the entire movie, even when he gets hit. And the way he spoke to Michelle Yeoh's character in the first bit of the movie seemed like he had rehearsed his lines once. And as the story unfolds, Chow Yun Fatt's character seems so insignificant to the storyline, which looked like it was centering around Ziyi Zhang. On the good side, the fighting scenes and sword fighting were done well.(Though at one point of the movie the fighting seemed unconvincing.)The cinematography and the scenes when the characters defy gravity and leap incredible distances were breathtaking as well. If you like quick and mind-boggling martial arts, with sword action so fast you'll get blown away, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't."
"SammyK","9","0","0","7 June 2000"," An artful mix of chop-socky and lyricism
","Ang Lee could very well prove to be the most chameleon-like director making films today.  From ""The Wedding Banquet"" to ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""The Ice Storm,"" Lee has consistently opted to pursue a completely new aesthetic and genre with each new film.  And yet, each film retains a unique sensibility that is completely Ang Lee.  With his new venture, a Mandarin-language mythological fantasy starring two top Asian stars, Lee yet again makes a 180 degree turn from his last film.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is exhilarating, utilizing gravity-defying action choreography, exquisite locales and production design, and a plot that grounds the spectacle with convincing character development and motivation.  The cast is strong, no doubt under Lee's supervision, and the result is something fully revolutionary: a kung fu film merged with character based drama. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" if given the chance by its North American distributors, has the chance of being a huge hit with audiences here, and deservedly so.  The mythological lyricism and genuine pathos gives this film an edge that the clinical and somewhat forced ""The Matrix"" never had."

About 45 minutes in I realized that not only had I given up on the film being anything extraordinary, but I had in fact become bored. I glanced around the theater to other movie-goers. To be honest, I couldn't get a good read on the theater audience. I will say that no one looked as bored as I did.

Being a martial arts movie fan, I've seen loads and loads of them, and this was going to be the film that proved chinese cinema to be just as good as hong kong cinema, and possibly even hollywood. What a disappointment. I absolutely hated this film, completely and utterly. Is it good when films are rubbish? seemingly all the film critics think so.<br/><br/>The first 5 minutes started terribly, with pathetic floating around like ponces. I was cringing my head off during all the flying sequences, they were so terribly done it wasn't even funny. I mean, if they had given some sort of explanation as to why people can fly and jump miles and walk on water, then maybe I would have liked it more; but no, I know, we'll just start flying for no reason.<br/><br/>Arg, in so many chinese films people can jump really far and run across long grass and such, but they don't float, and they actually make an effort to jump. The bar scene, being the most cringeworth of all, even sees Zhang zi yi take off on one foot without jumping at all and fly out through the roof. Good luck attempting that.<br/><br/>The fighting that wa supposed to be amazing turned out to be okayish, but the wires were seriously overused and made it seem tacky and laughable.

","The one thing this movie has over the average martial arts film is the cinematography. There is a lot of beautiful scenery and they show it. Other than that, it's pretty typical stuff for the genre - revenge motive, lots of fights, and unfortunately lots of flying. The flying is neat the first time you see it; It's really old by the twenty-fifth time. It's a gimmick like the camera gimmick in the Matrix. The plot is very average. I have to wonder if the people fawning over this thing have ever seen a martial arts movie before. They're all like this. Martial arts movies were quite popular in the US back in the 1980s, so it's no big deal that there's still one being shown here. Sure, most of the American ones were absolute crap, but if you really delve deeply into the genre, and don't mind reading subtitles, there's some truly spectacular stuff out there. Stuff that makes this movie seem like an unimaginative run through the clichÃ©s in comparison.<br/><br/>Martial arts films are full of strong female characters, many of the movies have absolutely startling cinematography, there's always an ending that fans of Hollywood blockbusters wouldn't expect, the characters are most often consumed with internal conflict, etc. <br/><br/>As far as the fighting in this movie, it's not bad. Nothing compared to a Bruce Lee film - nothing at all - but at least it's not silly like so much of the Jackie Chan slapstick stuff these days. <br/><br/>Overall, if you think this movie is great, boy, are you ever lucky, because you've just discovered a genre in which movies like this one are only slightly above average.

Unless you regard it as that you may be disappointed.  It's really a ""chick flick"" in many respects: the male characters are only silhouettes while the females are three dimensional and more.  Still, there are motivations here that remain a mystery and you will leave the theater discussing them.

"bob the moo","Null","2","5","26 February 2002"," A beautiful story of good v's evil and unrequited love
","When a mystical sword is stolen it sparks a quest to find the thief, who may or may not be the mysterious Jade Fox.  This not only causes the unrequited love between Master Bai and Yu Shu Lien to be further postponed by duty, but also signals the development of Jen Yu and her romantic discovery.  As the identify of the thief is gradually revealed a showdown looms with both Bai and Lien representing the good and the thief representing evil.<br/><br/>A wonderful film in that it managed to make a whole generation of multiplex-only movie watchers that not all good things only come out of America.  However there is much to enjoy in this film that still will have been lost on such an audience.  The film mixes a raft of subplots around the main focus of the theft of the sword.  However we also have the development, romance and envious greed of Jen Yu, the conflict between Yu and Yu Shu Lien and of course the love between Master Li Mu Bai and Lien that has been put off due to duty.<br/><br/>The stories all work well - the mystery surrounding the stolen sword and the search for Jade Fox make for a compelling mystery while the romance between Master Bai and Lien is beautifully observed throughout.  The story surrounding Jen Yu is very good as it follows her development throughout however her desert romance is perhaps a little too slow for a martial arts movie.  The only complaint about the stories is that they are a little heavy for a martial arts film - or maybe there is too much fighting for a well plotted movie?  Actually it's probably a brave mix that has some of the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>The martial arts action is sensational - Yuen Wo Ping excels himself with one stunning visual treat after another.  The wire work is great even by Hong Kong standards - imagine the impact this had on an audience who thought that wire-work had been invented by the Matrix!  The standout scenes are the battle between Lien and Jen Yu and the Jen Yu's battle in a crowded barroom. The only complaint I did have is that the treetop fight near the end was not as exciting as other scenes and was also the least realistic and came across as silly at times.  In terms of visuals, the film is beautifully shot and picks up the gorgeous Chinese landscape well - the only problem being that this seems to distract from the main story.<br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh is as impressive and as beautiful as she is in everything else I've seen her in - you can keep your Julia Roberts rom-coms, I want more of Yeoh's acting talents rather than pure star power.  Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as Master Bai and he works well in his scenes with Yeoh.  He even manages the martial arts really well despite not having made one before but I would have liked to see first choice Jet Li in the role.  The standout is Zhang Ziyi in only her second film.  She shines in the most difficult character and manages to convey so much and still be excellent in complex fight scenes.  And how does Hollywood reward her? By sticking her in Rush Hour 2!  That's like taking a beautiful flower and trying to plant it in the middle of a concrete slab!<br/><br/>Overall it's a little slow for the martial arts crowd but it is a wonderful mix of Lee's art house films and the martial arts genre.  At times the mysticism gets a bit too heavy to be truly meaningful but it's an exquisitely beautiful piece of filmmaking."

It is something that you will remember for eternity.

","I thought this would be a martial arts movie with adventures and such. What I got was unrealistic fighting scenes with people flying about. Now, I normally don't have a problem to suspend my disbelief, and accept things like that in a movie or TV series. When I saw Mists of Avalon, I accepted that there was some magic in it, like when the priestess could control the fog and such, and when I watch the X-Files, I accept all the ghosts and supernatural stuff, likewise when I watch Buffy. So how come I had such a hard time accepting the flying and levitating in this movie? I think there are two reasons: 1) I thought it would be a movie set in this universe without altering the laws of physics too much, and 2) It was sometimes all too obvious that they used wires. After a while, the levitating was simply so much that I did accept it as some form of magic, otherwise I couldn't have kept watching it. But, even after deciding this, I still thought the movie was simply too long and boring. I'm sorry, but that became the biggest problem for me after a while."

I won't say it was too predictable (which was one of the movies only redeeming qualities), but it was pretty bad when they fell in love after knowing each other for about 2 days.  Also, the part when she stabs him and then they start rolling around on the bed was atrocious.  I know a lot of people have complained about the flying, so I might as well do it too.  The Matrix had reason for flying (computer generated world), but this movie, NO WAY!  I didn't like the way they flew along a perfectly radiused curve; even though there wasn't a visible wire, I couldn't help but see where it would be.  After checking my watch approximately 20 times before the end of this abomination I was surprised to see the amount of positive comments on it.  I think the scenery in the movie was great, but that doesn't make a great movie, it makes great photography.  I think the choice of subtitles over dubbing was bad because it forces you to keep your eyes on the bottom of the screen and read instead of watch what's happening.  Now I'll add an immature comment to show how much I hate this movie:  they should have called it Crouching Tiger, Homosexual Dragon.  I wouldn't see this movie again unless a large sum of money were involved, even then I'd be leery.

Subtlety is not part of Lee's palette; he is going for something grand and melodramatic, and that's what he gets. The hallmark of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is its standout action sequences, of which there are five or six (depending on how you count).

"Innsmouth_Apprentice","9","1","2","31 March 2011"," A pinnacle of visual storytelling.
","This is a martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies (I am one such person). The name of CTHD refers to a Chinese metaphor for someone hiding their strength. That is exactly what the protagonist of the movie is notorious for.<br/><br/>This protagonist is a teenage girl from a high-ranking official's family. Her name is Jiao Long, which literally translates to ""Little Dragon"". They call her ""Jen"" in the popular subtitle versions and the dubs, but just be aware that that Westernized version is not her actual name. I suppose ""Jen"" was picked both to evoke a sense of familiarity, and because ""Jiao"" starts with a consonant that's pronounced both like a ""J"" and ""Sh"", so it's deemed to be confusing for Westerners. But you'll pick up on this when you watch the subtitled version - you'll read ""Jen"", but clearly hear them call her by her real name (""Jiao Long"").<br/><br/>(Incidentally, subtitles are best way to watch non-English-language movies - too many crucial intonations get lost and twisted in dubbed versions. Watch this with subs. Your mind can keep track of two things at once, trust me.)<br/><br/>Right, so Jiao Long, played by the beautiful, graceful (lengthy dancing practice in childhood), and passionate Zhang Ziyi, is outwardly a good daughter, but secretly a complete rebel. The last few years she's been studying a Wu-Tang manual on martial arts, and, unbeknownst to those around her, achieved amazing results with it. When fate (with a bit of help from Jiao herself) brings her together with two renowned martial artists and warriors, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Jiao Long is extremely eager to confront these two living legends in combat - to show off, prove something to herself... and ultimately gain that precious thing - a clear purpose in life.<br/><br/>Here I come to the main strength of the movie, for me, at least, which is why I've rewatched it quite a few times: it is sublimely and complexly philosophical. We have a girl in turmoil, struggling to choose her values, morals, path in life. Most of us will recognize these processes and empathize with them. The interesting thing is that as she looks to the ""adults"" around her, particularly Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, she discovers (and helps them discover) their many own flaws and insecurities. They seem sure and confident, but beneath the surface you see the same feeling of being puzzled and dissatisfied, searching and not finding, living by a principle and ending up disappointing in it.<br/><br/>The second strength is the fight and action choreography. Unlike those other nonsensical MA movies (like the Chinese Jet Li flicks and the army of Jet-Li-flick clones) which stuff your face with flight scenes and while-in-the-air tricks, CTHD's action feels more real even though it employs many of the same tricks. It just does it so much more tastefully, selectively, and to the point.<br/><br/>The overall visual direction and the sets are beautiful. The story rolls along at a satisfying pace, and the gorgeous backdrops and decorations aren't overdone or covering up a lack of meaningful plot, like in those House-of-Daggers-Hero-type films. Oh yes, and the music is very tasty.<br/><br/>Zhang is a joy to look at every moment of the movie, and the rest of the cast fit the bill perfectly. Not overacting, not being bland - just right.<br/><br/>A unique masterpiece."

","Ang Lee is no ordinary director. He brings out his characters with great emotion and depth that makes you care about the story, plot line and knows how to use subtlety to his advantage.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is perhaps one of the most beautiful and interesting movies I've ever seen in my life and is definitely in my list of favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>The storyline of the film deals with four main central characters who each represent a different sort of perspective on society and situation in life. Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh)is a strong warrior but has had to sacrifice personal love in the face of tradition and honour. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is a famous warrior who longs to lead a life of peace but has one more score to settle to avenge his master's death. As the two secretly love each other but remains taboo, they long for a more peaceful life away from the bloodshed.<br/><br/>Enter Jen Yu (a stunning Ziyi Zhang) who has a fascination with the martial arts world. A rich bureaucrat who is about to enter an arranged marriage, she longs for a more fascinating lifestyle where she can be free to do as she pleases. However, her view on the world is vastly different from Lien and Mu Bai's. Her extreme fighting capabilities have turned her into a sort of rebellious girl who longs to lead the life she truly wants, especially with a desert bandit she is in love with named Lo (Chang Chen).<br/><br/>CTHD deals with not only the world of martial arts but also the emotions of the characters which is a very huge plus in this genre. Sure, you have some conventional plot lines such as avenging a master's death but Ang Lee keeps the focus on the characters. At times, the martial arts aren't the main focus here and it is the character development and the story that you really care about - but it is great that the action scenes are just breathtaking.<br/><br/>The performances are terrific. Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat look great together and make the performances very believable. Ziyi Zhang is just stunning and brings a combination of beauty and danger to her role as the feisty young princess. What is terrific about the film is that you really need to invest emotionally with the characters in order to fully understand the meaning of the film. In particular with the ending, if you don't get it then it just means that you didn't feel what the characters went through and the meanings behind their actions. <br/><br/>In a lot of ways CTHD is a very spiritual film. It deals with many themes such as repression, freedom, the longing to love and the expectations of a society where the rules don't always fit us. The cinematography I might add is stunningly beautiful and really adds a lot to the film. A lot of the landscape also seems to add a lot of energy into the film and bring some visual imagery as though the landscape itself represents the freedom of the soul, in particular the desert.<br/><br/>The action scenes have the characters floating in mid air and flying, walking on water and flying through the trees. To many people this might seem ridiculous but I took this as a dream. This film is essentially a fantasy though the characters feel real. It is just amazing to see these scenes. I am sure that Chinese audiences are already accustomed to such scenes and I have seen some of these things before but the way it is done here is just so elegant and beautiful it just takes your breath away.<br/><br/>Ang Lee always has that ability to make you invest emotionally with the characters in the story. He knows that the complex emotions that occur in the story are what is important at the core and heart of a film and that is what makes such great films so memorable. However, CTHD also offers fantastic action as well and is also very romantic at the same time.<br/><br/>I can not recommend this film enough.

","There's a telling moment towards the beginning of the movie. Shu Lien is riding through the crowded streets of Peking, when her eye is caught by a little girl forced to perform tricks for the crowd -- holding a stack of bowls on her head, while lifting her legs over her shoulders. We've only Shu Lien's lingering, inscrutable glance that tells us that this woman warrior is seeing herself in this little girl -- and will soon see another trapped performer: Jen.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's direction is, at times, achingly beautiful, but without the obvious self-awareness of Wong Kar Lai's shots. He lays out each scene so that the positions of the window, the table, the characters seem almost incidental and paratactic -- but it's also inconceivable that they should be any other way. I have seen it, Lee seems to say, and I am laying it out for you as a precise offering.<br/><br/>The precision allows for an incredible number of ""issues"" and ""subplots"" to bubble beneath the surface -- which ranges from detective story (who stole the sword?), revenge drama (Li Mu Bai's master), to romance. But the underlying core is, as with all of Ang Lee's films, the tension between different orders of life, and how that resonates with each of the characters. Take the story of the film's arch-villain, Jade Fox, for example. Ostensibly she desires power -- killing the head of Wudang to gain the kung fu manuals -- but what undoes her is her longing for family, the core of Confucian values; she sees Jen as her daughter, sister, even spouse; the betrayal she feels when Jen turns to Li Mu Bai motivates her vengeance and downfall. That Jade Fox, the character on the farthest fringes of society, should embody so much desire for traditional values (framed by the irony of her serving as Jen's family ""nurse"" for so many years) creates a subtle circularity that feels strangely Buddhist. Indeed, the ""letting go"" stressed by Buddhism informs both the characters and Ang Lee's direction: Jen lets go of her ego and purges herself in that final act of sacrifice; Li Mu Bai releases his own ego by trading his life for a too-late confession of love; and Lee, by drawing on the wordless ballet of martial arts choreography and stunning shots of the Chinese landscape and subtle, unforced character studies, allows the film to breathe and become the masterpiece that it is."

","Master Li Mu Bai is a lawman, traveller, soldier who fights evil, battles Injustice and does general daring deeds. He returns to the city and meets Shu Lien, his dead brother's wife who has long since been in love with. However, he returns with good news, he is hanging up his sword, the Green Destiny, up for good and seeking out the supposed simple life. However, in this tragic, action drama, nothing is simple as the sword is stolen by a mysterious warrior.<br/><br/>As Li Mu Bai's nemesis the Jade Fox returns Li Mu Bai knows that he will have to face his nemesis one last time if he is to succeed in attaining the life he yearns for without bloodshed, knowing that all of his efforts where not in vain. However, as Jen Yu, a young woman about to enter into an arranged marriage, is entering a period of emotional instability, it means that every character in this immense film is in more danger than they realise. In Ang Lee's colossal film these themes take on the power of Gods as every hidden emotion, every glance, every movement and every gesture takes on further meaning.<br/><br/>The direction is amazing and the entire film is beautiful to behold, and having sen it at the pictures three times, believe me, I know. The costumes, the cinematography and props are fantastic and every craftsman who spent time on this film deserves an award for their efforts. The acting is first rate with all three leads being unbelievably awesome. usually at this stage I feel the need to single someone out, but I can't! They're all excellent and it makes for a film that is impossible to tear your eyes away from.<br/><br/>That said it does take a few scenes to get used to the whole wire work stuff in there and I remember when I first saw it I thought ""What the hell is this?"" But by the time I was half way in, I didn't care. <br/><br/>The fight scenes of course are the things that give the film its action heart and they are incredible, with a number of multi-character fights that must have been tortuous to put together, but the best one being the one with the two women with the variety of weaponry that is so gripping and so violent as they really seem to go at t with hatred and vengeance so strong that they really seem to want to kill each other. This is no ""Charlie's Angels"" bullsh*t fighting, this is the real deal.<br/><br/>It was annoying at the time that the film was beaten at the Oscars to the best picture and Best Director nods by Gladiator and Traffic as both of these films, for me, have faded, while the things that make this film great, still make it great now, but I guess that's due to the fickle nature of the academy voters. However, it is pleasing that it's in the top 250, but sad that it's so far down.<br/><br/>Sumptuous and Sublime!<br/><br/>Em"

","""Sense and Sensibility"" director Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has achieved what no other 19th century Hong Kong martial arts costume epic has ever accomplished in the history of motion pictures. Not only did action fantasy rake in big bucks at the box office, but it also racked up dozens of cinematic awards, including four Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Original Score, and Best Foreign Language film, in addition to being nominated for Best Picture and Best Director. Lenser Peter Pau walked off with four awards for his marvelous cinematography, and Hong Kong critics honored Woo-ping Yuen for Best Choreography as well as Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Director. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is surely the most honored martial arts masterpiece of all time, at least for the time being and combines art-house prestige with plain, old-fashioned, slam-bang, kick-butt melodrama. Moreover, in America, Ang Lee has succeeded with his critically acclaimed film of presenting the dialogue in original Mandarin language so that audiences had to contend with subtitles. Traditionally, American audiences shun subtitles, but ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" changed that with its unqualified success. Happily, the subtitles rarely exceed two sentences.<br/><br/>Veteran fight choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen of ""The Matrix"" complements Ang Lee's quiet but compelling dialogue scenes with several incredibly kinetic, gravity-defying combat sequences staged with warriors dashing up walls, gliding across rooftops, and clashing swords atop towering bamboo trees. These eye-popping acrobatics enhance an intricately woven yarn about love, honor, intrigue, gender-reversal, and revenge. Ten years ago hyperkinetic antics such as these would have been greeted with derision. Indeed, not sense the Bruce Lee actioneer ""Enter the Dragon"" has a Chinese-language, martial arts film been heralded with so many honors and changed the attitudes of Americans.<br/><br/>Starring Chow Yuen Fat of ""The Replacement Killers,"" and Michele Yeoh of ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" qualifies as a bittersweet but transcendental kung fu spectacle set during the Qing Dynasty. Scenarists James ""Ride with the Devil"" Schamus and Tsai Kuo Jung based their screenplay on Wang Du Lu's romantic novel about the tragedy that dooms two ill-fated couples when a thief steals a 400-year old sword called 'the Green Destiny.' Initially, invincible Wudan swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) renounces the warrior's life. Basically, all Li Mu wants is to hang up his sword and settle down with Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), a fearless kung fu fighter once betrothed to Li's late brother. Each repress the heartfelt love smoldering between them to honor the memory of his slain brother. Visiting Shu Lien, Li entrusts her with delivering his legendary sword to Sir Te (Sihung Lung), an elder who helped them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the provincial governor's daughter, Jen (Zhang Ziyi of ""Rush Hour 2""), reluctantly prepares for an arranged marriage. She admires Shu Lien and envies her maverick lifestyle. Jen neither wants to wed nor has gotten over a torrid love affair with Dark Cloud (Chang Chen), a charismatic desert brigand. No sooner has Shu Lien presented the sword to Sir Te than a masked intruder filches it. Shu Lien pursues the elusive larcenist up the sides of walls in a futile effort to nab the thief, but loses the villain in the darkness. Eventually, Li returns and teams up with her to recover the sword. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ponders the meeting of true happiness. Tempestuous Jen argues you can only attain Shangri-La when you choose who you love and what you want! Pictorially, ""Tiger"" boasts spectacular photography of the Forbidden City as well as the parched grandeur of the Gobi Desert. Longtime Kung Fu Cinema fans will hail the hair-raising heroics, while ardent feminists will applaud the strong, independent women that defy the traditional roles. Ultimately, nobody finds true happiness, except for the audience. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ranks as a landmark kung fu film."

","I won't write a long-winded review because frankly if you haven't seen this film by now, you are not living a full life.<br/><br/>Easily the most beautiful film (next to The Black Stallion and the LOTR series) ever made. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia and this film brings to mind the definition of the word EPIC. Beautiful, breathtaking and superb, it should be a permanent addition to your library.<br/><br/>If you are looking for one of the most fabulously crafted love story combined with amazing martial arts and Oscar worth scenery, this is the film for you. I work in the film industry and I see a lot of movies. I always return to CTHD time and time again for a spirited take on a classic story of unrequited love. The subtle nature of the acting is different from what we in the ""West"" are used to, but it fits. I highly recommend watching it in the original language (I believe it's Hunan, not Mandarin but I'm not sure) with English subtitles as opposed to a version that's dubbed in English. The sound quality is poor on the dubbed film and overruns the fabulous score."

This is the real point of the movie which won the Oscar.<br/><br/>So Ang made a great balance between commercial success and artistic presentation, with, of course, some compromise.

The unreal aspects is taken over by the immense acting talents, the swordplay, the story. Truly deserving of any awards it has received and it really has attracted more world recognition of martial arts, action, drama, wire works intertwined into a one of a kind movie.<br/><br/>It's certainly one of the movies where it creates such an impact just like, star wars or the matrix did on me.

This film deals with suppressed characters who are trapped in their lives by a society that rules over them. The fight scenes are tremendously exciting, the music is addictive as well as great and the story is so rich you want more.<br/><br/>I'll admit, this movie made me weep at the end from the power of its characters, fight for love and its ability to keep you glued to the seat for 2 glorious hours.<br/><br/>Quite, simply, one of the best films ever, and most certainly one of my all time favorites!!!"

","You can bet that when director Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" came out in 2000, that many got to see the martial arts movie in an accessible, wholesome fashion. An adaptation of the works by Du Lu Wang, the film is set in ancient China and concerns two martial arts warriors (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) who are dispatched to retrieve a stolen sword, which leads them to the rebellious daughter (Ziyi Zhang) of a prominent nobleman. More than just a martial arts movie, the film builds on the relationships between the characters and the timely vibe. The action scenes (with choreography by Yuen Wo Ping from his work on 1999's ""The Matrix"") are astounding, and are reminiscent of the old-school kung-fu flicks Lee and us grew up on as children. Certainly one of the most praised action movies of the last 20 years, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has received a lot of attention especially in the United States, from those not used to what Asia has to offer.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Lets quickly pardon the dreadful American/English/Irish/unknown-origin voice dubbing, and strangely unrelated subtitles on the DVD, and cut straight to the chase. This is perhaps the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. Almost every single frame is perfectly composed and lit. The story really is incidental - as is the acting, although the latter is still first-class. Ziyi Zhang is an absolute delight, stunningly beautiful as well as incredibly skilled in her art. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh give highly accomplished performances.<br/><br/>However the real stars of this show are the cameramen and lighting directors, etc etc, who have created a masterpiece - pick a frame and hang it in any gallery in the world. So much craftsmanship is evident here it makes you realise just how bad most movies are. And the martial arts and wire-work on display here are second-to-none, in places quite breath-taking. One can only sit back and admire the skills and the beautiful back-drops. For anyone with an appreciation of film-making this is absolutely essential viewing. Keep a copy handy and admire it at will - and be grateful to the artists who created this modern masterpiece."

","The English title of this movie is really hilarious. ""Wo Hu Cang Long"" is a slang, it actually means ""a true masters (about everything, not only martial art) are pretend themselves instead of being showy."" Maybe ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" sounds more ""chinese"" for Westerners who has a stereotyping about dragons for Chinese people.<br/><br/>Being an Chinese-speaking person who knows more about the culture background about this story, I have discussed this movie with many people in the United States. <br/><br/>I find out most of people appreciate the amazing martial arts and ignore the in-depth analyzing of this story. <br/><br/>If you think this story is only a story about martial art, I think i should ask you guys a question: Woule you only treat The Lord of The Rings as a fairy tale, or City of God as a disturbing film? The whole story deals with betrayal and redemption about Jiao Long's life of martial art under Chinese culture. That is all I can say for people who have never seen this movie.<br/><br/>If you have seen this movie once and love those amazing scenes, I recommend you to watch it again and enjoy characteristics and interactions in that movie; if you have never watched it, I think my comment will be useful for you."

Of course, I knew ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" wouldn't be an ordinary martial arts movie, it had to be more than that. Otherwise it wouldn't have such a high ranking in the Top 250. After seeing the trailer, I really wanted to see the movie as well.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" certainly wasn't a disappointment. The three leading actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and the beautiful Ziyi Zhang gave excellent performances. The story was quite good, although it wasn't the most brilliant story ever. What makes the movie worth watching is of course the several beautiful and amazing fight sequences. The choreography is perfect. Of course, people walking in the sky and stuff like that isn't very believable, but for once I could accept it.<br/><br/>Although it wasn't exactly my favourite genre, I certainly enjoyed watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". The acting is good and the fights are amazing. I have to admit I'm glad it won the Best Picture award, because I liked the four other nominees much more.

","I understand why this film has received such critical acclaim. Aside from Superman leaping tall buildings in a single bound and Neil Armstrong hurdling treacherous moon rocks, when was the last time you saw adults fly? And they're not flying to save the world or to demonstrate a lack of gravity: they're flying as part of beautifully choreographed chase and fight scenes that resemble dance more than combat. (I'd sure like to see a white-suited young John Travolta pulling a few of these moves.) <br/><br/>Crouching Tiger is set in feudal China and exhibits all the features of a well-constructed fairy tale: <br/><br/>* good versus evil <br/><br/>* two sets of star-crossed lovers <br/><br/>* a magic sword <br/><br/>* poisoned darts <br/><br/>* a wrongful death that must be avenged <br/><br/>* a princess being forced to marry before her hair has been folded into the shape of an elaborate jellyfish AND <br/><br/>* a trail of bread crumbs dropped to keep someone from getting lost (the crumbs are, predictably, devoured by starving contestants on Survivor MCMXLVIII: The East Asian Desert)<br/><br/>Although the plot leaves many unanswered questions, the film succeeds because once you accept the fantasy premise, you are drawn into the complexities of the characters. There's Shu Lien, the thirty-something female warrior who has placed her career and a life of service to the forces of Good ahead of her impulses to love and be loved (kind of a Princess Leia). There's Li Mu Bai, male warrior turned monk turned possible ex-monk who is the yang to Shu Lien's yin. You gotta love a guy who engages in full martial arts combat wearing a long, flowing robe (picture a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi). There's Jen, the impetuous, spoiled rich girl with more secrets than the carpeting outside the Oval Office. There's the evil Jade Fox (Darth Jade-r?), also known as the Wicked Witch of the Far East. And last but certainly not least, there's Lo (Han So-Lo?), the outlaw anti-hero who gets more than he bargained for after stealing a comb. <br/><br/>If you learn nothing else from this film, the next time you ambush a royal procession crossing the desert, you will think twice before ripping off any personal grooming objects."

Hitchcock said the 3 things to make a great movie were 'a great script, a great script and a great script'. All of the talented film makers involved in this drivel must have been creaming themselves so heavily in an orgy of self-congratulation that they neglected they were making a movie and less forgivably, being a kung-fu movie, an entertainment.<br/><br/>This dog failed to entertain utterly. Chow Yun Fat is a great favourite of mine and so obviously they ruined it by giving him a character with no character. Same with Yeoh.

I have never been so bored in any film. I have no problem with fantasy and can suspend disbelief (I like LOTR well enough for example) but I do have problems with something that tries to justify its unbelievable nature by being boring. Episodes of Monkey were more engrossing.<br/><br/>A terrible movie, a terrible waste of time and talent. Impressive to those who'd go 'ooh' at a Jean Michelle jarre light show.<br/><br/>Rubbish.

"Sy-4","7","1","2","12 January 2004"," Interesting but overrated...
","An odd film, this: so highly placed in the IMDB Top 250 yet so many negative user comments! I guess you'll either love it or hate it and so the only point in writing anything about it is to help you decide which camp you're going to fall into.<br/><br/>So, on the positive side, most of the martial arts scenes are definitely cool, in an exaggerated matrix-like way. There are plenty of nice touches scattered throughout the rest of the story as well. Without giving anything away, I particularly like the scene where Su Lien demonstrates that she knows who the thief is. The acting of the principals is good. If you're going to see one Chinese movie this year, it might as well be this one.<br/><br/>But on the downside, I can't help wondering how well this movie would have fared if it didn't have the foreign movie mystique. The plot is at times confusing. The intent seems to be to not waste any time on introductions and so catapult the viewer directly into the story, but it's easy to miss things the first time round. The story is also very fragmented and jumps around from place to place without much obvious connection.  Despite this, it also feels very slow. People seem to be willing to forgive these faults in this movie for some reason, though they might pan a domestic movie for the same things.<br/><br/>But probably the worst bits for me are the ubiquitous wire effects. Some people go on about the effortless way in which the main characters seem to float through the landscape. But for me, the main characters are so obviously swinging around on the ends of cables that it completely destroys any feeling of immersion. These effects are almost a parody of bad filmmaking and every time I saw Li Mu Bai being dangled awkwardly over the rooftops, it wrenched me out of the fantasy experience and reminded me that I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>In summary, a flawed classic. Very different from your average Hollywood production, though that in itself does not make a great movie! Some decent martial arts scenes and some good moments. But ultimately too fragmented and slow to live up to its overhyped reputation. <br/><br/>7/10"

Although the fight scenes are stunning, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" also contains beautiful music, breathtaking photography and moments of gentle, melancholic romanticism. I think particularly of the scenes between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh; it isn't often that unspoken love is so perfectly depicted(watch the moment where he presses her hand to his cheek- that may just be the best part in the whole film).

I watched the developing plot with interest and forgave some of the over the top early martial art excesses. Then there came a sequence in which the characters were able to accomplish feats that absolutely defied physics. Ok maybe it is like a dream effect.

There is no humor or speed to it; it's wire-fu simply on the grounds that the style they are portraying is more elegant and thoughtful, with more grace and beauty than a free-for-all, flurry-of-blows kind of fight.  If I want to see gimmicky, fast-paced fighting, I'll go get something more cliché.<br/><br/>5.  General comments:  definitely one of my favorites.  It is a representation of just about the entirety of human emotion in its purest form, yet informative of a culture distinctly alien from our own.  I can't find a single thing wrong with this movie."
"WriterDave","10","1","2","25 February 2003"," Amazing beyond words
","This is one of those films so awe-inspiring and amazing, that no rave review could do it justice.  Encased by a classically mythical story of warriors and heros and lovers and witches in ancient China, Ang Lee gives us the most beautifully choreographed fight scenes ever put to film.  This film has a lot to say about love and destiny and courage.  It has a quiet and ambiguous ending, and rightfully so.  You never thought action and fighting could be so artistic, you never thought myth could be so powerful in film form, and in the end I thought people could fly.  Bravo."
"mjurado","Null","1","2","24 February 2003"," Visually stunning, a timeless fantasy tale
","Mild spoilers.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts fantasy tale set in China in the feudal period. It is the story of the legendary warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and his quest to retrieve his powerful sword from a thief. That provides the setting for a number of subplots, including Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and their forbidden love; the Jade Fox, killer of Li's master and to whom Li owes a debt of revenge; and of course the betrothed but rebellious young noblewoman Jen Yu. Part Shakespearean tragedy and a part fairy tale, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts fantasy film on an epic scale.<br/><br/>The story is a tragic one, in the sense that the plot revolves around the characters' being without what they desire, and tragically seeking it. For example, Li's desire to leave the warrior life and live a peaceful existence. Li and Shu Lien's love is forbidden (and similarly, that between Jen and Lo), because Shu Lien was engaged to Li's master before he was murdered. Li's desire to avenge his master by killing his killer. Jen's (the stunning Zhang Ziyi) desire to live an adventurous life as Shu Lien has.<br/><br/>
The story is told as it might have evolved as it was passed down through generations, a fantasy tale of sorts about an invincible sword and powerful warriors with a supernatural edge. Some may be put off by the jumping abilities of the especially skilled fighters in the film, but it is important to keep in mind that Crouching Tiger is much like a sort of fairy tale. I felt it lent a quiet elegance to the ancient heroes and reinforced in the viewer the idea of how exalted the warrior caste was in the world of the time. <br/><br/>The masterful storytelling aside, it would be impossible to summarize the film without praising the action sequences. The choreography is nothing short of amazing. From the first action sequence, a night battle in a city square and across rooftops, to the best in the film, a confrontation in a dojo between Jen and Shu Lien (with plenty of weapons at hand), the action scenes grab hold of you and don't let go. <br/><br/>The symbolic meaning of the sword is also an interesting latent theme in the film. The Green Destiny, Li Mu Bai's powerful green sword, could be a symbol of the characters' own destinies. Li tries to give the sword away as he leaves the life of the warrior, but is unable to avoid its influence. Jen attempts to sieze control of her own destiny through the sword, and Jade Fox is unable to avoid her destiny, which is the sword in a more literal sense. At a first viewing, the sword seems little more than a prop, but each subsequent viewing brings the viewer to appreciate more the role of the sword in the story and what it might be made to represent.<br/><br/>A triumph of the genre and an instant classic that blossoms more each time I see it. Definitely in my top 5 films, if not my favorite."

","CTHD is one of those age-old films that you either love or hate. Personally, I love it. Not as much as some, but love it nonetheless.<br/><br/>I am a massive fan of HK cinema. I love its dynamism and flair for the slightly insane. CTHD takes all the things I like about the genre and gives it a hollywood rub down. The production values and cinematography are breath taking. The story actually is enjoyable and the dialogue never really seems stunted. Although some would argue that these are exactly the reasons it is inferior to original HK cinema.<br/><br/>The oft-discussed fight scenes are never less than spectacular, with Michele Yeoh really shining alongside Zhang Zi Yi. Although it does make your mouth water to imagine what the film would have been like if Woo Ping had Jet Li to work with as opposed to Chow Yun-Fat. Although I think Li would seem a bit young as opposed to Yun-Fat's almost regal portrayal of a battle weary master.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the film is the loooong flashback sequence. It is the only part of the film which even approaches being dull. While I appreciate it sets up a lot of the story and fleshes out Jens character, It is a bit drawn out.<br/><br/>I would recommend CTHD to almost anyone. It has heart, action and is aurally and visually stunning. I hope there are further releases based on the mythology of this film. The early adventures of Li Mu Bi and Yu Shu Lien would be fantastic (maybe Jet Li this time?) and a peek at the Wu Dan school would be pant wettingly brilliant. High hopes indeed."

","Long after humankind has signed its name in the book of extinctions, our earthly-successors will truly marvel at some of the cinematic landmarks we've produced. In my opinion, ""Crouching Tiger..."" will definitely be one of the titles uttered upon the vocal orifices of these post-homo-sapiens.<br/><br/>The story, set in feudal China, tells of a legendary green blade called the ""Green Destiny"". After the sword's master Li(Chow Yuen Fat) intends to return the sword to its rightful owner, it is stolen by a mysterious assassin. Into this enchanting tale are woven threads of love, passion and pride as Li and his partner Shu Lien attempt to find the assassin.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only rotten tomato that some self-appointed critics have thrown at this cinematic beauty is the non-realism of the characters jumping about, and climbing up walls. Yet to this I pose the following: Since when does a film have to rely on the laws of physics or realism? At the time of writing, the biggest film in the US is about a teenager who can climb up walls, shoot webs and has amazing super-strength after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider. I rest my case.<br/><br/>The character and story depth of ""Crouching Tiger... "" is more than enough to bury any of its Hollywood rivals and its cinematography alone is enough to send Pearl Harbour whimpering away like a canine who just hind-legged an electric fence. This is truly the kind of epic that the mainstream audience have been crying for... one that doesn't feed its audience a pathetic diet of tokenism, patronisation and misplaced patriotism. <br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"Larry-17","10","1","2","20 December 2000"," I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but... Wondrous!
","There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""<br/><br/>In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.<br/><br/>What a film this is.  Everything you've heard is right.  It may not be the most wondrous thing ever...but it is a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart...that also has some absolutely breath-taking action scenes.  ""Crouching Tiger..."", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia!"") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights.  High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in the winds.<br/><br/>In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called ""wire work"" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Washowski's but the choreographer of ""Crouching Tiger..."" also staged the wire-fights of ""Matrix.""  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The guy with whom I saw the advance screening and I...the whole packed-in audience at the big theater at Pipers Alley...burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...  At other moments, I found myself in absolute weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become all drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.<br/><br/>Apart from anything, this is a grand story!  It has passion...love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.<br/><br/>And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in semi-love with her for a long time.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than anything I've seen her in (she was a recent ""Bond Girl"").  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.<br/><br/>The center of the film...remarkably...is a girl who looks to be about 15! Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  I say that she is remarkable because her story is the binding element of the film.  And she holds the film together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both the dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas de deus (okay...did I spell that right?) that frame the conflicts between them.  She is the ""Luke Skywalker"" of the piece, if you will...though ""Crouching Tiger..."" has everything the ""Star Wars"" saga had: excitement, thrills and magic, but here, it is wrapped in those things Lukas film wanted to give, but succeeded in delivering in only the most self-conscious way: heart and deep-placed spirit.<br/><br/>By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood onscreen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the ""Full Peckinpaw,"" if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully!<br/><br/>While there are those who might grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and trick photography...okay...true enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is put in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile burdens of emotions!<br/><br/>So there.    Enough?  Just go see it.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the DVD!  I'll probably see it again, maybe see it twice again, before it hits the home-market."

","Okay, I can understand why so many people like this movie...I think. Granted, it is beautifully filmed and the action scenes are wonderfully choreographed, but does that really make a great film? Let's think about it from a different prespective for a moment...<br/><br/>First of all, I did not care about any of the characters. Whatever love story or feelings there were between Chow Yung Fat's character and Michelle Yeoh's were completely lost. There was absolutely no developing of that subplot. There was no tension, and when it finally came time for Fat's character to profess his love for her, it seemed forced, unnatural and straight-out stupid. Nothing they had done up until that time suggested that they felt that way about each other. It seemed like the filmmakers just wanted to throw in something for him to make a dying monologue out of.<br/><br/>Which is another film, I can't remember the last film that I saw that had so many people with dying monologues. It seemed that every even semi-important character had to go with a long, drawn out speech. JUST DIE, DAMNIT!!<br/><br/>Having said that, the dialogue was incredibly tedious to sit through, the acting/characters was about as three-dimensional as a drawing on a piece of paper. On top of all of this, the story seemed to be forced and (excuse me for saying so) not too original at all. I've seen it a thousand times before, only it was done better than this.<br/><br/>However, the cinematography was beautiful and lush, the action scenes marvelous, the set pieces gorgeous, the theme breathtaking. But all of that is not enough to make up for the lack of story, plot, character development and scripting.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 5 out of 10. It is DEFINITELY not worthy of ""Best Picture of the Year""...not even close. I wasn't expecting much from this film considering all its hype, but I wasn't expecting to be so disappointed either."

The story is set in feudal China and centres around an ancient (even then!) sword that is stolen by person(s) unknown.<br/><br/>Real star of the show is Ziyi Zhang who comes across as a kind of young female Bruce Lee, although somewhat aided by the ability to defy gravity - director Ang's claims that she could not fly, but perform great leaps and falls!<br/><br/>(Sorry Lee - I know flying when I see it!)<br/><br/>The film starts with a murky and talky set-up that introduce us to the three principle characters played by Chow Yun Fat,   Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh. From their talk-talk it seems they have all acquired mystical living and fighting skills although I would not be like to explain the full in-and-outs of it!<br/><br/>Thankfully the silly talking stops and  movie starts to kick-off in earnest when  Zhang is kidnapped on the way to her marriage of convenience. This is where the film really works (as an action movie) and indeed some of the set pieces are classics, although aided and abetted by skilful fly-by-wire work.<br/><br/>I don't understand is why the script wasn't re-written to make the characters background  clearer, their skills highlighted (is Zhang hitting with normal powers for someone of her height/weight or superhuman powers?) and then get the whole show on the road earlier. Maybe I missed a few things while dozing through the slow opening, but I could have done with a bit more help with what follows.<br/><br/>The actors all put in solid performances, although only the doll-faced Zhang climbs above the script. Fat seems to be billed as star of the show - perhaps because he is the only recognised actor - but he features only in passing. Equally curious is that his love for stunt-happy Yeoh seems understated, but perhaps that is the Oriental way?<br/><br/>Plenty of plus points for having strong females characters that hold their own in all aspects of life, but the mystical soup doesn't deliver anything like the classic  some people think they are seeing. The real battle in this movie fights isn't between good and evil, it is between sense and silliness. Sense wins wins in the end, but it is a close call..."

","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the most beautiful and most fulfilling movie experiences in years. I love many films but I can count with one hand the movies that have the subtlety and beauty of ""Crouching Tiger"". What Ang Lee has made is beautiful, wonderful cinema. I'll start with the action and flying scenes, they were absolutely breathtaking, subtle and beautifully coreographed, the flying was like watching ballet in the air, so magical and the fight sequences have to be probably the best fight sequences to be put in film, they are so well done and the movie is so deep that through these fight scenes the characters express their feelings, they're done gracefully and without gore at all. The romance of the characters is beautiful, vivid and full of emotions, the affair between Jen and the bandal Lo was such a breath of fresh air, the flashback scene was wonderful, and the undeclared love of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien was so honorable and pure. The cinematography is wonderful, the forests, waterfalls, lakes, deserts, all look wonderful and so beautiful, this is a visual feast for the eyes. The acting and the characters are amazing, from the wild, independent and ingenue Jen, who is an aristocrat young girl looking for freedom and an exciting life wonderfully portrayed by the beautiful Zhang Ziyi, to the subtle and deeply moving Shu Lien performed by the talented Michelle Yeoh, to the sublime and wise Li Mu Bai played by the terrific Chow-Yun Fat. The story or stories are handled so well, from the theft of the sword, to the love story between the characters, to the master-alumn relationships, to the love-hate relationships, and the revenge plot as well, they're all given the same importance and are wonderfully juggled through scenes. Overall, one of the best films to come in years with the two greatest cinematic moments of the year: The treetop scene and the jump, breathtaking, exhilarating, phylosophical and poetic, with a high touch of magic and inmense beauty, vivid romance and blowing martial arts, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an absolute masterpiece and will be remembered for many years to come.<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! 10/10!!! 5 out of 5!!!

"utepian","2","1","2","26 February 2001"," See 36th Chamber of Shaolin.....
","Crouching.... has great fight sequences, great music, but then I'll stop at that. The fight sequences are few and far in between.  The ""in between"" is really boring. You are once treated to a edge of the seat fight scene followed by long melodramatic scenes.<br/><br/>But that is not the worst part. The story. The story is such typical run of the mill Asian movie fare, it is not even funny. ClichÃ© stuff such as brotherhood/sisterhood, rebellious love affair, revenge, unrequited love, feminism, lofty romantic dialogues (Take a leap of faith and your desire will come true), the lengthy dramatized death of the male protagonist all packaged in the film with no interrelations. The scene in the restaurant although greatly performed, really was there for enticement purposes. Can anybody give me a justification for that sequence or it's bearing with the story?<br/><br/>The Character played by Zhang Ziyi: I could not figure out if I should like her, despise her or sympathize with her. She is brash, she is skillful, but not disciplined. But she doesn't get disciplined even in the end. So I am to assume that although she is undisciplined she can do all the feats of the masters that they have achieved with years of meditation and practice. She realizes Jade Fox is really evil and cunning, but she is mad at Li mu Bai and the character played by Yeoh. She goes from Yeoh's sister to foe before you can read the subtitle (literally one sentence). I could understand what she did not want from her life but I still cannot fathom what she wants in life. She does not want to be a student, something Jade Fox gripes about that she was not given an opportunity, because she was a woman. She does not want the lover she found of her own means. She is really not a protector of the underprivileged masses, she only beats up people who disturb her meal. Can anybody explain to me what she wanted in life?<br/><br/>Character played by Chow Yun Fat: The guy went into meditation and reached a place where there was much disturbance. He realized he needed to avenge his masters death and find Jade Fox. Oh well so much for meditative ways of non violence. So he is back into his role as a warrior. But then why relinquish your weapon. You relinquish your weapon and take up full time meditation or vice versa. How can you do both?<br/><br/>Character played by Michelle Yeoh: We understand women were not trained to be warriors, then where the hell did she get her education?<br/><br/>The movie is typical Asian movie fare where you have piecemeal slices of the various contexts, namely love, action, emotion, etc. Humor was evidently missing from this cliche ridden movie, but I am sure director Ang Lee may have toyed with the idea of pushing a comedian in there somewhere (characters in restaurant and their American football team names).<br/><br/>
The western media and audience do not see very many Asian films and hence the movie looks refreshing. There is a long-established genre in Chinese film and literature called ""Wuxia."" The Wuxia were a class of knights during the time of  Confucius, who in this fantasy-based fiction often have magical abilities like flight (actually more like gravity-free leaps), and speed, reflexes and strength of superhuman levels. Chinese movies about them, called Wuxia Pien, have been made for decades, but few have had the budget or the expected worldwide release that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has had. One of the best movies I have seen in the Kung-Fu genre (and even as a film) still remains (As released in the country that I saw) ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (originally titled ""Shao Lin san shih liu fang""). Yeah, typical kung fu fighting movie, perhaps even lacking in form compared to CTHD, but in terms of content, ""Par Excellence"".<br/><br/>Ask yourself after you see CTHD, if those fight sequences were to be removed and replaced with run of the mill martial arts action sequences, would you still call it a great movie (Love story)? On the other hand if the romance was removed, would it still be a great Martial Arts movie? The two aspects were incongruously placed in the film and overall the story lacked sense and reason. CTHD has been touted as ""Sense and Sensibility"" meets Martial arts. I found it more as ""Sense and Sensibility"" incoherently interspersed with Martial arts. Crouching... is as lousy as it can get. It's characters are uninspiring and the film unlike other Wuxia movies is really spiritually hollow."

By the way this flick is subtitled for those who did not know - like me before I saw it.  So people, for Pete's sake, don't waste your time...go rent a Jackie Chan movie, which at least has some decent plot and has good action sequences.  I'll give it a 4/10."

","Every so often I find myself liking a movie and being forced to point out some of the bad things in it because it is so overrated.  I hate doing that, so I will talk about the good things first.<br/><br/>Great action sequences -- the best martial arts action I have ever seen on film -- and a very good story make this one worth paying to see.<br/><br/>However, the flashback sequence in the middle of the movie was a big mistake.  It went on WAY too long and involved a romantic subplot of little to no interest. This was NOT the interesting love story in the film and these characters had no chemistry together and the young girl was a brat. The real love story of course was with Chow and Michelle -- they were terrific and had great chemistry.  This meandering flashback broke up the movie and took away the hypnotic effect that the film had on me prior to that point.<br/><br/>*spoiler alert* And the other complaint I had was Chow's still wanting to help the young brat (at the end -- before the incredible tree stunt scene) even after she had just tried to kill the love of his life!!!<br/><br/>*end of spoiler alert*<br/><br/>All in all -- a good but not great film."

"da_hal","Null","1","2","30 January 2001"," Good and bad, but don't expect too much
","First of all, after reviewing the other comments before this, I was surprised at the shallowness of most of the reviews.<br/><br/>From a cinematography perspective, the movie is incredible. Ang Lee continues his tradition of beautiful shots. While some people complain about the pacing, as you can see in many other movies, slow pacing is used to build atmosphere and tension. From a western perspective, yes, I also found the movie a bit slow in parts (the whole desert seduction just kept going and going and going,) but from a filmmaking perspective, it is a great achievement.<br/><br/>From a cultural perspective, I found the dialogue incredibly bad, not so much for what was written or the character's motivations for saying what they did, but the delivery. Perhaps in China, you can deliver a dramatic line with no pacing or pauses, but in the west it sounds a lot duller.<br/><br/>As a kung fu film fan, I was most disappointed with the quality of the fight scenes. Perhaps, Lee looked for the best actors, not necessarialy the best fighters.<br/><br/>Also, I am not a big fan of wire-fights. If you watch any of Jackie Chan's movies, or Jet Li's classic ""Fist of Legend,"" you get a true sense of superhumanity, and any wire fights afterwards pale in comparision. (One such incredible actor who will no doubt become a household name in a few years, James Dean Bradley, the white guy in Jackie Chan's woefully underrated and barely released in the US ""Gorgeous,"" is one amazing example.<br/><br/>All that being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing this movie, because the story is so strong. Every character has 2 or three different and competing motivations for every single decision they must make, and the decisions they actually make make their character really come alive with complexity and emotion.<br/><br/>If I would compare this movie to another, it would be John Woo's ""Last Hurrah for Chivalry."" Again, there is a strong story, lots of wire fighting, and good cinematography.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are looking for good fighting, you can wait for the video to see this movie. If you are looking for a good time, then go see it on the big screen."
"Not_a_bit","10","1","2","29 January 2001"," Delightful spiritual journey
","Having seen Ann Lee's some critical films (The Wedding Banquet, The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, and CTHD), I have to say that Lee is a wonderful story teller, whose work needs to be digested slowly.  If you can sit through the developing part of his movie, you will be rewarded greatly at the end.<br/><br/>Thanks to the amazing fight sequences, CTHD doesn't require that much patience to appreciate. However, the fight sequences are not mere show-offs. They come alone with character development. Some of the fight scenes may seem familiar for martial-art movie fans, but I've found more surprises within the stunt fights. Those surprises alone have won my respect and recognition for Ann Lee's talent.<br/><br/>The ending is also beautiful. I personally take it as an emotional outlet rather than literal fact. It makes a perfect circuit of my emotional flow, and that makes me want to see the movie again right after I leave the theater. Luckily I have possessed the DVD now, so I can watch it again and again, every time a delightful spiritual journey."

I am a cultured person and enjoy Good Movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.<br/><br/>Being a film student, I must say this movie smacks of cliche.  There was no emotional drama, no entertaining characters.  I was excited to see this film, and I suppose my feelings toward it are a summation of how far I was let down.  That is to say... It completely SUCKED.<br/><br/>Although, as far as meaningless pieces of tripe go, Crouching Tiger was not the worst.  The action sequences were well played, although the flying was very cheesy.  Admittedly it is apart of the genre's tradition, but that doesn't make it good.  It was like watching a boring episode of a fantasy television soap opera for 2 hours.<br/><br/>On all levels it was pretty much lame.  Characters are forgettable or even hateful, for instance Jade Fox or her protege.  Scenery is nice, though the cinematography was dull and gray.  Action was iffy, split between great sequences to annoying flying and slow motion.  Speaking of action, there is almost none!  There is minute upon minute of bad conversation, were nothing is happening and I'm squirming in my seat thinking how much money I blew, waiting for the next action scene.  This is no way to feel upon viewing a movie everyone is hailing ""epic"".  Don't believe any of these people that tell you different.  This movie is a waste of film.

"ralphdl","2","1","2","15 January 2001"," Video gamers need only apply (spoiler)
","Video gamers and Martial Arts fanatics only need apply.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most overrated film since `American Beauty' was canonised `Best Picture of the Year' by the enlightened press. How anyone other than a video gamer could sit though this Sony Playstation plot and antics is beyond me. Credit must be given to the photography, authentic sets and locations that made this film visually bearable despite the inane story. The otherwise fine actors stumble along in a desperate attempt create a story that someone should care about<br/><br/>Apologists have claimed that this is a magical fantasy and that it must be appreciate it as such. Nonsense, there have been many wonderful fantasy stories. Stories you could Actually follow and really wanted to! and characters that you could care about..... Peter Pan, perhaps?<br/><br/>I could almost accept a world where everyone and their ancestors are martial artists and a couple of amazing leaps here and there, but the constant flying was beyond ridiculous. Not only was it overdone, it was done badly.  Great, they digitally retouched the wires, however what about the peaks on the backs of the characters shirts where the wires were attached ?!  Even though the wires were not showing in the treetop scene, they might as well have been there the way they the actors  swayed back and forth.<br/><br/>Although this movie had the look and feel of `Ju Dou' and `Raise the Red Lantern' it essentially was just a kung fu movie with overly choreographed fight scenes and video game special effects.  The most ridicules scene is after Li Mu Bai's fight with Jade Fox. He is mortally wounded by one of the many poison darts from the phalanx of darts shot at him by Jade Fox.  He manages to deflect all but one of these, of course, with his super human sword play.<br/><br/>` There is an antidote,' says Jen `but it will take time to prepare it.'<br/><br/>There was obviously no time to waste so Yu Shu Lien offers `take my horse!' and away Jen gallops.  Throughout the entire movie she has been flying over the tops of buildings and treetops and now 'away she goes,' to save Li Mu Bai's life...on a horse!<br/><br/>If this movie was a cerebral attempt at a Martial Arts movie, I'll catch some reruns of Kung Fu on TV. Maybe I'll just indulge in some down and dirty Bruce Lee films or Patrick Swaze in `Roadhouse'.(I hear it's on TV for the fifth time this week).<br/><br/>In the meantime, I think I'll play some Mortal Kombat or Final Fantasy IX with my 15 year old son and it won't cost me 17 bucks."
"the red duchess","8","1","2","10 January 2001"," Quality, tasteful, restrained film-making.
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' certainly exudes 'quality' beauty, from the miraculous recreation (or has the country simply not changed?) of turn of the century China, and the relentlessly symmetrical compositions, the immovable grid against which the characters struggle to express their humanity, to the expansive Tan Dun score, which matches Hollywood in scope, but manages to avoid sentimentality and overly crass commericalism, probably through the melancholy Yo-Yo Ma cello solos which give this film its distinctively downbeat atmosphere, unusual for any kind of action movie, never mind the usually exuberant martial arts genre.<br/><br/>This is in keeping with what we expect from Ang Lee - these aren't carefree heroes he gives us, but weary warriors, disenchanted with the false mythology that has grown around their caste, paralysed by emotional repression imposed by stern codes that seem increasingly irrelevant or inadequate.  In this, it is like 'Gladiator', and it shares with that 'film' an overall sombre stateliness with frenetic spurts of action.<br/><br/>Of course, this is only a superficial comparison - whereas 'Gladiator' was a glorified computer game, 'Crouching' reeks with authenticity, a sympathy with and understanding of Chinese culture (society, rites, philosophies etc.), of human nature, of the influence of culture on human nature, the impact of tradition; everything 'Gladiator' revealed about Roman society and culture could have been gleaned from a Steve Reeves outtake.<br/><br/>This is what gives the film, which has a surprisingly simple plot, considering the genre, its satisfying depth and texture - one never feels that it is simply generic.  But this is also the film's flaw (besides the fact that I'm not really into solemn stateliness), one that it shares with Lee's last film, 'Ride With the Devil', which was another attempt to humanise, de-cliche an action genre, the Western, and which succeeded so well that one sometimes wondered where the entertainment had gone to.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, 'Crouching' is very entertaining.  The action scenes are simply magical.  One of the cliches about a certain kind of action cinema is that it is balletic.  For instance, Sam Peckinpah.  But in Peckinpah's films, the action itself is not balletic, just men standing around shooting each other; it is the rhythm created by montage and composition that creates this feeling of dance.<br/><br/>'Crouching' is truly balletic, or dance-like; the exhilirating physical verve within a set of precise, expressive movements gives the film the same sense of controlled improvisation as a Gene Kelly routine.  These aren't just fights, but rigorously timed dances, each contrary move complementing or developing the previous, so that the potential chaos of the content - fighting, flying, fleeing etc. - is beautifully harmonised by the form, as you would expect from Lee.<br/><br/>The camera is as liberated and controlled as the warriors; in one astonishing scene it follows a falling victim of Jen Yu down the top of a restaurant to the ground floor and continues to record the action with fleet energy, giving it an  almost supernatural, non-physical power.<br/><br/>As Li Mu Bai says, there is no desire without restraint.  But sometimes there's a little too much restraint.  Sometimes you just want to escape the suffocating honorability of Li and Yu, and revel in the tyro delirium of Jen, whose undisciplined energy is a constant, sensual joy, one sequence as beserk as a brawl in a Western.  You know with Lee you will never trespass the bounds of taste, never reach the obscure, psychedelic audacity of 'A Touch of Zen', or the sheer silliness of 'The Dead and the Deadly', where the hero is turned into a slug.<br/><br/>Sometimes, such as the astonishing airborne fight in the bamboo trees, or the 'Fantomas'-like plot involving a masked stranger and a villainess called Jade Fox (the film is fundamentally conservative, and yet sympathetic to its lesbian-feminist transgressor), or the 'Winchester 73'-like abstracting of the plot by having a weapon as the film's true hero, or the remarkable extended flashback sequence where Jen meets the barbarian Lo, you wish that Lee might push it a little further, might leave tastefulness behind just for a moment and do something daft.  But he always pulls back, as his story and characters demand.  For better and worse, this is exactly the kind of martial arts movie you would expect the director of 'Sense and Sensibility' to make."

","Critically acclaimed, with most pros falling over themselves to praise this thing, this movie just isn't all that spectacular. Chow Yun-Fat is underused, although it's nice to see Michelle Yeoh so much. Zhang Ziyi is amazingly pretty, matched nicely with the appropriately hunky Chang Chen, and hey she can swing a sword.<br/><br/>The wire work doesn't work for me at all. I much prefer Jackie Chan jumping through a ladder, i.e. stunt work, to this magical floating up walls business, i.e. special effects. The set piece up in the bamboo trees didn't move me one bit.<br/><br/>Narratively, this thing is all over the map. There's a complicated plot, too daft to recount, that's supposedly intentionally silly, but it's silly just the same. There's tiresome flashback which still fails to explain why Jen Yu is so annoyingly selfish; she remains unredeemed by her attempt at redemption at the end.<br/><br/>Sir Te sums it all up when the Green Destiny is stolen for the second (and feels like nineteenth) time.

These action interludes begin and end with little or no reason in themselves, and have no purpose whatsoever in advancing and story or plot. In the tradition of these Hong Kong style exercises in martial arts, there is much fierce striking and slamming of body parts with no apparent harm done to the participants, except on the rare occassion when a character has to die for story purposes.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the photography and choreography are not hard to watch throughout; but even before its two-hour running time expired, I found myself hungry for a real action film."
"Giac","3","1","2","4 January 2001"," Certain to appeal to the elitists
","The movie did have gorgeous scenery.  That is all I liked about it.  But the movie is sure to appeal to the elitists among us, who are more refined and cultured than the common herd.  They will like the fact that the characters have unrealistic, but nobler and ""finer"" motivations than the rest of us. Most of us would not spend a lifetime apart from someone who loves us, simply because they were once betrothed to a friend who died, but that's because we're crass and human, not god-like as 2 of the main characters were.  (Li does admit in the end that he wasted his life - my favourite scene in the movie.)<br/><br/>Most of us would not go around attacking everything around us simply because we want to be free, but Jen exists on a higher plane than us mere mortals. Taking this a little further, Lien likes Jen instantly, even though the girl is constantly attacking her, has stolen a very valuable sword, is associated with a mortal enemy, and constantly puts down the man she loves.  Once again, most of us would probably dislike her, but we don't operate in the clouds like Lien.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are utterly ridiculous and probably admired because they come from the east.  If a Hollywood movie had people running up walls, etc., I have little doubt that it would be roundly panned.  Personally, I found them really boring, like watching 2 perfectly matched buzz-saws. <br/><br/>
All in all, as far as the overall movie was concerned, I couldn't help thinking that I was watching the cinematic version of Dungeons and Dragons. But that's probably because I'm a mundane human with no aesthetic sensibilities.<br/><br/><ul><li>Jack</li></ul>"

Crouching Tiger is really an enhanced bad chinese romance movie with an additional 10 minutes of stupid effects through trees including one funny part with the swords getting cut in half.

The movie has some of exceptional special effects, that you have never seen before. The photography and choreography are also exceptional and the music is amazing, it really matches the atmosphere,scenes and feelings between the different characters.<br/><br/> The plot concerns around the fateful decision of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) to retire his trusted warrior's weapon, the Green Destiny, a sword that has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. But one day the Green Destiny is stolen and they begin to discover that the sword may be in the hands of Jade Fox, the notorious warrior who killed Li Mu Bai's master. And then they start the pursuit of her and whats soon to be discovered as her student.<br/><br/>You must remember that this movie is nothing like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies. Here, martial arts are used to underscore the emotions of the story. Whenever the characters are filled with anger, love, hate, jealousy or joy you can expect to see those emotions displayed artfully through combat.There is a great deal of fighting, but little blood or gore. I guarantee that the fighting scenes in this movie is the most spectacular you have ever seen.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the most wonderful movies I have seen, and the movie takes place in a decade in chinese history that is very facinating and beautiful.

The characters are floating and flying because the China portrayed in Lee's film is a place full of wonder, tradition, and mysticism.  Remember, this was based on a book so Lee was most likely interpreting the author's ""flying"" the best he could.  Besides, it's Lee's film, he can do whatever he darn well pleases.  If you can do better, then please, by all means re-make this movie, I will watch it. Anyway, on to the film.  Beautiful in every detail.  The choreography, cinematography, and all the other -ographies were superb.  The acting was appropriate to the movie (Michelle Yeoh, Chow-Yung Fat, and Ziyi Zhang are stand-outs). The action sequences are awesome (especially the courtyard scene between Yeoh and Zhang) and the flying scenes are breathtaking (my favorite is the treetop scene between Zhang and Fat). On the surface, it appears to be an attractive martial arts movie.  But underneath the surface, it is SO much more.  It is a love story, a story of revenge, a tragedy, an artistic vision.

It seemed to be inserted rather than part of the flow.<br/><br/>Superb film score!<br/><br/>Overall, I'm surprised just how good a Martial Arts movie can be when characters are so strong in-depth."

","Wow, the Crouching Tiger backlash has well and truly begun, I can't believe some of the stuff I've read knocking this film.  People who knock this film because there are people flying just haven't got a clue this film is not a historical epic, it's a fantasy film set in mythical China.  And fantasy doesn't mean childish who said that adults have to only like realism films and anyway the relationships between the characters in this film is as real as any film out there.  And just as bad as the `what people don't fly, this is rubbish' crew are the `I've seen loads of better Martial Arts films then this' brigade.  Maybe you have but this wasn't loved because the great fighting alone it was loved for the whole package the fact that character and plot had as much if not more importance then the fighting, that's what was revolutionary (but I doubt it was the first).  But the fact that the film was a huge hit should be admired by the Martial Arts snobs because maybe it will influence a lot of those films to have more plot which would make the whole genre much better.  I only watched CTHD because someone told me it was good and I had heard all the critics praise and to be honest I thought I was going to see an okay film.  But after seeing it I was blown away, not by the action great as it is, but by the characters and plot. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are wonderful but the real star is Zhang Ziyi who is fantastic as the troubled Jen.  The ending is really terrific and emotional and probably my favourite part of the film.   And for me the two best fight sequences are the first Jade Fox fight (I love the way Chow Yun Fat smirks when he easily knocks her down), and the second is when Jen takes on all the fighters in the tavern.  <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a great film because I never believe in Hype but this film for me is one of the only films in history that deserved every bit of praise it got, but of course it's not going to be for everyone.  So those that like adventure and romance just open your mind to the mythical China setting lay back and watch one of the greatest films of all-time. 10/10"
"eternitti","2","1","2","22 June 2001"," One of the most over-rated, over-hyped pieces of trash ever made
","I can't believe I paid $5.50 to see this movie. I was told the acting was good, the plot was great and it had the best action scenes ever made. Well, two out of three may not be bad, but one out of three is. I'll give them this much. The acting was pretty decent. However, I was highly disappointed with the plot and action. The action wasn't even that good. There were just two mediocre action scenes. There was that scene in the bar, but I know I've seen similar bar scenes before. The other decent action scene was the fight between Jen and Michelle Yeoh's character.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty unrealistic and shallow. Sure, it was more of a character film, but the characters felt cliched. Chow Yun Fat is about to retire, but has to go on one last mission. Yeah, like that hasn't been done before. Chow Yun Fat's acting was decent, but his character was pretty shallow. So was every other character.<br/><br/>The plot didn't keep you on the edge of your seat. Some scenes were pretty predictable. I hear most of the people complimenting Crouching Tiger complaining about ""hollywood trash"". This isn't any different. It's just a bunch of dull dialogue leading to some action scenes with a love story thrown in. Ok, let me get this straight. You're willing to say that about Pearl Harbor, which I enjoyed, but not about Crouching Tiger. The ending is just like the kind that you would see in ""hollywood trash"" except not done half as well. She dies for the one she loves. Again, it's been done.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Ang Lee's good, but everyone screws up. This is just feels like a compilation of different action scenes, different characters and different plotlines just thrown together without any effort. It's below average. I give it a 2/10"

","Well, we just finished watching the english-dubbed version of this movie. It started off slow, left me bewildered, and actually chuckling and rolling my eyes at the fight scenes.<br/><br/>There were points in the movie where my wife and I were trying to figure out who was in the scene.  Was that her boyfriend who came down and swept her from the water?  Oh, no.  It was Jade Fox.  I actually saw wires in several scenes suspending the actors; sad to say the least.  I was amazed to see that the movie got such a high rating.  The story could have been told better, the fight scenes could have been more realistic, and there could have been better character development.<br/><br/>Scenes were obviously sped up to ""enhance"" the martial arts, and I don't care how ""light"" you become as part of your martial arts training, you're still susceptible to gravity.<br/><br/>I'm very glad I didn't see this one in the theatre, and I feel slightly taken by even spending the $3 to rent it.

","This is probably the WORST movie that was ever nominated for the Oscars. A complete failure, from all points of view, that somehow turned upside down the heads of all americans (including the critics).<br/><br/>Okay, i must admit, it is not really that incredibly bad. But considering that it's been nominated and even won some Golden Globes and Oscars make it look like something really great, which is not.<br/><br/>Why, you ask? Well let me tell you.<br/><br/>First, the plot. Yes, it's intriguing and complex, but it has absolutely nothing special in it. A plot concerning a stolen sword, the attempts to recover it, everything mixed in with a love story between a girl about to marry someone she didn't love and a crook determined to change.<br/><br/>As you can see, nothing special. Then , the dialogues. Some of them are really stupid and unappropriate (maybe it's because of the doubling in English), some normal and only a few really good. <br/><br/>The characters: except for the girl, played beautifully by Michelle Yeoh, they are all pretty un-interesting. <br/><br/>Okay... then open the book with all the cliches in the american films, and you'll see that most of them are in this one. It's full of them, sometimes i even had the urge of leaving the theater, but the only thing that kept me in was the laziness and sleeping feeling that i had because of the movie. Example of a cliche? The almost ending scene, in which Jade Fox is about to be killed and, just like in all the cheap B-type action flicks, she confesses everything, what she wanted to do and why, because the movie was unable to make you understand these things by yourself.<br/><br/>At least the ending was a bit better and saved the general poor aspect of definetely the most overrated movie of all times. But even in the ending, and although i watched the movie carefully, the dramatic scenes never made me sorry, not even one bit. Although in many movies i am touched if the ending is dramatic. Here, i didn't feel sorry at all, maybe because that Ang Lee didn't manage to make you really feel for the characters.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing... the action scenes, although some of them really well made, are so ridiculous sometimes... when there were the flying scenes, with these men travelling like UFO's from tree to tree, laughter raised from the whole theater. And for a good reason.<br/><br/>All in all, if you haven't seen this one, don't let yourself be fooled by most opinions in here. This is just another low class asian movie, only with a bigger budget that made it have the door opened in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Vote: 4 out of 10."
"JakeBrinkman","3","2","7","28 October 2019"," Excessively fake action and an angst-fueled plot
","As is standard for Kung Fu films, the most notable part is the action. Most of the fight scenes were exciting, and it was interesting to see some of the crazy Kung Fu abilities. However, every action sequence was marred by the incredibly unrealistic weightless floating around that everyone did. Not only was it unrealistic, it also wasn't always choreographed very well, made all too apparent by the desperate scrambling the characters did as they flailed their limbs while the guidewires carried them. It didn't make them look like they were in control of their own actions, which is odd for a genre so heavily focused on self-mastery. Despite this, the action did still have cool moments whenever the guidewires were detached.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was nothing good about the plot. The story was so convoluted in the beginning with massive amounts of backstory that had to be told way too quickly in order to fit it all in a reasonable runtime. As a result, there were far too many ""speak of the devil"" coincidences in the movie's first act. The second act was a decent love story. I think the relationship turned into love unrealistically quickly, but it wasn't outright bad. Then the third act happens, and we realize just how stupid the story actually is. Everything boils down to an angsty girl who has everything she needs, including the means to achieve everything she's ever wanted. Instead, her angst drives her to throw everything away and try her hardest to become the region's biggest edgelord while her lover and her new parental figures wonder where they went wrong. She is the central plot element, and it's hard to see anything good in a story when the plot's very center is entirely unlikable."

","Wow. I watched Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 24 hours ago, and it is still gripping me, I still can't stop thinking about it. The beautiful score, composed masterfully on only his second film by Tan Dun, is still running through my head. Although I look around, all I can see are the cherry trees, beautifully shot by Ang Lee and perfectly lit by Peter Pau, on which Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi fight near the film's climax. Michelle Yeoh is amazing as the martial arts warrior who tries to hide her feelings for Yun-Fat. Her role is played with a certain weariness of an older warrior, but the performance is far from weary. It is played with grace, and you can really believe the longing in her eyes as she stares at her true love. Overall, this movie is close to a masterpiece."

","I can honestly appreciate a good material arts movie but I can simply not appreciate this movie as much as everyone else seems to do. The storytelling isn't always done in the best way and the movie has a bit too many slow and ridicules moments in it. It's by no means a bad movie, I still rate it a 7 out of 10. This is mainly thanks to the look of the movie. Visually there is very little wrong with the movie. The sets and costumes are good looking and the cinematography by Peter Pau and music by Dun Tan are splendid.<br/><br/>The story didn't quite grabbed me and never really become interesting, tense or surprising. The at times absolutely horrible dialog also didn't do much good to the story and storytelling of the movie. Also none of the actors really impressed me.<br/><br/>The fight are very over-the-top at times and I can't say that I was particularly fond of the whole zero-gravity fight elements in the movie. It was fake and odd looking most of the times and was simply too much over-the-top, even for a material arts movie. The 'normal' fights and mainly the ones involving also weapons were a real treat to look at. They were extremely spectacular and impressive to watch. Yes, it really are those fight sequences that make ""Wo hu cang long"" an original one of a kind movie, that still remains a must see simply for that very same reason.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the fight sequences, not by the overall movie.

","When I first saw this movie, I was utterly blown away. I had never seen anything like it before...just a remarkable conglomeration of many different movie genres; comedy, romance, action, mystery and martial arts film. And the truly amazing thing was that this movie did all of these things well. Since I saw this movie, I have explored the genre fairly extensively; I have watched some of the contemporary films, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers; some other slightly older films, like Ashes of Time and the Bride with White Hair; and some of the classics, like Touch of Zen, Come Drink with Me, and Golden Swallow. And of all of these films, the oldest are the ones that still compare well with this, particularly Touch of Zen, in which one can really see the roots of this movie (highly recommended). Anyways, getting back to the movie; I won't spoil the plot, but Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are fantastic in their roles, as they simply display perfect emotion for their situation. Zhang Ziyi is outstanding in her role as a feisty young woman who is unwilling to bend to her parent's wishes. And Chang Pei-pei, in a small role as the Jade Fox, is outstanding, a nod from And Lee to her early classics (Golden Swallow, Come Drink with Me). When I watched this movie, I felt that the cinematography and choreography put me into a dreamlike state that made me even more willing to accept all of the ideas and themes that this movie presents. An enjoyable experience worth watching if you just saw Hero or House of Flying Daggers but missed this one. A must see, even for those who are not fans of wuxia or martial arts films."
"MatBrewster","9","1","3","19 February 2005"," Excellent Action, Beautiful Drama
","Now that wire work is pretty standard in American film, it is hard to remember how impressive the effects were in the Matrix. Though the Matrix was hardly the first to use that type of effect, Asian cinema had been doing it for awhile, it was the first time I had seen anything like it. I remember being completely awed by the look and movement of the film. Though much of the style and effects quickly became vamped by many films, shows, and commercials, it remained perfect in its visual effects. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out a few months later and pushed the Matrix visual envelope even farther. For my dollar, Ang Lee created a smarter, more beautiful use for the effects than the Wachowski brothers ever dreamed of creating.<br/><br/>The story is a bit tricky. A master martial artists, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), decides to give up his heroism and settle down. Proving his seriousness in this new direction he gives up his famed sword, the Green Destiny, to a friend. The sword is quickly stolen throwing Li Mu Bai and another friend, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) into detective work to reclaim it. Added to the plot is a noble woman, Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), about to be married against her wishes and Li's old nemesis Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Chang). To add a little more to the plot (I told you it was tricky) Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are lovers destined to never have their loved fulfilled.<br/><br/>Ang Lee manages to sort out this complicated plot rather smoothly. The film is sumptuously shot on location in China. The renowned action sequences are poetic and beautiful. It feels more like watching ballet than a sword-fighting action movie. The more skilled fighters can climb up walls, jump great heights and seemingly fly through the sky. Though the film never explains how they are able to manage such incredible feats, they do it with such agility and grace, that you never think to question it. There is a scene fought out amongst tall whisp trees that is pure poetry. Yet they action sequences never stand in the way of the story. This is not a film designed to wow the audience with nothing but visual tricks, the action serves the story alone and is not there to give cheap thrills.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds a theme develops. Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lin never express their love for each other out of honor and loyalty. They hold to strict codes that must be obeyed over all of their own desires. Jen Yu is also bound by codes of conduct, but she chooses to disobey them and strives to live her own life. This serves as the central conflict between the characters. I will not give too much of the plot away, but will say that film concludes this conflict in manner not seen often in cinema.<br/><br/>It is difficult for me to judge the acting of a foreign film. I choose only to watch the original language, with subtitles. This allows me to hear the nuances of the actors voices, but since I must rely on the subtitles to tell me what they are saying it is difficult to really judge a performance. That being said all of the actors do a fine job. Chow Yun Fat does a remarkable job as a master fighter. Each action scene he is in he fill the screen with a knowing presence. He fights with great poise as if he knows he will be the victor, but does not want to show his true ability. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are also stand outs.<br/><br/>My only complaint has to do with one of the sub-plots. In the middle of the picture, we get a long back story on part of Jen Yu's life. After watching the film again I can see that the back story is essential to the overall theme of the film, but it is still too long in the telling. It also serves to slow the film down just as the plot was finally moving along. I believe the essentials of the back story could have been told at a quicker pace allowing us to understand what is needed without slowing the pace of the film down, or lengthening it too much.<br/><br/>This is a small complaint with a truly wonderful film. I have been a fan of Ang Lee for many years, and this film stands as his finest achievement. He is known for his smaller, character driven family films. Here he manages to achieve something on a more grander scale, yet maintains a beautifully portrayed character drama."

","I have to disclaim this review by first explaining that it would not originally have been my choice of movies to go see. I don't usually pick Chinese Martial Arts movies out of a crowd. However, I'd heard from so many people how amazing it is, so I decided to see for myself.<br/><br/>My opinion is mixed. The best parts of the movie are the visuals and special effects. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, resembling artistic dancing. The fantasy sequences of people flying and standing on treetops are especially breathtaking, as is the scenery and cinematography.<br/><br/>The acting was also fairly good, with performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, among others. The only really noteworthy performance, in my opinion, was given by Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the confused daughter of the Governor. She came across as convincing in portraying a mix of naiveté, confusion, wistfulness, and prodigious talent, all hidden between a hostile exterior.<br/><br/>Where the movie falls apart is with the plot. I found that it lacked direction, seeming to travel haphazardly in one direction and then another. Ask any writer or English teacher what makes a good story, and they'll reply that it has to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Seems simple, right? Well, that basic principle got lost somewhere along the way with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br/><br/>Characters change their missions almost by the minute. Flashbacks occur at odd times. The love stories seem to be thrown in simply to appeal to a Hollywood audience, without any real need for them in the plot. The result is somewhat of a hodgepodge.<br/><br/>Of course, it's a beautiful hodgepodge to watch. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is worth seeing in theatres simply for the visuals. The bigger the screen, the better. It doesn't quite translate to DVD with quite the same effect."

","CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is a captivating film in many aspects. The film creates a unique universe that the viewer becomes involved in, from watching the film. The universe created in CROUCHING TIGER is one of traditional virtues and values, but also one of harmony, but unbelievably well-done fighting sequences at the same time. The beauty of CROUCHING TIGER is that nothing is forced, -even the fighting sequences are the right amount of time- the story and plot flow perfectly. The continuity, cinematography, and acting performances enhance the effect of CROUCHING TIGER's unique universe.<br/><br/>Prior to viewing CROUCHING TIGER, I envisioned an overrated Chinese action flick, similar to a Jackie Chan movie, with a little more seriousness, and countless action sequences with cool special effects that lasted too long and subtitles. I was fortunately surprised to discover that my initial judgment was proved wrong. The action sequences where Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu fly and glide are absolutely amazing. These scenes capture the spiritual meditation of the CROUCHING TIGER universe. Although these action sequences are fighting scenes, each scene has a graceful spiritual feel to it; this is enhanced by the serene cello solos of Yo-Yo Ma. The fight scene on the treetops between Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu was particularly brilliant in its execution. The cinematography eloquence of this scene produced breathtaking experience.<br/><br/>The acting performances delivered by Chow-Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Ziyi Zhang were spectacular. The power, nobleness, and honor of Li Mu Bai's character was successfully expressed through Chow-Yun-Fat's great performance. The beautiful Michelle Yeoh also delivers as Li Mu Bai's close friend and ally, as she gives a strong and emotional performance. Ziyi Zhang plays the young and fiery Jen Yu, who is searching to find her real self. The emotions and aura's projected by each character more than make up for the film's subtitles. In fact the Chinese language heightens the film's effect on the viewer, as the viewer need not pay attention to the words, but the flow and emotional quality of the dialogue. <br/><br/>CROUCHING TIGER did not have one wasted scene. Each and every second was enjoyable as the next. For all the uniqueness of the film, it in many ways tells the story of a typical adolescent girl and her quest for true identity and self trust and discovery, but in abstract ways. Jen is like many teenage girls: worrying about whether she is with the right man, adopting a rude and fiery attitude and temper, and committing juvenile acts such as stealing and running away from home. Jen's story is in many ways a rite of passage as she goes from being a kind and polite aristocrat's daughter to being the Dark Cloud's mistress in the wild desert, to working and training with the evil Jade Fox, to taking lessons from Li Mu Bai and making friends with Bai's close friend, Shu Lien. <br/><br/>Jen's experimentation with various people and lifestyles is like experimenting with drugs and alcohol. She had exiting intense experiences with each experimentation, but at the film's conclusion she finds her true self, and what she was meant to be, and who she was meant to be with. I will not reveal Jen's final conclusions, as to not ruin the ending. <br/><br/>All in all CROUCHING TIGER is a masterfully crafted film, definitely worthy of every second of its 120 minutes. <br/><br/>CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON ****/****"

","The true meaning of this movie, I think (I haven't seen anyone post the same) is the battle between the ethical(Li mu Bai) and the aesthetic (the young girl who follows her heart) (Yes Kierkegard)This clash is one that everyone must go threw either unconsciously(don't do anything and just live the life the way you do) or consciously (re-affirming your will to power). And that doing things the right way all the time can lead to regret(the worst of all pains), but one who follows their heart regardless of right or wrong has no place in society. It is the great tear of the individual subconscious in society then or now. Live the way we tell you and die slowly(you are a slave if you chose that, whether you want to admit it or not..Read Nietzche) or live the way you want to and die quickly; the only true freedom....On a diffirent note the directing in this movie was absolutely amazing, the scene where they were sword fighting in the trees, then did a slow shot on the girl laying back on the willow falling down sent chills down my back, absolutely amazing...Bar none some of the best directing I've ever seen"

As I stated before ""People cannot                  fly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""<br/><br/>                 Getting to choreography, most fights are not pretty to watch.  Anyone                  who has seen the Ultimate Fighting Championship or any no-holds barred                  fighting event will attest to this.  However, for a movie fights have                  to be well choreographed to make it ""artistic"" and exciting.  I will                  grant that.  Given that, a choreographed ""real fight"" would look more                  like something out of a Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme film                  where fighters throw blows when they have openings and do not fight to                  an almost musical rhythem.<br/><br/>                 Nobody and I repeat nobody can become a martial arts ""master"" from                  reading a manual.  The skill comes from years of training and hard                  work from a skilled teacher.<br/><br/>                 As I stated before the plot of this movie was so convoluted and                  boring.  The desert sequence seemed to be thrown in the middle to get                  some nice shots of the desert in the film.  This sequence totally                  breaks up the flow of the movie.  <br/><br/>                 There used to be Kung Fu movies that aired in New York on Saturday                  afternoons.  These were very low budget and usually had plots like:<br/><br/>                  1.  The Magnificent Seven, where a group of bandits terrorizes a town                  and a bunch of Kung Fu guys get together to fight them<br/><br/>                  2.  A relative or teacher is murdered.  The student or relative of                  the deceased then trains and goes to seek revenge.<br/><br/>                   3. Some yo yo character begs to be trained by the Shaolin priests in                  Kung Fu (the Karate Kid had a similar theme) so he can go fight the                  bullies that have been picking on him.<br/><br/>                 Anyone of the above had a more interesting plot than CTHD. In most of                  the above movies the only ""flying"" we ever see is someone leaping very                  high to get into a tree or a high ledge.  This is done by running the                  camera backwards.  There is never the floating and walking across                  water that is shown in CTHD.  Each time this effect was done in CTHD I                  could see the characters shoulders hunched up or their clothing on                  their shoulder moved up like they were being picked up by strings.<br/><br/>                 I can go on and on and shoot down any argument from these couch potato                  (ex. Roger Ebert) movie critics who don't have a clue what it takes to                  be a true martial artist and who have never been in a real brawl."

So I'm doubly disappointed - that the movie wasn't better, and that we spent all that money for little reward.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a Westerner who's incredibly ignorant about Chinese culture.  Also, I'm not good with subtlety.  I need to be hit over the head to get the point of movies and books, which is why I love schlock like ""Independence Day"".  However, I KNEW that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" wouldn't be that kind of movie, and I was prepared for that. I knew that there'd be subtitles, and that was fine.  What I wasn't prepared for was the incredible slowness of the plot.  Chow Yun Fat is such a talented actor - why, oh why, was he so wooden in this movie?  We kept hearing about the great unrealized love between his character and Michelle Yeoh's:  why did we see absolutely no evidence of this?  I kept wanting to scream ""STOP YAPPING AND JUST KISS HER, ALREADY!"".<br/><br/>Also, the ""flying"".  I'm sorry, but to me it just looked silly.  I knew there'd be wire work, and I was looking forward to it - I thought I'd see the actors' moves aided and exaggerated slightly by the wires.  I didn't expect to see them FLOAT.  I was one of the ignoramuses who giggled when Jen leapt across a lake, touching down one toe for a microsecond before taking off again.  It didn't look graceful or balletic to me; it looked phoney as hell.  As for the ending - well, just as I was thinking ""That can't be the end"", on come the closing credits.  Oh well.  That was one of the few times I've ever been relieved to see the closing credits.<br/><br/>My husband and I discussed the movie afterwards, and we were both bewildered.  Were we missing something?

","Rarely have I been so disappointed in a film. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had been highly praised in all the national and international reviews available, leading a moderately full cinema last Friday night to expect an interesting plot, exciting fight scenes and visual artistry. Instead, the audience soon became restless.<br/><br/>My most damning criticism has to be that for the first time ever I found a film dull within minutes of its opening. Our row of seats consumed unheard-of quantities of chocolate and popcorn to compensate for the obvious lack of tension. We remained uninterested in the fate of the protagonists throughout and considered leaving the film before the end but stayed on because we did not fancy braving the sub-zero temperature outside.<br/><br/>Having seen several older films of genre on television, I had looked forward to the first fight scene. The audience collectively leant back to enjoy the fun, watched for a while and then started sniggering. Not only are the fight scenes not particularly well choreographed, they are astonishingly badly filmed. Instead of filming them like dance sequences, i.e. as full body shots, the film's makers give us small snippets of arms flashing in front of faces. There are countless multiple somersaults ending in about a second of slowing-down, like a rocket going into reverse acceleration, where the special effects people have obviously had to play around in order to have the actor appear to land on the ground and not several inches about it. The ""best"" bit in the entire film was when a character flew off, body rigid, one arm stretched out above his head. At least half a dozen voices in the cinema, including mine, simultaneously cried out ""Superman.""<br/><br/>Give me Jackie Chan any day!"

","This movie got so many rave reviews, I figured it was worth checking out. I was expecting an entertaining movie with great visuals, great action, and a great story. I was extremely disappointed to say the least.<br/><br/>This movie tried to cram so many elements into it that it was left with nothing. It tried to have epic action, fantasy and adventure, and a few love stories as well. Now, you might be thinking, lots of movies have all of those things and are great movies. That is true, but this movie tries to emphasize so many things that it is left a jumbled mess. The plot gets lost somewhere in between the unrealistic action and the love story that seems completely out of place. The plot, while very easy to understand in the beginning, takes more confusing and unnecessary twists and turns than any movie I've ever seen. Really, this is like a trilogy trying to be crammed into one movie.<br/><br/>All we are left with is the admittedly beautiful cinematography. While the scenes look pretty, nothing else on the screen does. The problem is that it does so many things, but falls short of it's goals in every area. It is not one of the better martial arts movies. It does not have one of the better love stories. While some of these elements are mediocre, the movie as a whole fails."

If you're looking for cool special effects and fights without a storyline, then this is the movie for you. I was getting restless in my seat about 15 minutes into the movie. The fact that this movie was so popular is simply another testament to the fact that lots of people have taste where they sit. In short, though this film is visually thrilling, it fails in the most important area: a good plot."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a terribly overrated film. While it certainly isn't the worst ever made, it also definitely isn't the best, as some people like to think.<br/><br/>The action scenes are decent, but uninspired and unoriginal. If you have seen such movies as Once Upon A Time In China I, II, and III, then you've already seen some of the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Probably the worst point of the movie were its scenes of romance. They were cliché, they stretched on for long periods of time and they weren't all that interesting. While I don't mind having romance scenes in movies, I expect them to be of a reasonable length, and for them to be interesting. These scenes dragged on unnecessarily long, and they weren't that interesting.<br/><br/>Another problem with the movie was the characters. The movie gave you no real reason to care about these characters. They just weren't interesting characters, they didn't hook you in.<br/><br/>At the very beginning, the movie was interesting, but after that one fight scene in the restaurant, things went down hill from there.<br/><br/>If I were forced to summarize this movie with one word, that word would be mediocre. If you want a good martial arts movie with interesting romance scenes in it, I recommend the movie Hero, as well as Once Upon A Time In China I, II and III.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is inferior to many martial arts movies out there, and should only be watched if this is your only choice of rental."

","""Crouching Tiger"" was boring, predictable, and clearly geared toward an American middle-class audience. Characters were only slightly dynamic, and the majority of the acting was dry. The movie was slightly entertaining, but artless. A few shots of the Mongolian desert were worthwhile. For more meaningful Chinese movies, try watching ""Farewell My Concubine"" or ""Raise the Red Lantern."" In contrast with ""Tiger,"" these two films have very complex characters and plots, even if the characters don't fly. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is not a cultural experience, but a predictable American movie with Chinese actors."

","It is impossible to know where to start my critique. Whether it is with the fact that this movie is on the top 100 foreign films of all time or whether to start with the large amount of crap that others have written. The editorial review is absolutely beyond me. A classic Greek tragedy? Where did you get that idea? I mean, the fact that they can fly is fine, in a fantasy fiction film, anything can happen. But this film had no storyline, the acting was minimal, and the martial arts that Ang Lee tried to present was ridiculous. In trying to make an artistic masterpiece, he sacrificed the entire beauty of martial arts. Its called martial arts because when someone has mastered it, the way they fight is a wonder and beautiful to watch. For instance, when you watch Jet Li's old movies done in Chinese, one can see the beauty of it all. The way his moves flow into one another and at the same time, he kicks another person's ass. This film was simply another foreign film that was brought to America and now people who think they know about movies say, ""Do you know anything about Asian cinema? Well, there's this amazing film called 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'"" All of it is bs. The movie sucked and anyone who followed up this one with Ang Lee's other film ""The Hulk"" can see that this man needs some serious work on his editing and entire movie-making process. this was not a good film, the idea was stupid, the result was horrible. If you thought this was an amazing expression of Chinese cinema, think again. This is an insult to Chinese traditions and a step backward for Asian cinema."

This gimmick was used in several films, including that miserable abortion called ""The Matrix"" of about the same time as this.This unfortunate gimmick was dropped after a few films, and its easy to see why. If you must know, its yet another rehash of ""Star Wars"" but its set in 19th. century China instead of a galaxy far away and minus the futuristic hardware and space ships. Its sole novelty beside the fight gimmick is that the warrior is female. Period. It does feature beautiful color photography, but so what? The critics fawned all over this one.

Even though I expected to have to put up with this, I still found it so ridiculous that I couldn't stop laughing starting about half way through. Usually knowing that you will have to accept something before watching a movie, helps you get past these negative things. For example, watching an older sci-fi or fantasy flick, you know that you will have to accept poor special effects. Once you can get past this, you can enjoy the movie.

Basically a treasured sword called The Green Destiny is stolen by an unknown martial arts person. Master Li not only wants the sword back, but is anxious to see and train the sword's keeper. Filled with silly dubbing and ridiculous stunt like moves makes it rather funny. For example, there are scenes when characters are flying through trees and jumping to high buildings, impossible.

I had reason to believe this film was true to life with no magic or unrealistic events yet the people who were fighting had these 'special' powers to jump over 2 or sometimes 3 storey buildings. They also staged sword fights in trees. If your thinking big trees with strong branches think again. These were thin trees and they were 'floating' on the leaves. I mean who can do that as well as take part in a sword fight? They also managed to jump high from a standing start with no run up or aid to help them jump.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste my time with this film if i was you.

If there would be an explanation how they achieve to literally fly and do all those things. I would be ok with it. In every movie you see, you literally see that how they can do things. It is part of the character arc. In every movie! This somehow said that there is a book with pictures and a language and that's all. I just don't buy it. Atleast a 30 secs long scene where someone reads the book and tries out the technique and we see how that person starts to rise from the ground. Totally fine! Sold. Really. That's simple. That director is not a good one.<br/><br/>My other huge problem was the point of the movie. It had a main line and one supporting. The main was a cliche. Poor woman doesn't want to get married. She wants to live her life no matter what.

","Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good film, but it's not a great one. It's not as great as everyone says it is. Oh, it's definitely beautiful in every sense of the word. It's wonderfully choreographed. It's skillfully directed, and all of the acting talents ARE talented, and they depict their characters with depth, grace, and sometimes when necessary, wit.<br/><br/>But its handsome qualities can't hide its meandering, sometimes tedious storyline, although the storyline itself isn't the problem. Take into account the execution. Take out the dance-number action sequences, and what have you got? A bratty girl who wants to rebel and gets people killed as a result of her reckless actions and poor judge of character. Her motivations are indeed valid, but her actions are childish and grating, and not always justifiable as a 'means to an end' sort of thing. I'm glad Ang Lee didn't depict her actions as such, but she was still an obnoxious character whose lack of responsibility is almost rewarded with secrecy by people who are trying to help her despite how often she backhands them with her attitude.<br/><br/>I found the story underwhelming, to put it simply. The only other flaw I can think of is the dialogue, at least in the English-subtitled version (I haven't seen the dub, and don't plan to), where character traits and motivations are often explained to us in dull exposition sequences that could have been shortened or even cut out completely in favour of showing us their motivations through their actions. A skilled director can show his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling without telling them through stinted lines of dialogue, and I think Ang Lee is skilled enough to do it--he just didn't want to, I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite my gripes, I think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is still a well-told film with a kind of beauty and grace that few others can match, visually and aesthetically. Wuxia isn't a genre I'm big on, but I can't say I've any feelings against it outright. I appreciate its capacity for amazing visuals and thematic symbolism, but it's a fickle style. Lee did an amazing job, and despite the hype surrounding this film, and the underwhelming execution of the story, I was not disappointed."

It is assumed that a story must have a beginning, a development and a result. Well, here is the beginning. At first, the film has the feeling that something is missing. After seeing it, he discovered that the film one is adapted to the fourth book of a pentalogy, so we do not have the information of the first textbooks. While it is compensated with the part that gives information in the dialogues that leads us to imagine what has happened between the characters before, it is still partly with that feeling that something is missing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, wonderful. Great performances by the entire cast; beautiful photography; big fights, both with weapons and without them; a dream recreation of ancient China; an adequate and versatile soundtrack, which works perfectly in both action and dramatic scenes; a couple of love stories not very original but very worn; and an agile direction of Ang Lee, which takes us from one place to another without giving us a break."

Jen-Yu got the most spot lights and scenes here, perhaps she is supposed to be the main character but I found that her story wasn't really interesting and her character was very annoying, I get it that she was very talented and brilliant fighter but her personality is such spoiled that she caused many problems to the others. What's the point with sword getting constantly stolen, returned and stolen again. In the beginning, I felt sympathy to her for her arranged marriage when she already had the man she loved (Lo) and wanted to live a free woman, but her immaturity, arrogance in her skills, and throwing tantrum when Shu-Lien only tried to give her wise advice were beyond my nerves. It is fair if she started as annoying character, but I expected character development in her which didn't exist. The flashback sequence showing her love interest (Lo) was too long, I enjoyed the fight on the horse in desert but still, it could've been cut. She desperately wanted to retrieve her supposed precious comb yet it never explained why it was precious, the comb actually was just a plot device for her romance with Lo.
Jen's fight with Shu-Lien was quite pleasant in my eyes but I hated how it went though, surely I saw that both had comparable skills, but Jen had more advantage with that legendary sword (wtf when it could sliced the heavy weapons Shu-Lien used), Jen said to her when she blamed the weapon for her lost (indicated that Jen was superior than Shu-Lien) yet their very first fight when Jen stole the sword (both unarmed) told the otherwise. I half-expected that Jen would accidentally killed Shu-Lien with that sword to the horror, I'm so glad when Mu-Bai knocked that sword out and threw it, as skillful as Jen was, she wasn't worthy yet to wield that sword. So many random fight scenes for Jen being awesome with no relation to the plot, only to show how spoiled and arrogant she was.
None of the characters got proper development, Shu-Lien and Mu-Bai got lesser scenes than Jen, their past love story was barely mentioned. Almost forgot about Jade Fox, the supposedly main villain here became only an extra character, her lost and demise felt like a joke. Only appeared briefly in many unimportant scenes, her fight with the Police Inspector Tsai and his daughter May (since both father and daughter held revenge against her for killing his wife) resulted in May lost both her parents in the hand of Jade Fox, this had promising premise to further the plot but got abandoned for the sake of beautiful Jen. Mu-Bai's revenge on Jade Fox for murdered his master, got ditched for the sake of paying attention to Jen. I wished May and Mu-Bai would unite to defeat Jade Fox (as they had similar motives) and May became Mu-Bai's disciple instead of Jen but everything was about Jen here, I would be okay if the story itself nice and Jen's character got proper development, but not. Also, a flashback of Jade Fox killing Mu-Bai's master with Mu-Bai mourned for his master would be much more worthy than Jen-Lo's lovey dovey flashback.
Mu-Bai's death too, should be very sad and moving, but his lack of scenes, importance and development hardly made me feel it, though I feel sorry for Shu-Lien, losing her loved one (after losing her fiancee years ago). I'm happy when Shu-Lien pointed the sword at Jen's neck, it seems like she wanted to blame Jen for it (and so do I) but in the end she forgave her because despite everything, Jen was her beloved ""sister."" I expected Shu-Lien to commit suicide, to follow Mu-Bai and to be reunited with him as she already lost everything, only facepalmed so hard when Jen was the one who choose to commit suicide despite she already reunited and could be live happily together with Lo.<br/><br/>As beautiful as the fights and the sceneries were, storyline/plot is still the most important and core element in every movies, and since the plot here is weak and failed miserably, I think that it's enough to watch this once, this movie is the kind that I hardly want to watch for second time, though I would like to give it a try for the sequel later."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","1","29 May 2016"," Incredibly complex wuxia epic
","Well, I'm not quite sure what to make of this film. Although it requires a certain suspension of disbelief (simply that, people who do martial arts can fly) it's not what I was expecting at all. Well, maybe a little. You see I was expecting some effects-laden, action-packed piece of chop-socky cinema, and instead what I got was a thoughtful, slow-paced yet deeply gripping human drama which goes for the heart. You see, this is an intensely complex film about destiny, conscience, one's place in society, true love, emotions and the need to hide them, plus lots more. It's impossible to describe all of the things that this film is about, suffice to say that Ang Lee intertwines the various plot threads seamlessly to create a fluid, well-paced movie. The two hour-odd running time flies by, in case there are any naysayers.<br/><br/>Two familiar faces take the leads in the cast, but the whole bunch are pretty good - especially the unknown Ziyi Zhang as the feisty, muddled teenage warrior who struggles to come to terms with her own adulthood. Taking the lead is Chow Yun-Fat, and once again he plays the coolest character ever. Michelle Yeoh - former Bond girl - is also surprisingly good as the intelligent, beautiful Yu Shu Lien who also happens to be a great fighter. The music is sufficiently epic, the photography gorgeous and scenes of mountains and forestry are, as stated elsewhere, breathtaking.<br/><br/>The action, when it comes, doesn't disappoint, mixing in some traditional Bruce Lee-style hand-to-hand combat with some very big, sharp-looking weapons and fluid wirework which makes the characters gracefully leap through the air mid-combat. My favourite fight is the final battle in the temple between Lien and Jen, where both combatants move impossibly fast and damn near wreck the place with their combined weaponry. However, there are only about five (extended) battle scenes in total, with the rest of the film concentrating on characterisation and furthering the plot. I won't spoil the ending, only to say that it's very good - and moving. My final words can only be, see it for yourself!"

","Boring. If you like impossible flying-through-the-air martial arts fight scenes, this is for you. If, like me, you think elaborate, complex fight sequences are amongst the lowest form of cinematic entertainment, second lowest only to things blowing up frequently, hugely and in bright colours, you will find this boring.<br/><br/>Plot is basic. Everything just seems like another segue to another fight scene.<br/><br/>Admittedly, cinematography is great. Beautiful scenery, great colour, and the flight scenes are well staged. That's about all I can say on the plus side."

","The action of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comes fast and thick. It is under the direction of the master Yeun Wo Ping that they are staged, in the manner of the old Wu Xia novels that have entranced generations. The fighters float effortlessly and gracefully over rooftops and across crevices. They fling objects like they weigh nothing at all and their bodies are powered by a strange, otherworldly power. They cartwheel off walls with an accelerated elegance and ease (though the footage does seems sped up). They have names like Iron Arm and Southern Crane, and carry their signature weapons and tools with pride. Some detractors might express the opinion that this depiction of martial arts seems fetishsised and catered primarily to a Western audience. But the movie does not just exist to serve the action - the narrative is the stuff of legends and fable. <br/><br/>It starts with a legendary sword, as always. Li Mu Bai is played by action royalty Chow Yun-fat as a dedicated Wudang swordsman whom has given his life for his art. His performance is dignified and composed as his swordplay is (see how he matches Jen stroke for stroke with a sheathed Green Destiny, and then as he unsheathes it, there is a ringing and shimmering gleam that signals his true mastery of the blade), but there is an undercurrent of weariness and desire for a quieter, more normal life. There is an underlying romance with fellow fighter Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) that is expressed not through words, but longing looks. And there is revenge, and loyalty, and honour, ideas that are found within the roots of Chinese imperialism periods. We understand that after her escape and subsequent crimes, that Jen Yu will no longer be able to face her parents for the shame she has brought to her family name. <br/><br/>It is Zhang Ziyi that is the star here. She is one of those actresses that seems to have an eternal youthful vivacity about her, even in her more recent films. This was her breakout film and she excels; there's an element of roguish rascalism that reflects her age, and which contributes much to her disobedient character. Her fighting skill allows her this type of arrogance, along with a dismissive tone to her speech that suggests experience but which does not match her youthful face. This is to be expected; she seizes power and turns on her elders, and in a moment of perfect characterisation, jumps after the legendary Green Destiny because the loss of it would represent a license to do whatever she please and beat whomever she turned its blade on. And there is no usual redemption for her here; in a poetic twist, her surrender to the gods of fate and judgement highlights a new vulnerability and acceptance of her actions. It is open-ended, but in the best way, as if beckoning us to make our own conclusion on her heat's purity, and it feels like a fully realised and fulfilled arc (although it loses points for the over-long flashback sequence that almost makes us forget the main storyline). <br/><br/>But most of all it is the action that excites and pleases. There is the classic one master against hundreds, and Lee manages to tread the fine line between comic and dramatic and as such the goofiness and B-action-esque of the Qinggong style become thrilling and captivating. There's a nice little moment of vulnerability where Jen clutches her wrist after repelling the first challenger, as if studying the book for years does not equate to mastery in reality. And then she draws Green Destiny and proceeds to beat them all soundly. There's a brilliant awareness of the surroundings, not just as eye candy, but as an element of the action itself - Jackie Chan is another who knows this. Lee knows he can cut to a man being flung out of the window, smashing much more of the building than necessary in order to provide comic relief - and then to use the same method in the delay of the collapse of the floor in the final wide shot, after a brief lull as Jen dispatches the last combatants. <br/><br/>But the best of them all must be the showdown between Jen and Yu Shu Lien. It seems very convenient for them to drop into what is basically a square weapons playground, but the action switches into overdrive and we soon forget this. What makes this more than just a flashy fight scene is the emotional undercurrent that charges both of them; past the polite pleasantries, the faux declaration of sisterhood, and the betrayal and bloodshed Jen has brought upon the area all ring in their minds, and it isn't just a showy clash of techniques, but a deadly dance. The percussion slowly builds in intensity, and their blows become more frantic, and less guarded. It is masterfully shot and choreographed - we see fluid full body movement and acrobatics that defy physics. And Lee will use choice closeups to indicate moments of turning of the tide; a thick iron bar with deep gashes to show the Green Destiny's wicked edge, and the shaking, inexperienced, young hand that clutches it. How could this be any less thrilling?"
"adrianswingler","3","0","5","26 September 2015"," Overrated
","I was disappointed with this one vis a vis the ratings it gets. It is barely watchable and eminently forgettable, imho. I'm a fan of old school gung fu movies and have no tolerance for the kind of canine fecal material that Tarantino spews, but understand that some like fantasy and might have different sensibilities.<br/><br/>But even on that level, I just don't get it. Martial arts is about control and mastery of one's self, physically and spiritually, and the best actors are highly accomplished professionals. They are a wonder to behold. So, how does it make it more interesting to have people that have never put in 1/100 the effort jerked all over the place with pulleys and trampolines? OK. If it's a fantasy story...maybe...but you don't watch gung fu movies for the story!<br/><br/>For my money, a person that likes martial arts movies will be about as much satisfied with this one as a hard core NFL addict would be watching a touch football game. Superficially it's kind of the same, but has nearly none of the things you're watching it for. At the end of the day, could the fantasy-flick crowd go watch a nice mindless ""written purely as fantasy"" movie and not have to drag martial arts down?<br/><br/>I didn't detest this one. It's not like Kill Bill in terms of being just 1000% awful and a sad statement about humanity today. But, WAY too many times I found myself saying, ""Did they really need to do that? How does that improve the movie"", or thinking that I'd like to see 1/2 the ""magic"" with some real moves than what is. I guess, that's supposed to be better. It isn't.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I think it's very sad. This is the trend now and it looks to be about pushing out a superficially similar product whilst greatly reducing costs and not having to rely on very talented people who are not easy to find/recruit/schedule. I totally fail to see how this is any kind of improvement for the genre. It seems like more ""make the money men happy, we've plenty of sheep that will follow. Old School is old hat""."

","I first saw this movie as a kid and thought it was alright. Mainly because I didn't know what was going on and although the fight sequences was well shot and directed. I just didn't really get into it. I was really into Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies back then. Where the plot was silly but entertaining to watch. This is a movie with a well told story that has some amazing sword fight choreography going for it. The movie is about fates intertwining, romance that doesn't go over the top, and of course fighting. But the unfolding of the story and how everything plays out was just so darn fantastically paced. It was captivating from the start to finish, just to see how everything plays out. Even the drama aspect of this movie is the right amount. It has won awards for good reason. Not just because of the storytelling, but because of the acting, cinematography and choreography which is just well shot. Especially for a movie that came out in 2000. I think this is probably the first big Chinese movie to make it to the big screen in the US and leave an impact. Do I think this movie is a bit over-hyped? Yeah, it isn't a groundbreaking movie. But it's still a Chinese that left an impact when it first came out.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"cowheysean","9","0","1","15 July 2015"," Personal Experience of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts and drama film based on the life and death of Li Mu Bai. The film is eventually centralized around Jen Yu but Mu Bai is the noticeable western-like hero. Li Mu Bai is a well-known and heroic warrior. Even though Li is famous, he still struggles with his warrior identity. When Mu Bai returns home from his meditation, he feels a profound sense of 'sorrow' instead of enlightenment. In the early stages of the storyline, it is clear that Mu Bai and the next character introduced (Shu Lien) have strong feelings for each other. Mu Bai's sorrow may stem from his warrior life and potentially never acting on the mutual interest that he and Shu Lien have shared. Therefore, Mu Bai's solution is to rid himself of his old life by donating his famous sword, the Green Destiny, to Sir Te (a trusted close friend). The Green Destiny is inseparable from Li according to Shu Lien. Within a few moments, the sword is stolen, thereby forcing Li out of early retirement in order to retrieve the Green Destiny.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes place during the Qing Dynasty. Years earlier, Mu Bai's master was cowardly murdered with poison by a woman named Jade Fox. Mu Bai never forgives himself for not revenging his master's death. Coincidentally, Jade Fox is seen with a masked warrior stealing the Green Destiny. Setting the film with a crisis that needs to be solved by Li Mu Bai. <br/><br/>Personally, Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of this writer's all- time favorite films. Even though this film can be characterized as an action film, one can't help but notice the strong feminine undertone between the action sequences. The story line is well written and Chow Yun-Fat's performance was masterful. The action scenes are absolutely stunning in every fashion, especially the treetop scene with Jen and Mu Bai. It is a story about love, regret, passion, revenge, and transcendence. It is a journey that highlights Mu Bai's and Jen's fascinating skills as well as Jen's arrogance that ultimately indirectly kills Mu Bui. <br/><br/>On a side note, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's story shifts from a well- trained and disciplined Li Mu Bai to an over-confident and self proclaimed sword goddess Jen. After Mu Bai's death, Shu Lien can't help but see Jen's life unfold without the love of her life (much like Shu Lien's life). Therefore, Shu Lien grants Jen to be with her lover from the desert (Lo). As an audience member, one can't help but perceive Jen as a villainess type of character in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Her recklessness and rage only causes pain for those around her. At the close of the film, Jen realizes her mistakes and feels that if she 'sacrifices' herself Lo can live happily."

","Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon is a very special film.Its elegant and yet simple story telling, backed by its relaxed pacing and bleeding cinematography makes it just about the most beautiful and elegant martial/Kong-fu film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The best feature of this work is its simpleness to follow. Unlike many Martial arts films I have seen,the audience has very little to do,but to be engaged, and this is refreshing.<br/><br/>The Story is magical and captivating from the first frame to the very last and Ang Lee's use of the Western Chinese landscape,is truly breathtaking and stand as a character in itself.What is unique about this story is that it is in equal parts a mystery and at the same time time an enthralling tale of unrequited love,set against a rich display of Chinese culture and visually explosive Martial Arts skills.<br/><br/>The ensemble of actors were incredibly strong. Yun-Fat Chow, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang, delivered impactful performances right through and the musical score was especially tantalizing, together somehow transplanting you to this era of china and this was truly an achievement.<br/><br/>The only qualm I had with this film is that the character Jen (Ziyi Zhang),could have been a bit more developed.I found myself at times questioning her motives and struggling to understand her loyalties.In truth,an additional ten minutes of screen time could have better helped the audience to fully understand her as a character.<br/><br/>However,with Crouching Tiger:Hidden Dragon:Green Destiny on the horizon in 2015,am hoping she gets her due as much as I would get the opportunity to grace this magical world once again."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a masterful directorial effort by Ang Lee that is a beautiful film and is bound to sweep you off your feet. I haven't seen many foreign films up to this point, but I think now I shall. This film weaves a story and it feels like you're part of the story. The language barrier did not hold me back, and I felt like I was in 19th-century China part of this story. This movie is beautifully shot and features some of the best cinematography I have seen in film.<br/><br/>Ang Lee, who directed such American classics like Brokeback Mountain and Life of Pi, directs a Chinese narrative that takes place during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Li Mu Bai's master was murdered by the Jade Fox and as he is about to retire, he finds out he has another chance to avenge his master's death.<br/><br/>This film features some great acting by very talented international actors. Chow Yun-Fat is very good in his role and he should be, since he's one of China's best actors. Michelle Yeoh delivers a convincing performance as Fat's lover. Finally, Zhang Ziyi is very good in her role and delivers quite an emotional punch.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very beautiful film both story-wise and to look at. The film will make you seem as if you're in the story. Sure, the story can get silly sometimes, but most martial arts films do. The choreography is excellent and sometimes is very Matrix-like. The score is wonderful and exquisite. This is an action film, but there is plenty of substance here and there is definitely a great story being told. You can tell this film is in the hands of a talented director. Very well done! I rate this film 9/10."

","I agree with Richard Finch here. Here is a visually beautiful film that obviously required talent to bring to the screen. Much money went into the lavish and beautiful sets, even that of a cave dweller who probably has more beautiful things than most people do in urban America. The cinema photographer also did a wonderful job filming a China a lot of Chinese people probably don't ever get to see. <br/><br/>So, what is wrong with the film? Unfortunately, the characters really aren't all that deep. It's a pretty formulaic story and a familiar one as well. Unrequited love that isn't actually spoken of much until it's too late. <br/><br/>The fight sequences, though beautiful are so far fetched they are distracting and pull us out of the story. I kept thinking of Kill Bill and how it just packs a punch, hits you right in the gut and it just all works. We also can really relate to the characters in Kill Bill and they've got grit!<br/><br/>Here, a lot just seems sort of tepid. Not a bad film by any means but nothing super spectacular either."
"bayou_hannibal","4","0","3","29 May 2012"," Horribly overrated movie with lame martial arts
","I characterize ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as a martial arts movie loved by people who normally don't like martial arts movies. It's mind boggling how much mileage this movie got out of its crappy, clichéd plot and annoying floaty fight scenes. The movie critics who gushed over this movie wouldn't know a great martial arts scene if they were karate chopped to the face with it. Before I saw this movie, I heard about how it had not only how it had a great epic plot, but also had excellent fight scenes. This movie has neither.<br/><br/>Let's talk about all of the floating. There is no gravity in this movie. The fight scenes have as much in common as footage of man walking on the moon as they do with the fight scenes in truly great martial arts movies. Ang Lee went crazy with wire tricks. Half of this movie is spent with people floating around on wires. Somebody takes a gentle jump off of the ground and floats across the room. It's ridiculous. When I saw this movie in the theater, there were numerous audible laughs from the audience at all of the unintentionally funny floating.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the fight scenes are mostly a waste of time. There is no drama or plot advancement to them. For any action scene to work, there has to be a point to it. The good guy kills the bad guy and we rejoice, or the bad guy kills the good guy and we cry. Every great action scene in the history cinema has had some influence on the plot. Whoever made the dozens of cheap, cheesy Kung Fu movies that I watched on late night TV as a kid understood this. Ang Lee apparently doesn't. In many scenes, two people float around an arena fighting for five minutes, and nothing happens. You know that neither of them will get hurt, so from the beginning, it's a complete waste of time. This, unfortunately, is an epidemic in action movies nowadays. Action scenes seem like more of a tool to show off CGI or cinematography than to advance the plot in an exciting way.<br/><br/>This movie's plot is laughable. It easily ranks among the worst of any martial arts movie that I have ever seen. It's just a tired old cliché about an old master wanting to guide a young arrogant whippersnapper, with some ""I want revenge on you because you killed my master"" thrown in for good measure. The characters don't behave realistically and by the time that you are halfway, you won't even care what happens to them. When I first saw this movie, I almost felt like a practical joke had been played on me. I walked out of the theater saying ""wow, is that it?"" If this movie had been made in the 1970s with cheesy dubbing instead of subtitles, nobody would be giving it the praise that it has received. This is why I have labeled this movie as ""a martial arts movie loved by people who normally don't like martial arts movies."" People who see this movie don't realize that they are getting an old cheesy film on artistic steroids.<br/><br/>Do you want to see some great martial arts? Go to Wal-Mart and see if you can find some really cheap DVDs of old Chinese films from the 70s and 80s. Or, check out some Jackie Chan or Jet Li movies on Netflix. For a modern combination of great action and drama, I highly recommend Jet Li's Fearless. One of half a dozen fight scenes in that movie produce more adrenaline than all of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and its simple plot works really well too. If you normally wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie like that, then maybe you'll get something out of this one."

Some of the movie is beautifully shot but the action scenes are almost laughable. Seeing CTHD put me off this kind of film until I caught Hero on TV. I bought Hero on Blu-ray and it is sumptuous and really artistic - everything that I was led to believe Crouching Tiger was.

","How can one express their thoughts of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in words? The emotions in this film are so complex and deep that words really can't do them justice. But that won't stop me from trying.<br/><br/>In a word, this film is beautiful. This is a grand and powerfully emotive film that must be experienced to truly understand. Lovingly crafted and jaw-droppingly beautiful, this is a film where emotions take center stage.<br/><br/>Two aging warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) are looking to retire from a life of adventuring and fighting. But the theft of a legendary sword, the Green Destiny, sets in motion events that will unearth buried secrets in them and a young princess, Jiao Long (Zhang ZiYi).<br/><br/>The film is famous for its fight scenes, which are as beautiful as they say. This isn't a particularly violent film, at least not in the way of say, Jet Li. Or even Jackie Chan. The action sequences are almost completely bloodless (a wise concession from reality), and they are performed with such grace and beauty that they are far closer to dancing than violence.<br/><br/>While there is plenty of swordplay, calling ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" an action movie is an inept and unfair description. Above all, this is a romance; the fight scenes are just an extension of the character's feelings. In their own way, each of the central characters is trapped between their emotions and their lives, and the times where their feelings are brought to the surface, we can see the intensity reflected in their movements.<br/><br/>For a film that depends so much on the abilities of the actors, the performances were completely ignored by the major awards. This blunder was tremendous oversight. The actors playing the three central characters deserved Oscar attention, which none of them received.<br/><br/>Chow Yun Fat became famous as an action star in John Woo's films, but the Hong Kong star has tremendous acting ability. Li Mu Bai is a weary but wise man who is bound by his sense of duty, but the skill of this new opponent intrigues him, and instead of punishing the criminal, he wants to train her and give her direction. Michelle Yeoh also has a background in action films, but her performance equals that of Chow Yun Fat. She's his lifelong companion, tied by their past. But their duties deny them the ability to really say how they feel about each other. Zhang ZiYi is outstanding in her second screen performance. She's a young girl who has learned the ways of the Wudan martial arts (which Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are trained in), but as Li Mu Bai puts it, she knows the moves, but not the meaning. Trapped in an impending forced marriage, she is seduced by the freedoms that, she thinks, warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien have, and runs away. But by the time she learns the hard truth, it may already be too late. Supporting roles by Chen Chang, as Jiao Long's true love, and Cheng Pei Pei, as her governess supplement the material well.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is a masterful filmmaker. Even his films that aren't quite perfect are still well made. Lee has made a number of brilliant films, like ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" and the slightly overrated but still wonderful ""Brokeback Mountain"" (for which he finally won a much deserved Best Director Oscar), this is his best film. This is a film about romance and philosophy more than action, and Lee understands this. It's gorgeously filmed, and he place character and emotion above action. Character, not plot, drives the film.<br/><br/>This film was denied the Best Picture Oscar at the 2001 Academy Awards. This was a grave injustice, and the fact that it lost to the bloated and hilariously self-important ""Gladiator"" is insulting. Nevertheless, those who see the film will understand that its best defense its itself."

"rhinocerosfive-1","4","0","7","22 April 2009"," Crouching Story, Hidden Vacuum
","So I watched this movie again the other day, and as ever I felt a little dirty afterward. Gorgeous to look at, and all those lovely Ang Lee touches making the relationships throb with life. But there's something sore here I can never put my finger on. Dmitry called later on and I asked him what was wrong with this movie, and as usual he had exactly the answer: <br/><br/>""Nothing matters,"" he said.<br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/>Start with the Macguffin: a sword is stolen... that the owner just threw away. Bang. Doesn't matter. Everybody gets all excited about it, runs around getting into spectacular fights over it, when in fact the people who are acting like they care said right at the start that they didn't care. The sword is recovered, and, yes, stolen again. And again everybody acts like that matters. If it didn't matter at the top, it can't matter later, unless new information is introduced. It's not: when Chow Yun-Fat turned his back on his fighting ways, he already knew the bad guy was still out there. Which brings us to:<br/><br/>The oldest, dumbest motif in Shaolin filmdom: the bad guy killed my master. This was a tired excuse back before Bruce Li used it 30 times. A revenge story always sucks because there are only two ways for it to be explored thematically: (1) the vengeance trail is an empty path, which is not news to anybody who's seen a Western or gone on a vengeance trail; (2) the vengeance trail is an honorable pursuit, which is idiotic to anybody who's ever studied Buddhism, or gone on a vengeance trail. This movie chooses to combine the two, which is only slightly less stupid than either one alone. First, we're forced to spend time with a hero who can't see the lack of wisdom in his decisions. Second, we know what he ought to be doing, which is having kids with the Michelle Yeoh. That's a little tragic, and the only part of this story that works dramatically. Too little too late, because for the whole middle of the movie we're not thinking about Chow and Yeoh, we're looking at:<br/><br/>The intrusive ingénue love story, which breaks its own rules by failing to be a love story. The pretty girl is supposed to be in love with the pretty boy. She is supposed to be so in love with him that their love is presented in epic, sweeping visual terms. We in fact spend a good half hour derailing the central (admittedly ridiculous) plot line for a diversion in romantic desert locations, purportedly setting up the great timeless love of these renegade children. Then, when the boyfriend shows up demanding his old flame's affection, she is iffy and pouty. Turns out she'd rather be a Quentin Tarantino heroine, kicking ass and posing. After all that heavy breathing in the desert, she gives him the kiss-off without even a farewell roll in the sand. And when the grown-ups tell him to go wait in the corner, he goes. Along with any credibility the love story might have had.<br/><br/>Which segues into the traditional storyteller's dilemma: what to do with the ingénue. Zhang Ziyi is no problem to look at. The trouble is the script's abuse of her character as a story device. The conceit of a talented but recalcitrant student is an old one, tried and true and moldy and blue. That's not even the problem. It's that the movie can't decide how to use her. Is she a lover? That part's convincing. Is she a warrior? I buy it. Is she a wandering spark, looking for a haystack? Is she a wild horse in need of a rider? Is she ever going to take her shirt off? These are the questions that, even if answered (not all are), are answered erroneously. That she kills her potential master is, again, mildly interesting from a dramatic standing, but, again, it's too little too late. She never took her clothes off, she never really loved the boy, she never really reached her potential. So when she kills herself, the sacrifice is for nothing: there's nobody to save but herself. And now she's dead.<br/><br/>Just like the chances of my ever watching these beautiful, empty fight scenes again. After all, this movie's through-line is that one shouldn't waste the time he's given."

What gives? There is no solid direction here, just a lot of cut & paste scenes of great martial arts followed by acting with no direction.

","This film is about the love, power struggle and retaliation between powerful martial arts masters in the middle kingdom a long time ago.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I last watched ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". I remember thinking that it was not so good. Even the wires lifting the actors were exposed! This is one of the worst goofs you can get. I was even inclined to believe the conspiracy theories that the Western world hyped up a mediocre film to embarrass the Chinese.<br/><br/>After watching it on TV again today, my views are completely changed. I am quite captivated by the complicated relationships between the lead characters. Each of them are developed well, and have their own special quality. Li Mu Bai is portrayed to be a compassionate but reserved master in martial arts. His masterful quality radiates from his character. Shu Lien is a clever woman who is great at resolving urgent situations. Jen Yu is a rebellious young girl who has no remorse towards all her mischievous acts. This character development is powerful. I develop a lot of respect for Li Mu Bai, and hatred for Jen Yu.<br/><br/>Locations are also beautiful, particular the forest scenes and the desert scenes. Fights are well choreographed, and smoothly executed. Instead of senseless violence that is a common problem with action films, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" transcends to the level where an action film looks beautiful and artistic.<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a good film.

"sc8031","7","0","1","6 July 2008"," It's not really a martial arts flick
","Okay, this movie is decent, but it's not one of the best films of all time. It is certainly stylish, well thought-out, well acted and innovative in the elements that are combined in its execution, but the characters and story do not allow it to attain the status of masterpiece.<br/><br/>My main problem is that the background is sort of a vague fantasy. It is a distinct period piece with generous creative liberties taken on behalf of the director. We know it is Qing China based on the family life of Jen (Ziyi Zhang) but nothing in the film is particularly historical. There are vague horde-like bandits, Wudang martial arts, random snippets of ""philosophy"" that sound like they could possibly be Buddhist or Daoist, yet nothing is concrete. This kinda irked me when I watched the movie recently. Despite appearing as a religious or martial arts-themed film, the film doesn't investigate either of those things.<br/><br/>I also didn't particularly care for any of the characters. No one had a real sense of humor and the love theme (THE theme) struck me as cliché and predictable. The main character, Jen, is supposed to be some kind of symbol of tortured feminism from this period (she can't be happy anywhere in this society) but it didn't come across very eloquently. I found her a real hassle to watch on-screen. Or maybe that's the point?<br/><br/>The musical score was a bit much. I felt the film-makers were relying a bit too much on the music. Perhaps the film is indeed rather balanced, in making sure not to leave the viewer's attention on any one technical aspect, so in that regard it is a very good mainstream cinematic work. But the shots of the Gobi Desert ""contrasted"" against Yo-Yo Ma's cello playing was just over-saturation and bordered on self-parody.<br/><br/>I don't think this or anything else I've seen by Ang Lee is necessarily a masterpiece (although I should point out I have not seen Brokeback Mountain or Lust/Caution). But it is a very solid, entertaining film."

","Mu Bai Li is a master warrior whose sword, The Green Destiny, is stolen by Jen, an impetuous young woman who is the apprentice of Jade Fox, an evil witch and Li's sworn enemy. With the help of his friend Shu Lien, he must find Jen, save from her own folly, and avenge himself upon Jade Fox.<br/><br/>Whilst I really like this movie, I perhaps don't quite admire it as much as a lot of folks, purely because I've always loved Cantonese kung-fu movies, particularly those of Tsui Hark or Wei Lo. What's great about it is that because it was made by an acclaimed director of arty dramas (such as Yin Shi Nan Nu / Eat Drink Man Woman and The Ice Storm), it encouraged lots of people who wouldn't normally check out a chop-socky flick to go and enjoy themselves, made some critics sit up and pay attention, and encouraged other directors (such as Yimou Zhang) to branch out into action films. It's other great feature is its clever combination of dazzling wirework with digital airbrushing - during the fight scenes the actors fly around, run up walls, leap impossible distances and perform incredible spinning moves in real time, with Peter Pau's breathless camera following them through every amazing feat. This type of action had all been done before (for example, in Suk San: San Suk Saan Geen Hap / Zu Warriors From The Magic Mountain), but never with such a freedom to choreograph and photograph it in any way the director might want. Lee turns in some astounding scenes; my favourite is the initial running fight between Zhiyi and Yeoh, and invests the characters with real depth, contrasting Jen's selfish immaturity with Mu Bai and Shu Lien's unspoken love for each other. The martial arts staging by Wo Ping Yuen is absolutely first-rate, and Tan Dun's score is rich and haunting, varying from period percussion to lush strings. All the actors are terrific (Yeoh especially), somehow managing to be both subtle and vulnerable in one scene and then performing their crazy acrobatics the next. A great international multicultural movie, with four excellent leads, all differing nationalities - Chinese (Zhiyi), Malaysian (Yeoh), Hong Kong (Yun-Fat) and Taiwanese (Chang). Shot in China, distributed by American majors and a well-deserved smash-hit success worldwide, both critically and commercially. Based on a book by Du Lu Wang; English title is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
"ntsci","Null","0","1","3 February 2008"," OK film, but terrible fight scenes
","Badly choreographed fights scenes detract from what would otherwise have been a decent film. The traditional Kung Fu movie always had the actors perform superhuman feats, but they were done in a way that always left one thinking, wow, how did he do that. But in this movie, the wire work is so obvious it kills all possible enjoyment of the martial arts. One doesn't think, ""how did she do that"" because the wires are just so obvious. And if the flying and jumping is so obviously fake that it make you think the entire fight scene is fake. Realism is fight scene is especially important when viewing a woman engaged in martial arts; to buy into the idea that she is a great warrior, the audience has to believe in her skill. So its particularly important that skill show be at least plausible.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning. The story might have been interesting, but I was so turned off by the poor quality of the action sequences that I really stopped paying attention to the story. I've seen many, many eastern martial arts films and this one has the worse choreography of them all."
"Baby_Seal_Clubber","5","0","4","18 February 2007"," Strings, Tao and Yo-Yo Ma
","Croching Tiger, hidden dragon by Ang Lee is based on a five volume novel written by Wang Du Lu. Ang Lee tries to shorten down these five volumes into a two hour movie. I haven't read the novel so I can only assume this is the reason for all the plot holes and the some what incoherent story. I will not even attempt to sum it all up here but its basically a story involving a bunch of sword fights, some macho-sadistic sex, some love, some eastern philosophy and some more sword fights. <br/><br/>To enhance the sword fights and distance himself from ""lethal weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" Ang Lee uses a bunch of strings (The loose ones from the script perhaps? Im sorry, don't pay that one any attention) and computers. The characters fly around, run on water and jumps from tree to tree. These strings and computers could easily give my grand mother these powers, which kind of brings me towards my point. I love fighting movies ala Bruce Lee, and I totally respect the beauty and hardship that lays behind a good ""sword-fighter"". Fencing, dancing, singing and why not acting are all quality's that are admirable in those that master it. But what is there to admire when all the work is done by strings and computers? The F/X guy? Should I be amazed at the fact that they are flying when superman did the same thing years ago? Ang Lee did however succeed at distancing himself from ""Lethal weapons"" and Die hards"" these movies don't try to pretend they exist for any other reason then explosions and fist fights. Ang Lee is working with false marketing, this is really nothing but: A bunch of truisms and quasi philosophy, without any real meaning, in between the (after a while) quite boring fencing numbers. Or in short: An overly pretentious action movie with subtitles."
"donbendell","8","0","1","25 January 2007"," Still a damn fine movie and well worth watching
","""This review no doubt has been colored a bit by the hype (and backlash) this movie has received. And after witnessing some of last year's ""best"" movies, which ranged from okay action-adventure (Gladiator) to mindless, manipulative mush (Erin Brockovich), I can clearly see why many US reviewers call this the best movie of the year. I agree with them to an extent; Crouching Tiger has everything the best films have -- a credible story, strong script, good sets/cinematography and powerful performances. But is this, as some have called it, ""one of the best films of all time?"" I would say not. It's certainly a great movie, but it's lacking that certain spark that sets great films apart from classic ones. While watching this movie, I got a sense of déjà vu, as in I've seen most of what's contained in here before.<br/><br/>Perhaps I've watched too many HK movies lately (is that a good thing or bad thing?) or was too critical going into this movie, but I found myself picking it apart by the parts, rather than the whole. I admit that this may not be the best way to view (and review) a movie, but the structure of Crouching Tiger lent itself to this kind of criticism. At any rate, the film combines elements from many successful wuxia movies -- the desert setting, flashback use and theme of unreciprocated love of Ashes of Time, the high-flying fights of Swordsman II, and so on. This of itself is not really a bad thing -- when was the last time you saw a wholly original movie? -- but, again, as I've watched a spate of these films of late, I found myself saying ""well, that was done better in another movie..."".<br/><br/>However, the movie gels together well, mostly through the performances of Michelle Yeoh (who didn't even know basic Mandarin before this film) and especially newcomer Zhang Ziyi, who is Crouching Tiger's real star. I wish the film had concentrated more on their pseudo-sister relationship, rather than using a good portion of the movie to Zhang and Chang's relationship. Even though Chang gets a good amount of screen time, his character is underwritten for his prominence in the story, and he seems more of a MacGuffin (plot device) than anything else. In fact, upon looking at this movie, it seems the opposite of many others in the genre. The male characters seem more superfluous, while it is the women who dominate. Again, this is not a bad thing, but when love and relationships figure so highly into a story, it seems kind of silly to only develop one side of a particular relationship.<br/><br/>Action-wise, Crouching Tiger does a good job. There isn't as much as some other movies, but what's in there is done well. Yuen Woo-Ping's touch is present in the sequences (people climbing walls, jumping across rooftops, etc.), but it's subdued enough so people who don't like wire-fu won't be too off-put by it. My only real complaint with the action is that the computer-fu stuff (people flying about) looks pretty fake in parts, though it's not as bad as some recent HK movies like A Man Called Hero.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Crouching Tiger doesn't quite live up to the hype, but is still a damn fine movie and well worth watching. Despite its' problems, it does deliver a good story, performances and action, and provides solid entertainment for both HK film novices and veterans alike. One great thing has come from this movie already -- it has gotten some people who previously thought kung fu/martial arts films were ""stupid"" or ""silly"" to take the genre seriously."""

","When I first saw this film back in December of 2000(?), I thought this was a decent, but not superb, film. I was amazed later by the great accolade showered on it by American public and professional critics. It was a decent film with a superb cinematography but with an incredible overuse of wire-assisted flying and cliché plot. If Chinese martial artists could fly like this, why should we need Wright brothers or Bleriot? Even as a fantasy, this movie's flying is overdone. This movie reminded me of late Mary Martin as Peter Pan or Sally Field as the Flying Nun.<br/><br/>The plot was OK but rather cliché and formulaic. So many other Chinese martial arts movie have similar plots. <br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, I didn't think much of this film and did not understand the superlatives used by many to describe this film.<br/><br/>Several weeks ago I was discussing this film with a Chinese-American friend. He is totally bilingual in Mandarin-Chinese and English and carefully studied Chinese culture and literature (both classical and modern popular). According to him and many Chinese IMDb commentators, this film was a total bomb in mainland China. He mentioned several reasons:<br/><br/>1. To a native Mandarin speaker, the lead actors'(Chow Yan-fat's and Michelle Yeoh's) Chinese were HORRIBLE! Chow spoke his Mandarin with such a thick Cantonese accent that some Beijing movie audience roared in laughter whenever he spoke. One IMDb commentator compared his speech to George W. Bush saying, ""Hi, I'm from New York."" According to my friend, it is worse than that. It is like Jimmy Carter with his thick Georgia accent claiming to be Brooklyn-born and Brooklyn-raised. <br/><br/>Michelle Yeoh's Mandarin was even worse. With her Malaysian accent, it was like a foreigner speaking Chinese. It was like our Californian governor Arnold Schwarznegger saying, ""I vas born in Zakramendo, Kalifornia."" How can these two clowns pretend to be Ching-dynasty Chinese martial artists working in Beijing area?<br/><br/>2. The plot is rather cliché and uninvolving. This movie was based on the fourth novel of a wushiu pentalogy. By the time of the fourth novel, the two main characters in the movie have gone through so many things together. Also, there are many other important characters in the pentalogy who were never even mentioned in the movie. Because the movie omitted many of the plots in the first three novels, the audience (many of them have never read the pentalogy) could not get fully involved with these two main characters. <br/><br/>Also, the original pentalogy is neither inspiring nor unique. It is a competently written work, but not the best in the wushiu genre. In fact, the writer expressed his regrets about writing this pentalogy. The screenwriters of this movie dumbed up the original novel, which was only an OK novel to begin with, and made a rather mediocre and cliché screenplay in the style of Hollywood. <br/><br/>3. The wushiu in the movie was OK but not superb. There are many, many martial arts movies and many of them have better fight scenes than this movie. This move is definitely not the sine qua non of the genre. <br/><br/>American audience and professional critics, because of their ignorance of Chinese language and culture, did not know any of this. Many of them LOVED this rather mediocre movie. Academy Award voters nominated this movie for Academy Award in many categories. Go ahead. Keep on loving this mediocre movie. Ignorance is bliss, indeed."

","I had heard so much about Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" that I practically refused to see it. Fortunately, I finally came to my senses. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a wonderful film! This movie is most-often associated with its spectacular battle scenes, and I would be lying if I said that they were anything less than magnificent. Yuen Wo-Ping, choreographer of the martial arts sequences for this film and ""The Matrix,"" out-does himself in terms of creativity with his work here. I personally felt that the fight in the trees toward the end of the film was one of the films many highlights. The intensity of the duel between Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) was absolutely captivating. The fights would be pointless though, if not for the powerful story that holds the film together. A master swordsman named Li Mu Bai (Yun Fat Chow) must recover a stolen sword with the help of his longtime comrade, Yu Shu Lien. They soon discover that the thief is not quite who they thought it was, which makes recovering the sword much more difficult and dangerous than either of them could have imagined. The story seems very basic, but it really isn't. The performances do much to bring it all to life. The grace of Michelle Yeoh is daunting enough, but when she unsheathes her sword, the word, ""daunting"" is redefined. The very young and very beautiful Ziyi Zhang gives a very passionate performance as Jen Yu. Pei-pei Cheng provides the film with the deadly Jade Fox. Yun Chow Fat plays a very reserved master swordsman, anchoring emotional performances from everyone else. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" definitely lives up to the hype; 10 Oscar Nominations can't be wrong!"

","I grew up watching wuxia (chinese martial arts) films and my favourite shows were the 'Once upon a time in China' series starring Jet Li and a couple of other well-loved Hongkong wuxia serials. Perhaps they mayn't be the best but CTHD was nowhere near their standard. <br/><br/>From the start, the strangely-accented Mandarin of Li Mu Bai, Shu Lian and Dark Cloud jarred the entire feeling and mood of the movie. (No offense to Chow Yun Fatt and Michelle Yeoh.) Zhang Ziyi came close but only when Master Tie spoke did one get the feeling that this was a Chinese film.<br/><br/>Next was the simply-rendered dialogue, which one can hear on the streets today. It was simply unbearable. There was none of the formal speech of those times. (Just watch any Jin Yong series and you'll get an idea. All those witty conversations using idioms and verses are really cool..)<br/><br/>The movie was anything but traditional. We hardly see Jen's parents enough to feel the oppressiveness that she felt. The only paternal presence that could be felt was in the form of Master Tie. In fact, it seemed to be more of a teenage-angst type of movie, like the O.C. or Friends, where the youth just did whatever they wanted. The parents etc... seemed to be placed there only as an dummy obstacle.<br/><br/>Being filled with a lot of teenage angst from Miss Jen, it is rather mind-boggling as to what she is really angry about. Her wedding? Fair enough. But that doesn't warrant picking a fight with the pugilists in sight, running off to Shu Lian to cry after that and then suddenly breaking off all ties with her, when she was the one who initiated the friendship first? She may be a strong-headed person, but also most certainly insincere and a bit psychotic, I might add.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is very little character development here. Shu Lian confided in Jen but still one knows nothing about how Shu Lian and Li Mu Bai actually grew closer together and who they really are, to appreciate the close bond between them.<br/><br/>And oh yes, the plot. What plot, really? A princess falling in love and eloping with a bohemian in the desert sounds really exotic, I guess but the bohemian wasn't even suave enough to sweep one off one's feet. Plus his Mandarin sounded terrible. Perhaps it was just to show off the fighting skills, which admittedly were awesome but the lack of tension during these scenes made one feel like it was a match between two robots.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Jade Fox. Bleah. I started off watching in a happy mood and one hour after it ended, I'm still in a bad mood. See the dark clouds over my head? The only good things in the movie are Chow Yun Fatt and the calligraphy scene but Chow's 1-D role does him little justice. Watch Jin Yong shows instead. The fighting is better; the plot and characters a hundred times more interesting."

","Ah. It's amazing to see how such a common film like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon can manage to garner such an intriguing fan war. For the record, I liked this movie, and what has been said is true, the cinematography was amazing. However, considering that we're talking about a movie that is but one amongst many of the same wuxia genre, this movie is highly overrated.<br/><br/>I realize that a lot of the attention garnered for this movie was thanks to the fact that it is an Eastern movie that seemed to appeal to a Western audience. I don't mean for it to sound insulting, but we in the West tend to have a unique attention span that is easily distracted by new things. CTHD is certainly that for the West. However, considering how I've grown up on HK movies and Chinese serial dramas, this movie was nothing new. In fact, it was much of the same old stuff but almost worse in a way since Ang Lee didn't bother bringing the first 3 novels of a quintology to life and jumped head first into the 4th. Don't get me wrong. I love Ang Lee and think he's quite the amazing guy, but that does not mean the guy is constantly batting 1000 in my book.<br/><br/>For one, why Mandarin? I realize that Lee wanted to appeal to a larger audience with that, but I believe that enough of the Eastern world is so used to seeing dubbed movies and serials that it wouldn't really bother them.<br/><br/>Secondly, why did Lee choose to go with a more balletic style of choreography versus the more traditional heavier-feeling style of choreography? While I didn't feel that it took too much away from the movie, many of my Asian friends did complain that making the choreography that balletic took away what little semblance of belief you had left. (FYI, the wuxia genre traditionally employs the ""flying"" technique with wires, but it is usually not done in such an...effortless feel. I'm not really sure how to describe it, but watch CTHD against the choreography in any Asian serial of recently years, and you'll understand what I mean.)<br/><br/>Third, why the 4th book? Many of the complaints toward this movie concerned how disconnect the plot felt, and I have to agree. While I had a good deal of background on this movie, I still felt there were too many details that were just left hanging in the air. <br/><br/>However, despite all that, Lee does an admirable job of constructing a coherent story. The actors, despite the language hurdles and various other issues, performed rather decently in their parts. The thing about the wuxia genre is that the movies/serials have to be view as more than just the sum of its parts. With rare exceptions, one good actor can't carry such dept of story and a good cast can do nothing to improve a poorly constructed plot. In Lee's case, the end result was more than just the sum of its parts. Deconstructing CTHD makes one wonder why one would view such a flick in the first place. However, put everything together in one place, and you've got a fairly decent way to waste a few hours. Granted, my preferences for this particular story would run more toward seeing the recently made Chinese serial rather than this movie since the story is better developed, but hey, to each his own.<br/><br/>Overall, an admirable six stars out of ten."

Director Ang Lee's highly innovative valentine to his beloved martial arts films of his youth is best served by his clear-eyed approach to a genre riddled with mystique enhanced by compelling characters with a simple plot line (stoic warrior Chow's unique sword is stolen and honor must be restored in 19th century China) and some jaw-dropping state-of-the-art visuals with gravity defying balletic fight sequences (thanks largely to expert instructor Yuen Wo-Ping). Ziyi gives an overnight sensational star-making turn as a regal bride to be with a secret: she's a protégé in the making as a warrior to be reckoned with as a butt-kicking wunderkind. Epic storytelling with obvious heartfelt immediacy underscored by classical musician Yo-Yo Ma's pungent score. Benchmark moviemaking at its finest."

","I saw this film in Japan (as Green Destiny) long before it was released in Europe, which was great ... but with one minor drawback - it was shown with a Chinese soundtrack and Japanese subtitles which meant that I, as a determined monoglot, struggled somewhat to keep up with the story. Given the price of cinema tickets in Japan, I was not best pleased.<br/><br/>This might not have been so bad if so many of the characters hadn't been sporting identical haircuts - as it was, I spent the first 60 minutes of the film thinking two people were actually one person. And then there was a flash back sequence that left me baffled for a while. Luckily, my wife was on hand to provide a whispered commentary (""He very impressed her skill"" etc.)<br/><br/>But, that aside, this is cracking film that I had hoped Hollywood would take notice of and imitate. Sadly, they have not. This film has intelligence, decent acting, great scenery and, of course, some very good fight scenes.<br/><br/>Well worth a look see if you get the chance .. or buy it on DVD and watch with English subtitles rather than listening to the awful dubbed soundtrack."

","I can't believe that I'm reading so many negative reviews for this film. I can only imagine that these viewers are expecting to see a different type of a movie.  Yes, there are some martial arts in this movie, but this movie is not a martial arts movie.  To me the movie is primarily a story of unfulfilled passions and of the immense sadness of the love to two truly good souls who, rightly or wrongly, can never bring their love to fruition until it is too late.<br/><br/>Imagine going to see a Bruce Lee type Kung Fu movie and getting something like this in return (and please don't get me wrong, I love some of the old Bruce Lee movies as well, but that's a totally different genre of movies). I bet that's the cause of a lot of disappointed reviews here - this is NOT an action, martial arts movie, even though a lot of people are expecting to get that when they see this movie.<br/><br/>What may make it worse for those expecting a fast paced, traditional martial arts movie is that this is a very deliberately paced movie and takes it's time developing both the mood, relationships and the story.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed - almost like a ballet dance. Ang Lee also eschewed computer generated special effects for traditional ones with actors and stunt doubles (though it is my understanding that most of the actors did many of the stunts themselves).  Again, this has led to complaints that the effects don't look as 'good' as in other modern movies. Again, I beg to differ.  This was again a very deliberate decision, and IMHO a really good one.  It gives the movie a totally different, almost 'classic' feel.<br/><br/>If you want to see a fast paced, martial arts action movie, I would suggest you choose something else.  However, if you want to see something truly special, check this great movie out."

","Watching CTHD for the 2nd time last night, found myself enjoying and liking the film even better than I did the first time.  1st time was on VHS, this time on DVD, which allowed me to cheat and watch it with the English dubbing, and not do the subtitles, allowing me to better concentrate on the movie without having to read the dialogue.  Being able to do so, got to appreciate the film even more. I have read a lot of harsh criticism on the messaging board for this movie, and really do not understand it.  I can understand one personally not finding the movie their cup of tea, but to be so bad mouthing of a film that did not warrant it in any way shape or form... people who just don't get it, and most likely frequent and see movies like Deuce Bigelow, or Real Spring Break Cancun, or, whatever that flick that was that had the American idol winners in it... for future reference, all of you keep your ignorance to yourself. The 1st time I saw CTHD, I didn't know what it was going into it, and have never really watched any 'martial arts' films before... remember the gravity-defying sequences as a detraction to me, it's unrealism - sometimes I am too highly realistic.   This time around, letting myself go, allowing myself to be taken in by the Wudan trained ability of being able to free themselves of the physical boundaries that bind us, was able to be entertained by the grace, beauty and magic of it. The movie itself is a very beautiful movie, both cinematically, obviously - beautifully shot, the sequence in the trees is just a visionary, beautiful, etheral dream that is unequalled.  And the story is quite good, since I have at least, a minimal understanding and Eastern culture and philosophy, really a beautiful story of love, freedom, tradition, heritage, culture, passion, and the living spirit.  I certainly recommend it to those who are, intelligent, learned, broad and open minded, and true cinema movie go'ers out there. <br/><br/>To those who bad mouthed it the way they did, isn't there some reality television show on right now for you to go watch?!"

","I was really looking forward to this movie and finally got round to catching it on DVD. Firstly, I admit that I watched the dubbed version which, although approved by Ang Lee, was stunted and did the film a disservice. The voice acting was wooden - simple as that. Hey - it was late and I didn't fancy keeping an eye on subtitles!<br/><br/>The plotline was interesting but nothing special - the story of a stolen sword intertwining with that of a young woman who must decide which path she wants to take in her life. It's quite long winded but worth sticking with despite it ham-fistedness because the loose ends are tied up quite beautifully.<br/><br/>The only great thing about this film is the visuals that are simply stunning. The fight scenes are over rated and what really stands out is the gentle cinematography that frames the story in a mythical almost childlike fashion. It's basically a fairytale - just imagine you were to write down the story on paper and read it to your children (once upon a time there was a mighty sword....)<br/><br/>I was left fairly cold by this film, despite the beautifully poetic ending. I disagree with what some others have written in that I don't think this is a better film than Gladiator.

But the feel of the movie was, to me, as if the director were trying to pass off this Poppins-like fantasy as reality.

Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, giving one glimpses of China never seen.  Second, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat were great.  I was especially surprised to see Chow do so well for an actor known as a gun toting hero.  The fight scenes were, for the most part, well choreographed, especially the scene with Michelle and Ying Zhang.<br/><br/>So why overrated?  First of all, there were many kung-fu movies with similar or even better fight scenes.  Second, I just couldn't buy the ""flying leaps"" seen here, especially for a film trying to be dramatic; how do they get the magic to do it?  Third, the character of the princess just annoyed me.  I think it would have been better to focus more on the characters of Michelle and Chow than on what seemed to be a spoiled brat.  Finally, I try to get the main gist of the film, but it just doesn't come to me.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, if Ang Lee's name wasn't on this film, I doubt it would have gotten the recognition it got.  Yes, I know that's how the world turns, but a director's name can't influence how you see a film; it should be able to stand on its own.

A dazzling tale of swords, sorcery, and powerful drama, Crouching Tiger is truly a sight to behold.<br/><br/>Lee Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a highly skilled warrior, has given his legend ary sword, the Green Destiny, to the elder Sir Te (Lung Sihung). However, one night, while Mu Bai is staying at Sir Te's palace, a young thief named Jen (Zhang Ziyi) steals the sword. A chase throughout the grounds ensues, and Jen is eventually cornered by Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), Mu Bai's good friend and fellow warrior.<br/><br/>It seems that Jen, a governor's daughter and bride-to-be, has secretly been taught martial arts by the infamous assassin Jade Fox, who killed Mu Bai's master. What ensues is a gripping and lifelike drama, as we learn of Jen's past and her passionate romance with a desert wanderer (Chang Chen).<br/><br/>The moving plot is simply amplified by the spectacular fight scenes, choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping (The Matrix). Each fight goes beyond the proceedings - they don't just consist of two or three people going at it like angry zebras. The bouts are stunning in their complexity, and are much like the martial arts themselves - balanced yet brutal, delicate but deadly.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those movies that you must own simply for the fact that you can watch and rewatch your favorite scenes, and never get tired of them. The action is fantastic, the characters are deep and realistic (you can spend hours just questioning their actions and motivations, and figuring out what makes them tick), and the direction and cinematography are nothing short of top-notch. The soundtrack, which won an Oscar at the 2001 Academy Awards ceremony, is beautiful and evocative, and perfectly fits the mood and atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an absolute triumph of imagery and imagination.

Warriors flitting from tree to tree, soaring across the tops of buildings...  This was not my type of action at all.<br/><br/>The romance was blah.  I mean, it was well-acted or whatever, but there was nothing special about it.  A typical love story set in an atypical, unbelievable context.<br/><br/>Basically, what we have with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a big budget, a good choreographer, and a few good actors.

","I saw this film for the first time a year and a half ago and I have to say that I didn't like it. I found it over-complicated and over-directed although the fight scenes, the photography and the music were beautiful. Anyway I thought it was overrated in many aspects. When the HBO started to air it about two months ago I didn't care about it. Then everything has changed. Last week a saw Zhang Yimou's wonderful movie 'The Road Home' (1999) and I saw Zhang Ziyi, a beautiful young and talented Chinese actress in it. I decided to find out more about her and I saw that she played in this movie, too. Then I decided to check this movie again. And this time it lived up to my expectations. Zhang Ziyi, playing Xiou Long, is extraordinary and steals the show. She has the chance to follow Gong Li on her throne as the 'Queen of the Chinese cinema'. As I said the photography and the music were all superb but I still think it is slow and over-complicated at times. But there are much more for this movie than against it. In conclusion I would say that there are movies which are better at the second time and one has to find its hidden values. I would recommend it for the lovers of the Asian cinema along with 'The Road Home'."

","It seems the worst thing you can do is trust the enthusiastic reviews and the unbelievably overblown hype some titles - CTHD included - enjoy in abundance.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a reviewer myself - words would fail me had I tried to describe in detail how bad this movie is. It's not the flying thing, that was actually amusing, not annoying. The fight scenes themselves were fairly average - still, I enjoyed them. At least they helped me stay awake.<br/><br/>It's just that CTHD desperately tries to tell a story that is not there. What I have seen was just a heap of scraps glued together in some vain attempt to make up for a storyline. The beginning is somewhat promising and then after 15 minutes or so everything starts falling apart. New characters appear out of nowhere, things happen for no apparent reason, emerging subplots turn out absolutely meaningless. Now, I know this was supposed to be a story about love, but I expected some logic nevertheless. Silly me. The desert part caught me off-guard, just as I was beginning to doze off, and kept me puzzled for the next half an hour. There is no momentum, the pace is in reverse proportion to the swiftness of the fighters. Halfway through I still didn't care a bit how this was going to end. All the excellent performances I'd read so much about turned out to be just mannequins walking or flying around, staring blankly at other mannequins' faces and going off into overdrawn conversations on a par with an average ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" episode. I can't remember a single laugh from any of them, not a tear shed, not a single expression of unrestrained emotion. I'm not sure which of those dummy figures I was supposed to dislike or sympathize with. I wouldn't be able to anyway.<br/><br/>The only good thing about it is that I didn't see it in a theater.

","There are a million movies from Asia that look just like this one.  People run, they jump, occasionally kick, and are generally aggressive towards one another.  This movie is no different save for the fact that people fly while kicking their legs helplessly.  It's an overuse of an effect that only detracts from the story rather than enhances it.<br/><br/>Taking a cue from Hollywood, there is also an unimportant love story in the middle of the movie.  It stretches out for over ten minutes only to set up a scene at the last minute of the movie, something that could have been handled by another character's dialogue.  It also suffers from ""Romeo and Juliet syndrome,"" showing that two people can meet, fall in love, and be separated within 24 hours time, then obsess about each other forever after. It's disappointing that so many feet of film were wasted on this unnecessary diversion rather than extending the character development of Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien.

"Sinnerman","6","0","1","6 October 2002"," Lensed with western eyes in mind
","Back in 2000, I gave a rousing take on CTHD long before the Hollywood Marketing machinery made it into a western cultural phenomenon. I was lying then....Being of Chinese descent, I just could not bring myself to come down too hard on a landmark movie so many people associate as a beacon of Chinese/ Asia cinema. But with the passage of time and the buzz all but fizzled, I see fit to bring up my alternate take on this whole ""CTHD"" phenomenon.   Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, despite its many accolades by Western critics and audiences alike, alienated many discerning Asian audiences(including myself). <br/><br/>Granted, it was a technically and aesthetically accomplished film. But it lacked a distinct Asian feel that is hard to put to words. Films by Zhang Yimou(To Live) or even Ang Lee's past efforts(Eat Drink Man Woman) had that elusive, thematic quality, but not CTHD. <br/><br/>Many in Asia thus felt that CTHD(whether intentional or otherwise) ""relented"" too much in its attempts to meet a western checklist of what constituted a good Asian film (exotic location, death defying choreography, sweeping epic plot with hidden underlying themes etc).<br/><br/> At this point, do let me clarify that I am not a backlash critic. I don't exactly hate CTHD. I am just disappointed that it was so blantantly pandering to western tastes, when it could have retained its Asian sensibilities and still achieved greatness on the international front(much like Zhang Yi Mou or Miyazaki Films).<br/><br/>Either way, CTHD notwtihstanding, I do not think Asian films will truly arrive on the international stage as long as films like CTHD still get the disproportionate western response in lieu of its equally, if not more important Asian acceptance."

And, yes I know that the dragon was hiding, but you should at least of seen his tail or maybe he could have breathed fire or something. So where was the tiger?<br/><br/>

But not Ang Lee, oh no, he gets to direct The Hulk. And what do you think the chances of us actually seeing this Hulk are? Well, judging by this film pretty slim. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I watched this film twice (cos I started shouting at the screen, got thrown out and thought I might have missed the dragon), so I know what was going on, but even that baffled me. Basically the whole film idea is ripped off of from a pantomime called Peter Pan'.<br/><br/>
For those of you who don't know what a Pantomime is, it's a kind of play that we have over here in Britain, mostly at Christmas time. In these pantomimes, men dress as women and vice versa, and in Peter Pan a woman dressed as a man gets pulled across the stage suspended by wires. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Most of the rooftop chase scenes reminded me of pantomimes, so I started shouting out in the cinema `He's behind you!' or replying to the characters arguments with `Oh no you're not!' This guy with a torch then asked me to leave so I shouted `Oh no I won't!' and a dozen ushers grappled me to the floor.<br/><br/>In my dragon related film marking system, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only gets 9 points, this is bearing in mind that both Reign of Fire got 17 points and Pete's Dragon got 18 points for having an accurate title."

You think all the Chinese movie stars are like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan , or Chow Yun Fat. Over the years, there were several films describing parts of modern Chinese society, for example, ""Eat Drink, Man, Woman"" and ""Pushing Hands.""

","This movie wowed the critics and audiences alike in America and is a major disappointment in China.  I hate to say it but I agree with the Chinese.  Maybe the description as a romantic martial-arts epic should have been enough warning. 	Chow Yun Fat is the aging warrior who decides to hang up his sword apparently to begin hanging out with his female counterpart, Michelle Yeoh. On her last mission she takes the super-sword to the hours of their leader and it is promptly stolen by a female ninja.  Chow shows up and they get the sword back after quickly figuring out it was stolen by the spoiled brat daughter of, I think, the Governor.  It seems her governess is the under-cover Jade Fox, the villain who killed Chow's master.  Now Chow is out for revenge on Jade Fox and at the same time offering to teach the daughter because he sees unlimited potential.  Super warrior Michelle Yeoh is pining away for Chow and there is a desert pirate who has come to town looking for the daughter, who is about to be forced into marriage, because they love each other. 	AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH...This was ridiculous.  First there was no chemistry between Chow and Michelle.  Second there were too many story-lines competing to the detriment of the whole.  Third a good portion of this was shot at night in what was supposed to be ancient China which meant, you got it, limited light thus limiting the ability to see.  Fourth the martial arts scenes were sorely lacking.  Sure the choreography was great when they were on the ground but they were so over the top with the wire work that it quickly became something out of a comic book and a bad comic book to boot. Fifth --- <br/><br/>
SPOILER ALERT--and I must warn you if you intend to see this joke of a movie this could ruin the ending--SPOILER ALERT--<br/><br/>
why do women consider romances to be about either someone dying or cheating on another person?  At least in this one the cheating aspect wasn't there but two of the main characters do die in the end.  But hey, it was a romantic death. 	GARBAGE"

Instead of just exaggerating the physical abilities of the characters, they simply rewrote the laws of physics. Suddenly they are flying around in unbelievable ways.  The only justification for this in the plot is that they found some book that they studied to tell them how to fight this way.  I'd like to get that book!<br/><br/>Another thing that made me laugh was the Jade Fox character.  We are lead to believe that this somewhat old lady is able to fight off three people.  And she didn't even learn the special flying techniques some of the others knew (she couldn't read the book, she only looked at the pictures!).  It was pretty funny, sort of like seeing your mother really kicking some ass.  And this was the main villain in the movie.<br/><br/>One thing that was a little annoying about the fighting scenes was that there were something like 10,000 punches and kicks thrown and almost nothing ever connected.  And when they did connect, the other guy just went flying off to another wall or roof or tree.<br/><br/>Another scene that was pretty funny was the one were Jen is sitting in the restaurant and the group of 15 or so guys go to attack her.  She is probably just over 100 pounds and these big guys attack her while she is sitting down and she kind of just blocks them to the side with a single arm and she is not in the least bit jostled.  It's funny, when she's flying around she's super light, but in this scene she is suddenly as dense as lead. HA HA HA!<br/><br/>Best comedy of the year! 10 out of 10<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this movie certainly does not justify the high rating it has here.

It doesn't really make the story predictable, but the writers still could have surprised us a bit.<br/><br/>2- Some characters who know the secrets of Wudan, well they can fly (or float or whatever).

","This is a one of the very rare movies that I enjoy seeing mor than once. It is an epic tale in sight, sound and motion. Scenes of rich beauty, elegance and aesthetics, slowly paced, alternate with those of high speed and incredible acrobatics. It's a story of contrasting loves, of morals and virtues, of indecency and greatness. From different perspectives man's age old search for self-fulfilment and freedom is told. There is the Crouching Tiger, the passionate young aristrocat and there is the Hidden Dragon, the wise scholar who has mastered his martial arts to a level of mere intention. Both fail to reach their goals as humans, bound to physical appearances. However, both know that there is a future, created by their love, trust and will."

Do you believe that wirework is the puppetry of Satan?  If so, please spare yourself some teeth grinding grief and don't go and see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  You won't like it.  It will make you think, and that will scare you, and when you get scared, you get angry, and then you will give this astonishing film low votes.  Nobody wins when that happens.<br/><br/>Be clear on this, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon isn't a martial arts film in the Jet Li sense.  It's a mature romantic drama, with spiritual/fantasy overtones in the style of Star Wars.  Just assume that the characters are using the Force, and note they're doing it consistently: the pragmatic Shu Lien has to bounce off walls, while the talented Jen can leap dizzying heights, and the nearly transcendent Li Mu Bai merely has to point to soar into the sky.  It's magic, it's extreme spirituality. Accept that, or please stay away.<br/><br/>However, if you have a soul and a mental age above the kindergarden level, you'll quickly understand what Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is doing, then you can just get on with being utterly astonished by the breathtaking beauty, excitement, joy and sadness.

","Funny, how the best film to grace American screens in the year 2000, isn't even American, but a 12 million dollar export from Taiwan, that is quite possibly the greatest film to grace any screen in a long, long time.  In a sentence, that's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The plot is simple, lacking the stresses of modern ""civilization"" (if that's what you call it.) Instead, it lets you lose yourself in China, at a mystical time when the world was full of innocence and superstition, and, you know, beauty.<br/><br/>
Sure, it should be noted that this isn't an all out, ""bucks for blood"" action flick.  It has action, yes, but it has a lot more:  romance, comedy, intelligence, and true magnificent beauty.  So, there is no Anti-humanoid getting shot hundreds of times and making it to the end credits, crack pushers, or bad DUBBING.  No, it's a film that relies on it's great characters to move the story along.  These characters are strong, complex, and brillantly played by (here's a little ironic twist) by Oscar snubbed actors:  Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi.<br/><br/>
What this film lacks is bad acting, though it makes up (and then some) with a mastery of visual technique and mesmurizing music.  The landscape carries you from all ends of China.  The choreographed fight sequences of Yuen Wo Ping will leave you breathless and completely amazed.  Once you add the camera work to this blend of visual technique, you have some extraordinary eye candy.  Tan Dun's music is both haunting and beautiful, complimenting the actions on the screen...enough so, as to say that this film could still amazed without dialogue.  It has the magic that those early nitrate films exsorbing with every frame.<br/><br/>Okay, this film may have some exaggerated moments.  Isn't that why we choose to go to see films in the first place?  To escape reality for a couple of hours and say ""okay, impress me"".  This film has what most don't: IMAGINATION.  Thank you, Ang Lee.<br/><br/>As I walked in the theatre, I noticed a sign posted...""Crouching Tiger"" is in subtitles.  I walked out, two hours later figuring out how many ways plain English would've ruined the film, I looked at the other posters for upcoming ""movies"", etc.  I just think...""Shame on Hollywood"".<br/><br/>""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""...10/10"

","This martial arts epic makes it biggest stride yet into the mainstream of American cimema and its consciousness with this supercharged effort from director Ang Lee(Ride With The Devil and Sense and Sensibility). As on the same wavelength as a Sergio Leone western,this film is basically the first time that Americans can see it without the dubbing since the entire film is in Taiwanese. It is a film of deep complexity and depthas it tackle such issues as honor,devotion,and compassion. The story is very interesting since it deals with the taking of a jade green sword,and then all of a sudden the film kicks into high gear with startling plot twists and astounding action sequences which are the movie's strongest selling points which find characters flying in the air and engaging in combat which perched on either buildings or spindly branches(since the action here was choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping known for his breathtaking effects that really had moviegoers going nuts in ""The Matrix""). This is a film that defines the laws of gravity here,and it's action-packed all the way making it a runaway hit internationally. The scene stealer here is a 18 year old dynamo named Zhang Ziyi who is remarkable opposite her counterparts Chow Yun-Fat(of ""The Replacement Killers"",and ""Anna and the King""),and martial arts actress superstar Michelle Yeoh(of ""Supercop"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies""). The best kung-fu flick since the days of Bruce Lee has there never been a film that keeps the audience in constant suspense along with breathtaking excitement. Rating: *****1/2 out of *****-Worth the price of admission."

Firstly, to dislike a movie because it is unbelievable is such a hollow, predictable, transparent and moronic comment that I can hardly read it.  In case you people haven't noticed, cinema is generally as unrealistic as it gets.  Even your basic film noir detective murder story is hugely unrealistic--how many of us are involved in murders?  How many of us are detectives?  How many of us are surrounded by violence and crime?  A very small number.  Film is a rare combination of art and entertainment, and Crouching Tiger was a beautiful blend of the two.  The fighting scenes were visually stunning, wonderfully choreographed, peaceful, and a joy to view.  No other film has ever portrayed fighting in such an artful and creative way.  The film has deep meaning, and is innocently simple-minded and slow paced.  It takes the viewer on a multitude of adventures yet seems fast-paced on the surface. If people flying really bothers you that much, especially if it wouldn't have bothered you had Ang Lee told the viewer this is not intended to be real, all I have to say is grow up (reviewer below).  Stop wasting your time and money watching movies.

Everybody was saying the story was so beautiful and how it touched them and that it will surely win an Oscar for best picture, but I was disappointed to even see it nominated in that category. And it definitely stole  it for best score. But enough about that. The one and only thing the movie's got going for it are the amazing fighting scenes wich are done really well and precise.

Afterwards I just went home and went to bed at 10 o' clock on a Friday night. I have to blame everything on the people that put together the trailer of the movie - they presented it as a sort of kung fu movie, making sure that they only showed the action sequences and the effects (about 15% of the movie) and none of the boring stuff (you do the math). And that has never happened to me before, I always knew al least what kind of a movie I was going to see, so imagine my surprise: there I am, watching the movie, expecting to see lots of action and the characters just keep babbling about a magical sword and talking about read-it-between-the-lines love. Blah. And I knew this movie would be bogus the moment I found out who was directing it - mister sensibility himself, I just convinced myself I'd give it a chance. After this crap I began appreciating my instincts a whole lot more.<br/><br/>But it couldn't have been that bad a movie says the layman; let me put it this way, I consider myself an eye-candy man, meaning that I have seen all kinds of crappy movies, but hey, if they had decent effects, if they were presented in an interesting way, mercy, if they even had a decent musical accompaniment, they had something to offer, they were at least viewable. Well, this movie has special effects that should be seen with a bib only, but the story, it really hurts just to remember myself about it, well for the story you need a vomit bag, the kind they have aboard airplanes, SO I DEFINITELY NEVER, EVER WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN (except the Zhang Ziyi part).

","The original plan was as follows:  Go see Robert Zemeckis' `Cast Away,' and finally be able to write a positive review for the Campus Press.<br/><br/>After actually seeing Tom Hanks waste his energy on a movie so incredibly devoid of plot, emotion, and appeal, however, I decided to direct my efforts elsewhere.  I figure I owe you folks something good. Well, I'm just going to come right out with it.  Drop whatever you're doing this very instant, and go see `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' by Chinese director Ang Lee.  Starring Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi, `Crouching Tiger' is everything a film should be, and then some.<br/><br/>Wuxia is a form of Asian pulp fiction novel, similar in style and story to the American western, mixing action, history, and often a fairytale-like love story.  The story of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is told in this style.  Set against the backdrop of Western China in the early 19th century, the film tells two intertwining stories. The first is of the warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who is secretly in love with the undefeated, but internally conflicted Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat).  The second story acquaints us with Jen (Zhang Ziyi), the daughter of a high-ranking government official.  Jen has been taught the mystical martial art of Wudan by the nefarious criminal Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who at one time, murdered Li's friend and mentor.  Both paths cross in a story involving the theft of Li's 400 year-old sword, the Green Destiny. I'm not going to be able to do this film justice by describing what makes it a masterpiece; however, it's my job, so I'll do my best, and hope you heed my ords when I tell you to go see it at all costs. First off, the film looked majestic.  The sprawling shots of unspoiled Chinese landscapes, the period costumes, the cities- in short, the entire world of the film made me wonder where Ang had found such a place to film his movie.  The cinematography involved is on par with the best works of John Woo in his Hong Kong days. While I wouldn't necessarily classify `Crouching Tiger' as merely a martial arts film, it has more than its share of fight scenes.  To call them fight scenes, however, is as severe an understatement as they come.  The battles are fought in a surreal fantasy world where gravity has no meaning, and the martial art employed is painted onto the screen rather than thrust into the audience's lap.  What's more, when the characters skip across a lake like so many stones, we as viewers aren't constantly reminded that these effects were generated by computers. The only thing that concerns me is that many viewers may be intimidated by the use of subtitles translating the film's Chinese dialogue. On the contrary, the use of  the pure Chinese language of the script adds volumes to the mood of `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'  After twenty minutes, I forgot I was reading subtitles and enjoyed watching a swordfighting scene with more philosophical aphorisms than swinging blades. So far, this is my pick for Best Picture.  Once I check out the Coen Brothers' `Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' I'll let you know for sure. `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' gets an A+. Let's just say this: if anyone ever tries to use `The Matrix' or a Jackie Chan film as example of great fighting again, I'll shake my head sadly and hand them my copy of the `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' DVD I plan to buy as soon as is humanly possible."

But you must ask the question, was this a big hit just because it was a non American film being directed by an American schooled director?

","In general this film is decent entertainment, but one thing stops it from entering the upper tier of great films. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have atrocious Mandarin accents - imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger in a 19th Century British drama and you'd be close. Chow is a Cantonese-speaker from HK, and Yeoh is from Malaysia - neither speaks Mandarin remotely like a mainlander. The fact that Ang Lee did not train them to speak better, or have them rerecord their dialogue, suggests that this film  was never intended for a Chinese audience. It was always meant as a ""foreign"" film for US consumption. In fact, I have come across a VCD of this film in China in which Chow and Yeoh's voices were overdubbed by other Chinese actors with normal accents."

It should also be noted that Chow Yun Fat cannot do martial arts and was a poor choice to play the role of a master just for that fact. Overall the movie is enjoyable and the scenery is good, but the story and fighting aren't original enough for true Hong Kong movie fans to consider it the best ever made.

If you liked this movie thats fine, everyone has their opinions, but one thing i'm sure of (and I hope we all can admit, reguardless of our feelings) is that this movie in no way deserved anywheres near the praise and hype it got.  I'd like to think even people who loved it can admit that.  Lets put it this way, I loved Army of Darkness (gotta love Ash) but I don't think for a second that it should win any awards (at least not based on the criteria we give awards by).  This is the same in this movie, aside from maybe cinemetography (I don't remember what else was out at the time).  Acting, Story, Special Effects (c'mon, flying?), and everything else were pretty low key.

","I didn't like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (on video, dubbed in English). It looked really good, and I'm sure if I'd seen the non-dubbed version, it would have been more dramatic, but otherwise it didn't do anything for me at all.  The scene where they're fighting in the trees, supposedly one of the highlights, seemed silly to me.  After the first couple of fight scenes, I began fast-forwarding through the rest of them.  I'm sure for some people, the way the characters floated around like Superman and all that was magical, but to me it just looked like a bunch of people swinging around on suspension wires.  The effect didn't work for me at all.  I've heard people talk about how exciting the action is and the sweeping drama of the story, but the story fell flat for me too; I wasn't into it for a second.  I found it predictable and not at all engaging (this might have been different had I not seen the dubbed version).  The photography was excellent, lots of pretty scenes, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested; I was bored through the whole thing, and by the time the ending came around, which I didn't think was much of an ending, I just didn't care.  When it was over I said, ""That's it?"" Something happens to one of the main characters in the end, but you *know* the character will be back for the sequel (or prequel, whichever one they're going to make). I think if this movie doesn't grab you from the start with the fantastic way the characters literally move and jump around, it never will.  This time next week I doubt I'll remember anything about it.<br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority, but really, beyond all the nice pretty pictures of the mountains and the trees, etc., I wasn't engaged by this film at all. I know most people seem to love it, but there will be others who will wonder what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a beautifully photographed, engaging and dramatic film from China, pick up RED SORGHUM; it clashes the fantastic with reality in a way CROUCHING TIGER never even approaches."
"LebowskiT1000","3","0","1","9 August 2001"," What's the big fuss about?
","OK, first of all you need to understand that I like just about every movie I've ever seen. I can say that most movies have some redeeming value. There is maybe 20 to 30 movies that I can say have little to no redeeming value, and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is on that list. I saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" a while back when it was in the theaters and I even have another review on the site (if you care to read it), and was less than stoked about it then.<br/><br/>The other night I watched it again because I refused to believe that I didn't like it THAT much. Knowing myself, it sometimes takes me two viewings to really enjoy a movie, so I watched it again. After watching it for my second time, I'm sticking to my original belief, in fact watching it a second time made it even more clear to me why I didn't like it. I'm truly sorry for feeling this way, but ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, I'm sorry, but I had to say it.<br/><br/>First of all, I'm all about suspending reality, that's all in good fun, I understand, but it just doesn't work at all in this movie and is just absurd! If you are going to suspend reality you need to give the audience a reason to believe it. OK, so these people have learned a special type of martial art that allows them defy gravity at any time...c'mon, I need more than that. And secondly, it bugged the hell out of me that none of the bystanders were amazed that these warriors could defy gravity. If you were chasing someone and suddenly they jumped over a 30 foot wall, wouldn't you be a little confused or amazed? I think so. A perfect example of what I'd like to see is in ""The Matrix"" when the Agent jumps to the next rooftop and the cop can't believe what he just saw.<br/><br/>While I'm on the topic of ""The Matrix"", I've had friends get upset that I liked the gravity defiance in ""The Matrix"" and didn't like it in ""CTHD"". OK, these two are sooooo very different, Matrix gives you a more ""realistic"" reason to believe that the characters can defy gravity and even then, the way it is filmed is WAY better than CTHD. You don't see people in Matrix floating over 30 foot walls, running on the sides of buildings or changing directions in mid air. ...And even when gravity is defied, it isn't for more than a second or two at most, whereas CTHD would do it for quite a bit longer.<br/><br/>So, anyway, back to CTHD. The next thing that bothered me is the fight scenes. I'll give it this, they are well choreographed, but are you people really impressed by this? Two people are fighting and all of a sudden one of them starts to float away and the other fighter has to hold her to the ground so that she doesn't float off. LAME, LAME, LAME!!!<br/><br/>Another thing, if you are going to have your characters defy gravity, make it true to itself. If gravity is out the window then why is a weapon going to be too heavy for Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to fight with?<br/><br/>Next on my agenda is the fight scene in the bamboo trees, this has got to be one of the DUMBEST, MOST ABSURD things I've EVER seen on film. I will admit however that the trees are beautiful and the scenery is nice, but the context is incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing, there are undoubtedly some people reading this thinking ""He didn't like it because it was subtitled"", no, that is not the case, I loved ""Run Lola Run"", ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" and ""Life Is Beautiful"".<br/><br/>All in all, I thought the movie was horrible and it's going to be a long time before I watch this again, unless the other viewers don't mind me screaming at how silly the movie is. If you haven't seen it yet and you are still interested, by all means, see it, form your own opinion. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-LebowskiT1000"

"tfrizzell","Null","0","1","4 August 2001"," ""Crouching Performances, Hidden Screenplay"" Would Be More Accurate
","Perhaps one of the most deceiving and over-rated films of the past decade would have to be the somewhat obscure ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". The film is a part-fantasy and part-adventure about two warriors in feudal Asia (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) who must try to recover a magical sword that has been stolen and attempt to stop a dangerous female fugitive who has been a thorn in their sides for years. While the two definitely have feelings for each other, they are bound by several factors that they cannot overcome. Relative new-comer Ziyi Zhang is the thief of the sword and also a daughter of a well-to-do aristocrat. She is a young lady who does not know what she wants in life, but knows that she does not want to be married, something she is being forced to do. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", much like the equally over-rated ""Gladiator"" was a smash-hit in 2000. It became one of, if the not the most, successful foreign-language films in the history of films. It captured four Oscars after a whopping 10 nominations and was a real threat the whole way to win the Best Picture Oscar. Critics hailed this film from every direction and most of the mainstream audience has been enthralled by it. However, the film has so many shortcomings that it is destined to be little more than a curiosity in the future. The performances are all weak except for the young Ziyi Zhang. She is the only intriguing character and although she has a very large part, she probably should have had even more time on the screen. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are basically stunt actors that are physically impressive, but are below-average performers and it shows even more in an ambitious film like this. The small details are impressive and Ang Lee does a good job with the direction, but his job with this film is over-rated as well. Many were blown away with the fight scenes and special effects, but many Asian films from the 1950s and 1960s did the same thing with much more limited resources. In fact some of those films are more realistic looking than this film in that regard. These problems hurt ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but what I really disliked about the film was the blundering screenplay that never did know where it wanted to go. So many side-stories and ridiculous situations make the script seem like it was just thrown together in an opium-induced state by the original novelist. Many camps developed in 2000. Some cheered for ""Gladiator"" some for ""Traffic"" and some for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". While ""Gladitor"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" are not bad films, their enormous success does not compare with the cinematic brilliance of ""Traffic"". ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a truly deceptive film. 4 stars out of 5."

Unlike others, the fight scenes did not redeem the movie for me at all.  I enjoy martial arts in movies, but this movie did not contain martial arts, it contained fight scenes that defied physics and especially the law of gravity.  If a movie is going to allow people to float through the air, walk up sides of buildings, or jump 40 feet in the air then there needs to be a reason why these feats are possible (such as the underlying premise of The Matrix) or the movie needs to be pure fantasy (like Superman). Crouching Tiger's suspension of reality didn't work.  On top of that, the acting wasn't particularly good, the plot was shallow, and the story simply wasn't enjoyable.

Just think of how much Crouching Tiger revenued in the East, that profit, plus profit from it's Western release = big money.

"FlickJunkie-2","7","0","1","29 July 2001"," Jackie Chan meets Peter Pan
","This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon). There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can't seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, `Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.'<br/><br/>On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).   By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn't commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li's desire to mentor Jen, Jen's relationship with Jade Fox, Jen's relationship with Yu, Jen's progress as a warrior, Jen's adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen's pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn't add that much to the main themes.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.  <br/><br/>
Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its $120 million U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like `Scary Movie' exemplify). Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing."

","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Maybe one of the most eye-pleasing movies that I have seen in a long time.  It was flat out a beautiful movie. However, despite the breathtaking panoramas of the Asian landscapes, I did not enjoy this movie all that much. I have seen both the English dubbed version of the movie and the original Mandarin, and in both I found myself guessing at why the characters were doing what they were doing.  I have talked with many people, even those who liked it, and they themselves admitted that they had trouble following the plot.  From what I could gather of the plot, it seemed to unfold much like a comic book, with a love intrigue, old and new, and the hero avenging something or other.  Over all, I did not enjoy the movie.  So, this brings me back to my first question: Why was this movie liked so much?<br/><br/>This is my take on that question. It seems as though the American public is tired of your classic, cute, Hollywood film.  OR they want to appear that way.  Yes, if you have seen a film that has come from overseas, and been dubbed in a different language, people will give you some intellectual respect for that.  And if you enjoyed it, well, then, aren't you a little appreciator-of-the-arts!<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie already, I wouldn't recommend that you don't see it.  Some of the fight scenes are cool, and it is a change of pace. If you end up liking it in the end, good for you. Just don't go into the moving expecting to like it."

Still, I liked it-the flying and Peter Pan type leaps really were unique.

Maybe it's me.<br/><br/>I also kept thinking that the 'Jade Fox' was not developed the way she could have, kinda shows up two or three times, we don't really know what and where about her as much as we should.<br/><br/>And that ending-does the swan dive turn fatal or does she bounce back like a bumble?? 'Tis up to the viewer I would guess.<br/><br/>That aside-the flick as a whole is done quite well. I liked it, it's certainly Not like anything else out there, and it's easy to see that Hollywood has lost that spark. Too many A.I.s.<br/><br/>***1/2 outta *****"
"mc12000","Null","0","1","13 July 2001"," Don't believe the hype
","Like some films, I came to this one having heard all the hype and bonanza. To be honest I hadn't planned on watching it until the DVD came out - I tend not stay away from films that have received a lot of hype. Apart from one single negative review (from someone who does not lack cynicism at the worst of times I might add), everyone else had given this film the thumbs-up. So I sat in anticipation. The slow start certainly made me wonder what all the fuss was all about. But gradually, the film began to unwrap and it displayed some impressive cinematography. We're also given a lot of martial arts scenes where reels upon reels of strings must have been used up to achieve the ridiculous flying sequences. I've watched many an Oriental martial arts movie in my lifetime and never before have I seen such spectacular heights. The one piece of credit I will give to the action is the lack of fake sound effects whch are often the bane of martial arts movies (yes, even Bruce Lee fight scenes. ESPECIALLY Bruce Lee fight scenes!).  The main bulk of the acting is actually done by Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zi Yi who both put in extremely intense performances. I've always viewed Yeoh as ranking alongside the likes of Maggie Cheung and Anita Mui (Funnily enough, they all made a film together). The way in which they express emotion is something that most Hong Kong movies sadly lack-but then, most HK movies are action-orientated. Zhang portrays a somewhat different character to Yeoh's. being younger, we see a brash, rebellious and brave individual who yearns to break free of tradition. In a way, Ang Lee is providing a picture of The modern Oriental female's inclination in life. In Zhang's character, we see both innocence and petulence and this is why the audience is immediately taken to her. As for action, I wrote off all the fight scenes except for two - the one where they are trying to take down the baddie, and the one in the courtyard between Yeoh and Zhang. The latter was breathtaking and is amongst the best I've ever seen. I suspect that there were various ideas for the film's ending. I suspect this because I would've chosen a different ending myself. I must confess that I did not understand the point of it until a friend explained what she thought it meant. And if it is what she thought, then I'd have to say that whoever decided upon the ending must have lost the plot. After all, there is a limit to romanticism which one can objectively justify, even in a romantic storyline. To put it another way: If the film was animated, then the ending would've been apt."

"rastaban3","9","0","1","18 June 2001"," Best foreign film I have ever seen.
","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a very good film that tells the a mythical tail of ancient China.  I don't know much about this area of history so I can't say how accurate it is.  I can say the story and the plot are presented very well and this keeps you interested.  The affects were first rate and compare well to many US and other Western style films.  This one also presents, as stated before, some the ancient myths and legends of China.  Something I have seen very little of and know little about.  This was a good chance for me to see some this up close.  Most of my life has been looking at ancient Rome, Egypt and the like.  So this was refreshing. It was also the first time a film was made that brought this to the publics attention in this manner.  I don't know if the story is true but this brings about some interest on the subject.  <br/><br/>I have heard some people complain about the subtitles of the film.  All I have to say is, get over it!  This is a foreign film, they don't have to present everything to us Americans on a silver plater.  We can read, so read the subtitles.  I have also heard some people complain that it is unrealistic for people to flow or fly, almost, through the air.  Well, as I said before, this film presents some of the myths and legends of ancient China and the mystery of what was Wudan.  This is how the movie is presented it holds to its story line.  As a result, some of the feats performed and aided by the special affects are realistic for this film.  I never saw, at anytime, the director stepping out of the bounds of the genre.  The only thing that prevents this film from getting a prefect 10, is the fact that the film does get confusing at times and can be difficult to follow. Otherwise, this is an very good film.  If you can get past the subtitles, this one is for you.  If you don't like to read, don't bother.<br/><br/>Overall, a must see (9 out of 10)."
"ashy","10","0","1","16 June 2001"," Excellent cultural eye opener!
","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an excellent film.  <br/><br/>What frustrates me is the close minded comments I'm reading from other users.  You cannot walk into a Chinese movie and expect to see Western values.  Chinese believe in spiritual power, dignity and avenging those who wrong you.  Unlike American movies, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is subtle in showing anything that may seem supernatural.  Think of it as a Fantasy, or one big metaphor.  Some users thought the flying sequence was silly---but really it emphasized the power and discipline of martial arts.  Am I supposed to criticize Cinderella for having a fairy Godmother?  Am I supposed to criticize Hercules for being half god when that is also unrealistic?  Think about it.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon needs to be watched more than once in order to understand the depth of the movie.  On the surface it seems to be about getting a sword back.  However, it is more than that.  It is about love that is suppressed because of tradition and the role you play in life.  The women of this movie possess a refreshing inner strength.  Not only do they kick butt, but they also stay strong when they are struggling with forbidden love.  <br/><br/>This is an excellent movie.  If you approach it with an open mind and heart, you will definitely appreciate its value.  As you watch this movie, you may also learn a thing or two about the Chinese culture."

","I used to love this site, thought it's place to meet people who share passion for the movies. But after reading so many negative comments about Crouching Tiger, Hidden dragon.  I started to lose my respect for this site and the kind of people who are using it. There are just too many hateful and ignorant people around. There are countless bigotry and attacks on the Asian cultures (comments like ""it's just another low class Asian movies"",  "".. the ridiculous flying sequence.."" or ""..the Governess' daughter's (who cares what her name was) "") and personal attacks (such as ""shame on Ang Lee"" , "".. Siskel and Ebert must have been asleep with the rest of the crowd when they rated this one...Shame on you!..""). <br/><br/>Blame it on Siskel? I believe he past away before this movie came out.<br/><br/>It's a foreign film, of course it has sub-titles. No one sticks a big gun at your head to rent it or watch it. So don't whine about the ""distracting"" sub-titles or waste our time to read your complaint about it just because you don't know enough Chinese or can't afford a DVD player (DVD came with English).<br/><br/>Many people complained about having a hard time to stay awake through the movie?! As if that's a proof of a bad movie. Well, those very same people probably will also fall asleep on Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.  Or do they even know what Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart are? By the way,  Beethoven is not the movie about a big, dumb dog.<br/><br/>Finally, those people kept comparing this movie to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chen are simply idiots. Same with those people found the ""flying"" sequence ""ridiculous"", it only tells me that you have no appreciation for the Asian (or perhaps any other) cultures. Why did you even bother to watch the movie in the first place then waste our time to read your ignorant comments?"
"jslusher","1","0","3","14 June 2001"," You gotta be kidding?...8+ stars for this film!!!
","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon may have won the hearts of many in this review, but this film was a major disappointment.  The cinematography and locations were the only high points of what I could manage to force myself to sit through.  The annoying subtitles were quickly presented and sometimes very hard follow making it very distracting...especially for the younger viewers.<br/><br/>The first (and BIGGEST) issue I have with the film, is the ridiculous ""flying"" sequences that take place!!!  Bruce Lee is probably rolling over in his grave over this!  Come on guys...I'm not an expert on the martial arts, and I certainly respect those who devote there lives to the study, but is the martial arts the producer of supernatural beings?...come on!...what's next, lasers from the eyes that melt steel and walking through walls!  Not to go without saying from what I did see of the fight sequences (they were nicely choreographed), just when everyone started the flying around ruined it for me...at that point, I could have watched ""Superfriends"" on the Cartoon Network and couldn't have better laugh.  Take for example many of the Jackie Chan films, the action is true and sincere, with the actor himself utilizing his skills with heart and conviction.  No strings attached here or stupid flying stunts...he supplies great action that keeps your attention.<br/><br/>Secondly, the Governess' daughter's (who cares what her name was) flashback of how she met her boyfriend was also way too lengthy...basically a story in itself (this is where the film lost my attention when she's fighting her boyfriend in the desert, I could go no further...).  My older son managed stay awake and sit through to the ending of the film which he later explained to me...come on!...the Wicked Witch!...the Governess' daughter flies off the mountain into the sunset!...and movie goers are giving this waste of mylar a 8+ rating.<br/><br/>In closing, I am glad that I did not take my family to the theater see this film...what a waste of time and money, especially with the cost of $8.25/person is the norm...I regret even spending the four bucks to rent the video from Blockbusters!  Siskel and Eibert must have been asleep with the rest of the crowd when they rated this one...Shame on you!"
"cmmdrangelus","1","0","2","14 June 2001"," Over hyped...fails to live up to expectations
","I must admit that when i saw the previews i felt an interest in seeing what this movie was all about.  I must admit i loved Gladiator, not just because of the action sequences, because i do feel that there have been far greater action pieces.  Gladiator had a gripping story.  When Crouching Tiger was nominated for Best Picture, i felt certain that it would be of the same caliber as Gladiator and even hearing reviews for the film i felt it might even surpass. I finally got the opportunity to see it and i found it to be subpar. First of all i know many people that dislike the movie do so on the basis of the ""flying."" However i felt that this was adequately explained by the film as being part of the Wudan training.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>There is a scene where Jen is in her room and Lo comes in, a character that we had previously not been introduced to.  What ensues is a long flashback scene in which Jen pursues LO all over a comb.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>I felt that this scene was actually quite Dull and LO's character has no real place in the film, he appears to be merely added on and actually hurts the fluidity of the film.  Further more i found the idea of pursuing a famed criminal through a dessert to be very idiotic.  This scene adds nothing to the film but detracts much. The romance between Lo and Jen also appears to be rushed and has no true emotional impact. Finally, the ending was a bit of a let down in that you are expecting a massive confrontation between Jade Fox and Master Li, and everything appears to build to it and in the end it is very short and not very impressive compared to the other action in the film. The ending is also something that i found unfulfilling, it left a lot to be desired. And the Dialogue...what can i say about the dialogue, it was dull and moronic at times.  During the first confrontation between the undercover police officer, his daughter and another individual the dialogue is painful. The movie was overhyped and fails to live up to expectations.  This is all of course my humble opinion, but i found myself strongly disliking the film."

","I was pre-sold on this film - the awards, the breathless praise, everything about the film was supposed to be extraordinary. Then I saw it. WOW!!! How can everybody be so wrong??? It must be politically correct to praise a foreign film and politically insensitive to dare to criticize the Chinese. First, the plot - it takes every bad scene out of spaghetti westerns and changes bandanas into Chinese clothing. A sword was stolen - a sword was found. The plot has all the complexity of a Dick and Jane ""novella""!<br/><br/>The acting - I have rarely seen such poor acting. It almost seemed like we should see a sign saying ""grimace"" before the actor changes expressions. The dialog during the chase in the desert was so hokey that I had trouble not laughing. Starting with: ""Dark Cloud is Coming, Dark Cloud is Coming, Dark Cloud is Coming, Dark Cloud is Coming"" <br/><br/>This film won awards?????? The reviewers must have been delusional! Or, as noted previously, ultimately PC.<br/><br/>I am not a kung foo(my choice of spelling)fan but must believe that there are better ""fight"" scenes out there. Once you see one of the flying fights, there is no need to see more. The restaurant(?) fight was straight out of a B grade western. <br/><br/>The protagonist/heroine - Let me see if I got this straight. She was an 8 or 10 year old kung foo wunderkind who gravitated to stealing valuables as a ""joke""?? <br/><br/>Now for the old hag/governess/""bad guy"". She was angry because the aforementioned 8 year old wouldn't show her the kung foo manuals??? [Dialogue - Young one: I showed you the pictures but not the words. Hag: That's why I didn't improve.] And the fabulous use of technology - an arrow-firing down-dated machine gun??? ....and it just so happened that the heroine was the only person in the world to know both the poison used, the fact it had an antidote and she could prepare it (""but it is difficult"" - so difficult that it takes 3 seconds too long). Talk about pre-juvenile plot!!! .... and the final scene (nah, I better not go there). Suffice it to say that we are left with the desert king and an inscrutable expression.<br/><br/>These comments will have served their purpose if just one person (not politically correct) is warned off and chooses not to rent this film.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this a minus 3"

","To prepare for seeing this I watched a battery of Hong Kong movies, including three dozen flying-swordfight movies, to enable me to put it into perspective. The upshot was, I became a fan of Hong Kong movies, but didn't like this one at all. The only pleasure it gave me was to watch the younger woman in her fight scenes--what the movie let me see of them. She's so stylish and intense that alone of the stars she's able from time to time to struggle out of the blanket of dullness that smothers everything else. This must be one of the most uncinematic tellings of a story in the history of movies. Without the sound or the subtitles, you couldn't follow the plot at all.<br/><br/>Actually I didn't understand it even with the titles.

Their retirement is accidentally ended by their constant run-ins with an insufferable girl who wants to be a fighter like them but keeps getting into trouble from which they have to bail her out. Her potential has been misdirected by her secret master (female master: mistress?), an enemy of good guys in general and the male s-f-h in particular. In the final rescue, he and his opposite number finally declare their love, but too late, and the girl, realizing at last the sorrow of it all,............does what? Kill herself? Accept her fate?

","This movie's gotten some pretty amazingly glowing reviews lately, some of which I suppose are earned.  I'm sure there's artistic beauty in some of the scenes for those looking for it, and fight choreography (by that Matrix guy) is of course superb and amazing.  It's by no means a very bad movie.  I just have trouble believing that all the people praising Crouching Tiger... really understood it correctly.  I'm just wondering because I consider myself a semi-literate moviegoer, and I don't think I understood it to the full extent.  I'll just tell you what I came away with.<br/><br/>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (and I have the director's quotes to back me up on this one) is basically a glorified kung-fu-theatre flick.  That means you should expect some conventions, which I believe CTHD adheres to pretty soundly.  One is unrealistic, cheezy fight scenes.  Oh sure, people trump it up in all ways like ""they're let loose of the bounds of gravity"" and what not, but ask yourself, the first time you saw those people just take off and fly like it was an everyday occurrence, did you not say to yourself, ""What the heck?""  Kung-fu-flicks have wacky fighting, so does CTHD.  Two is a meandering plot, that mostly exists only as filler in between said cheezy fight scenes.  Anyone who says CT's plot is clear and fresh is lying. It's a simple idea, told in a roundabout way, with some heaping melodrama thrown in for the ladies, I suppose.  Ah, that's not giving the ladies enough credit-that stuff's mostly too thick to convey much real emotion, and they'll see that.  But that's not really the point either.<br/><br/>What makes CTHD more of a homage than a rip-off of kung-fu is the spirit of the thing, that Ang Lee gets pretty well.  However, to the uninitiated, I'd think most people would have more of a ""What the heck"" reaction than all the unadulterated praise.  I will not give unadulterated praise here.  I like it okay, it's just somewhat of a disconcerting movie, so I'd urge any wonderers to be aware of this.  Kung-fu fans will have an easier adjustment.<br/><br/>Side note: Ebert says he'd talked with Lee about the choreography and how it was done, and the only primary special effects were some computer work to remove the wires the actors used.  They're all really doing those stunts, folks.  Even if the story gives you pause, it's worth a gander just to gawk at the finesse and skill on display here."
