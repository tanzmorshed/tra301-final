","Saw this the other night at the NYFF. Wow. It's an incredible film, a true cinematic achievement, possibly a classic and maybe will be the first 3D movie to break through and win the Best Picture Oscar. Some of the images were so beautiful that the audience gasped at many of them. I felt transported and like I was seeing a movie for the very first time. I haven't felt that sort of magic in a movie theater in a long, long time.<br/><br/>I read the book and liked it and the film may even improve upon it which is kind of a miracle considering it's kids, animals and water just about all the time. The spiritual themes are simple and deep and raise more questions about faith and belief than answer anything. No preaching going on here and there could be. Without giving anything away, it's a wonderful story about storytelling and how telling our stories can get us through the most horrible life experiences and to help deal with the aftermath of them.<br/><br/>It's an incredible film experience. Go see it!"

","''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.<br/><br/>You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.<br/><br/>The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.<br/><br/>The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.<br/><br/>In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.<br/><br/>""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat."
"noah_eye","9","413","515","13 November 2012"," Very impressed
","I was lucky enough to see Pi in full 3D Imax at a pre-viewing in San Diego last night, and as a huge fan of the book, I was intensely satisfied.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I was more impressed with the the casting choices and performances of the players than by the effects. Granted, the movie was very beautiful, but in the end, Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story. <br/><br/>I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D, but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also, if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway, worry no longer. This is easily, one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon."
"damh_frikinlater","10","434","552","21 November 2012"," Probably the Most Complete Film of the Year
","The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.<br/><br/>It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.<br/><br/>The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.<br/><br/>But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.<br/><br/>If you think that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make ""Tron: Legacy"" looks so cool and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year."

","With his latest movie, ""Life of Pi"", Ang Lee further establishes himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable, family-harmonizing ""Father Knows Best"" trilogy (1992-1994), through his Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005, best director), to his other titles like ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and ""Lust, Caution"" (2007), quality and Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous attraction for wide audience of his admirers.<br/><br/>Lee's latest and, so far, easily, greatest movie, ""Life of Pi"" is based on a screenplay adapted from the acclaimed fictional adventure novel written by Canadian author Yann Martel.<br/><br/>Throughout his childhood, due to matching pronunciation of French word ""piscine"" (pool, swimming pool) and English word ""pissing"", Piscine Molitor Patel, named that way after later abandoned Parisian swimming pool, so predictably suffers from being nicknamed ""Pissing Patel"". In order to avoid it, once in high school he finally shortens his name to Pi Patel... Nowadays middle-aged Pi tells the story of his life to a visiting writer, apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego, who is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively, Pi divides his childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16, describing his interaction with his family and schoolmates, in particular his relationship with his father and a girlfriend, concentrating on his exploits of God and spirituality, meandering between multitude of religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on from India to Canada sank. Most detailed, and therefore the longest, is recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat, an extraordinary ordeal he went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else, crew and passengers, died <br/><br/>Well, everybody human, but not everybody living. Namely, a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo, offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings, have survived, too. But, not for long, because, while confined in the most limited space as they were, surrounded by vastness of the ocean, the law of the ""survival of the fittest"" prevails, takes its tall, and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the food-chain, a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. <br/><br/>Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in an engaging tale—whether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in viewers—of an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on-screen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, complex yet basic, difficult yet simple, initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear, swiftly shifting to respectful care, instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16-year old Pi uses—amply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son, certainly well acquainted with animal psychology—to suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate ""killing machines"" among mammals, desperately striving for his own survival, nevertheless, generously, for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion, but still, initially and ultimately, magnificent adversary, Richard Parker, as well.<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" is, certainly, one of the most impressive movies of 2012, year that has just come to a close."
"chaudharyabhijit","10","251","338","15 November 2012"," Great movie, but a great director!
","Few movies will leave a lasting impression on you..Life of Pi is one of those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!"
"cnitinb","9","215","295","22 November 2012"," A visually opulent triumph of film-making!
","Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? <br/><br/>But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. <br/><br/>Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). <br/><br/>Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!"

","Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it."

","Life of Pi is a triumph visually - one of the most magical experiences I've ever had at the movies. Even more importantly, it's a triumph of a story.<br/><br/>I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist. When I heard the words ""I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God"", I was suitably skeptical.<br/><br/>The movie did not succeed in getting me to believe in God. However, the pivotal but ever-so-subtle dialog near the end really cemented why so many people the world over choose the target of their faith.<br/><br/>Piscene asks ""Which story do you prefer?"" Not ""which story do you believe?"" or ""Which story do you think is true?"", just ""Which story do you prefer?"" I've seen other reviews of this move that refer to the ""twist"" ending. There is no twist here, just an incredibly well-presented allegory. There's also many reviews talking about the triumph of endurance and human spirit. Those indeed are present in the story, but not so important as the central point - the crux of the matter.<br/><br/>""Which story do you prefer?"" The answer of course is a perfect allegory of religion. The fundamental stories are similar no matter which characters are in the pivotal roles.<br/><br/>""Which story do you prefer?"" As Pi answers, ""And so it is with God."" A faith-shaking thought indeed.<br/><br/>Depending on how you see the world and religion's place in it, the question may affirm or cause questions of your own faith. Is your religion's story true? Or just preferred? And more importantly, does it matter? What this movie drove home for me was that religions all have the same benefits and by extension, they all have the same flaws.<br/><br/>Which story do you prefer? To Ang Lee, Yann Martel, David Magee and all involved in bringing this story to the screen, thank you! It is so refreshing to be viscerally, philosophically and intellectually entertained all at the same time."

","According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.<br/><br/>Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.<br/><br/>There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.<br/><br/>The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??"
"StevePulaski","10","60","90","22 November 2012"," ""This is a picture of sheer power and beauty""
","Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.<br/><br/>Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name ""Pi Patel,"" and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.<br/><br/>During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named ""Richard Parker"" on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.<br/><br/>Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.<br/><br/>Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.<br/><br/>Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness. <br/><br/>This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful."
"TheSupertramp","10","62","94","23 November 2012"," ""I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?""
","Ang Lee takes Yann Martel's much acclaimed novel and turns it into a collage full of masterful imagery and dream-like visuals, which remains at the core a profoundly simple tale of spirituality, in a manner which might leave you either with a wry smile and shake of head at what you just experienced or with a euphoric feeling equivalent to the one you get after seeing a magic trick. The thing with this magic however, is that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.<br/><br/>I don't believe in God but I do believe in the power of stories, imagery, art in it's most simple yet beautiful form and most of all in the power of words. I believe in the power of cinema, the moving images that can move you in more ways than you can imagine. That can transport you into another space and time, into a World full of possibilities. Of everything. Of nothing.<br/><br/>And come to think of it believing in God may not be that much different.<br/><br/>'Life Of Pi' is undoubtedly a cinematic achievement in terms of visual effects and images but it's real beauty lies in the story that is so simple in it's depiction yet so profound in it's impact.<br/><br/>There are scenes of such wonderful amazement that words fall short often. Right from the beginning credits to the poignant scene when Pi leaves his lifeboat just after the ship-wreck and watches the mammoth ship sink underwater, the heart-pounding introduction of Richard Parker on the lifeboat, the surreal dream sequence of Pi, the many sunsets and nights at sea, the mesmerizing scene with the jellyfishes and blue whale and just so many other scenes that each one can be paused and made into a collection of brilliantly picturesque wallpapers. Such brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with us when he deems fit.<br/><br/>The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in almost every movie that he does, it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic, gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often.<br/><br/>""I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?"" ""The one with the Tiger."" ""And so it is with God.""<br/><br/>I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.<br/><br/>And yes, always ""the one with the Tiger."""
"ElMaruecan82","8","10","12","26 March 2017"," It's all about suspension of disbelief...
","Every once in a while, a movie keeps you marveling at the beauty of its imagery while captivating your mind with its intellectual richness, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is such a movie where images speak a thousand words, so is ""Life of Pi"" with a difference though: it is pretty vocal about its content. To a certain degree, the film embodies the number 'Pi' whose mathematical function and simple writing are only the tip of an iceberg of infinite immensity.<br/><br/>Still, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a delight for the eyes before the mind, a stunt even more impressive as 2012 eyes used to think they saw it all (3 years after ""Avatar"" and less than a decade after Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""). Some shots reminded me of that line from ""Forrest Gump"" who was running across a desert and the morning light cast such a glow that he couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the Earth began. And ""Life of Pi"" is fertile in such shots where you can't tell the limits between the sky and the water, and it is no coincidence that the story is a metaphysical quest à la Paolo Coelho, of a boy drifting across the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, of all the companions.<br/><br/>God is obviously the 'guy-up-there' incarnated by the skies and the stars and Pi addresses him many times by raising his head, but when the sky and the water seems to make one, which might imply that Pi can find God, or try to, by looking at the ocean or in the eye of his feline companion of misfortune. Pi was named after Piscine Molitor which was the most beautiful swimming pool his uncle ever swam in, and in the scene showing the Parisian pool, the water is so clear, the man feels like floating in the air, it is not just gratuitous effects but the display of a heavenly, ecstatic moment, where the body and the mind are in total symbiosis. This is how the uncle found God anyway.<br/><br/>To avoid the mockeries, Piscine calls himself 'Pi' and is so motivated that he becomes a champion of the Pi number and could memorize thousands of the decimal pieces, the cheers of his comrades making up for years of urological nicknames. But don't get mislead, the film is only about mathematics if you use the Galilean metaphor of the alphabet with which God wrote the universe. This is a language Pi is eager to decrypt, driven by his childlike curiosity, Hindu myths and Gods fascinate him, so does the story of Jesus Christ who died as an innocent for all the humans' sins, and he also finds peace and serenity while recalling the name of Allah during his prayers. Pi's ecumenical openness inevitably crashes into his father's rationality.<br/><br/>""Appa"", a zoo owner, is a practical man who doesn't believe in religion, he eats meat and would rather have a son sticking to strong opinions rather than believing in everything, being as ""irrational"" and unlimited as the like-named number. So, it's the father who puts limits in his son's idealism where he sees him trying to feed the tiger (named Richard Parker), believing animals have soul. The father proves him wrong by tying a goat to the cage and showing him how the animals deal together. Animals have no souls, it is only the reflect of humans' soul, the metaphor for religion is obvious. We only see God through our own eyes, how ironic though that the father uses a sacrifice of such heavy religious undertones to make his point. As for Pi, the matters of God are forgotten for a time.<br/><br/>And it takes that extraordinary journey where he's stuck with the tiger and has to learn how to tame it, to feed it so it doesn't think of eating him, to state his presence, mark his territory, to establish a way to communicate with the animal, until finally, Pi concludes his metaphysical quest. The tiger becomes his enemy but also his ticket for life. I won't spoil right now how the adventure connects with God, but it is all done in that conclusive last rhetorical question, where Pi creates his own myth, which like all myths, explains a fact through a story that might sound ludicrous but whose universal appeal is undeniable. Because that's what myths are: stories that go beyond our own perceptions, that seems impossible yet challenge our thinking to such a point that their nonexistence seems as unbelievable as the opposite.<br/><br/>While I was watching the film, I was mesmerized by the special effects, the interactions between Pi and the tiger, even with the other animals. And I was almost disappointed to learn it was CGI, it didn't look like CGI to me, for some reason, it felt ""plausible"", too beautiful to be artificial. But maybe that is the ground broken by Ang Lee. In 1914, a man shared a screen with a dinosaur, in 1964 one danced with penguins, in 1988, one was handcuffed to a rabbit, in 1993, dinosaurs came back in the form of CGI creatures, their realness was undeniable but it still asked for our suspension of disbelief. ""Life of Pi"" is the only one where the animals are meant to be and look real, that the magic of the film would take a 'normal form' to better fool us.<br/><br/>Some would say that God was a creation by humans but maybe the idea of God is so beautiful that humans only tries to make it approachable, like God who used the figure of Jesus, or Muslims when they pray or Hindus with all their Gods. Maybe less than the form of God, is the idea itself, maybe Cinema is like religion or myths, after all, it is all about suspension of disbelief, but for a purpose that is essential to the human soul."

","We were able to see this at an early screening but per that paper, not to say anything until after other screenings. So, now it's screened elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the book, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I knew that a film from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done, and I wasn't wrong. This is an incredibly strong work, on par with ""Crouching Tiger"" .. Not through action or events but in the way the cinematography, camera movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell the story.<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book, the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of since ""The Sixth Sense"". You immediately think back over the entirety of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.<br/><br/>No matter the perspective you chose, this is an amazingly well acted, well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films I've seen this year.<br/><br/>I watched in 3D, but this is a film full of so many bright colors and scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the beauty of the scenes. Strongly recommended."
"duckmushroom","6","82","138","2 January 2013"," If you're expecting enlightenment...
","I read ""Life of Pi"" a couple of years ago while I was touring around Europe and I found it to be a mildly-entertaining book which touched lightly on the philosophical side. It was no surprise to me then, when I discovered Ang Lee's faithful film adaptation to be exactly that - mildly entertaining, touching lightly on the philosophical side.<br/><br/>I believe a lot of people came to watch this movie with many different expectations, from those who wanted to watch a realistic sea-survival movie, contrasted by those who believed it would offer something truly deep and significant philosophically. Both these camps will be disappointed. As Jonathan Romney says in the IOS review ""Life of Pi is fatally scuppered by coy, bogus mysticism."" Conversely, as you will read on the message boards here at IMDb (spoilers abound there, be forewarned!) a lot of people couldn't even handle the philosophy-lite that was on offer and were ""disappointed"" that it wasn't the straight- forward boy-lost-at-sea-with-a-tiger story it falsely claimed to be (*deep breath*). Hey everybody, this film will not change your life. It will provide you with some inoffensive entertainment for a couple of hours, and probably little more.<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" - whether in book-form or in this adaptation - is neither high art, nor gruelling adventure. What it actually is is a fantasy story, framed at the edges with a smidgeon of realism in an attempt to add a soupçon of depth and food-for-thought. Approach the film as such and you may well enjoy it. <br/><br/>As a heavily CGI-ed film it provides at times a stunning visual work. Again reviewers have been mixed, some claiming that the over-playing of visuals falls into the garish, and attempts to wash over the philosophical shallowness of the movie. Well, CGI is the trend today; it has some benefits, but the overall effect of digitally rendering your characters and sceneries is bound to leave something missing soul-wise. ""Life of Pi"" is pretty enough to look at, but personally I think much more could and would have been made of it if it was adapted as an (classic style) animation.<br/><br/>I'd mark the film as 6.5 (it made my partner cry), but I'm rounding down this time because of the sudden wave of sycophancy present on IMDb, meaning that every film that comes out has 8-point-something (corporate presence?). Either way, a pleasant break from Hollywood aggression, and worth a watch."
"boothkaren20","3","139","249","7 January 2013"," Disappointing tall tale, dressed up as pseudo philosophy
","I found this film ultimately unsatisfying. <br/><br/>Granted, it is visually stunning, but that in itself doesn't justify the running time. I found myself wondering what the point of the film was at all. <br/><br/>If I'm right,it is a pseudo mystical / philosophical propaganda piece, which suggests that it is better to hold tight to a fantastical, improbable story of triumph over adversity (ie your faith in God, whoever that is), if it gives you hope and gets you through life – rather than to endure a harsh, unpalatable reality. <br/><br/>The whole film is geared up to asking the question of the viewer – which do you prefer, the outlandish fantasy or the grim truth? I'm not sure it's even answerable, unless you have a faith which you want to reaffirm. So when the question came, I thought ""Is that it? Is that what you've been waiting to pose""? <br/><br/>The majority of the film covers a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck, cast away on a small lifeboat in the company of a Bengal tiger. The story is told in retrospective by the boy (Pi) as an adult. It is clear to the viewer that this is a tall tale, from Pi's general style of story telling (a colourful childhood, an eccentric swimming-obsessed uncle). We can tell that his style is somewhat unreliable. Therefore I didn't exactly buy into the survival story. I wasn't rooting for him and there was no emotional attachment to the character, in the way there would have been if this was a straight forward recounting of what happened. <br/><br/>What I was thinking was ""when is this part going to end, so that I can get on with finding out what's really going on in the film""? By that, I don't mean that I was particularly interested in the true survival story, which when it came was pretty grim (although that might have been a more interesting film!). I really wanted to know why the film maker thought it was so important to take us on this fantastical journey. <br/><br/>When the answer came, in all its semi-philosophical shallowness, it wasn't worth the wait."
"ClaytonDavis","7","132","236","28 September 2012"," Life of Pi is a visual spectacle, Irrfan Kahn's best
","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).<br/><br/>Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of ""Pi,"" a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with ""movie stars."" <br/><br/>Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. <br/><br/>Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. <br/><br/>The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.<br/><br/>Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"

The animation was real and beautiful, so the scene was amazing. Some scene and action taking from different views was also impressive. This movie was pretty hot and being discussed much in my country now. Some scenes are taking in Taiwan. I did not watch the book so i can't compare between book and movie.

","Let's be honest here: Life of Pi is a pretty looking movie with a rather dismal plot, and a pretentious religious subtext thrown in there for good measure.<br/><br/>Life of Pi might not be a bad movie. Realistically it would get maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, but seeing as there's so many positive reviews here and all of them seem to be from either fanboys of the book, or people who haven't seen very many movies at all, I figured a 1 would be best to balance things out.<br/><br/>No doubt the film has some humorous moments that are indeed very funny, like the tiger peeing in Pi's face, Pi's ""rules"", and what not, and the film has tons of pretty visuals. A lot of the film takes place on a boat, and at times it looks like they used a real ocean to film it on. Not to mention the jellyfish scene was pretty, it was almost like James Cameron's Avatar. <br/><br/>But... the plot is just so vapid and pretentious, it defies description. Basically, the film throws around a lot of religious references, and it takes up a good portion of the plot, but dear LORD most of the time, the religious references were as subtle as bricks in a drying machine. At times it's like the writers are smacking you across the face with a bible. And when he father asked Pi (as a child) early in the film ""how many more religions are you going to convert to?"" (or something like that), I should have taken that as an indication as how the rest of the movie would be.<br/><br/>Oh and the many random moments which included (but weren't limited to): the strange 2:35.1 Aspect ratio change where suddenly a bunch of fish start flying out of the water into the boat (including WINGED fish that seemed like a Michael Bay wet dream), a carnivorous island full of meerkats (though to be fair, the meerkats scene was like a cuteness overdose), and humpback whale bit. Yeah. <br/><br/>There were parts of the film I enjoyed, but it honestly was just not a very good movie. It was like eating a platter full of candy and sugary sweets. Lots to indulge in and munch down on, but you've devoured nothing of substance by the end, and you're left with a stomach ache. And throwing a religious subtext in it doesn't mean the film is good or anything... It's just pretentious.<br/><br/>So yeah, like I said. Realistically my rating would be a 4 or 5 out of 10, but the 8.4 rating and amounts of 10/10 reviews here is just ridiculous."
"robinwoodpdx","10","32","52","23 November 2012"," my new #1 favorite...will be rewatching it many times
","LIFE OF PI is an odyssey that has everything: love, danger, exotic locations, swimming with tigers, and the three major world religions. It is a staggering, nearly all-encompassing metaphor for life. It will strengthen your faith in God. And it is infused with beauty throughout, via director Ang Leeahhh.<br/><br/>I think there are two ways you could take the story: first, as a kind of magical tall tale; second, as something quite a bit deeper--i.e., not superficial entertainment, but profound testimony by an overcomer in life. I'm guessing that people who are deep and have been through a lot of difficulties in their lives will probably get much more out of this movie, whereas others might not relate to or perhaps even recognize the subtext in it (and oh, how much they will miss!!!).<br/><br/>It isn't necessary to read the book first, although it is marvelously well written. Rarely do I think a movie so good that I see it twice in 2 days, and I will go see it a third time soon--don't miss it on the big screen!!<br/><br/>MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
"castostarlight","1","195","369","29 January 2013"," Great visuals serve only as a distraction from a overbearingly preachy plot and shallow characters.
","I'm going to go ahead and say it outright. This film flat out takes the cake for the most overrated film of the year. This is unwarranted and uninspired Oscar bate on a Hurt Locker level. For the first time in a very long time I have actually left a movie feeling I had wasted my money.<br/><br/>You all know the plot. A boy finds himself adrift at sea with a dangerous tiger after a horrific shipwreck. At the start of the film we are subjected to a meandering and drawn-out set up for themes and characters that do not even see a reprise or conclusion before the end of the film. It really felt like this film was stretching every scene and concept to a breaking point to fill the three hour artistic precedent established by previous Oscar winners like Return of the King. It just drags and drags until we are finally privy to the main plot. But then, the films biggest problem comes to a head: the theme.<br/><br/>The film's theme cannot even be adequately described as it lacks any focus or objectivity. It simply comes off as an overbearing theistic agenda slathered onto an unrelated story. It presents itself as a lesson about faith, but doesn't convey this message in any other fashion than saying ""I had faith and I survived, therefore you should have faith."" As a critical thinker, I simply counter the point by demonstrating that if a faithless person was put in the same position as the main character and made the same decisions (since none of these decisions were based his faith) they would have identical outcomes. There in lies the problem: the lesson is not demonstrated through means of the story or character progression. It is literally told to you every few scenes via frequent and uninspired narration. The first rule in screen writing is a simple one: Show, don't tell. After all, film is a visual medium. Apparently the screenwriter missed the memo.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? The acting was wooden. The score was big but not memorable. The only thing I can give to the film's credit is some beautiful cinematography and an effective use of 3D. But presentation is all for naught if the story is ineffective, and Life of Pi never once managed to grab me, move me or convince me of anything. It serves only as a colossal waste of money and time; my own and Hollywood's."

","What utter garbage this movie was. Sure, the CGI was good... and that's about it.<br/><br/>That anyone found this movie a spiritual eye-opener shocks, and actually kind of horrifies me. Why are there so many people just wandering around like zombies not questioning their own existence? Did this movie just serve to make them actually put down their lattes and credit cards for one second to see a different perspective on life? I have no other explanation for how well received this movie was.<br/><br/>I tried to see it as just a story on it's own merits but the religious nonsense was just so thick, it's impossible to separate. Life of Pi heaves with religious overtones - constantly. But none of it goes ""deeper"" than what you would assume every person has pondered at least once or twice in their lifetime: Is God real? Why do people believe? Is it better to believe or disbelieve, and does this change if God is real, or not real?<br/><br/>Let me point this out: PI DOES NOT LEARN ANYTHING, NOR CHANGE DURING THE MOVIE. Pi starts out gullible and foolish, looking for meaning in life to the point of seeing religion and ""God"" in everything where none exists. At the end, after a painfully long journey (for both protagonist and viewer), Pi is still seeing religion and ""God"" in everything - except now he is also a liar. <br/><br/>A religious version of castaway that asks no new questions, provides no new answers, and is better off missed."
"cultfilmfan","10","43","74","25 November 2012"," Life of Pi
","I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films."
"3xHCCH","7","16","24","9 January 2013"," Sanitized Version of the Book with Melodramatic Touches
","I have just finished reading the book the other day, and today I got to watch the film version. With the book still so fresh in my head, I went into the cinema with very high expectations. This is specially so after reading and hearing reviews which call Ang Lee's cinematic masterpiece visually comparable to ""Avatar"" or emotionally comparable to ""The Little Prince,"" as well as all of the awards buzz.<br/><br/>The book for me was a pleasant though slow read because of the lengthy wordy, even flowery, descriptions Yann Martel uses for his languid reflection on zoo life, his comparative study of Hindu, Christian and Moslem philosophy, and of course, his survival tale at sea by a teenager and a Bengal tiger sharing one lifeboat. It waxes philosophical in the beginning, then waxes fantastical in the middle, before settling for dry reality at the end. While a movie could probably improve on the imagery for each scene, there are several key parts of the novel that would entail a lot of narration. On the big screen, too much narration cannot be too good.<br/><br/>My first assumption turned out to be true. The cinematography and visual effects were expectedly first rate and excellent. Those camera angles were breathtaking. The colors were very vibrant. The special effects regarding animals were realistic for the most part, especially the land mammals, particularly Richard Parker. Though I have to say that the water creatures were too obviously computer-generated, not too good. A most triumphant sequence in the film for me were the scenes on the floating green island of algae and meerkats. I thought that was ideally visualized and executed, so much better than that chapter of the book.<br/><br/>My second assumptions also turned out true. A lot of the story needed to be narrated by an adult Pi Patel as he was being interviewed by a novelist researching for his next book. These bookending present day scenes were pretty dry for me. The whole last chapter of the book when Pi was interviewed by the Japanese shipping officials was all one long narration only without supporting imagery. All of this talky narration may be boring for some people. <br/><br/>In order to make the film appeal to more people, Ang Lee spares us from gory details which the book was not averse to describing in graphic detail. In the film, the screen time of the zebra, orangutan and hyena was very short. For all the brutality that was supposed to have happened on board, Ang's lifeboat remains almost pristine white. I thought that was quite merciful of Ang. I wish I could also say the same for some sappy melodramatic scenes, like Richard Parker laying his head on Pi's lap, which were not in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, this film version of ""Life of Pi"" is very good, but it can be disappointing for people who have read the book. It was a loyal albeit sanitized version of the book, which is not really a bad thing. The book was not exactly inspirational to me, more educational actually. For this film, Ang Lee seemingly aspired to make this movie inspirational, and these obvious efforts may prove to backfire for some audiences."

","This movie starts slow. The shipwreck scene at sea is only somewhat believable, if you allow yourself to be distracted by the CGI, but it drags, and the references to religion are just a mish-mash of ancient superstition that don't mesh well with the supposed story being told. In the end we learn there is possibly another story that is the ""truth"", and which is preferred? Well I liked neither. And neither story was ""true"" since all was fiction to begin with.<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" felt like a story that wanted to go somewhere but didn't know how to, like the author was Pi and trying to figure out how to write a story for the first time, hoping that the proposed alternate story at the end would give the time spent on the rest of the tale some sort of validity, which it didn't. It reminds me of a joke I heard a few years back, one of those jokes where I wondered why I wasted my time listening to it, and I will repeat it here, giving it a Life-of-Pi ending:<br/><br/>One day, Juan is out trimming his hedges.

","I went to see 'Life Of Pi' in 3D as I'd heard what an amazing, life-changing movie it was, and that it was one of the best uses of 3D ever. Unfortunately it was neither of these things. Theoretically, it's a movie which few people should actually like, and should offend religious people, yet almost everyone seems to be lapping it up like God's very own ejaculate.<br/><br/>I'll get the 3D aspect out of the way first. Whilst the visuals were brilliant, beautiful and sometimes breathtaking with vibrant fluorescent colours, there wasn't a single shot of 3D in the entire film that made me think, 'that's impressive use of 3D', and I'm a fan of good 3D. Whilst Pi was poking a stick at the screen, instead of it coming out at me in 3D, it was a rather pathetic, unfocused blur.<br/><br/>The film is about a boy/young man called Pi who was shipwrecked. A writer tracks him down as he hears Pi has a wonderful story that will supposedly make him believe in God. Pi tells the story and it's incredibly long-winded with nothing remotely miraculous in it, mostly just a load of bad luck. Most of the story is Pi and a tiger stuck on a small rescue boat, and whilst that's interesting for a while, after about an hour, it becomes really rather tedious.<br/><br/>Pi then tells a second story which is the true version of events, and there's nothing remotely miraculous in that one either, again just a load of bad luck. At this point I was thinking 'I cannot believe I've spent about an hour watching Pi and a tiger on a boat when it never even happened and he was just bulls**tting us'.<br/><br/>So basically he tells two stories, one of which is lies and one true. He then asks the writer which story he prefers and he says he, ""The one with the tiger. That's the better story."" Pi responds, ""Thank you. And so it goes with God."" However, just because the writer preferred the first story doesn't mean he now believes in God like Pi claimed he would; he merely liked the first story better. Just like Pi's first story, this claim is more bulls**t from a compulsive liar. Personally, I liked the second story much better, which was never even shown, merely given a brief spoken account of. It sounded like it would have made a far better movie than an hour on a boat befriending a tiger. What Pi should have said is that the two stories he was about to tell would make the writer understand the nature of faith better, not make him believe in God.<br/><br/>The message,which began with Pi as a kid following three different religions, and ended with him spelling out that that it doesn't matter which story(religion/belief) is true, just follow the one you like the best and comforts you the most, is a terrible message. It teaches people that it's OK to believe in lies instead of the truth, to follow a religion just because it has a nice story, and maybe even follow a few simultaneously then you can enjoy all the various stories.<br/><br/>The movie tries to have an open-minded, positive message about religion, encompassing them all. That's all very well for teaching tolerance of other religions, but as a message it's problematic as I just find it so flaky. Since when has the truth been so unimportant? The truth is important and I won't let this ill-thought-out movie tell me otherwise. As someone who doesn't agree with the concept of believing in lies just to comfort oneself with a nice story, the message went against what I believe.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I don't understand how anyone religious could like the movie either. Surely the whole point of religion is to follow it because you actually believe it to be the truth, not just because it's comforting and a nice story. If I was religious then I would find this message patronising and offensive. Religious people praising the movie can only mean one of two things: 1) They're fully aware that their religion is a lie and don't care as they're happy just liking the story 2) They didn't get the message of the film. Neither of these reasons are anything to be proud of.<br/><br/>The only demographic I would imagine liking this film are flaky people, and people who think being flaky is acceptable, or even admirable. According to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, this is over 80% of the population. I can't say I find THAT true story very comforting, but, as the truth is apparently not important, maybe I should believe that nobody is flaky and everyone else agrees with me and sees 'Life Of Pi' for what it really is. If there's one thing I can't stand it's flakiness; it's annoying and you never know where you stand with such people or what they stand for.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of a story being too traumatic to tell so giving a false version with symbolism instead, but the message about religion was stupid. If people simply enjoyed the journey then that's fine but it isn't that interesting, and without the message, hollow. People thinking the message is wonderfully deep, beautiful and philosophical, however, need to quit being such flakes and give themselves a slap. Yann Martel, who wrote this 'lying-is-wonderful' story, needs to find another career and spare the world from more stupid messages.<br/><br/>Other than impressive and beautiful visuals, a few lines of good humour and a shipwreck, this film had nothing for me. Plus it dragged, like Ang Lee movies tend to; I would honestly have preferred to sit through his 'Hulk' movie a second time. Pi is a boring, time-wasting, flaky, bulls**tting douche, and I'd be grateful if next time he kept his ill-thought-out, tediously long-winded stories to himself."
"MovieNewsAndUpdates","10","37","63","25 November 2012"," Deserves a lot of praise and much more
","Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith, religion, endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there, he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead, Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list"
"miccosiamesecat","1","39","68","8 May 2013"," Slow boring movie and smacks of new age
","First off, let me just say that I am NOT some religious nut. I a have seen the twilight movies and probably a bunch of other movies that I shouldn't be watching. I'm an adult and can sift through a movie and take away what I want and watch the rest just for entertainment value, even though I AM a Christian.<br/><br/>That being said....this movie takes about five different religions and mixes them all together and basically says, it's okay to believe in anything you want, that everything is ALL the same and you can pick apart different ideas and make your own religion. I found that idea very disturbing and I wouldn't even mention it, except for the fact that they push this super spiritual mixture mess throughout the entire movie. I would have loved this movie if they would of left the spiritual voodoo out of the movie. Make it a simple story of overcoming the odds and finding a bonding relationship with an exotic animal that not many people will ever understand, let alone come that close to. I could believe and even respect that. Some people has special talents and gifts with animals and can understand them in ways most people can't, and the animals reciprocate that back.<br/><br/>Enough said about the religious stuff...let me just say that the movie was pretty slow. I know that one of the main characters(aka..the tiger) doesn't have dialogue and so you have to rely on the animals body language to do the talking for you. There was one part towards the end of the movie(don't want to give it away) where I thought I was having an acid trip, the idea was so ridiculous and strange. I know this is supposed to be a deep spiritual and slightly(and I emphasize slightly) philosophical type movie, but that wasn't what I was expecting to get out of this movie and towards the end, it just got ridiculous. Not to mention, I hated the way things ended up with the boy and the tiger and the ending of the actual movie was very boring and anticlimactic.<br/><br/>I like deep...deep thoughts, ideas...I can do deep in my sleep, but this movie was just weird on every level and is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This COULD have been a really great movie if they would of kept it simple...boy bonds with tiger and overcomes all odds...no mumbo jumbo wonky stuff.<br/><br/>That's my two cents anyway..."

","I gave this film 10/10 because it is really touching and lets people think about things around us. I didn't expect it that good since I haven't read the book. Probably Ang Lee's directing made me want to see how it works, but it turned out very amazing. The film is not perfect, you can see some goofs in it. It is a sight feast in terms of pictures. The whole story and journey that Pi had been through is well told, and at last Pi told a different story, which really made me think about things around us. Many times what we believed is perhaps not the truth...but when we find something that is worth to believe, we shouldn't let it go even if we may lose everything we cared about, they will come back eventually...Anyway, it is really a good movie, worth to watch!"

"nolandalla-447-695930","7","25","43","28 November 2012"," A Beautiful But Flawed Film
","Life of Pi is a difficult movie to review.<br/><br/>Certain to be one of the year's most widely-discussed films, in part because it's open to multiple interpretations, this is a bold cinematic achievement by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee.<br/><br/>Yet, it's also fundamentally flawed, its most puzzling script gaps camouflaged by extraordinary special effects and first-rate performances by the actors who portray the lead character at different stages of his life. Indeed, the varied imagery and wide range of emotional demands upon the actors are so compelling that one might actually overlook the glaring contradiction within the film's most intriguing question — which deals with the storyteller's relationship with God. The film is such a powerful visual spectacle that the audience deserves an equally consistent storyline — and ultimately just as satisfying a payoff — which compliments the arduous endurance test of sitting through what feels like an overly-long 2 hour and 20 minute epic journey across the world's biggest ocean.<br/><br/>First, the basics. ""Pi"" is an Indian boy who enjoys an almost idyllic childhood. His early years are spent in a tropical seaside paradise located on the coast of the Indian Ocean. Pi's family owns and operates a zoo with several exotic animals.<br/><br/>When Pi becomes a teenager, his father decides to disband the zoo and move the entire family abroad. This leads to a life-changing adventure. To its credit, the story challenges many conventional assumptions about new immigrants. We assume immigrants are thrilled to be in a new homeland. But that's not always the case. After all, what child wants to be uprooted from a house near the beach, living happily among zoo animals — as is the case with Pi? I found this to be a powerful message — no doubt experienced by many very real immigrant children — which I had frankly never considered before. Sometimes, immigrants leave happy lives behind when forced to move elsewhere due to circumstances beyond their control.<br/><br/>The family and their prized zoo animals set off to Canada, which is to become their new home. Pi and his family board a cargo ship scheduled to cross the Pacific Ocean, with several wild animals from what had been the family zoo boarded in steerage.<br/><br/>A deadly typhoon changes everything. During the storm, Pi is thrown into an open lifeboat and is ultimately forced to survive on his own at sea. To make matters worse, but undoubtedly more interesting for the audience, some wild animals manage to find sanctuary inside the lifeboat with the terrified Pi. One of the animals that climbs aboard is a vicious Bengal tiger.<br/><br/>The story is entirely plausible up to this point. In the interest of avoiding spoilers for those who have not seen the movie, let's just say Pi and his beastly companion end up spending many months at sea together locked in a battle for supremacy and survival. As one can imagine, the demands which would be extraordinary were Pi sailing solo are magnified tenfold by the presence of a wild beast that views everything on the boat as his next tasty meal.<br/><br/>One thing which can be revealed is that Pi somehow manages to survive the ordeal. The story is told in flashbacks by an older and wiser Pi, ostensibly living somewhere in Canada in the present day. These segments introduce the film's most puzzling assertion.<br/><br/>The movie includes strong religious overtones throughout. Pi's early years are spent searching for God and the right religion to join. This is a pervasive theme throughout all stages of the film — setting up the central character's most poignant moment of self-discovery. This takes place when the adult Pi, now in his early 40s, reveals to the listener that the perilous sea voyage enabled him to better know and understand God. The reflection is largely positive.<br/><br/>Alas, Pi spends considerable time praising God as his savior at sea. After all, the necessities for survival were ultimately provided to him.<br/><br/>And therein lies the glaring contradiction. Pi reveres the same God who essentially murdered his entire family, needlessly sent dozens of innocent animals off to a torturous and terrifying death, and transformed him into an orphan in a strange land — not to mention having to endure a terrorizing ordeal on the high seas for 227 days. If God is to be praised for providing precious food and water at opportune moments while exposed at sea for months on end, shouldn't the same divinity also bear the blame for causing so much death and misery in the first place? ""Gee God — thanks for the tuna and rainwater. I guess that's payback for drowning my giraffe, two elephants, plus my mom and dad."" Moreover, the beautiful imagery becomes something of a distraction. Several short interludes interrupt Pi's struggle at sea, which show off a kaleidoscope of splendor. Unfortunately, these scenes in no way serve to advance the story nor answer any of the fundamental questions and judgments which Pi is entitled to make following his experience.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is not a film for children. It's being promoted as an action-adventure with a boy as the star, and various animals as the supporting cast. But these are not Disney animals. They are wild beasts capable of killing in an instant. There are several scenes of savagery, which left may children screaming and crying in the showing I attended. For those expecting to see Beauty and the Beast at sea, think again.<br/><br/>In summation, this is a spectacular cinematic achievement, which will undoubtedly be rewarded at Oscar time. Deservedly so.<br/><br/>Everyone will take away something different away from this movie. My interpretation is that life — even when filled with the prospect of danger and death — can be mesmerizing, even beautiful. However, as a spiritual awakening, this is a movie which cannot be rescued. That message remains aimlessly adrift at sea.<br/><br/>www.nolandalla.com"
"BJBatimdb","5","33","59","26 December 2012"," Disappointing and confused
","I haven't read Life of Pi, and feel that being too faithful to the book may have been where screenwriter David Magee went wrong.<br/><br/>At its heart it seems to be a simple story - an allegory about a boy and a tiger that masks an horrific experience on board a drifting lifeboat. However, the structure of the piece means that when the truth is finally relayed in the film, all its impact is lost in the confusion of what has gone before. Instead of shock, I felt only irritation that the two-hour allegory had been so unambiguous and had given no hints to the truth which - for maximum effect - should have immediately become apparent in the telling of the second story. So instead of feeling illuminated by the end, I felt cheated and disappointed.<br/><br/>Visually it's gorgeous, the acting is first rate, the CGI seamless and the 3D is nice enough, but the movie drags in several places (the mangrove island is just pretty padding) and although the animals portrayed are CGI versions, they are so realistic that I was more upset by the scenes of their slaughter than I was when that was related to the deaths of real people. I would not take a child to see this movie without considering the scenes of animal suffering. Just because they are CGI animals does not make it less traumatic.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointing trip to the movies, where I felt the writer and director lost sight of the most important emotional arc and thereby diminished any impact at the end which would have made up for a rather slow - if beautiful - film."
"Ash_Heydrich","1","66","130","19 December 2012"," I saw this movie backwards and the pie was still narrating.
","I am an Indian. I watched this in India. With my girlfriend next to me. And we laughed hard throughout the movie because of the horrible Indian accent of all ages of Pi. Thanks to Russell Peters who has actually ruined the Indian accent forever, because lets face it, it is really like that. You can never take a guy who speaks in such accent seriously. ""Richard Parker, I have got water for you, Richard Parker"" I mean mother of god!! <br/><br/>Speaking of God, and religion, it's not down everybody else's lane, like I am an Atheist and proudly so, so I found this movie a propaganda for religious fanatics. <br/><br/>This Pi guy really should have used pronouns for Richard Parker. Honestly. <br/><br/>227 days out on the sea and still a better love story than twilight, though. Cinematography was awesome of course, watching it in 3D was superb, but its just that. Everything else was a joke. <br/><br/>Ang Lee, I'll have what you're smoking."
"because-of-him","1","23","41","14 April 2013"," Very deceptive manner to promote false religions or not...
","The movie is actually a 9.5 out of 10 as far as special effects, but the story plays heavily on religion and is more of a moral teaching that all religions are the same, worthless while at the same time pushes anti- religion. The man who tells the story is a very intelligent person so it is very puzzling why he cannot tell the very marked distinct differences in religions yet finds that he can worship many at the same time, a belief that is beyond belief and believability. The story would have been a perfect 10 had it left out the heavy emphasis on religion because the shipping scenes and survival portions are very believable and beautifully done, almost magical. Overall, the mocking of religion leaves some, as us, with a sense of a thorn in the flesh. While we enjoyed watching it very, very much, it is not a movie we would buy or own. It is just too politically religiously abusive."
"billmanuel","3","20","35","24 April 2013"," It did teach me about ""God""
","I need to forewarn that I went into this movie with high expectations due to the critical review from the industry and the public, and the expectations grew even more after Pi said his story would make his friend, (and by extension me) believe in God. The CGI landscapes, seascapes were beautiful, but the CGI people were not as they looked odd, almost demonic. Still, I was really intrigued now that Pi was claiming that his story would leave me no choice but believe in God, so I kept watching.<br/><br/>The story unfolded and there were some exciting scenes, as exciting as can be for a boy and his cat at sea, but even some of the animal CG looked a bit fake. Once the carnivorous island sequence appeared, I knew Pi was disconnected from reality, that it was not merely a case of artistic license. The movie went downhill from here.<br/><br/>I waited for the big reveal, the part that would force me to throw off the yoke of agnosticism, change my life forever and finally embrace a higher power. The big reveal, the entire story was an allegory at best, but more accurately a lie to make the truth easier and more profound than it actually was. My takeaway from Pi about believing in God and changing my life forever, God exists if you only pretend he exists and if you are going to pretend, you might as well pretend big and make the lie really grand, truth, honesty, objectivity and logic be damned. So, in that respect I guess I learned more about religion than I cared to.<br/><br/>Even worse, the author seems to assume that the public is stupid. At the end when we find out which animal characters represented which human characters, the orangutan being Pi's mother, the zebra being the sailor, the cook being the hyena, Pi's dimwitted friend asks,""but who is the tiger?"" Really? Come on. Pi is like a magical miracle potion that everyone is raving about, but when you actually invest in it and buy it for yourself, you notice the label on the back that says, ""Contents: Oil of Snake""."
"chatless46","9","18","31","25 November 2012"," Taking Suspension of Disbelief to a New Level
","On its face, this is a ripping yarn about survival at sea, based on a novel by Canadian Yann Martel. The book version is astonishing, and the film version is literally jaw-dropping both because of its visual effects and because of its faithfulness to the source material.<br/><br/>The novel blurs the line between ""fact"" and fiction, beginning with the author's note describing his pursuit of a good story, a pursuit that lands him in Pondicherry, India. There he hears of a tale that, he is told, is God-affirming. The protagonist and narrator of the story, a native Pondicherrian by the name of Piscine Molitor Patel, now lives in Martel's homeland. Martel returns to find him in Toronto. This is where the film begins, and pretty much continues in lockstep with the book.<br/><br/>The story supposedly told to Martel by Pi Patel unfolds intriguingly from his childhood in India to his voyage at sea with his family, through tragedy and finally, to salvation. The story is infused with humor, horror, beauty, and seamanship, all aided by stunningly vivid images. At the end, the viewer and the author face a choice that may affirm theism in some, and yet allow nonbelievers to reject it.<br/><br/>What is hard to reject is the unutterable beauty and flash of the story, and the skillful way director Ang Lee has captured it on film. Convincing performances by Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi and Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi are stellar. No less convincing is the rendition of leading feline Richard Parker, a creation that may make you wonder where digital technology is leading us.<br/><br/>Most movies, and fiction in general, require suspension of disbelief. In that sense, ""Life of Pi"" can be a challenge. That said, this film breaks new ground as terrific entertainment."

","Let me start this review by saying I have enjoyed many of Ang Lee's films in the past. Let me also say that I am an animal lover. And as an animal lover I am appalled that this movie got made. <br/><br/>Now I am fully aware that a significant portion of the animal scenes were cg. Nonetheless, the extent of distress that the animals suffered in the actual scenes that were used on top of a blue screen amounted to nothing less than gross levels of animal cruelty and so typical of a person completely indifferent of modern day animal issues. <br/><br/>For that Ang Lee should be ashamed of himself. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I can't say strong enough that this is NOT a story that should have been put on film!!!<br/><br/>I say that for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the start of the film was culturally inaccurate. The mere suggestion that an Indian boy could freely and happily explore Hinduism, Islam and Christianity is nothing short of ludicrous and extends way beyond the scope of being able to 'suspend disbelief'. As for the cg, again, I felt is was ordinary at best and certainly not worth all the Oscar buzz it achieved. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I got the bigger message. I just don't think the vehicle for it was suitable for film and I don't think it can be even mentioned in the same sentence as films like Avatar. I have not read the book and I'm sure it was a great book, but it should have stayed a best selling novel. <br/><br/>As for the film; it is used toilet paper and for his complicity in gross acts of animal cruelty, I hope Ang Lee never works again."

","Life of Pi (2012) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Ang Lee's incredible tale of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), a teenage Indian boy who survives a ship sinking that kills everyone on board except for himself and a tiger. Soon the two are on board a lifeboat not knowing what their future holds. I had never heard of the novel that this film is based on and I had absolutely no idea what the film was about until about five months prior I saw a promotional piece while waiting to watch another movie. I actually went back to work joking about the picture because I couldn't believe anyone would try and make a movie about a boy, a tiger and a lifeboat but the joke is on me because Lee has created one of the more memorable, magical and uplifting films of the year. I was really shocked to see how tremendous the picture was but what makes it so special would have me giving away countless spoilers, which is something I'm certainly not going to do. I think it would be best for viewers to go into the picture knowing as little as possible but I can say that Lee has created one of the most beautiful pictures you're likely to see. The beautiful images are just so remarkable to look at that it's impossible not to get caught up in the scenery. Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen. I'm really not a fan of CGI unless it's used properly. Too many times I think it's just used to be lazy and save money but that's not the case here as Lee perfectly mixes in the CGI with the live action stuff. The two coming together are practically flawless and that certainly helps bring one closer to the story and characters. Sharma does a terrific job and especially when you consider he'd never acted before and was basically having to carry the entire film. I was a little mixed on the 3D effects. While some where brilliant, for the most part I think the film would be viewed just fine in 2D as it would give one better colors. Still, no matter which version you see, the heart of the picture is in its soul, its character and the lessons he learns while being stuck out at sea for over two hundred days. LIFE OF PI is a really remarkable film that has so much going for it that it's clearly one of the year's best."
"evanston_dad","9","12","20","15 February 2013"," Made Me Wish I Could Believe in God
","I read ""Life of Pi"" years ago and remembered little of the details about the book other than that I enjoyed it. During the first half hour or so of Ang Lee's screen adaptation, I felt myself getting bored and restless. It seemed like a religious movie, a movie whose central premise was all about reaffirming a belief in God. As a non-believer, I don't begrudge films with religious themes, but I also don't really enjoy them, feeling like someone invited to a party where everyone else is speaking a different language.<br/><br/>But then the main thrust of the story kicks in, the young boy Pi is stranded in the middle of the ocean with a lifeboat and a tiger, and I was engrossed by the beauty and spectacle that Ang Lee delivers. And then toward the end, there's a twist that I instantly remembered from the book as soon as it happens in the film, and that I can't believe I had forgotten. For that twist is what makes this film something beautiful and much more than a simple story about faith in a higher power. Instead, it becomes a story that gets much closer to the motives behind what I think drives most people to religious faith, and that is that believing in God is way more comforting than the alternative. Some people seem to be able to choose to believe, while others (like myself) simply can't, no matter how much more appealing life seems with a strong belief in a higher power. People will argue probably forever over this film's ending and what it means, but that's what it meant for me.<br/><br/>Ang Lee needs to be commended. This film had to be a very difficult directing feat to pull off, confined as it is almost entirely to a lifeboat and a slew of CGI effects.<br/><br/>A truly wondrous and wonderful film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Live of Pi was so bad that I'm at a loss as to how to review it.

It seemed as if he did everything he possibly could to ensure that he would not survive.<br/><br/>Nothing about the island made any sense.<br/><br/>In summary, it is as if everyone involved with this movie from start to finish was on drugs the entire time.

"Galina_movie_fan","10","14","25","22 February 2013"," Furious Tiger, Brave Boy
","I saw ""Life of Pi"" last night and absolutely loved it. I still feel so overwhelmed by it, its visual splendor and the moving story that kept me involved for the whole time. The latest Ang Lee's film is beauty itself, and everyone involved in creation of such sparkling intelligent and classy entertainment deserves the highest praise and admiration for the work they've done. I am sure that in two days, ""Life of Pi"" will receive majority of Oscars it is nominated for. It deserves them.<br/><br/>I hesitated to see it because I did not think that the movie about a boy and a tiger stuck together in the middle of the ocean for months after the horrible shipwreck on the drifting lifeboat which the ferocious tiger first claimed as his territory and a makeshift inflatable raft chained to it which was Pi's fragile shelter would be so compelling and gripping but it was. Roger Ebert said that Life of Pi is ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I gladly agree with that. I simply can't find anything wrong with ""Life of Pi."" It is beautiful, profound and adventurous story of survival and understanding life with all it offers or throws at us. It is life affirming even though it takes us along with Pi Patel through unspeakable hardship, losses, and deadly danger of indifferent and indomitable forces of nature's elements and wild creatures. And it manages to say a lot about faith and God without being over-simplistic, preachy or shoving religion in your face. It may help an atheist to understand the believers better or at least to try. It also turns itself in unexpected direction when we thought we were in the end of the journey, reflects on the darkest corners of human nature and leaves the viewers asking questions on what they really want to believe and whether they are open to the possibility of miracle in life, in their lives. It is up to the viewers to choose the answer only they would be satisfied with.<br/><br/>Peaceful beauty of Pondicherry, former French colony in India that surprisingly for me looked like a charming small French town, totally enthralled me in the beginning of the film that started as a typical coming of age story. Well, it is coming of age story but amazing on so many levels, spiritual, ethical, physical, religious, humanistic, testing the limits of what a human being can deal with and how it would shape him, his life, and his perception of life. This is an experience, both movie watching and afterthought that will stay with me. What else can I ask for in a movie? I've always respected and admired Ang Lee and found his movies exquisite. But ""Life of Pi"" is without doubt his best work. Furious tiger, brave boy, magic journey, fascinating story - amazing movie."

","Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.<br/><br/>It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.<br/><br/>I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.<br/><br/>I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.<br/><br/>My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.<br/><br/>You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.<br/><br/>And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.<br/><br/>There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see.

","It is very hard to give this masterful creation of Ang Lee a tangible rating and critic, because much of the takeaway of the film, is for the moviegoers and readers of the original novel to contemplate. <br/><br/>It is also very hard to rate because it has been such a hard movie to make, out of a novel that addresses both the strength of faith and weakness of humanity in a rhetoric way.<br/><br/>Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor. The conversation about the journey of life that Ang Lee has succeeded in engaging us into is a special kind that few artists like him is able to deliver.<br/><br/>The opening music is magic.<br/><br/>The one point I deducted is my faith in Ang Lee.

","I honestly didn't expect to say this again in the current calendar year but ""this is probably the best movie I have seen this year"". Yes, I think this is probably even a better movie that The Dark Knight Returns which I was all but certain would be my personal Picture of the Year winner. Life of Pi was simply amazing. The story is incredible and the way the film is delivered couldn't be better. You truly go on this story with Pi Patel and Richard Parker. The acting by Suraj Sharma is surprisingly fantastic as well. Some people will surely call this movie boring because it has a slower pace to it but Tom Hanks' Castaway film was also on the slower side and as that movie showed, if a film is well done the slow pace allows for more emotion and a connection to the characters. Shoot, I got watery eyes when Hanks' character lost Wilson and that was a stinking volleyball, lol. This movie plays along that same style of a slow paced story of survival but is done even better due to the incredible cinematography that rivals Avatar in terms of magnificence. Another thing Life of Pi did remarkably well was end without disappointment. By that, I do not mean that the ending isn't sad. I mean that the ending lives up to the film. Again, take Castaway for example. That movie was great but its ending was quick and left a lot to be desired. The ending for Life of Pi throws a subtle twist that is sort of a mind blowing moment. That subtle twist leaves you pondering the events of the film well after it ends."

","The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest ""Life of Pi"" he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. ""Life of Pi"" is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when ""Life of Pi"" transposes itself to a mystical ""survival-at-sea"" flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of ""young man vs. beast"" for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), ""Life of Pi"" is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent"
"koki400","2","12","21","6 March 2014"," truly terrible ending
","I must say that this movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen. It was all a dream or the evil character is all in my head ain't got nothing on this movie. I am not trolling I will say that life of pi is beautifully shot and it is moving at times. However, Spoiler alert...the basic structure of this movie is ""narrator"" at the beginning ""let me tell you a story that is so fantastical you wont believe it."" Viewer at the end ""Oh my, did that really happen...I...I..don't believe it."" Narrator ""I told you..the reason you don't believe it.,is cause I made the whole thing up."" We then are treated to the real story which is suppose to be so terrible that he made up this ""loose"" story about animals which is some vague metaphor of the truth blah blah. The real insulting part is when the old codger ask the writer...which story do you prefer. The premise, plot, and ending of both stories are the same but do you like the one with the cuddly zoo animals or the one where we use people as bait and I watch my mother get killed. The writer and the audience in unison say...tear rolling down cheek..the one with the tiger...the end. The point being some pseudo intellectual notion that watching your mother die or being raped or insert whatever horrible thing could happen to you is all a mindset or how we choose to deal with it. OK I get it, a positive attitude can do wonders. But seriously if you survive something like the holocaust I would rather just hear the version that is the truth rather than the version where Adolf Hitler is mickey mouse and you were in Narnia the whole time. I mean come on..this is so insulting on so many different levels. First off, if you are going to tell me this stupid made up story abut honey badgers and unicorns..then stick to it like a crazy person...don't tell me the real story right afterwords. Cause you know what my reaction is going to be, not oh my god what a cute story I like the first one better. My reaction is going to be oh crap you watched your mother get hacked to pieces and you made up a story about it involving zoo animals and then you ask me isn't the first story better...um yes it is...but the story of Anne frank would be better if she was cat woman and died at the end fighting crime...but alas that's not what happened..nor is it the story I prefer."
"taooftri","8","11","19","4 March 2013"," Excellent movie by Ang Lee and his crew!
","This is by far the best Ang Lee's film, at least to me.<br/><br/>I read a lot of comments about this film after watching it just yesterday. Many discussions revolve the topic on whether the animal or human version of the story is real. My view is that none of them is real.<br/><br/>It is a film about faith. Both the animal and human versions are not real. The human version is made up. The animal version is a figment of Pi's imagination and the animals are merely metaphors. The four animals personify the 3 religions and logic that Pi has been exposed to in earlier life. This adventure allows him to find the religion that means the most to him (we all have our preferred gods). Logic - most likely represented by the orang utan - is not enough to help Pi tide through the ordeal at sea. Only the tiger - his chosen religion/faith - is able to last him the whole way. In effect, the boat is Pi, his heart; and the sea and storms are life itself. Through life, and experiencing life, Pi finds his god.<br/><br/>What is the island? The green interwined roots of the mystic green trees most likely stand for the serpents of Vishnu and the shape of the island does remind one of Vishnu. The fact that the island gives and takes away life provides further proof that it is actually a metaphor for Vishnu.<br/><br/>There are many other interpretations to this film but I think this is the beauty of Life of Pi. The human version of the story was made up for the two Japanese investigators and it is actually a sarcasm toward the conventional minds, which do not believe in faith and miracle but embrace only the logical.<br/><br/>It is a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>Bravo, Ang Lee and team!"

I am not positive this movie should have been labeled as a ""PG"" movie because it contained scenes that certainty were not kid-friendly. I am truly astonished at the fact that this movie had good ratings because it was so beyond horrible, in my opinion. If anyone asks me how Life of Pi was, I'll tell you now, I will not be giving it a positive recommendation, let alone any at all.

","After his ship is hit by a storm, a young Indian man finds himself adrift on a boat with a tiger. The cinematography is so dazzling that Lee won an Oscar for this, one of the few instances where a director has won without the film winning Best Picture. Unfortunately, Lee is better with the special effects than with the actors, whose performances are uneven at best. While the movie looks great, like pretty postcards, the script, based on a popular novel, is too weak to sustain interest. The story, disjointed and somewhat clumsily structured with flashbacks, is fantastic and nonsensical, and ultimately pointless. The characters are meant to be wise and worldly but come across as shallow caricatures."
"DICK STEEL","10","15","29","2 December 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Life of Pi
","Once, many thought that Life of Pi, based upon the novel by Yann Martel, was unfilmmable. But I guess it takes a special someone with much imagination and gusto to tackle it head on, dealing with three aspects many filmmakers would largely and automatically shy away from - children, animals and plenty of water - and delivering one riveting picture that's as visually arresting as it is dramatically challenging in its tale of fantasy, religion, philosophy and life.<br/><br/>In what would essentially be a one man show for the most parts, almost akin to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks in terms of a tale on the human spirit, Ang Lee didn't have the luxury of a world renowned actor at his side delivering soliloquy after soliloquy, but had the luxury of improved technology to assist in his cause. And technology this time helped to transform this story into what it was, especially when it came to dealing with animals, having to weaken a Bengali tiger over a period of time, as well as to shoot scenes of nature and the food chain, which in normal circumstances would be almost impossible to create and control.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is what it is, with Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi for short, with an extended little sub-arc to tell of his creation of the nickname, now an adult (Irrfan Khan), and telling his remarkable tale of shipwreck and survival in his family's uprooting from India toward Canada in search of a new life outside of the own they know of, which involved a zoo. But as it turns out, the Japanese vessel they are travelling in sank during a storm encountered while in the Miranda Trench, and the few survivors turned out to be Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and finally, one of the earth's most dangerous predators, the tiger nicknamed Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Much of the narrative then deals with man versus animal, man versus nature and the elements, and Pi's survival while having to deal with a predator at his doorstep. In Cast Away, Tom Hanks has Wilson to interact with, while here it's a battle between Pi and Richard Parker, which one can allude or metaphors as a battle within oneself for necessities and wants, and the picking up of essential skills to survive. One took us on a slice of life trip on a deserted island, while this one takes us on a slice of life trip drifting along in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean, amongst what would be one of the last frontiers on the planet.<br/><br/>And this is opportunity for plenty of gorgeous, hyper imagery and visuals, that makes it a technological wet dream to deploy the kind of firepower money can buy for a movie. There's 3D technology, IMAX with its different aspect ratios that creep in during stylized sequences, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography exploiting what's best to bring about plenty of exquisitely crafted, postcard picturesque landscapes and waterscapes that will leave one astounded as these effectively augment the themes of the story, especially dealing with nature, bearing witness to both the tranquility and the ferocity that it can bring.<br/><br/>What made it a lot admirable, is that Ang Lee decided to stick to his guns and cast a group of relative unknowns, and handing over the lead role to a new actor Suraj Sharma, who repaid the director's faith manifold. It demonstrates the leap of faith the director had to undertake, mirroring the same leap of faith Pi had in committing his survival to higher powers, doing the best with what he has at his disposal, with circumstances and outcome for someone higher up to decide. Suraj Sharma holds his own and doesn't look overawed, or too raw for a role that deals with a coming of spiritual age of sorts, and I won't be surprised if this film provides that career boost along the same lines as Dev Patel's of Slumdog Millionaire.<br/><br/>Those who have read the book will know of a second story arc that provides the crux of most post-viewing discussion, allowing points to be made in support of, or against each version being told by Pi. What I thought interesting was how either could be truth, and it says a lot about what us humans would like to hear - only the good stuff, and that in which we can process or accept, and is more palatable for various reasons, versus something that requires a huge dose of faith and belief from the storyteller. In light of what we cannot verify, this theme turns Life of Pi into something of a religious debate, especially since Pi himself is something of a religion connoisseur, dabbling in many and yet being the master of none.<br/><br/>Still, if that doesn't really appeal to you, then Ang Lee's story-telling craft of Yann Martel's fantasy will, of a remarkable trip across an ocean, filled with sadness, despair, yet about survival and hope, complete with stunning visuals that will keep you mesmerized for the most parts, about a boy, a tiger, and the life boat they find themselves sharing under extraordinary circumstances. A definite recommendation, and would probably be shortlisted as one of my favourites of the year!"

","The trailers I saw for Life of Pi did nothing to explain what the movie was at all and I had not read the book nor heard of it. But I decided to give it a try. I don't like 3D, never have, it's always unimpressive. Well guess what? Ang Lee did it. I saw this in 3D and it literally is the first 3D film that made me go WOW!! The visuals are just absolutely amazing, some of the best effects I have ever seen. Fortunately this is not where the films ends it impressive streak. The story is just lovely, riveting, and so emotionally and spiritually deep. A philosophy class could talk about this movie for an entire year and still have more to say. The film doesn't even begin to try to give you a philosophy or way of life but rather is all about exploring the world and exploring the philosophies of life. As a lover of animals you will look for how all the animals in the film play a role but there are truly just animals and important lessons are learned through them. It was perhaps one of the most symbolic and deeply philosophical films I have ever seen and because of that it was incredibly entertaining and beautifully shot.<br/><br/>While a few actors play Pi throughout various stages of his life, only one leaves an indelible and brilliant impression. Suraj Sharma at least deserves an Oscar nomination for making you feel so connected to him and displaying a brilliant display of courage and depth to his character. While he doesn't get as much screen time Irrfan Khan puts incredible emotion into his performance as adult Pi. Both Sharma and Khan bring to life a great adventurer and philosopher in the form of Pi. The supporting cast performs their parts perfectly. No one person really stands out because their goal it to get Pi into his adventure but they are still great. Adil Hussain and and Tabu are particularly good as Pi's parents.<br/><br/>Ang Lee without a doubt must receive an Oscar nod for this film. The cinematography, the special effects, and most importantly the use of those special effects are nothing short of revolutionary. The animals are so brilliantly done and the character of the tiger (Richard Parker...love how he got his name too) is so vital to the entire story and by the time the film ends you will ache for the tiger as much as Pi does so you will feel his emotions. The film won't be for everyone. Certainly its just too intense for children with a lot of animal deaths and I can see the mainstream movie goers accusing it of being ""slow"" or ""boring"" but for anyone looking for something unique and outstanding, Life of Pi is it. I hope the critics feel the same way because this one is a home run in my books!! 9/10"
"lancequan2046","9","14","27","27 November 2012"," The Lotus Flower in the Heart
","A sad, violent and cruel story disguised as a fairy tale about a kid taming a tiger at sea. <br/><br/>In Ang Lee's hands the book-to-film adaptation was thankfully not turned into something of a young Robinson Crusoe or a love story between a volleyball and a fat Hanks. At the same time none of the magical realism ""feel"" of the novel was lost in the adaptation / visual interpretation. Eventually the very bloody message of the story (humans are essentially beasts, we create religion or hallucinate about faith to help ourselves forgetting our bestial nature) was impressively preserved without the need to show almost any gore. <br/><br/>Most importantly, the very sensitive topic of the conflicts and dependency of faith, religions, science and nature was beautifully narrated in the movie. The technicality demonstrated in Life Of Pi is everything on a magnificent, grandeur scale, yet at the same time the technicality does not over-shine Lee's nature as an intellectual – his yearning and pursuit for purity and beauty.<br/><br/>I remember coming across a film review that called Lee's Life Of Pi ""preachy"", which seems to echo quite a few reviews on the book. Whoever said that, in my opinion, made a very basic mistake in understanding the purpose of the story. Both Martel's novel and Magee's script, not only never attempted to coax people to flock to religion or faith, but also put a rather nasty joke on religion and its forms. Yet at the same time in the end the protagonist of the story was able to maintain his faith, despite having some not-so-mild-natured joke cast onto his religions. ""Preachy""? Please. This looks more like a sacrilegious story to me.<br/><br/>When I read the book, one of the things that impressed me the most was that Pi never for once cursed, sworn or truly lost it while drifting at sea, amidst all his suffering and misery. My guess is that reverence and hope never really left him, and that, is probably the true distinction between having a faith and not having one. Lee gave this rare, controlled and optimistic narration a beautiful stretch in his film – Pi had a happy ending by textbook definition. In the end, some might think of Lee as some semi-delusional intellect with wishful thinking, he is probably more willing to believe in the deity and beauty in human nature instead of looking into our bestial instincts. Or maybe, he is like the Indian girl in the film dancing Bharatanatyam – there is a blossoming lotus flower hidden somewhere in his heart.<br/><br/>I am far more pessimistic than he is. I am constantly on guard in case my Richard Parker ambushes me and tears me into pieces, although I also know, there is probably still a lotus flower hidden somewhere in my heart."

","'Life of Pi' is a story about a young man stranded on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a tiger after the ship carrying his family and their zoo sinks. Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), this is a spectacular film with a lot of great qualities.<br/><br/>There's pretty much just one actor in this; Suraj Sharma makes a great debut here and I really hope his career takes off after this despite not being nominated for an Oscar unfortunately. It must be challenging being the only actor on-screen for 90% of the film with no one to converse with except a CGI tiger- Sharma handles this well though and his performance is thoroughly entertaining. Irfan Khan doesn't have much screen time but he gives a powerful performance, particularly in the last scene. Rafe Spall is a bit disappointing; he doesn't show any emotion in crucial scenes and he can take away the power and quality of a scene because of this. The exact opposite of an actors' job!<br/><br/>I am opposed to 3D in cinema and therefore chose to see this in traditional, 'boring' 2D. Visually, it is still spectacular despite it being advertised as a film made for 3D (doesn't every 3D films' advertising campaign argue this?). The CGI animals – excluding the tiger – can look obviously fake and tacky at times which can be a bit off- putting but this is very brief. The night sequences are over the top and unrealistic but are beautiful and do somehow suit the film – Ang Lee has done well in creating the setting.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent film which is sure to do well at the Oscars. It's not really similar to any of Ang Lee's other works but it is a great film to watch and is expertly made. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book so I can't tell if it is any better but, from what I do know about the book, I think this film tries to stay as close to it as possible."

","I cannot overpower my very own purist's paranoia, I watched this film in theater a few days earlier in dubbed Italian (my Italian level is so-so), I could not reckon that any film has been officially ""viewed"" until I have watched it in its original form, so thanks to the latest BluRay copy, finally I am able to hail LIFE OF PI as my current favorite film of 2012! <br/><br/>Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced. <br/><br/>Back to the film itself, I am pretty oblivious to Yann Martel's source novel, but Ang Lee and his crew has deserved every single accolade because the outcome is simply astounding and mind-blowing, from the exotic Indian zoo, the palette of liveliness and quietude seeps directly to viewer's mind curves, then, the visual stunts take over, the minutiae are constructed into an inconceivable kaleidoscope of sea survival (ship-wrecking, heaven-like sea surface, carnivore island).<br/><br/>The allegorical storyline which can be laconically recapitulated as ""the story between a boy and a Bengal tiger floating on the sea"", also goes beyond one's mundane imagination, the liaison between Pi and Richard Parker the tiger has gone through a minute incubation-to- transition cliffhanger (technically it is not a cliffhanger since we all know the ending beforehand, but the two-hander just conjures magic spell upon us, which is mesmerizing, eye-popping and heart-warming), with the brilliant first-time actor Suraj Sharma interacting viscerally with the green screen (an almost entirely CGI-germinated tiger heralds the auspicious retirement of all the animal cast, as long as money continues investing, leave those poor animals in peace and so are the ever-engaging animal activist). Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances. <br/><br/>Being an agnostic, Pi's eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn't register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be ""a story could make one believe in God"", the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as ""religions""is concerned. <br/><br/>The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly- recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee's versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible."
"DubhDoo","8","9","16","9 March 2013"," A beautiful and engrossing adventure from Ang Lee
","In a manner somewhat similar to the recent adaptation of David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas', 'Life of Pi' shouldn't work. Based on the award-winning and widely-lauded 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel, it chronicles the life-changing maritime adventure of a young Indian boy humorously named Piscine or ""Pi"" for short, who after a surviving the sinking of a ship, ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and of course, a large Bengal tiger called Richard Parker (a moniker that came about wittily). Consequently, the book came to considered 'unfilmmable' (and for just cause), yet the world of cinema's interest in Martel's wonderful novel remained undying and after much development the proposed adaptation eventually landed at the feet of the excellent Ang Lee. <br/><br/>Despite Lee's having proved himself to be a director of considerable talent, with superb offerings like 'The Ice Storm' and 'Brokeback Storm', themselves both adaptations, it was doubtful whether or not the much-loved novel would translate successfully to the big screen. Many other accomplished directors have failed to capture similarly ambitious novels in film form, such as David Lynch's folly that was 'Dune'. Any worry has turned out to be unnecessary though as the Taiwanese filmmaker has delivered a beautiful and moving film that is easily one of his finest works yet. <br/><br/>There's no denying that 'Life of Pi' is filled with visual beauty, as in teaming up with DoP Claudio Miranda, Lee has utilised the film's ocean setting like an impressionistic artist to a blank canvas. Even though it is a scene that has done the rounds in the film's trailers, the night- set scene where the whale leaps out of the water is a thing of breathtaking majesty. Similarly, there are numerous moments that are nothing short of gorgeous in a way that could see even Terrence Malick become envious. Adding to this, the use of CGI is one of the most remarkable in recent years, exemplified with the meticulous detail put into Richard Parker, which renders him a significant achievement in CGI, as it becomes rather difficult to tell when the tiger is real or not.<br/><br/>Yet, it's worth noting that this is a film that resonates on an emotional level as well as a technical. From the moment proceedings kicked off, I was engrossed in Pi's story, with its smooth fluidity, whether I was looking at Irrfan Khan or Suraj Sharma. The latter, a first time actor, delivers a great and at times subtle performance as the titular character, consistently helping me to engage with Pi and ultimately, like him. Even as he was simply sitting upon a raft in silence, I still couldn't help but find myself enthralled in the journey he had (unwillingly) embarked on.<br/><br/>'Life of Pi' is a wonderful film, bursting with imagination and in love with the possibilities of storytelling, which sees Ang Lee wield 3-D expertly, forgoing the usual gimmicky 'things leaping out of the screen' and instead adding more depth and texture to the colourful cinematography. It's not just a technical marvel, but a true wonder all round, because the fact that Martel's novel actually works (rather well, at that) as a film is quite a miracle, and for Ang Lee should applauded."
"jj_spicer","8","9","16","18 February 2013"," Visually stunning. Engrossing storyline
","I went into Life of Pi not knowing anything about it. I'd seen trailers, and assumed it was a ""Jungle Book on Water"" sort of story. The trailers don't really do it justice as far as conveying what sort of story it is. It's a truly memorable film.<br/><br/>A young boy, Pi, on his way to Canada with his family and their animals from their zoo, is shipwrecked and left stranded in the middle of the ocean on a boat with nothing but a Bengal Tiger to keep him company. But, unlike the Jungle Book, where you'd imagine the boy and the tiger become best friends and head off on an exciting adventure together, this story remains anchored in realism. This tiger is an actual tiger, which tends to want to maul and eat animals, including our protagonist, and there is a very effective scene early on that establishes this premise.<br/><br/>The story becomes a tale of how the two manage to survive in close proximity with each other, each knowing the other wants to survive, and each knowing that, somehow, survival is dependent on the other. And as the final scenes start to show, the metaphor behind the scenario is deep and thought-provoking. Questions of religion, faith, humanity and the soul are raised, and you'll leave the cinema having experienced a pretty thought-provoking film.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma has to carry the film, as he and his CGI (for the most part) tiger are the only two characters on screen for most of the 2+ hours, echoing shades of Cast Away. And Sharma does a terrific job for a young and relatively unheard of actor. Ang Lee certainly brings out the best in his performance, and the effects on the tiger are sensational. You know he must be a CGI creation, simply for safety and practicality reasons, but you truly can't tell at times whether its one of the few scenes that has an actual tiger in it. It goes to show how far CGI has come.<br/><br/>It's a visually stunning film, and its cinematography certainly adds to the story, rather than just provide a platform. Lee has always been good at using the surroundings to bring a story to life, and whilst sometimes, it maybe feels a little too pushed (the whale scene, whilst stunning, seems a little over the top), it's still wonderfully done. I didn't even find the 3D effects distracting.<br/><br/>I would be surprised if this won any Oscars, simply cause it's maybe not the sort of film that would lead to any sort of wins, except maybe in the visual effects field, but its still certainly a terrific movie to take in. I suspect reading the book may give further meaning to the film's themes, but there are plenty there already to deal with."
"TomTomH","8","9","16","13 January 2013"," Spectacular 3D, Outstanding VFX and Talented Acting!
","Ang Lee's 3D VFX film adaptation of Yann Martel's 2001 award-winning book of the same name, ""Life of Pi"", is such an amazing film with stunning artwork. Sitting in the cinema last night with friends, it was quite a jaw-dropping experience. I've got to say this would be impossible to do with real animals. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, if he was real, not CGI, would have not been easy on set. The way they animate the tiger and background is incredible. Whenever I saw a clean shot of the boat (that Pi and Parker sail in) and the sinking ship, it reminds me of the look of the animation they do in Spielberg's Tintin.<br/><br/>Pi's life is told in three stages: childhood, teenage life and adult. The adult stage is quite emotional. The story is delivered by adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) retelling the story about his unbelievable past life to a writer (Rafe Spall, Prometheus). <br/><br/>Pi's childhood (portrayed by Gautam Belur, age 5 and Ayush Tandun, age 13) starts with him being bullied at school because of his unusual name, which then he shortens, but still causes teasing. He soon begins to become interested with different religions which causes some amusement. His father owns a zoo and he teaches Pi how to take care of the animals. These lessons Pi's been taught helps him later on in his life. <br/><br/>The teenage Pi's life (portrayed by Suraj Sharma) begins his perilous journey when sailing on a ship moving to Canada, when his family agree to move from India. On the way, Pi and the ship encounter a heavy storm which ends up sinking the ship and him ending up on a lifeboat, becoming the only (human) survivor. While lost at sea with no hope, he discovers that a tiger (Richard Parker) has come aboard. Although he knows the tiger wants to kill him, he eventually works out a way to control him. Thinking about Parker, he reminds me a little bit of Aslan from C.S. Lewis' Narnia series; when he walks and roars and uses tiger facial expressions, but not when he attacks. He's a lot fiercer than Aslan, who is more calm and friendly.<br/><br/>For Suraj Sharma (teenage Pi), this is his first ever acting debut in film and already he's received his very first Bafta nomination for the Orange Rising Star Award category (and that's what I think he deserves). He brings a touching and rewarding performance as Pi, I think he's the perfect choice for the role. <br/><br/>It's special effects and 3D are fantastic. Whenever you see the animals and human extras, you even wonder if their completely CGI. Of course whenever I saw Richard Parker I knew it was going to be computer-generated, but I've just learnt that four real tigers were used in some shots. and you still can't tell which is which. It would have been completely impossible to film right out at sea, so thanks to computer-generated imagery, it couldn't be easier. The 3D effects are incredible (like Martin Scorsese's Hugo but in a different way). This isn't a gimmick. No. These are unlike the other 3D films we see today in which 3D is sometimes unnecessary. Lee (I think) uses 3D almost like they use it on 3D wildlife channels on 3D TV. In this film the animals look as real as on a wildlife programme. You wonder how they manage it, and that's what gives the film an amazing look. At one point it feels like the sea will spill into the cinema. You'd be amazed. <br/><br/>Life of Pi is a film that should be seen in 3D to experience the special effects. It isn't the best film I've ever seen but I still think it's spectacular. A must-see!"
"lbjtheking","8","9","16","10 January 2013"," Beautiful exploration of the soul!
","I liked this movie for many different reasons. The first is because of the amazing special effects. I didn't even see the film in 3D and I was still amazed by the magical scenes created. They felt like you could actually be there, experiencing them as Pi is. Another reason I really enjoyed this movie was because of how deeply it digs into and explores the heart and soul of the character of Pi. This amazing young actor does a great job of portraying the raw emotions of one trapped at sea. It is believable, entertaining, and understandable all at the same time. Its almost like a character study wrapped up with a visually spectacular adventure. It is one of the must-see movies of 2012. Do yourself a favor and take the time to really enjoy this great movie."
"planet11","9","9","16","8 January 2013"," The version of IMAX 3D is such a treat
","It's the one of two best IMAX 3D movie I've ever seen(the other one is AVATAR). I really think IMAX should take a serious consideration to use this film's clip as the demo tape. Not to mention the various meaning behind this film the reviews here said it about 100 times. I found one of the interesting part of this film is too see how the 3D effect can be used in a drama movie to tell a story, not just for those special-effect-kind film. Plus the sound editing and mixing is also well above the standard and cinematography is a lock in many awards. <br/><br/>Ang Lee is known to bring out the best from new actors ,Ziyi Zhang of CTHD,Wei Tang of Si Jie, and Suraj Sharma of this one. They all deliver award-winning performance in their first international big screen role.<br/><br/>I plan to see it again in IMAX 3D while it's still showing there, and I highly recommended anyone go to feel the real power of IMAX 3D if you haven't done so."
"EUyeshima","8","11","21","16 December 2012"," Sumptuous, CGI-Generated Images Bring Martel's Book Vividly to Life
","Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain""). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (""Howl's Moving Castle""). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.<br/><br/>Adapted by David Magee (""Finding Neverland""), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.<br/><br/>The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.<br/><br/>Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (""The Namesake"") plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from ""The Namesake"", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and Gérard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall (""One Day"") plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward."
"rjennica","10","11","21","22 November 2012"," you get lost in the vast spectacle of it all!
","This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud."
"mvedprakasha","8","6","10","28 March 2013"," The Conceptual Review
","World is a zoo bearing many species of the life where each individual witnesses the minds and souls of others which actually represents the universal truth. Opening with the soothing voice the Indian classical music of Bombay Jayashree gives us the calmness that exists in the blue planet. The takeover of the story slowly grabs the impetus in the traditional method of the Irfan khan recollecting the olden days as though inculcating the thought process of mind which always moves back either into the history or toggles into the future and never stays in the present. The years of 1950's of newly born India's is well thought of to be a subject matter. The story giving a philosophical glimpse starts with Lord Krishna who symbolizes the ultimate bliss of life throughout his journey of life, by a way of circumscribing the entire Universe in his tiny little mouth is a valid way of representing the Pi responding to it while his brother doesn't. The interests of pi and his brother are varied throughout the movie. The hunger for knowledge awakened the pi while his brother was attracted by the fantasies of the world, cleanly represented by the holy water in the church. The senses of hearing of Allah did not affect Ravi but the listening Allah touched the ears of Pi. The concept of Absurdity is also meaningfully taken into the story by the introduction of Albert Camus to the pi. The worldly fascination doesn't give the ""Anand(i)"" is very well depicted in the movie. The concentration of the fact of Darwin's theory of ""struggle for existence"" is shown at every step of the movie such as his father's business mind where he thinks to move to Canada, and also by the fact in the life boat where at the point where he kills the fishes to feed himself and the fierce Richard parker. The conflict in the mind about the killing of the fishes (other species) for the one's own survival on this planet is the lively truths of past, present and the futuristic tendencies of the world. The colors about the godly islands which shall mark the origin of the all the energy which starts with the birth of cold and healthy water lakes along the sunrise and dawns with the water being acidic in nature turning wild to end the life of many species also seems relevant to life. The realization of the nature's thunder storm-god paradox is brought evidently to depict the curiosity (JIGNYASA) to know the world, one self and God .The simile of Tiger to that of the soul of the pi is very interesting. Life is a journey of the body and the soul in this planet to evolve or reach a destined destination. On finishing the journey body shall cry for the loss of the soul, nevertheless the soul is liberated without even bidding the good bye, becomes one with the universal eternal energy. The tiger which represents the depth of the pi, departs without any hesitation deep into the forests brings the end of the 25 years story in 3 hours. The making of the movie and the 3d effects and photography has really made it worth the golden statues. The editing and the Foley have made it supportive to the great Oscars."

It's just an overall perfect perfect movies. Barely any flaws at all. The most visually stunning movie of the year. My only ""flaw"" with the film would probably be pi's relationship with his crush. I mean, she isn't a horrible actress or anything, but I felt it could've just been a little bit stronger and more developed. Oh well. Besides that, Life of Pi is just a flawless film, save for the romance. The runners up would probably be Moonrise kingdom, The dark knight rises, Argo, and The avengers. those films are just as equally great but whenever someone points a gun at my head and asks me what the best film of 2012 is, I would have to say Life of Pi. final score: 10/10"
"Whimsynsolence","10","9","17","27 November 2012"," 'Pi is the tiger' and other analysis
","I watched the movie 'Life of Pi' today, it was fascinating. I was not able to think while the movie was playing because the incredible imagery continuously running in front of me, didn't provide me with the sufficient time to think. Yes, the book says that he was stranded in the sea for 277 days, well, the movie showed this extent of 277 days in less than 2 hours. Though, the story is fictional (yeahh! I know it says that this is based on a true story), so imagination has a greater scope. But, in the second attempt of his story, he implies that he was the tiger who ate the co-passengers in his life-boat, including his mother, the cook and whosoever he states were with them. Even in the first scene, where the hyena attacked the zebra and the orangutan, it angered Pi. Pi rose to attack it and suddenly, a Tiger catapulted itself to the open and attacked it. This may symbolize that the tiger in Pi rose to life at that moment. Well, remember what Pi's father had told him when for the first time he made an attempt to feed flesh to the tiger. Can't remember the quote word-to-word, but it did mention that you can see your emotions in the eyes of the tiger. Blah! The child (Pi, of course), who has digested 3 religions at once could also assimilate the very notion that 'the reflection-of-emotions' can be vice verse i.e., the tiger's emotions could reflect within him too (Read this line twice to make better sense of it).<br/><br/>Next, it killed and ate the hyena first. As that was the time when he was experimenting with new meat, he tried the human flesh (as they were dead). Please note, 277 days! So, he ate his mother and then the cook (don't remember the other character he mentioned though). So here we see, that Pi became cannibalistic. Later on, he hunted fish and ate them for the next few days. I was not able to think all this when the movie was running because the scenes were running so fast, that, I hardly got the time to digest any of it. That is why Hollywood (I dono under what category this movie comes under) movies seem believable, because, it doesn't give you the time to think.<br/><br/>The visit to the Carnivore Island was the best part of the movie for me, just for its sheer representation of multiple symbolism. One thing I noticed was that it characterized Lord Vishnu, who is sleeping in the ocean on Anantha (the poisonous snake). The very reason that the roots of the trees were entangled and looked as though it was crawling represented this very notion of the snake. The image over all, looked like a person sleeping - Lord Vishnu. It represented his form (the island) to be the life-giver in the morning (when the Lord must be sleeping), while at night, the island becomes acidic and kills all life forms on it, the Lord is asleep then, the poisonous snake feature is activated. So, this must be one of the crazy ideas behind this (and yes, I appreciate it). Well, heard a myth that the Tirumala hills which has the Tirupathi temple in its abode, which is in Andhra Pradesh, India. This temple has 7 hills surrounding it. Some amazing person found the shape of the hill to be the shape of the Tirupathi Venkateshwara's face. You can have a look at the picha (in the link below). The Carnivorous island has a similar concept as that of the pic of the hills. Well, there is a saying/belief that one day, all the wild (carnivorous) animals would come down this hill and attack humans. This will happen when the Lord would wake up. Don't worry it is a saying.<br/><br/>The very reason Pi-fellow could come up with such a fascinating story is because, he has read 3 religious texts and understood the best way to narrate a thing that could sound realistic and yet exploit the reader/viewer's brain. This maybe the link with his interest with the religious text, and the dichotomy of being a cannibal.<br/><br/>While watching the movie it made me feel that Pi is so heroic and he had survived it all. But, now I feel bitter for his act of cannibalism. His lies/truth... blah! it is a fiction. No need to ponder anymore. Well, I loved the movie and I will be watching it again. *giggles*"
"snikam6691","10","9","17","25 November 2012"," A Beautiful Movie!
","This is a movie full of inspiration and human survival instincts along with ample dose of emotions and Pi's affection for the beautiful Bengal tiger.Although you want to believe that animals do have feelings but this movie correctly portrays that animals only have instincts not feelings.It also makes us sad to think that they may not feel the love we want them to feel and also do not reciprocate it.That is the saddest part of the movie for me...when Pi's expect some kind of gesture from the tiger but the tiger just disappears into the jungle.But then again we must also be happy since the true home of the tiger is the jungle and he is happiest there.Also this movie shows the amazing human brains and how Pi's uses different skills to survive.I do not want to reveal the entire story but this is A must watch for every person of every age."
"januaryman-1","10","9","17","23 November 2012"," Stunning!
","Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.<br/><br/>What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.<br/><br/>This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards."
"tedg","Null","13","27","8 January 2013"," 30 Million Sephiroth
","How is it that Scorsese can get 3D so wrong and someone like Ang Lee get it so right?<br/><br/>Sure, there is some dimensional silliness — a hummingbird in the first few moments... a message thrown into the water that lands in our laps — but the general philosophy here is to use the technology to define *space*. Usually, we are given an array of objects, but here the goal is space itself.<br/><br/>I have been seeing very few movies recently, but I think so far as the handling of space, this film is important — a real advance over what went before. Compare for instance the handling of the water in the shipwreck to that of ""Titantic"" or ""Perfect Storm"" or ""White Squall."" The water here is architectural, dynamic but conceived as a whole. When I've noted previous advances in the cinema of space, they have been less in the architecture and more in the introduction of height, the position of the virtual camera and the emotions evoked by how that camera moves.<br/><br/>Following the ideas of the book about the folding of experience, story-telling and religious ecstasy, we have visual metaphoric blending of underwater, various effects on the surface of water, stars, storms and modes of fluorescence in each of these. The notion is that the story with the tiger is likely fiction, and that the 'real' story was not 'as good.' We have strong hints that this is so in the written dialog, so the cinematic notion of merging dynamics below the sea with action above the sea makes sense. This begins early in the story with a shot of the famed swimming pool after which our hero is named. Late in the shot we realize the camera is underwater. Soon, the water becomes sky.<br/><br/>But because we have shared what came before with our own eyes, we can't unknow it. It becomes folded reality.<br/><br/>Another example: early we see a Hindu ceremony with thousands of candles floating on water. The father-voice-of-reason says ""do not be fooled by the lights."" Shortly thereafter we have the lights on the ship moving underwater and presumably triggering the untrusted narration. These lights were previously on the surface, and it seemed to me that the same visual cues were present in these — and later — lights as those we saw in the ceremony.<br/><br/>This sort of visual coherence is only possible now where essentially every background is a synthesized one. When you create the world, you can create it your way.<br/><br/>So the larger framing has an underwater with the ship named after the kabbalistic (recent kabbalah, not genuine historical kabbalah) notion of truth coalescing around the most attractive story. That ship is lit — again a kabbalistic reference, and the lights morph to totems: animals, symbols and memories. The sprites used in the software to model the flow of particles under the sea is used to model the turbulence on the surface and sky. Further, an associated notion is that everything must be considered as a whole situated assembly; in story terms that is the truth of coherence; in cinematic terms it is the focus on the coherence of space.<br/><br/>Lee has always done something like this, even in his student films about dinner tables. In ""Crouching Tiger"" the fight choreography was calligraphic and was shown that way, so this was expected. But it IS an advance in the vocabulary and should be seen if only for the cinematic thrill of being present when our imagination advances a step. Note especially how the final shot does a reverse rack where the background moves closer after his feline self has 'left him.'<br/><br/>But it fails as a compelling narrative for me. The kid in the boat seemed too Mowgli Disney perfect and not sufficiently broken to be believable. Though the cinematic tone is well thought out, it is presented too much as reality for me. The distance in abstraction between the framing device (the adult recounting a version of the story) and the story is too close. We might have done better to have the framing bits use a different technique, and the tiger be more supernatural.<br/><br/>We do have *some* supernatural elements: the magical whale, the storm that seizes the written story, the fact that corpses and excrement vanish from the always sterile boat. The magical island's tooth (truth). The fact that a Japanese ship packs a survival manual in English. But these are plot points, not parts of the world. Tarsem Singh might have done better in this regard.<br/><br/>We can assume that the 'alternative story' was shot, because you wouldn't hire Gérard Depardieu for one part of one scene. Perhaps we can see it in a recut version. Hey, if Decker can be a replicant in later versions of ""Bladerunner,"" maybe Anandi can be a life-dancer, the real narrator.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.<br/><br/>Most of you may not be aware, but ""Life of Pi"" is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book ""Life of Pi"" on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella ""Max and the Cats"", which in-turn was based on a true story.<br/><br/>The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact. Watch it, and then watch it again. This movie may well end up becoming one of your Top10 movies of all time.<br/><br/>Simply great!! Two thumbs and two toes up :-)"
"gavin6942","8","10","20","24 February 2013"," The Spiritual Event of 2012
","A young man (Suraj Sharma) who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger (Richard Parker). <br/><br/>Let me first say that I am glad that M. Night Shyamalan did not end up directing this film. Could he have made it successful? Possibly. But, he does have a stigma attached to him that Ang Lee does not have. Lee may not be a critically-heralded director, but he is not a running joke, either. And after this film, he may start getting more offers.<br/><br/>Lee says in making this film, he had to ""disguise a philosophical book as an adventure story"". Although I have not read the book, this sounds spot on. The concepts presented are certainly religious, or at least spiritual, and there is always the feeling that there is more going on than the parts we can see with our eyes.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert called the film ""a miraculous achievement of storytelling and a landmark of visual mastery"". I will grant that it was excellent storytelling, and would need at least two viewings to fully appreciate. The visual mastery is a bit harder for me to get behind. Some of the visuals are spectacular, while others I felt never quite seemed real enough. Technology has come a long way, but I still know a fake tiger when I see one.<br/><br/>The story works great, and carries itself in three stages. (Here is where the spoilers start, so stop now if you have not seen it.)<br/><br/>The first stage is the overt religious and spiritual stage. Once we get past the jokes about ""Piscine Patel"", we see a brief exploration of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Certainly nothing thorough, but we get the idea of how we can approach the world seeing one god as many, or many gods as one, and not find it to be contradictory. If the film is going to convince us to believe in God, we have to join him on this quest. (I suspect it goes deeper in the book.)<br/><br/>The second stage is during the days at sea. We have the reference to Richard Parker, here a name for a tiger but also the name of a classic shipwrecked sailor. In some ways, the story here parallels that of the real-life sailor and the Parker from the Edgar Allen Poe story. We also have the introduction of ""Tsimtsum"". I did not know the term while watching the movie, but felt it must have been important. (Why a Japanese ship had a Hebrew name is anyone's guess.) I now know it is a Kabbalah term about God's being simultaneously transcendent and within the world. A concept that is both contradictory and necessary. It also explains how Pi survives...<br/><br/>The third stage is the last few minutes, when we hear the parallel story about the cannibalistic cook. Is this the real story? Is it a metaphor for the other story, which was actually the true story? Is either one true? And ultimately, does it matter? Here, after we are immersed in faith for two hours, we are left to decide: which is the true story, and does it matter which? (With Pi the only survivor, any story he creates will be the only story that will be recorded as the true story -- he has essentially created his own world.)"
"superduperspit","10","10","20","28 January 2013"," An all time great film
","2012 is a great film year. Almost all the films I looked forward to delivered. However one stood above them all and that's Life of Pi. I believe this is not only the best film of 2012 but one of the best films I've seen in my life.<br/><br/>What makes Pi great is the different way it works. On the surface, if just taking the story for what it is, it's a great film in many ways. It has a likable lead and story and manages to make a boy floating on a raft entertaining. I can't say enough about how well crafted the confrontations between Pi and Parker are. Ang Lee uses the boat as a perfect device for their head to head ""battles"".<br/><br/>But of course, Life of Pi is more than just a great story. It is steeped with symbolism. The genius ending by Yann Martel of course gives the entire film a new face. Which Pi story was real? Of course the answer is that neither are meant to be truly real. What's important is what someone takes out of a story and what it means to them. As a film viewer this is applicable to us, listening to Pi's story or another movie's, we can interpret it whichever way we want - by whichever fits our personal code. In the early stages of the film much is made of Pi's personal beliefs (in many different religions) compared to the characters around him. His father believes in science, his mother more the heart. A man even believes in swimming pools as his salvation. This is all important because just as Pi is willing to believe in multiple religions and pick the important parts from each, one interprets Pi's story in their own way and in turn, their own life in their own way <br/><br/>But more than just that, to me all of Life of Pi is symbolic of life. We are all boys on a raft in the ocean, braving the coming and going storms and searching for our destination. It bears mentioning that brilliantly, Pi is not going home. He's going to a foreign, new place. Just as in the journey to life, we do not go to the past, we go to an uncertain future.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether Pi's story was real or not, what seems obvious is that Richard Parker is meant to represent Pi's internal psychi. Hearkening back to the argument about science vs the heart, Pi is the rational member on the boat and Parker is the ferocious, emotional one. One can read Pi's journey as his rationality fighting with his emotional self. Likewise one could argue the other animals on the boat if not real, represent parts of himself. The zebra perhaps is the side of him that wanted to feel like a victim after the crash, the hyena the side that wanted to flip out and get angry and the orangutan the one that thought his parents had a chance to be alive. Quickly his victim side and his family-loving side is engulfed by anger, which then recedes.<br/><br/>One tell that the entire journey is a symbolism of life is the carnivorous island. This is an island that most people visit. The carnivorous island is when we get to a place that's so comfortable and secure, that we threaten to let ourselves get stuck there, instead of moving onto new and unknown adventures in our life. Pi has to choose whether to stay in this place and be eaten by this security of life, or to move on and he chooses to move one.<br/><br/>The part that fascinates me the most about this story is the decision to make Parker leave, without turning back to Pi. If one accepts Parker is a representation of Pi's emotional internal self, what does his snub mean? Did Pi lose his heart and emotional self in that journey across the ocean? Did leaving the the security of the island (where he'd have been with Parker forever) require sacrificing that part of himself? Or is it that in the real world, the emotional self cannot roam free with the rational, controlled self. Just as Parker had to be caged up before they got on the ship. It took that journey on the ocean for Pi to come in touch with his animalistic self, but they could never be together in civilization and this is what breaks Pi's heart as he's telling the story.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is simply masterful. Aside from the crafting of scenes on the ship as I mentioned, the editing is perfect. Think about the scenes like Parker eating the goat in the cage, or the animals on the boat. Every scene transition is simply perfect. Every cut to Pi telling the story is crafted perfectly. This is a film where a master is truly in control of his medium. Of course I didn't even mention the all time great visual effects Life of Pi is not only perfectly crafted and written, but it is layered with fascinating depth and psychology as a movie about life itself, choices and the meaning we take out of our lives. This is a true film masterpiece and work of art."
"abidsuhail","6","15","33","23 November 2012"," Visually Spectacular; dramatically diminutive.
","With all the hype of a bestseller novel turning into a 3D movie, Life of Pi would possibly be the highly overrated movie of the year. Of course, it greatly impresses with its verisimilitude of the digital imagery, which is painstakingly constructed with one step on the fantasy and another on reality. I think this is so far the best imagery shot/created for a oceanic film and Richard Parker, the tiger is a marvel. Though, I was initially disappointed with the narrower aspect ratio 1.85:1; would've been more spectacular in 2.35:1<br/><br/>But, where the movie (and the Novel) falls in its entirety is the drama, which is said to be constructed in tangence to spiritual overtones which justifies the Indian milieu ; the so called philosophy it offers is so very juvenile and text-bookish, (at-least that's how it would be for an Indian); the characters so flat and sketchy and casting over the top, detailing really bad and the authenticity in the soup (Tamil Talkie parts especially). Wondering if they hired a (right) cultural consultant. And this makes the first 25 minutes terrible to watch. Yes, all this is supposed to be carried from the original content by Yann Martel (which I consider an Yawn inducer).<br/><br/>Having read the book and unimpressed, my only reason to watch Life of Pi in cinemas was Ang Lee. The man, in one of his interviews has said, he did have an initial hesitation and did contemplate a lot before taking up this project. I think one has to follow their intuition in creative matters and wish Ang Lee did that.<br/><br/>So, if you've read the book, you know what to expect plot wise, and you'd be anticipating Ang Lee's visual interpretation, which is sure to enthrall you. And if you have not read the book, even better, the anticipation of 'where is this leading' might keep you engaged; only that at the end when the destination arrives, you might be left unsatisfied. <br/><br/>5/10 for the visual magnificence."
"cutesy00","9","7","13","1 March 2013"," worth every penny and hour spent!
","I just finished watching the movie Life of Pi, no words can really surmount to the story and moral of the movie.<br/><br/>From the very moment the movie started there was a few downs and as the movie progresses on, you'll find yourself hooked into a movie worthy of standing ovations and a whole cinema in applause. Pi, whose origins roots to India, is a the sole survivor of a Japanese cargo shipwrecked, the reason of the shipwreck is unknown in the story however, it is already seen in the very beginning if viewers were paying attention.<br/><br/>So as Pi survived, along with him a Orangutan named Orange Juice, a Hyena named Hari, an unnamed Zebra, and his companion through out the whole story a Tiger named Richard Parker. The other three animals die of hunger and feud and so leaving Richard and Pi together. Pi teaches Richard to become submissive and obedient to him through a series of struggles and eventually they both survived in the end, although, what happened to Richard is unknown whether he lived on after reaching the Mexican shore is for our imagination to work its wonders.<br/><br/>Even though, most would probably choose the second version of the story that Pi told the Japanese investigators and its convincing for humans I'd prefer the original story that Pi overcame.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is jaw dropping, the cinematography is very well done, the story...ORIGINAL! No words can really express the lesson in the movie, survival, friendship/taming tigers, above all faith in God.<br/><br/>How about you, ""Which story do you prefer?"""
"riziger","9","7","13","28 February 2013"," Proper adventure story with the visual effects to match.
","Life of Pi is a story about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck with a Bengal tiger. If that doesn't perk your interest, I'm not too sure what will. This film is a proper adventure story with storytelling that takes you on a journey in a way that I've not experienced in awhile. And boy how it has been translated to visual form is breathtaking. No surprises at all at the cinematography, directing and visual Oscars it's won with the best animation I have ever seen. I can honestly say that in almost no scene was any animation apparent and that just immersed me more into the adventure.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma does a brilliant job as the shipwrecked Pi, and Irrfan Khan plays an understated but equally charming adult Pi. The tiger, Richard Parker, forms a bond with the viewer that creeps up on you, and by the end I was hoping for it's survival as much as for Pi's. For something that spends the majority of the film as an animation, I thought that was fantastic. Perhaps the only con is the religion angle that some may not appreciate. However, I found it was just a facet of the plot and I had no problems with it.<br/><br/>I'm going to put myself on the chopping block and say this is one of the most complete films I've seen in a long time. Charming plot, perfectly cast, with a big enough budget to bring it to life visually. I will also say, that I believe this deserved the best picture Oscar. A must watch."
"BliuTiger","10","9","18","4 March 2013"," Master Filmmaking!
","I can't express how thankful I am to Ang Lee for taking on this project, which was deemed impossible to make by many filmmakers. This is definitely the most challenging film in Lee's career since Brokeback Mountain.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful films in recent time, Life of Pi is a great mix of humor, drama and adventure carried out by an incredible and original story. I never found myself rolling my eyes even though we see a boy on a small boat with a tiger for the most part. This is also the reason why this film was a big gamble. It's tough to make something eventful out of this premise without demanding a very high suspension of disbelief from the audience, which will hinder their enjoyment. Thankfully, Ang Lee and co. knew how to execute it in the best way possible. Actors did their job very well and were all believable in their roles. Suraj Sharma's performance stands out as the best. He was absolutely incredible in his first acting role ever! He can express sadness, happiness, desperation, fear, love, unsteadiness, interest etc with great prowess. His acting draws you into his character and makes him feel real. This just proves furthermore why Ang Lee is one of the best directors at the moment. Aside from knowing how to tell a story, he has an eye for talent and is able to ""squeeze"" that talent from actors.<br/><br/>The technical aspects complete the movie. The score is authentic and beautiful. The visual effects and 3D are just out of this world! Also, these aspects actually serve to enhance the experience and main themes of the movie. Effects are used perfectly at the right times and are in no way cheesy. The tiger is animated for the most of the movie and there's just no way to describe how brilliant and ""alive"" Richard Parker felt! It's absolutely stunning to watch him. I'm not surprised many people thought it was a real tiger the whole time.<br/><br/>Some people say the film is preachy, shallow, tries to make you believe in God, tries to be deep etc. I don't think it aims to do such things. It simply shows the beauty of nature and examines our love for stories, our imagination and our interest in faith. There are many metaphorical elements, which provide some interesting food for thought. There is also an angle that the whole story is actually an allegory and it's up to us to decipher it and interpret what actually happened. But even if you don't like open ended movies, if you just want to sit back and enjoy, I highly recommend this because the whole movie is a pleasure for eyes and ears. I don't think it's boring because I find the pacing surprisingly great. The exchange of drama and humor is perfect and the latter is executed very well - it provides genuine laughs.<br/><br/>One last thing if you decide to watch this: know what to expect. Don't expect a masterpiece in religious discussion or character exploration. Expect beautiful scenery, an engaging story that borders between reality and imagination and a magnificent Bengal tiger, all wrapped up in an adventurous journey of a young boy's life! One of my favorite films of all time - 10/10!"
"nayyar_9","9","9","18","11 January 2013"," Truly a masterpiece.
","I was already a big fan of Ang Lee before seeing this film, so I expected greatness, but it truly exceeded my expectations. I was blown away by the visual aspect, let alone the acting.<br/><br/>I've read so many complaints about the CGI Richard Parker, but never have I seen a fake tiger look so real. The one part in the film that really pulled on my heart strings was when Richard Parker was in the water for hours. His facial expressions were so realistic and believable. Clearly the people making these complaints have never sat down and watched the Nat Geo Wild channel, if they had they would understand that Lee really did his research on Bengal tigers, because he got the characteristics and traits down to a tee.<br/><br/>Pi. What a character, old and young. I remember seeing Irrfan Khan in one of my favorite films, New York, I Love You. He's such a likable character. I genuinely would believe anything that came out of his mouth if I met him. He and Suraj Sharma seemed so alike throughout the story telling. Sharma acted brilliantly with Richard Parker. Lee made sure that it wasn't an obvious love between Pi and Richard Parker, but instead a mutual respect. This feeling continued throughout the film, right to the end when Richard Parker didn't turn around. It was completely understandable on Richard Parkers part. Lee kept the element of realness, even though the whole story is so hard to believe.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is the first time I've seen Suraj Sharma, and he really won me over. The way his character survives is so smart yet so simple. He uses his brain, and he was the perfect film character to the book character.<br/><br/>Lastly, I MUST comment on the colors. Everything was so clear, so vivid. Every shot was like a stunning piece of art. I can't remember the last time I saw a film that left me in awe purely because of the colors. Incredible.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is beautiful. I definitely recommend it. I will be seeing it on the IMAX screen again next month. I'm sure it will shock me, make me fall in love and make me cry all over again. What a masterpiece."

","Thiz is a simple movie with stunning visual portrayal of a spiritual journey. It starts like Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" (2003) where everything is odd and magical, steps like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008) with its compelling flashback in storytelling and it feels like Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" (2000), only thiz time the survivor is not accompanied by Wilson the volleyball, but with something called Richard Parker. It is a courageous adventure story about a young boy named Piscine (Suraj Sharma), who unfortunately lost all his family in sinking ship. His survival effort along with all the animals, especially with a ferocious Bengal tiger, brings him to an understanding of life as a whole. The newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sufficient performance to describe a boy who has to survive nature. Adil Hussain and Tabu make brief but memorable appearances as Pi's father and mother. On the other hand, I think that Irrfan Khan could have been better as Adult Pi. His central role as the storyteller is just enough, not extraordinary, not even close, compared to Gloria Stuart as Old Rose in ""Titanic"" (1997). Ang Lee who is formerly known as the Director of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Hulk"" (2003) and the controversial drama ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), wrapping thiz movie with astonishing visual treat. ""The Storm Scene"" is one of the remarkable moments in thiz movie. I bet you won't get thiz experience before in any other movies.

I think thiz movie has lots of powerful philosophies all over the place. It's like metaphor in metaphor, there comes a point in everyone's life, thiz will be something that needs to be thought about. It's emotionally gratifying. Actually, the movie is not just about survival, it's not even about the sinking ship, and it's definitely not about the tiger.

"howard.schumann","9","6","11","9 December 2012"," Why not choose the better story?
","According to Yann Martel, author of the Booker Prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi, ""If your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you."" In the film version of Life of Pi, the fearful opponent is a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (explained in the film) and its worthy adversary is a teenage boy (Suraj Sharma) trapped in a lifeboat in the middle of an unforgiving ocean. For Pi, fear is the ingredient that is both his enemy and the friend that keeps him alive and helps him to maintain his faith.<br/><br/>Directed by Ang Lee and adapted for the screen by David Magee, the film is an adventure story in the mold of Robinson Crusoe, a testament of faith, and a philosophical Rubik's Cube that will keep you awake pondering its meaning. Whatever meaning you ultimately bring to it, the film is a sumptuous visual experience that combines a dazzling combination of state-of- the-art 3-D and CGI technology to breathtaking effect. The adventure is framed by the adult Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) relating his incredible story to a Canadian journalist (Rafe Spall), sent by a friend to listen to a story that ""would make him believe in God."" As a young boy Piscine Molitor Patel (Ayush Tandon), the son of a zoo keeper in Pondicherry, India, shortens his name to Pi to avoid being teased at school. Pi is a spiritual seeker who attracted to Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity and has even studied the Jewish Kabala. Pi's embracing of all non-conflicting religions is rejected by his parents whose philosophy is secular, and his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) challenges his son to make hard choices in life. ""Believing in everything,"" he says, ""is the same as believing in nothing,"" Santosh is a hard taskmaster who graphically demonstrates, after Pi attempt to feed the Bengal tiger in their zoo, that wild animals are not your friend and will kill you without a moment's hesitation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, hard times fall on the family and Santosh must sell the zoo and take the family and some of the animals to Winnipeg, Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship. When an unforeseen storm batters the vessel, all members of Pi's family and the ship's crew are lost at sea. Pi is the only survivor and clings to a lifeboat accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, and the huge cat, Richard Parker, who climb aboard. The young Pi witnesses the survival of the fittest and soon finds himself alone in the middle of the ocean with a ferocious tiger. The terror of the shipwreck is made real in a visceral 3-D experience of the raging water, thundering in surround sound.<br/><br/>The central portion of the film depicts the day-to-day effort of the boy to tame the tiger and provide enough food for both to survive their over 200-day ordeal. The magic of technology produces beauty as well as terror in scenes of the ocean at night with the boat wandering alone beneath the stars, a cadre of flying fish, luminescent jellyfish, and a leaping whale. Whether or not you believe that the boy is really in danger aboard a boat with a man-eating tiger does not detract from the sublime feeling of connection with nature that the scenes engender. To add a surreal aspect to the adventure, the two companions find themselves on a strange floating island overrun by a colony of African mongoose known as meerkats that allows Pi to gather more food for his return to the sea.<br/><br/>While the film's coda puts a slight damper on what we have just seen, the questions it raises are central to the film's message. Contrary to the opening invitation to the writer to research Pi's story because it would ""make him believe in God,"" Martel says that, ""God is not IN the story, but that God IS the story,"" and challenges the viewer to choose which story to believe, the one we have experienced for almost two hours or the alternative story that Pi tells Japanese insurance investigators. According to the author, ""Stories are important, because everything is in how we perceive it and nothing is really real until we say it is, so why not choose the better story?"" <br/><br/>In my view, what Martel is saying is not that we should choose the better story because it provides a palliative by keeping pesky reality away, but because it offers the context for a richer experience of life. Did the Hanukkah candles really burn for eight days without oil? Did the Buddha really live? Did Christ? We can never know for certain, but ultimately it may not matter if the impact of the stories can lead us to a true spiritual experience, one that is touched by love whether or not we believe it or have a Bengal tiger along for the ride."

","The story proper is book-ended between the scenes of a writer's (Rafe Spall) interview of the protagonist Pi, adult version (Irrfan Khan), which serve also as VO narration. Within this ""story proper"", the key segment that happens on a lifeboat drifting on the Pacific is further sandwiched between what happens before and after. ""Before"" show traces Pi's life early childhood (Gautam Belur) to teenager (Suraj Sharma) when financial difficulties forces his parents to close the zoo they were operating and embark on a family voyage to the U.S. together with the animals which they hope to sell upon arrival. ""Just like Columbus"", his father explained, to which Pi replied in a muffled voice ""But Columbus was looking for India"". ""After"" recounts the incidents after drifting in the Ocean for 227 days, hitting land for the first time (just an island) and eventually finding rescue at the coast of Mexico. Quite obviously, the ""key segment"" of drifting in the Pacific, which takes about an hour, is the highlight. But is must be said the 2-hour film is mesmerizing in its entirety.<br/><br/>This centre masterpiece is to be enjoyed on two levels: visual and spiritual. There can never been enough said to do justice to the visual wonder Ang Lee has created, utilizing 3D in a way never used by anyone else before, to create beauty, especially when it comes to water. The spiritual context is so rich that the film arguably compels multiple viewing. Much has been elaborated by critics on the theme of divinity that transverse cultures. Similarly is the universal theme of valuing what you have, and reaching out to communicate your appreciation before it's too late. Most insightful is Pi's OV comment that the Bengal tiger, notwithstanding being a constant threat to his life, is in fact the most important reason for his survival of the 227 days. Here we are talking about loneliness. This fellow being has become Pi's reason for living, initially to stay away from its murderous claws, but later to caring for its every need from food to fresh water.<br/><br/>A lesser director would have grabbed the many opportunities for sappy tear manipulation, which would be beneath Ang Lee. The scene showing the parting of Pi and Richard Parker the tiger alone will be reflected on for a long time."
"the_grand_lebowski","8","6","11","2 December 2012"," ""What Hurts the Most Is Not Being Able to Say Goodbye""
","It is a rare opportunity to see a film in which every frame evokes miraculous imagery. So it is with Life of Pi: Director Ang Lee translated the bestselling novel by Yann Martel into one of the most visually arresting cinematic events of this year. Like a fever dream that occasionally transforms into a nightmare, before delivering you back into a state of nirvana, Life of Pi is at its best breathtaking, but also looms with a mysterious energy prepared to pounce when you become comfortable.<br/><br/>The story of Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma) unfolds through the narration of the elder Pi, who recounts his story for the benefit of a writer, in search of a story that will ""make him believe in God."" It is unlikely that Pi's engrossing story will have any effect on your religious inclinations, but it will certainly entertain. Pi's life is completely upended when a cargo ship carrying Pi and his family, as well as numerous animals from their zoo, is lost at sea. Being the sole human survivor, Pi is forced to contend with a troop of animals that also managed to seek refuge on his lifeboat. As the days pass, the group of four animals is cut down to a single animal: an adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The two survivors are faced with serious challenges on their journey across the ocean, and none is more terrifying than the close proximity they share. What develops is a volatile relationship that ultimately saves Pi's life.<br/><br/>The entire weight of Life of Pi is balanced on newcomer Suraj Sharma's back. The true beauty of this film may be its cinematography, but considering how much of this movie focuses on a solitary human in a boat with a tiger, casting a weak actor in the role of Pi would have been as disastrous as flinging acetone on a painting. The range of emotions conveyed by Sharma makes it difficult to believe that he earned this role accidentally (He only attending the casting call to support his brother's audition, and ended up winning the role out of 3,000 actors.), and has no previous acting credits. If Life of Pi is any indication of what Sharma is capable of, we shall be seeing a great deal of this talented young man in the coming years.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is substantial achievement in storytelling. The film covers a variety of topics: spirituality, mortality, maturity, death, and survival. The film is incredibly dense, and having little knowledge of the novel beforehand, I was not prepared for how intense a film this would be. The quality of trailers shown before the movie seemed to indicate that many might treat Pi as a children's film; it is most certainly not. While a story of a young man on a boat with a tiger might sound like the beginning of a children's fable, the substance of this film would be difficult for a child to stomach. <br/><br/>Ang Lee has proved himself a master of stylized film and Life of Pi is possibly his most visually stunning motion picture to date. Life of Pi illustrates the ability of a story to captivate our imaginations, and attests to the wonderment of storytelling.<br/><br/>http://flickermotion.blogspot.com/"
"rushtoarjun","9","6","11","1 December 2012"," Clearly not a 'love at first sight'..! simply a brilliant movie!
","Once in a while you see a movie and think ""god its brilliant!"". And once in a decade u see a movie and think ""good lord, that's boring!"" and go home, login to facebook and update a status saying crap about the movie but think a LOT about it later and realize that you just watched one of the most brilliant movies ever made! that's Life of Pi! <br/><br/>I went for the movie with a lot of expectations. Firstly, because its an Ang Lee movie and secondly, because its a movie about survival and facing your fears. But what was waiting for me in the theater, was just another 3D flick with a lot of CGI graphics. At least, that's what I thought! But after watching the last few scenes, began one of the most intense thinking processes of my life! And finally realized how brilliant the story is and how brilliantly Lee has made it into a movie. Life of Pi may not be the best acted movie ever but everything else about it, is inexplicable.<br/><br/>Speaking as a south Indian myself, another good thing about the movie is that Lee has managed to minimize the amount of clichés which occur a lot while making a Hollywood movie about Indians.<br/><br/>I played the movie, scene by scene in my head again and again, only to realize not everything is what it looks like. I highly recommend this film to everyone. whether you like it or not completely depends on your perception. In the scene where the tired young Pi asks his 'companion' to talk to him and looks deep down into the ocean, the camera goes deep into the ocean from Pi's tired and hopeless face, captures everything he has lost, ends up at his mother's smiling face and comes back up to his 'companion''s strong, confident face. That one scene has a strong inner meaning and another dimension, which you will realize if you really want to! And that was just an example.<br/><br/>I know i used the word 'brilliant' a lot but I really can't help it! the movie is just BRILLIANT!"
"Red_Identity","Null","6","11","30 November 2012"," Marvelous
","Let's get this out of the way. I did not see this in 3-D, so I will not talk about how amazing the 3-D was. In that respect, perhaps I am able to judge the film in its own right. The story here isn't anything too different. We've had survival stories of this kind before. The film is also told as one man's recollection, and I always have a problem with this technique. It always sort of drags the film down, because instead of you being immersed in the actual story being told, films always do some back-and-forths with the story and the character recollecting the story. This film is no exception, and it kinda falls into that same trap of cheese and over-sentimentality at times. This isn't a subtle film in any way, and it's more obvious in the present scenes.<br/><br/>Getting that out of the way, this is a truly beautiful film in every respect. The message is clear, but powerful, and on a visual level this is masterful. The cinematography isn't just brilliant because the visual imagery is brilliant (and many times that's all people think of cinematography as being) but because the sweeping scope of the photography and the many different shots create a fantastically vivid and dreamy world. Even in it's most languid scenes there's a technical mastery here not present in most films. The strongest section of the film is Pi at sea no doubt, and it's virtually perfect. However, the last 10 or 15 minutes once again cross the line where some of it just comes across corny. But I liked the purpose of where the film headed, and what the ending was for, I just wish Lee and the script hadn't hit it with so much on-the-point sentimentality.<br/><br/>But overall, flaws and all, this is a truly fantastic film, and strongly recommended."
"ttdaomd","8","6","11","24 November 2012"," Visually stunning metaphor
","Beautifully made movie about the complex relationship between Good and Evil, Man and God. The only negative is that the movie is so visually stunning that it may lead the viewer to appreciate it only on the physical concrete plane. <br/><br/>The real point to the movie is to show us that the tiger is not in the boat trying to kill the boy, rather that there is a metaphorical tiger living in each of us, and it is through the mythology of religions that each of us may discover for ourselves how we deal with our own tiger. <br/><br/>In this way, I think that the medium of film cannot match the impact of the written text for a film of such metaphoric import. It is through the imagery created in each individual's mind through the living life experiences of each person reading the passages of the book that give it deeper personal meaning and sense to the metaphor. This movie, as every movie, must impart the visions and experiences of essentially one person, the director. But it is such a beautiful vision after all.<br/><br/>Thumbs up!"
"vijayan-shekhar","9","6","11","24 November 2012"," Life of Pi-mind boggling visuals,profound narrative and story telling at its best
","Life of Pi- a must watch It's quite apparent going by the trailers and the buzz generated by this movie that its all about a young man's survival from a terrible ship wreck and a certain Bengal Tiger ( named Richard Parker for mildly amusing reasons) during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. A middle aged Pi ( with a generous mop of curly hair , played by the subtle and extremely engaging Irrfan Khan) recounting his tale to a wide eyed Canadian novelist.<br/><br/>The older Pi takes the novelist down memory lane and in the process paints a picture postcard of Puducherry, the zoo owned by his rational and strict father and his innate faith in godliness, religion whetted by his curiosity during the adolescent years. The parents had a different perspective on religion and spirituality – the father an atheist and the mother – mildly encouraging and endearing do not impede the young boy's religious intentions giving him the wherewithal to choose his own path.His life is not devoid of love as Pi in an understated manner states "" We both had just enough time to break each other's heart"" In due course of time due to the unstable financial and business climate post emergency, the father takes the stellar decision of migrating to Canada for a better future aided by the sale of zoo animals. Aboard the ship, nature plays spoilsport in form of a terrible thunderstorm leaving Pi the only human survivor with a ferocious tiger for company Picture this – it's just the boy and the Bengal tiger out there in the dark deep sea along with the forces of nature playing against him ( rain or shine plays true here) The Bengal tiger aka Richard Parker is an offshoot of digital imagery – the eyes, majestic walk, fur and the famous roar makes it all the more believable. This story is appealing as it deals with the problems Pi must solve which forms the most dramatic center piece of the film and you start identifying with Pi and the leap of faith he sorely needs. How in the middle of the ocean would he find food and water, avoid turning into Mr Parker's meal of the day, guts and gumption required to sale through this ordeal. The relationship he shares with Parker shows shades of fear, competition, predatory instincts, compassion and love with the director showing remarkable restraint and control in not following the predictable path.<br/><br/>LOP's background score does not distract you, rather it plays a supporting role (the Tamil ditty at the beginning of the movie sung in a very soft and mellifluous voice) . The 3d visuals speak a language of their own (turquoise blue water, flying fish, dancing dolphins) aided by engaging story telling make it a visual spectacle Sooraj Sharma who plays the teen age Pi, is utterly believable as the character and you live and identify his trials and tribulations, while Irrfan Khan underplays the ordeal he has survived with an uncanny blend of normalcy. Adil and Tabu as Pi's parents in their own sublime way add a lot to the character of the boy who transforms into a man with a life changing experience The movie is one of a kind which is a visual marvel aided by wonderful storytelling , has profound lines , goose bump inducing moments and makes you believe in all the wondrous things and the avalanche of emotions the director has used to play with the human psyche be it Pi or us.<br/><br/>It may also make you ponder and ramificate in the end whether you have seen anything at all :)p Love,Life,Luck and Laughter, Shekhar Vijayan."
"MovieFanBenLinus8","10","8","16","27 February 2013"," Movie Review: Life of Pi
","Life of Pi is an absolutely outstanding philosophical film, undoubtedly one of the best to come out last year. It recently won four Academy Awards, all of which were absolutely deserved; it is impeccably crafted and deeply moving. The first time I saw the film, the framing narrative structure disoriented me, due in large part to the deliberate pacing. After watching the movie again, however, everything clicked for me, and now I can say that there is hardly a false note among the storytelling. As an adult, the title character reflects back on his life, how it all changed him, and more importantly, how he still feels about it. We first meet the younger Pi in his school days, and we witness him acquire valuable skills from his family that will ultimately prove highly beneficial in his life, despite the fact that he takes much of it for granted. He also manages to create a new identity for himself, by taking the nickname of ""Pi"" and displaying his knowledge with the irrational number. This ties into much of Pi's overall philosophy; reality hardly matters. What's more exciting and engaging for him and his life is the overall better story. He is first and foremost a storyteller, and he is absolutely one who uses his power wisely. And so it is no wonder that he becomes so intrigued by three various, almost contradictory, religions. He deeply loves the sense of community he gains from them, and he deeply relishes in his faith. Starting with the stunning shipwreck sequence, however, he comes to realize that his faith must continuously be tested in order to be fully pure. And there is surely no stronger test of faith than being stuck in a lifeboat with nothing but an adult Bengal tiger. As time goes on, however, he manages to survive, all the while learning to appreciate the gift of life with what little time he has, and to realize that suffering is a necessity for true happiness. Much debate has been brought about by the film's ending; people wonder ""did it really even happen""? I personally find the ending extremely powerful, one that enforces the movie's thesis. It hardly matters what really happened at sea in the lifeboat; the only important thing is which story is better. And the jaw-dropping special effects only add to the excitement of the story; this is truly a larger than life experience. Even the use of 3-D is spectacular, as it fully immerses us in Pi's world. This is a technically flawless film, and it begs the question, ""was Avatar ever this visually stunning?"" I'd say no. Life of Pi is unquestionably one of the year's best films, and it is more than a film. It is an experience; both a visual one, a philosophical one, and a storytelling one. This film absolutely must be seen; it is an absolute stunner and a near-masterpiece. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10- ""My Highest Recommendation."""
"Turfseer","7","8","16","27 December 2012"," 2nd Act shines; 1st & 3rd Acts not as much due to dependence on narration and alternative offscreen ending
","Is 'Life of Pi' meant as a story of great spiritual uplift--or a different story altogether--something more morose and sinister? Director Ang Lee, proffers up a twist ending where the film's protagonist, the young Pi Patel, has his amazing tale of survival called into question and replaced by an equally fantastic tale, albeit far less spiritually uplifting, than the first.<br/><br/>The film begins with a now grown Patel, residing in Canada and working as a professor. Patel relates his life to an aspiring writer in three parts: 1) his childhood and adolescence with his family in India; 2) his life as a castaway in a lifeboat with the tiger, 'Richard Parker'; and 3) the climax of his survivor story which includes an alternative story to the one he's just related. Unfortunately, Lee must rely on a narrator, the elder Patel, to tell a good part of the story. This is off-putting (particularly during the denouement), since the stodgy conversations between the professor and the writer, can't hold a candle to the magnificent visual scenes established with the younger Pi (played by brilliant newcomer, Suraj Sharma) as he fights for survival on the high seas.<br/><br/>The first third of the 'Life of Pi' is slow-moving. Pi's upbringing is quite unusual in one respect: his father owns a zoo. Otherwise Pi is presented as a sensitive but quirky kid who evinces a spiritual side, even at an early age. Pi's spirituality comes into play later, when his alternative story, presents him in a decidedly less pacifistic light.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most significant scene in the first third of the movie is when Pi's father forces him to watch Richard Parker devour a goat. Pi's 'loss of innocence' foreshadows his ultimate test, when he later comes face to face with Richard Parker in the boat. How does the tiger manage to pull the goat into his side of the cell? The apparent unrealistic and perplexing scene may suggest, on the other hand, that Patel's story is either whole or part fantasy.<br/><br/>The meat and potatoes of the 'Life of Pi' is the young man's incredible story of survival after his parents are killed, during the sinking of the Japanese freighter. 'Life of Pi' fascinates, when we see how Pi manages to cope with a tiger in his lifeboat. Before Richard Parker becomes the center of Pi's attention, two other animals, a zebra and orangutan are killed by an hyena, who in turn is killed by Richard Parker. The animals' demise takes on a symbolic meaning later on, when Pi proffers up the second story in the Third Act. The sudden disappearance of the three animals from the boat, once again suggests that perhaps Pi's story belongs in the realm of fantasy.<br/><br/>Ang Lee proves his mastery as a director of special effects, since most of the tiger sequences were created through the wizardry of computer generated images. From his inventiveness to creating a small raft of flotation devices to keep a safe distance from the tiger and the way in which he goes about finding food after a whale destroys his food stocks, the story of Pi and Richard Parker proves quite absorbing. The taming of the tiger is the high point of Pi's 'man versus nature' saga before the Second Act crisis.<br/><br/>The crisis occurs when Pi lands on the 'bionic' island. Again, the island appears to symbolize Pi's crisis in the alternative reality the elder Pi relates to the writer in the Third Act. Once Pi discovers that the island's water turns acidic at night and is devouring fish, as well as a tooth in a carnivorous plant, he concludes that he'll die if he remains on the island.<br/><br/>The elder Patel finally reveals that his castaway story might merely be a 'coping mechanism'. Patel reveals that he told Japanese investigators of the possibility that what 'might' have happened was that he ended up in a lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg and a crew member who his father had a disagreeable encounter earlier on, before the freighter sunk. The crew member ends up killing the sailor and his mother after his mother puts him on a raft. Patel returns to kill the crew member. The fight with the crew member recalls the tooth he finds in the plant on the island. Leaving the island might be symbolic of his decision to leave the situation where he found himself observing how his mother was thrown to the sharks. And finally, when Richard Parker fails to turn back and acknowledge him, this jarring event symbolizes Pi's acceptance of a loss of innocence and the reality that Story #1 was a fantasy.<br/><br/>There are hints that Story #2 may have been worse than Pi initially lets on. Was Pi possibly guilty of cannibalism? It's interesting that there was an actual Richard Parker in the 19th century who was a victim of cannibalism after a shipwreck and the character's name also figures in an Edgar Allan Poe novel, again a victim of cannibalism at sea.<br/><br/>Ang Lee, as well as author Martel, have made it clear that they both prefer Pi's spiritually uplifting tale of survival to the downbeat one involving murder. The elder Patel makes his preference clear in the film itself. The second story appears to be thrown in to contrast it with the uplifting message of Story #1. Story #2 then perhaps becomes a cautionary tale--similar to the loss of innocence moment when Richard Parker kills the goat. Lee has no problem with such ambiguity as long as the feel good message is highlighted.<br/><br/>In the end, the Life of Pi 'main course' will be remembered for Pi's 'story #1' and Ang Lee's masterful visual presentation. The rest, including the lumbering narration, simplistic spiritual stance and ambiguous alternative ending, are the leftovers."

"Hitchcoc","10","7","14","22 January 2013"," Master Storytelling!
","This is the most wonderfully original movie I've seen in such a long time. It is set up with an amazing touch. We are absorbed into the Indian culture by some of the most lovely people. They are understanding of Pi's dilemmas and his religious confusion. They support him, although he is an arrogant little twit at times. There is an amazing scene where he shatters his boundaries and almost gets himself killed by the tiger who later becomes his shipmate. The special effects are probably some of the most believable and effective I have ever scene, from the shipwreck to the game of (excuse the expression) cat and mouse that ensues. We are totally involved in the incredible story of Pi and how he uses his knowledge and survival skills to maintain both his life and his sanity. The tiger, Richard Parker, is so well conceived and so believable in his own evolution that we grow to feel for him and his fate. There is a comradeship that one can only view. I found myself describing this movie to a friend, and when I finished he acted like I was crazy to have liked it. I guess Pi felt the same way. This is a movie that takes a wonderful book and an amazing story to new depths. There is also, of course, Pi's struggle with his views of a god that he can't quite define. His is an honest doubt. No character in fiction is asked for more and has to question the entity that he says as responsible for the loss of his family and his abject loneliness in the middle of the Pacific. I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can savor it again. My regret is that I didn't get to see it in 3D which I don't normally care for."
"pranav_2001","7","7","14","23 November 2012"," Loved the picturization, but found story-line to be weak
","We have always been told that value of Pi is best calculated as 22/7 but you wouldn't know that 355/113 give a more accurate value of Pi than 22/7. However, using 22/7 makes it easier for to do calculations and that's the reason why it is used often.<br/><br/>Done with beating around the bush... time to criticize!<br/><br/>From the time movie start you can't help but notice the ""beautiful"" picturization and cinematography throughout. Add to that the life-like sound affects make you experience the movie almost in real time. This movie shows the wrath of ocean on its survivors and its destructive powers. There have been several movies made about survivors in wild or islands or the sea. This movie makes the survival journey even harder by making the human survive on a small rescue boat with a Royal Bengal Tiger. In my opinion, the presentation of this movie on the big screen was flawless. <br/><br/>Plot revealed below.<br/><br/>But you can never have a good movie experience until the actors ""live the movie"" and convince their audience that it all happened for real. Pi's role is taken by two people, Suraj Sharma when he was younger and Irfan Khan, the older Pi who narrates his life experience to a novel writer. Both have acted very well for their roles, but the role of honest looking younger-Pi seemed to make older Pi's role look a little weaker. During Pi's struggle to survive on a small boat with the fierce tiger, he realises a lot of things, most of it is self realization, the way he loses hope and regains it and the mysterious things he sees in his voyage makes the fictional story intriguing. What I liked about the movie was how Pi starts enjoying the little things he was left with in the rescue boat and how important it becomes for him. But, the most interesting part of the movie is how the boy and tiger learn to survive together and realize that each of them played a big part in keeping them alive.<br/><br/>What makes a movie more unrealistic is a big negative for me. I didn't like extra affects that make the ocean look beautifully clear and magical. Another flaw in the story is the way it starts and the way it ends seem to have no connection. In the beginning Pi, as a younger kid seems to be furiously looking see the meaning of life, religion and God. By the end of it, I would have expected that the story would come with a clearer answer. The story makers somehow didn't make the ends meet.<br/><br/>My suggestion: Pi is a good movie to experience. Watching it in 3D makes the movie experience even better."

How can you bring such a wonder of imagination and well written prose to the screen? Well, Ang Lee did; his work, what I've seen of it in the past, certainly lets one to believe that he has no fear and is blessed with every author's dream, a total appreciation of their work. <br/><br/>It was a friend, and fellow author, who lent me 'L'histoire de Pi' by Yann Martel. Nothing unusual with a local author introducing to another, the work of yet another one, except that I was not into fantasy novels.

I think the author may well have been aiming to stimulate some sort of spiritual or philosophical musings in his audience. This film never achieved that with me - I am simply too shallow and rooted in material reality - but I was blown away by how visually stunning this film is, and I recommend it heartily on that basis alone.

","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.<br/><br/>There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.<br/><br/>But regardless, this movie redefines the word ""beautiful."" I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc."

","Life of Pi...<br/><br/>The Best ever 3D graphics seen by me in any movie. awesome!! You will be mesmerize by the beauty and cruelty of Sea and storms.. Once again 'Ang Lee' proves that he he is a master story teller... More than the actor 'Life of Pi' belongs to its director Ang Lee. He has used the locations as well as technology to his best advantage. It is hard to imagine such a difficult storyline is being conceptualized and materialized into a full fledged movie with such precision and success. Full credit goes to the cast and crew of the movie. Irrfan Khan is very classy in his short role. The lead actor has done a commendable job. He is surely a young talent to look forward to. Tabbu is effervescent as always. Everybody has contributed their part in making 'Life of Pi' a must watch for everyone.<br/><br/>The story itself leaves you with a question..<br/><br/>What was Real??????????????????????????"
"TMokko","4","6","12","12 May 2013"," Flat story
","Life of Pi was a disappointment. Framework of the story, with a reporter interviewing Pi, was totally unnecessary - it made it difficult to get involved with the fate of the main character - after all he would survive to live conventional suburban life. Story didn't move me at all. Whole time I was just wondering are the filmmakers selling this story as a real story, based on a fact, or as a fantasy film. As a 'based on a true story' it could not happen - tiger would eat a scrawny Indian boy in a heartbeat if it was truly hungry and the whole island thing didn't help the realism at all. As a fantasy film, the story needed magic carpet ride and a giant - that would do it. In the frame story the reporter said that: ""You had a story that would make me believe in God."" That was setting the aspiration of the story quite high. I was ready to yell ""Hallelujah"" or ""Allah Akbar"" in the moment story would do it's magic, but it really never happened. Story shouldn't promise something that it can't deliver.<br/><br/>Special effects were very good and actors did their job well - although I was surprised that Depardieu had so little screen time. Better survival film would be Cast away (2000) and better depiction of storm was in The Perfect Storm (2000)."
"souplipton","6","6","12","19 April 2013"," Visually nice, but not as interesting as it thinks it is
","Life of Pi is nice as a visual experience, but falls a little flat as a movie.<br/><br/>The main character Pi tells stories from the early parts of his life to build his character, but his character does not really make sense as a person. We are supposed to believe that most of the obvious unrealistic characteristics of his personality can be put down to Pi being incredibly quirky, but even still it is hard to consider him as being a believable character. His character exists purely to be the vehicle of amusing stories and situations, but when trying to consider what such a person would be like, it becomes clear that his existence is only there because it is necessary for the story. This problem might have been avoided, but I was once again underwhelmed by Ang Lee's directing. That this film won Ang Lee the Academy Award is a tragedy to me (in my opinion Spielberg, Affleck, Tarantino, and also Bigelow all deserved the award that year more than Lee did).<br/><br/>As well, though the visuals were nice, often they could clearly be seen to be fake. This was not as big a problem in Avatar (which also had more impressive visuals), where the situations are of a science- fiction variety and are not supposed to be real events, but Life of Pi presents these events as actually having occurred, and the flaws in the CGI break up any immersion in the story.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending fails in my mind in its purpose as a story that would make me believe in god. Unlike in the movie where it leaves things unclear as to which of the stories is better, in my view, while Pi's original account is nicer to believe, it is clear that his second account of the story is the one to be believed. I believe that man should live by the wise words of Henry David Thoreau ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"". Believing in something you know to be untrue because it is nicer is a crime against the intellectual gifts you have been given. Connecting belief in god to belief in Pi's story portrays religion as being an obstacle to the truth, an obstacle to man's progress into the world of the future.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is nice to look at, but hollow and full of holes when examined beyond its pretty visuals. Briefly entertaining, but without any depth to keep it interesting. I recommend that you see it, but do not enter with any expectations of greatness or deeper meaning."
"Ctchung4","9","6","12","25 February 2013"," Visually stunning
","I read the book many years ago, and I have enjoyed the film even more. I found the story flow a little easier to follow on film than when I was trying to read the book, as the themes became more apparent to the viewer through the narrative revelation, the transformations in the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, and our choice whether or not to have faith. For me, the most memorable scenes were those of the whale leaping out of the ocean and splashing back into sea, the exotic fish and phytoplankton underwater, and the island when it turned carnivorous at night. I highly recommend this film for anyone who loves films about adventures and a remarkable story about faith."
"MiloXC-HD","10","6","12","15 January 2013"," Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery.
","Read my full review (thoughts on the film, what I liked about it, the plot etc.) at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/kill-list-2011.html<br/><br/>...Normally I don't like 3-D films; I hate the cheap, uncomfortable glasses, I hate how you have to look directly at the center of the screen all the time, and they make me feel dizzy. However, the visually-stunning masterpiece that was up on the screen completely took me away and I was completely engaged with the bright colours and amazing imagery. I've heard it's amazing in 2-D, though, and I'm sure it is. There aren't really any exclusive 3-D scenes (such as subjects coming towards the camera), but there is so much more depth in 3-D films, which really brings out how amazing the cinematography was. The composition in every scenic shot was brilliant, and there were some really-amazing scenes and random events that occur with Pi out at sea. The book challenges the idea of reliability, as the imagery could be made-up due to Pi loosing his mind when he's at sea, but we see this vivid imagery ourselves which makes us lean towards the crazier story about the animals on the boat, not the people...<br/><br/>...I first read the book, Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, in 2009. I also read it in 2011. I've always loved the book as it too has very powerful imagery (especially for a book), and I was hoping that the film wouldn't let down the book like most film-adaptations seem to do these days. I really wasn't expecting Ang Lee to direct it well as his previous films have been nothing like Life of Pi. However, the film was exactly like the book (besides a few little differences), and I was more than satisfied. I'm not sure whether I prefer the original book or the film; they're both brilliant...<br/><br/>...The story leaves the audience with a question: which of Pi's stories is the truth? I believe the second story to be true. I would like the first story to be true, with it's incredible sequence of random events that haven't been experienced or discovered, but it's unlikely. Why? Because Pi was stranded for a very long time and after seeing nothing but sea and having a bad diet, lack of sleep and suffering from the heat and the pressure he faces, he probably went crazy. We see how exhausted he is when he arrives on the shores of Mexico; he cries and cries until he is in hospital. Also, the island has never been discovered and there is no evidence of any of the animals or events that happened. I also struggle to see how a young man survives that long at sea on a raft with a very hungry Benga tiger, even if he trained it; as Pi's father says earlier on in the story, ""you think tiger is your friend, he is an animal, not a playmate"". The whole movie is about knowledge versus faith; Pi questions and tries different religions and throughout the film these beliefs are questioned with knowledge. What the audience has to decide is whether or not they believe in knowledge of faith, just like Pi did earlier on. I believe in knowledge...<br/><br/>...In conclusion, Life of Pi is an absolutely brilliant film. Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The film is far from a let down to the book, and in my opinion actually excels. 10/10, because it's exactly like the book, not a typical Hollywood adventure and I honestly can't flaw it."

"aharmas","10","6","12","2 December 2012"," Sublime Filmmaking
","We live in an era of cinema where it's very difficult to feel fulfilled with contemporary movies. There is some dissatisfaction about how the emphasis is on special effects and more than often the script is weak in comparison. Also, some people associate only serious themes with quality, and we can't help but wonder why we seem to place so much weight on period/costume movies while evaluating films. Thankfully we have people like Ang Lee who will not put a film together if the elements don't fit. With the exception of the ""Hulk"" which looks right and has a good story, yet it didn't quite match his other accomplishments, and he has tried just about every genre in cinema.<br/><br/>Here he gives us what could be his absolute masterpiece, ""The Life of Pi"" a film that works in so many levels: it's entertaining, wondrous, a metaphor for faith and the power of life, for just about every feeling we can think of or feel. It is so powerful that every single frame and line in it has a purpose and grabs our attention in a gentle and yet, sure way. Once the film begins, you can't look away or engage in any other thoughts, and all sorts of annoying technology (other than the one in the screen) is forgotten. As a member of the audience, you want this superb piece of imagery and storytelling to continue charming you, teaching you, getting inside your head, heart and soul.<br/><br/>Pi tells his amazing survival story to another man, a writer I believe, and the beginning of the film provides the background of a young man who believes in spirituality and searches for answers from early. Later on, as the story takes him across the world, his beliefs and faith will be tested in several incredible ways. Pi is from India, and he has a connection to living beings and other spiritual entities. His family doesn't quite understand his hunger, but his mothers tells the others to allow to pursue what he feels is right.<br/><br/>As they decide to move to Canada, tragedy strikes their ship, and Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, with a few animals that managed to escape from the cargo holds. His odyssey, with Mr. Lee's amazing control of every possible film element, from one of the most sensational pieces of editing, some magical cinematography, sound effects, and a lovely music score, we learn, as he does that there are a few miracles out there, and most of the times, encountering them is a test of the soul.<br/><br/>Most of the interaction is between him and Richard Parker, a Bengali tiger that has as much will to live as Pi does. Lee has filmed some unbelievable scenes, and I am still in awe about the way he did accomplish this. It's either the wonders of great editing, some quite sensational computer graphic imagery, or just plain terrific direction by Lee.<br/><br/>Pi and Parker's main goal is to survive, and they start by outsmarting each other and proving their worth, claiming territoriality, and giving us some thrilling and at times, very funny and scary exchanges. Eventually, as the story reaches its last sections, we see another type of link develop, and a film that is certainly qualifying as a wonderful movie from its beginning has now soared into greatness. The audience must be ready to gasp, and choke as powerful expressions, sometimes wordless acting force us into looking into our own emotions. Tears will inevitable roll out as you witness beauty rarely shown in movies. ""Pi"" is surely one of the best films ever made, an instant classic, and a reflection into humanity, those entities we choose to guide us through our human trek in this world. Whether or not you believe its message, can relate to its ideas or just enjoy its execution is entirely up to you. It does offer an interesting choice at it concludes. You decide. Either way, it will move you."

"ze-moleculo-man","10","6","12","2 December 2012"," Brilliant and Beautiful.
","This movie is beautifully crafted by everyone involved in the film. The acting, directing, writing, and cinematography are all done incredibly well. All groups do a great job of building up the story from the beginning of the movie through the middle and finally hitting home at the end. The first 20-30 minutes where a little slow, but the small stories related to the audience by the main character, Pi, in the beginning of the movie start subtlety showing up later on in the movie. The movie delves into the duality of man and also explores different religious concepts. It is rich in philosophy and explores what everything all means. <br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>As many people have already written, the movie ends with Pi asking the writer ""Which do you prefer"" and the writer responding ""The one with the Tiger."" I think different people will view this phrase in different ways. One previous reviewer mentions it is written ""prefers"" as opposed to ""believe"" because it shows that people adopt different belief systems based upon their own preferences; each religion having its own benefits and negatives. I viewed it in a completely different manner. I believe it was Pi's way of showing different religions/philosophies place in the world and rebutting all of his father's earlier assertions. It brought what happened in the beginning between his family and childhood and then in the middle on the boat full circle. <br/><br/>1. Pi's father was of the New India mindset and denounced Pi's adopting multiple religions, telling him in one scene to be rational and choose one; he is said to believe in Western Medicine after being cured of Polio and that people saved him, not God<br/><br/>2. Pi's father in another scene shows Pi that Richard Parker is but an animal, and that when you stare in an animal's eyes all you see is your own reflection<br/><br/>In Pi's story with the Tiger, he embraces aspects of many different religions and some allegories are as clear as day. In what is related as the real story, a singular, rational, line of reasoning is undertaken and understood. Pi asking which story is preferable is akin to Pi asking his father which world he would rather live in; one with people acting on impulse and reason or one with people acting on what they have learned with an open mind and understanding of different religion and philosophies. People can take lives (murder) as easily as they can save lives (cure Polio). <br/><br/>In Pi's story with the Tiger, he slowly trains the Tiger and shows the Tiger with some human qualities and tinkers with the idea that a predatory animal can have a soul. In the ""real"" story, Pi becomes animalistic (acting on instinct and feeling) and you are left thinking about the dual nature of man. Since the cook and Pi take certain actions to stay alive, does it mean they have any more of a soul than an animal that hunts and kills at will for food? <br/><br/>At the end, you don't know if either of the two stories is real. Pi tells the writer his story will make him believe in God and it doesn't have anything to do with what the negative reviewers wrote on here and elsewhere. It isn't about sugar-coating what actually did happen to cope with reality. You are lead to believe neither story is important when Pi's book he was writing in flies off into the wind. What is important is thinking about what type of world you would want to live in; one with everyone working in their own self-interest and acting, in dire straits, like animals, or a world with hope in which people look out for other people/animals. <br/><br/>Pi couldn't understand why God would send Jesus to die for mankind, just as we can't understand which of his stories were true and where, if they did, converge. Pi could understand that he had been delivered alive, just as we, hopefully, could understand which version of events is better."

Thus is the case with Life of Pi.<br/><br/>Many times we see miracles in our every move, in every day and we choose not to see them, we're blinded by a blindfold that we put on ourselves and we question everything that we hear, everything we see. We need an open mind to the wonderful miracle of just being alive and that's what I got from watching Life of Pi. God closes a door but He always opens up a window.

However thanks to 'Richard Parker' there is also an element of thrill that keeps you on the edge time and again. These is a certain kind of purity to the story, but without compromising on subtlety and elegance. <br/><br/>The scenes portrayed i.e. nighttime, sunsets, the lightning and storms, the exquisite variety of animals, underwater scenes; the rare but amazing quips and the beautiful analogy used as a 'proof of god' all on the whole left me strangely content when the movie ended, i.e. without the nagging need for 'more' that some good stories often leave behind."

","Ang Lee is a great filmmaker. From his early Taiwanese films like Eat Drink Man Woman to his later Hollywood productions like Brokeback Mountain, he has probably never made a bad film. (And with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon he created an unparallelled masterpiece in the history of cinema.)<br/><br/>Pi does not disappoint, either. In fact, the beginning of the movie is a genuine surprise. I had to check it was really Ang Lee who directed the film, because it looked and felt exactly like Jean-Pierre Jeunet's work (whose unique visual and storytelling style I also happen to love). Later I learnt that it was actually Jeunet who was originally slated to direct Pi, and he had done a great deal of work on the film until he dropped out. Ang Lee emulates his style so successfully in the opening scenes that I am thoroughly convinced he could direct a true Jeunet movie any time.<br/><br/>But he adds his own touch to the film, as well. As always, he elicits great performances from the cast, and fills the screen with haunting images. Like all of his movies, Pi is beautiful, meaningful, deeply moving and has that visceral, eye-opening, lump-in-the-throat moment at the end that an Ang Lee film never fails to deliver."
"The-Sarkologist","7","4","7","14 May 2013"," Seriously, it's more than just a film about a boy stuck on a boat with a tiger
","They said that this was the unfilmable book, and, well, this and countless of other films also fall into that category (such as Cloud Atlas, which I plan on holding off seeing until I get around to actually reading the book, though I have since seen it because I could watch it on the plane), and I would also suggest that maybe books like Ulysses and To the Lighthouse also fall into that category (I know they have made a film out of To the Lighthouse, but since I am writing this at 38000 ft and have no internet access, I cannot comment on Ulysses – yep, they have).<br/><br/>For those who have not seen this film, you will know it as the film about the boy who is trapped in a life boat with a tiger. Actually, many of you that have seen this film will probably say the same thing, I know I will. In fact, it is amusing sitting on the plane and looking around at the other seats to see who else is watching it (and the fact that I am stuck in this flying coffin for eight hours, I might as well watch it, but I do draw the line at Cloud Atlas – which I ended up watching anyway, and quite enjoyed it). Anyway, enough of me rambling, let us talk about the film.<br/><br/>Visually it is beautiful, but having never read the book I cannot comment on whether it actually catches the themes of the book all that well. Based on the film, and the story that is told at the end, I suspect it is about how one struggles with one's animal instincts and the desire to remain human. When trapped alone, out of touch with the rest of humanity, it is believed that one will no doubt descend back into an animal nature.<br/><br/>It is an interesting thought though, that the only thing that keeps us civilised is the existence of other people. The reason I raise this thing is because there are two stories, and one of them involves the boy stuck in the boat with the tiger, but this is a metaphor, in a sense. The boy is, well, the boy, and the tiger is the animal urges that are trying to take over the boy's mind. However, how do we know that that actually happens. Maybe there have been studies, maybe there hasn't.<br/><br/>However it is not simply about controlling one's humanity because, in a sense, we also have a scene where boy saves the tiger's life, and we question whether that, in a sense, is his desire not to let go of his animal nature. In a way this struggle, as he says, keeps him alive. Maybe it is the case that by killing the tiger he kills himself. In a way, it could be the animal instinct finally winning, so by showing the tiger kindness, and mercy, one retain's one humanity, whereas by killing the tiger, one sinks and becomes lost in one's animal instincts."

"TxMike","Null","4","7","28 March 2013"," 'So, which story do you prefer?', asks Pi Patel.
","""Life of Pi"" is one of those stories that get you thinking and people talking about ""what does it all mean?"" The line, near the end, where adult Pi asks the writer, ""Which story do you prefer?"" is telling, because he doesn't say ""Which story do you believe?"" This is not a story with one definite answer of what really happened on the boat, at sea for most of a year. The author of the source book doesn't even take a stand, he wrote it to be a modern day fable, a well-told yarn.<br/><br/>I find the movie best enjoyed just by watching it and enjoying the story, and the beautiful cinematography without worrying too much about deeper meanings. It is a story about young Pi (short for Piscine) Patel who has a personal exploration with spiritual matters, and when he finds himself at sea in a lifeboat, with an adult Bengal Tiger, he uses his faith, his belief in God, to carry him through and trust in ultimate survival. And it doesn't matter if any individual viewer believes in God, only that young Pi does.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is teenager Pi Patel in the 1970s, his family is forced to sell their zoo animals, all are on board a Japanese freight ship when, in a mighty storm the ship sinks, and the next morning Pi finds himself sharing the boat with an injured Zebra, a Hyea, and after a while, hiding under the tarp, Richard Parker, the adult Bengal Tiger. Eventually only Pi and Richard are left on the boat, and much of the movie is their saga of survival before eventually landing on the beach of Mexico.<br/><br/>The movie starts and ends in modern times, with Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi Patel, a college professor living in Canada with his wife and two children. An author, Rafe Spall as the Writer , is there to learn of Pi's story and write a book. In the end as Pi tells of the Japanese representatives of the shipping line visiting him in the hospital, they found his story hard to believe. So he told them a second, different, simpler story. When the writer questions the stories, searching for an answer, Pi asks, ""Which story do you prefer?"" The author of the book things we should prefer the first story, because everyone else dies anyway, but it is a much better story.<br/><br/>I have it on Blu-ray, the picture and sound are both just great. Definitely a movie to re-enjoy periodically."
"carolsalomao21","9","4","7","23 March 2013"," Life of Pi: life lesson for all ages
","The feature film ""Life of Pi"" is the film that brings many life lessons to people that watch because no one can imagine what a young Indian origin can simply learn as much as Pi learned during the story reported. A film that also has many high quality cinematic effects also shows that no matter what your religious belief, anyone can express their faith in what you believe in, and even with the most difficult situations, such faith will not be shaken. Through the vision of Yann Martel, author of the book that gave the film, and its director Ang Lee, with great simplicity and beauty portrayed the drama of a young man who finds himself often helpless, trying to survive in the middle of the Ocean Pacific in the company of one of the largest predators on the planet, we are led to reflect on our own lives and the difficulties they face in everyday life, and what is the real strength (or faith, as it is very prominent in the story) that we have within us to overcome our challenges, and Pi had great courage to face their challenges in life. The Indian actor Suraj Sharma in just 17 years, it surprises with its superb performance, it brings much life and brilliance in all the passages of the film that depict the adventures that Pi lived during his youth. Like many films were inspired in large bestseller, ""Life of Pi"" was also a result of a book, in which Ang Lee masterfully and also metaphorically portrayed to perfection in this movie. As much as Pi has experienced situations that virtually no one lived, the whole story is a way to show that you cannot give up in the face of an obstacle, however it seems insurmountable to our eyes, because as the plot shows, it takes to trust in ourselves, in our inner strength, even with my eyes closed, so that our faith is put to the test, because if there is no doubt we cannot say that faith exists permanently. ""Life of Pi"", a film for the whole family, who teaches the true values that often are forgotten over time and generations, to make us see the importance of a united family that cherishes the Sacred Teachings and mainly the respect for life, be it any creature."
"bevanmortimer","8","4","7","31 January 2013"," It didn't make me believe in god, but made me want to read the book!
","Life of Pi is one of those films that almost immediately draws you in to the world it has created. I watched the film with a permanent smile on my face and surely that is all you can ask of any film! <br/><br/>OK, so we all know the film is about a young man who is cast adrift with a tiger in the Pacific ocean in a small life boat. But, inevitably the story is so much more than that. Told largely in flashback, questions of faith and the human spirit are asked and sometimes answered. Almost uniquely in the day of the big Hollywood blockbusters, the film allows its audience to draw their own conclusions and not to be preached at. I'm sure the film says different things to different people, showing that what you bring in to a film will determine what you take out of it. <br/><br/>The cast are excellent, especially the various actors who play our hero Pi Patel through various stages of his life. The different actors are all engaging and make his character believable and likable.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning and some of the 3D adds to the story and doesn't totally detract from it. I'm not a fan of 3D and this is the highest compliment I can pay to any 3D film. But, I think the visuals would be stunning in 2D. To be honest, I wish 3D would go away as it doesn't add very much and is a novelty at best. But, to be fair to director Ang Lee, he used it pretty well.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book on which this film is based, so I can't say how true to the book the film is. But, the highest compliment I can pay to the film is it made me want to read the book.<br/><br/>All in all a great film that I can highly recommend."
"wladutz","10","7","15","13 January 2013"," Beyond belief
","I have to say, I almost never review a movie - mostly because there are already so many reviews out there - but I have to make an exception this time.<br/><br/>I saw the movie for the first time 5 days ago, and I recall that when I got out of the theater, I had a mixture of feelings about the plot, the characters, the believability of the whole concept. But, as Irrfan Khan said in an interview for the Screen Team Show, ""It's a film that will start resonating after you watch it"". <br/><br/>I saw it four times in one week, going from theater to theater, seeing it with a variety of people, and each time, I discovered countless details that got away the previous times. I grew to admire and love the characters, the actors and the way they everyone managed to embrace their role.<br/><br/>I think Suraj Sharma was amazing in the role of Pi, and I am quite disappointed seeing that he didn't manage to get nominated for an Oscar. His acting is flawless and he conveys the energy in a way that it affects your subconscious and you start recalling and rewinding the movie many times after it's over. I believe his acting surpasses that of many appreciated and versed stars and, as he said, part of it is the merit of director Ang Lee, who showed his genius one more time in this incredible motion picture.<br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to this year and it fits the movie perfectly. Mychael Danna has done a great job again.<br/><br/>I recommend you to go to this movie several times, for understanding it deeper. To see it in 3D is amazing for the first time, but after living this experience, a normal viewing will help you pay more attention and see many details you missed before. It is in deed, an amazing movie and no wonder it got 11 Oscar nominations!"
"amit_imt2002","8","7","15","8 January 2013"," An atheist perspective!!
","Pi Patel is the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry,India and when the business fails they decide to move to Canada and sell the animals off.The family sets off on a Japanese ship with all the animals on board, much like Noah's ark,only this time the biblical floods have been replaced by Indira Gandhi's emergency.But that does not make it a political film! There is a perfect storm at sea and Pi somehow finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The smaller animals fall victim to the food chain and Pi is left alone with the tiger.We are now faced with a simple question, are there two animals on the boat or one human and one animal? This is one of the pillars of our belief system.If we believe the we humans are in a league of our own and above all other animals we fall roughly into the camp of those who also believe in intelligent design and therefore puts us immediately at loggerheads with environmental issues.To accept Darwinian evolution and mix it with spirituality is one of the key challenges and part of the bigger question of reconciling science and religion in a post industrialized world.<br/><br/>Children are born atheists and amoral.They acquire morality and faith or a combination of both as the result of a variety of factors driven primarily by parents.My 5 year old daughter is drawn to the creamy layer of Hindu Gods( out of the teeming masses of no less than 33 million) when she listens to stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. At school they pray to a secular God everyday.Yet she lives happily in an atheist household.What her beliefs will be I do not know, I merely intent to give her the gift of choice, while gently reinforcing my rationalist standpoint which I regard as my moral duty, just as my parents felt it was theirs to imbibe in me the fear of God.<br/><br/>The key question of why Pi was drawn to religion remains open. He ends up a professor of theology.The 200+ day ordeal can change anybody profoundly.The trapped Chilean miners contemplated resorting to cannibalism to survive.Danny Boyles 27 Hours is another true example of the triumph of the human spirit when the protagonist amputates his own arm to survive. So the fictional story of a boy who survived impossible odds should not make us religious. The film is shot magnificently, its a superlative act of visualization to bring this story to the screen and Ang Lee certainly has that gift. Intriguingly, the way he handles the Indian angle of the film and the prelude to the fateful voyage reminds me of Mira Nair's work in The Namesake which was a lesser film but filled with some of the same elements, a boy who grows up with an improbable and embarrassing name, the presence of Irrfan Khan and Tabu and the challenges of an immigrant family in the alien landscape of America as a nuanced adventure, thematically similar to Pi stranded with a tiger in the vast oceans.<br/><br/>There is a scene at the end of the film where Pi parts ways with his feline companion.Richard Parker does not look back at Pi to bid him farewell and walks away unemotionally while Pi sobs with heartbreak.The tiger and its fear kept Pi alive, which is an interesting counterintuitive logic where fear keeps us alive.Perhaps an emotional void is mans biggest enemy. As he recounts the story many years later his eyes well up with tears again.We are supposed to feel that humans have a monopoly over emotions and this sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, which is factually incorrect. Richard Parker deserves to be cut some slack as he has just survived an equal or probably even greater ordeal at sea!<br/><br/>Mention must be made of Suraj Sharma who went to the audition to accompany his brother but landed the role out of 3000 aspirants.He does an outstanding job as a gangly youth who fights his circumstances with remarkable ingenuity and pluck.But the star of this visual feast must surely be the CGI tiger who looks us in the eye and brings to mind William Blakes classic poem The Tyger( a wonderful way to spell,sadly rectified in our school anthology) from his collection Songs of Experience, which was a sister poem of The Lamb.Pi is the Lamb here.When the Royal Bengal Tiger walks into the pages of history he will not look back with emotion at us humans who proved to be his worst enemies.We will be left wiping away our tears at having lost the most beautiful creature ever to our greed, indifference and arrogance. William Blake's poem brought to life by Ang Lee in the Life of Pi will hopefully survive for our children to fire their imagination."

","First of all great team work. Made me awe and jealous in a good way. The movie is so true to all elements about India and narrative way was too great, nobody can claim to have made this movie better or best because this is the best of the best. I haven't read the book but the movie has provided me a visual as well as audio treat. Visual treat I don't have to mention(it's known to all who watched this fabulous visual movie) now by audio I meant the score the start itself had traditional Indian music inch by inch but with a new pleasant and at the same time modern in instruments without just using it here and there. The team(visual,sound,actors,directors etc) have provided a new and more spectacular fantasy and dream like movie where in all elements of Hinduism are treated without any mocking sequences. The movie made me think and what I think this movie has conveyed are 1. Life has a meaning and to completely understand it is really hard (Anandi first love but marries another woman) 2. Circle of life comes in where dominant species kills lesser dominant species for survival(hyena kills orangutan and zebra in turn hyena gets killed by Tiger) and man being most dominant is able to train all other animals with his will(Pi training Richard Parker). 3.God works in the most mysterious ways 4.Never give up hope even when the shadows of lose is high. And the final sequence where the tiger just goes into jungle without turning back even though I didn't expect or didn't want it to happen but added meaning to what his father claimed. This movie is worth being called Indian movie because it brings in all our tradition,beliefs,ideas and myths into screen without losing its charm. I congratulate Ang Lee for Visualizing India in the most positive and effective way,each frame showing India was superbly taken and I wish more movies comes out which brings in the values of our nation rather than over hyped and very typical movie like Slum dog millionaire which I hate. And finally I found the ending as somewhat like Inception's ending where the viewer has to determine whether there truly was a Tiger(at the end Tiger goes into jungle and the screen becomes black and white) or just fragments of his imagination to do away with the loneliness or Is he paranoid?Some scenes made me think him as insane(1.When storm comes he pulls away the shelter type clothing and reveal Parker to the extreme weather condtions when he is tied to the boat). Anyway it's upto you viewers to believe in 'GOD' version or 2nd version. I believe in the more colorful story that is 'GOD' version rather than dull boring 2nd story without any color."

Pi and Richard Parker form a passionate relationship through survival. Cast away alone above the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the ocean which goes down 7 miles. The actor of eighteen year old Pi deserves a best actor nomination at today's Oscars. Life of Pi will roar at the Oscars no doubt about that. It deserves best picture for how beautifully and original this film was made. People will argue that Argo has it all but that did not touch me in a way that Life of Pi did.

","Incredible !!!! I have never been to a movie that left me stunned at the end like Ang Lee's Life of Pi. I looked around and everybody in the theater was sitting in there seats, momentarily stunned, absorbing the wonder of the movie that we all just experienced, and when the Credits displayed on the screen the movie and Ang Lee received a warm applause, a scene I've never seen before. Everyone watched this movie thinks he simply understood it. they think the story is so simple that a young boy lost his mom and dad and his brothers and everyone who knows and everything he has. Then he continues on his journey alone with a TIGER in the middle of the ocean 227 days until he survives. REALLY? The story is more sophisticated than that ( I'll explain later..) The movie itself so outstanding, from the first minute to the end, its very entertaining, exhilarating, and heart-touching. The story-telling was great, the visual effects were perfect, the acting and directing was the best I've ever seen, Ang is really GENIUS, the way he simplifies the story (book) without loosing it's basic ideas was really a great film-making. the 3D was perfect (Watch only in 3D!!) Back to the story.. (I'll try not to spoil) - the scene that left me stunned is right at the end, when Pi Patel told the Japanese guys the other story, that scene helped me realize that there is something hidden in this movie.. something far more greater than that. After research i found that all the movie and the story is about symbolism, it's all about metaphors. these symbols sometimes brings historical stories like the name of the tiger Richard Parker, and sometimes even mathematically the story connects as well like the name of Pi (22/7 = 3.14) .. So who is Richard Parker?? who is the Orangutan? who is the Zebra ? What was the idea of the island ??!! why Richard Parker didn't look at Pi when they survived?? and many more symbols!!.. But more important than that was the faith, hope and other spiritual symbols. I won't go further in that to not spoil the movie! but when you watch the movie make sure to read about the hidden ideas to understand what Yann Martel- the writer of the novel- wanted to tell from this CLEVER story. That's why the novel Life of Pi won the Man Booker prize and that what makes it really a masterpiece and art at it's purest form.<br/><br/>so in summary, I want to thank Yann Martel for the awesome novel and of course i want to thank Ang Lee for such a magnificent movie, waiting more creativity from you!<br/><br/>If you haven't watch this movie yet, RUN to watch it in 3D before its gone and experience this journey on your own. because it's simply a MUST WATCH FILM!!."
"romangonther","10","5","10","5 January 2013"," Finally a stereoscopic film actually worth watching in 3D!
","To tell the truth: I really hate stereoscopic 3D. Well that of course is very irrational. After all it is just another tool in the filmmaker's toolbox. So the reason why I do not like it has more to do with the fact that a lot of studio bosses and distributors try to tell me that in the future all films will be 3D and in seminars some Stereoscopic Supervisors never become tired to tell people, that now films are so much better just because they are in 3D now. So ever since Avatar I had to watch one 3D film after another and come out of the cinema with the impression that at best the stereoscopic effect did not harm the movie - although sometimes it did. But I hardly ever felt that the 3rd dimension supported the story telling in any way. So besides the fact that the distributor can charge extra on a ticket for a 3D movie and thus will get more money out of it why use it?<br/><br/>And why watch it in 3D, you might ask. Today going to the cinema is like ordering a sandwich at Subway. You can choose between 2D and 3D, with intermission (if the film is longer) or without, original language with or without subtitles or the dubbed version, IMAX or non- IMAX and now Peter Jackson added another sauce to the menu: HFR or 24 frames per second. Call me old fashioned but when I was young filmmakers actually made decisions when choosing the right format for their story and did not leave the choice to the audience that naturally does not have a clue what's best for the film. So I always try to see the version that comes closest to the directions vision. But this is hard to decide especially when you see that films like the new ""Star Trek"" or ""Man of Steel"" are suddenly announced as a 3D feature but were originally shot on film in 35mm and IMAX format. Who has made the decision here? Did the director even know that his is going to be a 3D feature? And how I am supposed to know?<br/><br/>So this time having been so disappointed by watching the 3D Hobbit just a week before I tried to be clever and picked the cheaper 2D version of Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" and I immediately realized that this might have been a mistake. Even by staring at the 2D images of this great movie I could imagine that here is the film I have been waiting for ever since the whole 3D hype broke loose. So I went to see the film again the next day, this time in 3D and I got to say words that I never thought would come out of my moth: ""You really have to see this movie in 3D!""<br/><br/>Here finally is a director for whom stereoscopic filmmaking is not just another technical gag to make more money or to hide a 3rd rate screenplay behind it - excuse me, mister Cameron - but a filmmaker who really uses this technique to support the story and to make it an integral inseparable part of his movie like sound or color. Ang Lee constantly plays with the stereoscopic effect for example when he dives into a comic book illustration of the universe in the mouth of the goddess Shiva and thus illustrates the transcendental experience the protagonist has by reading this comic book. You really feel it. In another scene he morphs form 3d to 2d. The flying fish sequence is actually one of the most stunning 3D scenes I have ever seen. You actually start to worry about having a fish on your lap. But Ang Lee never uses 3D in these scenes just as an effect. It always supports the story and it does not only enhance the emotions but it really becomes an important part of the development of the protagonist's character. A reason why this works so well in ""Life of Pi"" is that in this film more than in most other films the story, the emotions and the inner struggle of the protagonist is reflected in the scenery and the setting.<br/><br/>In interesting point is also that if you watch closely or check out the technical date here in IMDb, you will see that Ang Lee constantly changes the aspect ratio of the film depending on the scene. This shows how much aware he is of the importance of the format he uses.<br/><br/>Of all the stereoscopic films that came out recently for me there are probably 3 modern films that are really worth watching in 3D, there is ""Hugo"", ""Pina"" and now on the top of the list Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"". So what can we learn from this: Cinema of the future will be 3D after all if we only follow Ang Lee's lead? Definitely not! But if a filmmaker chooses a format for his film, he has got to make sure that it is the right one and that he really means it. A movie is not a Subway- sandwich after all."

","Having been introduced to Ang Lee with his magical 2000 film Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,which was also my first ever none-English language movie,I was thrilled to hear that for his next movie,Lee was planning to do something pretty special in 3D.<br/><br/>Taking a look for some basic details about the film online,I began to fear that Lee may have strayed into the plodding Castaway territory,due to a good amount of the movie taking place between two characters being stranded in the middle of an ocean.Doing my best to lower the sense of doubt I had as I entered the cinema,I began to set to witness Ang Lee cast the life of Pi Patel in shimmering 3D across the screen.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Getting introduced to a local writer by a relative,Pi Patel is told by the writer,that the small amount of info his relative has shaded with the him,has made him think that the life of Patel would make a classic novel.Accepting the writer's offer,Pi begins to tell him about his extraordinary,strange life.<br/><br/>Decades earlier:<br/><br/>Despite having been forced by his dad (Santosh Patel) to witness a tiger kill a goat a few years ago,a 16 year old Pi Patel (who changed his name from Piscine Molitor whilst at school) still feels a strong connection to the animals that his family keep in their zoo,with a tiger called Richard Parker being an animal that Pi has a particularly strong connection with.<br/><br/>Feeling that greater opportunity is being offered in Canada and North America,Santosh decides to close down the zoo,and take all of the family on a ship to Canada,with the animals also being taken,so that they can be sold off when the family reach their new destination.<br/><br/>Walking around the ship's deck,Pi notices in the distance that a powerful storm seems to be heading in the ships direction.Shocked by the appearance of the storm,Pi is caught completely by surprise,when the storm hits the ship with a number of knock out blows.During the ensuring chaos,a crew member puts Pi into a lifeboat,that he releases before the rest of Pi's family have a chance of reaching any of the lifeboats.<br/><br/>Being unable to do nothing but witness his family die with the rest of the passengers as the ship starts to sink,Pi soon discovers that he is not the only occupant of the life boat,when a cover on half of the life boat by a group of animals that were originally from the Patel's zoo,which includes the rather hungry tiger Richard Parker.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Introduceing a religious element very early on in his adaptation of Yann Martel's novel, (with Patel being a Hindu-Catholic,who also teaches Kabbalah at a university)screenwriter David Magee (whose last credit was for being a co-writer of 2008's Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day) handles the religious themes of the story with a real delicacy that never becomes overpowering or too preachy.<br/><br/>Using Pi's multiple religious beliefs as a way to show a holding of faith and hope in a seemingly dyer situation,and also connecting Patel's experience's to mythological religious tales,with Magee superbly showing at the end,that the most outlandish of Pi's story,is actually the one which gets the points of his life across in the best way.<br/><br/>Setting 90% of the film in the confined location of a life boat,and also having one of the two main characters be a tiger (!),Magee brilliantly avoids the easy trappings of the movie becoming a very dry affair,by using the changing conditions of the enviorment as a way to expertly show the rites of passage that Pi is going through.along with the conditions,Magee also gives the movie an unexpected,pleasing Comedy element which helps to show the bond which develops between Patel and Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Keeping away from using 3D as a device to poke the audience in the eye with,director Ang Lee instead uses 3D as a way to draw the audience deep into Pi's world,with the scenes of Richard Parker possibly ""turning"" on Pi having a real dept of field,and Lee's use of elegant,long wide shots creating a strong,mystical atmosphere for the isolated world that Patel finds himself in.<br/><br/>Taking a look online for info about the making of this stunning film,I was shocked to discover,that along with the film being lead by the debut actor Suraj Sharma as the 16 year old Patel (with Irrfan Khan giving a great performance as the adult Pi) Sharma co-star,the tiger Richard Parker,was almost completely CGI!<br/><br/>Displaying no signs at all of tearing the movie at the seems,the CGI effects of Richard Parker blend seamlessly into the envioment,with the interaction,and developing relationship between Pi and Parker looking astonishingly life-like and completely photo realistic. Getting some pretty tough challenges put in front of him,which include being the lead star in his debut performance,and also having to act with a co-star who does not exist,Suraj Sharma gives a brilliant,eye-catching debut performance as the 16 year old PI .<br/><br/>Showing the fear and hurt that Pi feels over seeing his parents die,Sharma expertly portrays in subtle gestures the changes that take place with Pi during his experience,that go from being closed in and fearing the unknown,to opening up,and allowing the viewer to be a part of the life of Pi Patel."
"estebangonzalez10","10","5","10","26 December 2012"," Ang Lee shows us how 3D can be used effectively
","¨All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.¨<br/><br/>This film reminded me of why I love movies so much. Even though it is very hard to come across these gems nowadays, once you finally discover one you completely fall in love with it and are reminded why you fell in love with movies in the first place: it is just such a magical and emotional experience. Life of Pi is among the 3 best films of 2012 and despite my dislike towards 3D movies in general, I loved its use here. The art direction, visual effects, and cinematography were astonishing; it was one of the most beautiful films I've seen. This is a film you will want to see in 3D and enjoy the experience as much as possible because in my opinion this is the best use in 3D that I've seen. Life of Pi is based on the successful novel written by Yann Martel which many considered impossible to adapt to the big screen, but Ang Lee found a way to do it yet again. Lee amazed me in 2000 with his wonderful Chinese film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He has always been a magician artistically speaking. He also did a wonderful job with the storytelling and cinematography in Brokeback Mountain, but in Life of Pi he directs his best and most complete film to date. I left the theater totally satisfied and amazed with the wonderful visual experience. I also enjoyed the performances and the storytelling; so I have nothing really negative to critique about Lee's work here. I also love climatic twist endings and this film has one of the best I've seen since The Sixth Sense. This is a masterpiece and a must see movie for all.<br/><br/>A writer (Rafe Spall) has been sent by an acquaintance to visit a man named Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) who has a story to tell him that will make him believe in God. Pi receives the writer kindly and while he cooks for the man he begins to narrate his story. The writer is curious to find out what Pi has to tell him and he patiently listens to him as he narrates his story from the very beginning. He explains how he got his name, what his family was doing in India at the time, and so on. Of course none of this is really what the writer is expecting to hear until Pi gets to the heart of the story. He explains that his family owned a zoo and that his father suddenly decided to move them all to Canada. While they are all (including the animals) on their way to Canada on a carrier ship a heavy storm intercepts them and the ship sinks. Pi (the younger version played by Suraj Sharma) manages to survive along with a couple animals: an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Pi struggles to survive along with the animals in the small lifeboat in middle of the Pacific Ocean as he encounters many obstacles that will test his faith. The film is told in a similar fashion to Slumdog Millionaire (through flashbacks which happen to be longer than the present scenes) as we have the narrator telling his incredible story to the writer.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is really great here as the main character. Incredibly he has had no prior experience as a film actor, but he singlehandedly delivers this movie considering he is in the boat almost the entire time on his own (the animals were added mostly through CGI). A lot of credit has to be given to the visual effects department considering the animals look so real and believable. This film is really beautiful to watch, everything about it is just wonderful, including the powerful climatic ending which had a great message. I thought the film worked as sort of a parable more than an actual metaphor. I haven't read the novel, but I really can't see how it can be better than the film. Lee's imagination works better than mine, and he has created a wonderful film with many memorable scenes that will stick with me forever. The film touches lightly on themes of religion and faith, but at the end it will make you think about it. Everyone can make their own conclusions as to what story they want to believe, but it was pretty clear for me as to where the director was trying to get as to how he viewed God. The less you know about the film before going into it, the better. The film does start a bit slow, but it was a nice setup in my opinion with some beautiful cinematography, and it just picks up from there. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Kudos to Ang Lee ! Must watch movie Life of Pi.<br/><br/>3D was mesmerizing and cinematography was too good. Certainly a change in 3D movie industry.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan as the older Pi contributes largely in making the film emotionally compelling. American accent is a bit noticeable but overall good enough.<br/><br/>Better watch it only in 3D theater, will blow you up. Animated character of tiger doesn't allow you to feel that it is animated, it was so real."

"g-phanisrinivas","9","5","10","24 November 2012"," Imagination is subject to knowledge
","*Minor Spoilers*<br/><br/>Advertised and rumored as the most spectacularly visually stunning & galling film till date, Ang Lee's film set right in the center of Pacific is a technically avant-grade production. Some of the visuals enraptured me so badly. And no doubt the film's towering accomplishments have been praised by none other than James Cameron.<br/><br/>Technical excellence if flaunted throughout, but that's just not it; It's more. In the underbelly of the film lies an emotionally captivating story that is felt and experienced rather than viewed. The sense of being left alone in the world, with a boat and only a boat at stake, among wild animals that fight and outlive each other, these feelings come alive on the screen. One cannot stop feeling as stuck in the middle of nowhere as the protagonist does. We make the happenings our own.<br/><br/>The impact is only exalted by the engaging cinematography and the very diverse background score. Mychael Danna was introduced to India on a wide scale with the Golden Lion winning ""Monsoon Wedding"" and has hence reaffirmed himself with the brilliant ""Water"", a score that make perfect use of western and Indian instruments. It is hard to believe it was composed by someone who lived outside India all through. ""Life of Pi"" is equally superb with the flute interludes standing out.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's direction needs no introduction and praise. It is glorious, marvelous, matchlessput any synonym or even a hyponym in its place and it fits sound. Although he might not be as lucky as he was during Brokeback Mountain to win the Oscar. I love the way he doesn't compromise with the scenes and their treatment; He squeezes everything out of them on screen. The scenes are endless at times that one wonders why he pays such critical attention to every detail. It is overwhelming. Is the film self-indulgent? Yes I would say but in a good sense.<br/><br/>Yann Martel's story is exquisite (though I haven't read the novel which I am keen to read soon) but it is the screenplay that is haphazard at places. It must have been problems with adapting a book. Lee can of course not always get a screenplay as good as the one by Emma Thompson for ""Sense and Sensibility"". But that doesn't hamper the experience much as the other wonderful aspects make up for it and it could be by far the best adaptation of a highly visionary and whimsical novel.<br/><br/>Tabu has a strong screen presence and given the small role, yet she makes a long lasting impression. In her second international project after ""The Namesake"", Tabu makes the best out of the limited opportunity she gets. Adil Hussain is competent aside a dominating actor. Irfan Khan as the narrator & the older Pi is also refreshing. Suraj Sharma is an inexperienced actor but that never shows. Lee has made a perfect casting decision and the last scene in the hospital proves exactly why. Suraj Sharma looks at the camera that never cuts telling his ""story"" and we mostly experience the scene through his eyes that he expresses most of the story through.<br/><br/>I also loved the way India was depicted in the film. Pondicherry was an intelligent choice in the first place. It gets rid of clichés and instead shows some of the beautiful things of India. Two particular scenes I enjoyed the most were the dance scene where the teacher sings the classical dance notes and the second where Tabu narrates the story of Yashoda seeing the universe in Krishna's mouth in Tamil. <br/><br/>Life of Pi questions ideologies towards the end. It talks of reality that is difficult to assimilate, imagination that doesn't go beyond knowledge, a story that is seemingly imaginary yet claimed real. It tries to convince a character about the existence of God, structures a character as God-like and affirms faith and hope as the driving forces of human existence. The story has dark, ambiguous tones towards the end with which it questions what was 'right' and what was 'real'. It uses imagination as an escape medium for the protagonist.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the treatment and the film as a whole is light, gives a typical happy end to the protagonist, hilarious at times, triumphs in the end unlike Lee's two previous films ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Lust, Caution"". Now that's what Lee's known for – directing films of diverse range and genre."
"sidin","10","5","10","24 November 2012"," Life of Pi is achingly beautiful. An utterly magnificent experience.
","When I read the book, I understood why Life of Pi was pronounced unfilmable. Most of the plot revolves around a boy and a tiger on a boat. This is one of those cases where most would say ""nothing happens"". This story which isn't blatantly cinematic didn't exactly have a formula for a great film. Its production was also jinxed as it changed directors from M. Night Shyamalan to Jean Pierre-Jeunet, an Indian-American and a Frenchman. These choices made sense since the book was written by a French-Canadian but set in the Indian backdrop. Finally, the job was handed over to Ang Lee who is neither French nor Indian. This told me how judgments could really throw you off sometimes and prevent you from discovering beauty. Lee takes on this crouching tiger and truly gives us a hidden dragon. He has always been expert at subtle drama and handling unspoken/ unfulfilled relationships with poignancy. It all ultimately fits. I would even go as far as saying the book was waiting to be filmed by him. Nobody else could have made it.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is unlike anything your eyes have seen before. It is just utterly magnificent. Avatar, Hugo, Tintin and now Life of Pi. Few films have exhibited actual use 3D and not thanklessly indulge in shoddy gimmickry. The images composed are so strikingly rich and alive that it would work even without 3D. There would be at least 10 instances where my mouth opened and I couldn't bring myself to let out a gasp since I was choked with amazement.<br/><br/>As most fables do, they transport you into a fantastical world while being an allegory on life. I personally love the character of Pi. He is relentless, a child of god who never ceases to give up hope. There is another character you take home with you: Richard Parker, the Royal Bengal Tiger. He isn't a cute dog that everybody in the audience falls for but a fearsome presence like King Kong. There are other wondrous creatures like a bioluminescent whale, an island swarming with meerkats and flying dorados. Magic realism on film has never been this good.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is soulful as Pi. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes onto become a Hollywood movie star like Freida Pinto. Although, the performance that blew me away was that of Irrfan Khan as the older Pi. In the scene where he talks about Richard Parker, two teardrops from his eyes moved me ever so deeply. The film will be getting several nominations at the Oscars, including the big ones. But if there is any justice in Hollywood (which there isn't, as we know), Irrfan Khan should be on his way to getting an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.<br/><br/>Mychael Danna's music is simply unbelievable. He uses Indian flutes, French accordions along with classical western violins. Pi's Lullaby (in Tamil) is achingly beautiful and it is accompanied with a gorgeous credits sequence that will make A. R. Rahman sit up with envy.<br/><br/>I was a bit concerned about a few sub-plots in the novel and especially the preface which deals with Yann Martel talking about how he came to write this story. This preface is now a sub-plot in the film as Pi gives the story to the writer and tells him to do whatever he wants with it. That writer is Ang Lee who has taken Martel's story and improved upon it. He squeezes out certain moments from the source material and gives it a new life. The ending of the film is classic Ang Lee and stands tall as one of his best closing moments alongside Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Lust, Caution (2007). It is safe to say he is one of those few filmmakers who can film any story of any genre and still make it better than the genre's luminaries. He is one of cinema's modern masters.<br/><br/>The question everybody will come out with after watching the film is whether it was real or not? I don't wish to go into this at all as I wholeheartedly believe Pi's tale without a single speck of doubt (I find it easier to believe than many films based on true stories). It isn't exactly believable how Sense and Sensibility, a Jane Austen novel that was fundamentally British was also perfectly filmed, not by a Briton, but by a Taiwanese filmmaker. It may seem far-fetched but it's the truth. Truth cannot be truth if it only comes out of knowledge and not experience. Life of Pi is that transcendental experience. There are many who will have issues with the film's thematic elements. Believe in god or not, but if you believe in cinema, you will surely be blessed with a gift. The word I would use to concisely describe Life of Pi is: ""beautiful"". This is most definitely one of my most favorite films of the year."
"Fields201","9","5","10","23 November 2012"," Life of Pi is Fun
","Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.<br/><br/>It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!<br/><br/>If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!"

Perhaps the first time I have seen a movie based on a book I have read that didn't make me feel the director had left something out or (more often) falsified the story in some way. Remarkable discipline here, remarkable results. Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this wonderful movie is the way the 3D, that much maligned technology is used to create effects that bolster the emotional weight of the story. There's no sense of having things thrown into your face, just to create the illusion of 3D. The illusion here is that it all looks very real, especially the presence of the ocean. There's sense of depth as well as of dimension. It should open the way for a lot of creative work in this medium."

Suraj Sharma, a 17 year old unknown, was the absolute right choice to play Pi he is wonderful. It made me wish for more young actors like him instead of the same cookie cutter no talents that the movie industry seems to feel the public wants. The decision to go with an international cast of unknowns to most of the world, for the most part(Gérard Depardieu has a small part as does Bollywood star Tabu...theirs were the only faces I recognized...)

But, the movie in itself is pure pleasure for the senses, both external and internal. Its like a feast being laid out before your eyes, and eyes you wouldn't wanna blink! This is the best 3D movie so far (yes, even better than Avatar). The 3D and effects aside, I think its the story and the direction by Ang Lee that keeps the viewers engaged. And of course, the ferocious Royal Bengal Tiger, named Richard Parker. If only, animals could be awarded for their acting, the tiger would get the best actor award. The best scenes of the movie are the nighttime shots of the vast Pacific ocean and the underwater sequences. I didn't like the ending of the movie though, which made me doubt what I saw from the start. The spirituality aspect is delivered in plenty in the movie. Afterall, its a tale of survival against all odds. The movie is a winner because it delivers a simple tale which would have been so difficult to film in a manner which is not only beautiful but also humbling."
"sailpra-269-686665","8","5","10","22 November 2012"," Very contemplative movie with stunning effects and music
","Unlike most of the movies adapted from books that don't live up to their source, this movie has done more than justice to Yann Martel's book. The introduction to India, the music, typical school life etc have been very well portrayed. The music interluded with Indian classical tunes on Tampura and flute was wonderful. The emotions and feelings that go to and forth between Pi and Tiger while abandoned in the sea are remarkable (although Pi should have a been more emotional when he loses his family). Mr Lee has blended 3D computer graphics very well into the main story line without getting the audience bored (though once there was a feeling that CG would have been avoided in some places). The movie had space for a subtle fun too which was acted out very well by Suraj (Pi). Finally you get to really contemplate about the movie once you are out of the theater about questions like Faith and Life! Great movie to watch."
"TheMovieSnob247","10","6","13","16 February 2013"," A joy to watch and the best film of 2012 to date
","I've been waiting for a film to really capture my imagination from 2012 and I was beginning to think it wasn't going to happen. Life of Pi finally did that. Stunningly beautiful and inspiring, it's the best movie I've seen from last year. A young man (Pi) and his family are shipwrecked while moving to America with the animals from their family zoo. While he manages to survives the ordeal on a life boat, he must find a way to co-exist with some of the other survivors of the wreck; particularly a Bengal Tiger curiously named Richard Parker. <br/><br/>A few minutes into this I knew I was going to love this movie. The opening scenes were beautiful shot and the musical score was joyous and whimsical. I was intrigued from the start and the film kept me that way throughout. There's something about well made movies with animals just I can't resist (yes, I'm a sucker that way). I don't think I've ever watched Two Brothers without being moved to tears. <br/><br/>First off all, Ang Lee does a lot with very little on screen out side of the ocean and a boat. You would think there isn't much you can do with a film story like this, but Lee makes it work (his creativity is clearly on display). There are some really beautiful visual effects scenes (especially at night time) and the CG Tiger was beyond belief! I still can't believe that Tiger wasn't real, just outstanding work by the visual effects team that worked on that. I also felt the 3D worked really well for this movie. 3D works when it's used to make the film more immersive (like in Avatar) and not just as a cheap gimmick in order to charge more. The pacing was very good at no point in the over 2 hours did I feel it dragged or lost interest. There was also more than enough to keep you entertained (again, it's hard to do this when limited with what you can do) and plenty of humour was sprinkled throughout. Combining this with the soothing score and great storytelling, this film just seemed to work for me on every level. <br/><br/>There are some definite parallels to Cast Away; this seemed unavoidable given the nature of the story. While there were similarities, at no point did I find this film was a cheap imitation or ripped off Cast Away as some would suggest. This film stands on it's own merit and I even felt had a number of powerful scenes that rivalled Robert Zemeckis's classic. <br/><br/>It takes great acting to make both these movies work and fortunately that is the case here. Newcomer Suraj Sharma (young Pi) creates a character you can't help but love. And Irfan Khan's (adult Pi) narration is outstanding and pulls everything together. Together they really bring this character to life and are very believable; when the emotional scenes come, they hit home. The ultimate scene of this film for me comes when Richard Parker and Young Pi's journey comes to an end and it's so heartbreaking it had me fighting back tears. Both Suraj and Irfan are completely broken and their performances lift the scene to what I think maybe the most emphatic of 2012. It reminded me of a similar scene in Cast Away that is one of my favorite movie moments ever and gets me every time. <br/><br/>There are philosophical and spiritual elements of this film which I found really interesting as well. I tend to hate most movies where you watch most of the film and at the end the film does a complete 180 and says ""Oh, what you watched the last 1.5 hours didn't really happen; *this* is what really happened!"". That gimmick is often used to create shock value and most of the time is a cop out by the director for a bad story. The difference here is that mechanism serves a legitimate purpose in this film. In another moving scene in the film Young Pi tells another version of the story. The author (and Ang Lee via proxy) doesn't treat you as a child and dictate to you what to believe and why. Two stories are presented and it's up to you to believe in whichever you choose. The film makes it clear it's not so much which story you chose to believe, but why you chose it and whether or not you're at peace with that decision. And in making your choice, I think the film forces you learn something about yourself. I confirmed what I've always believed: that I'm hopelessly optimistic. <br/><br/>I loved that this film challenged me in this way and it sparked a really interesting conversation on the drive home and among friends later. This for me is always one of the elements of a great movie; the lasting effect of it. What was the film saying? What does the film mean to you personally? How does it make you look at life or circumstances differently? These are all questions I was asking myself in the days after and even now still. And everyone has their own answers and opinions, as they should. And that's kind of the point. <br/><br/>While I'm pulling for it to win Best Picture next week, Hollywood politics are always in play. It looks like that's going to either Zero Dark Thirty or Lincoln. Which is really unfortunate, because this is a better overall film than both of those films. I wish this had maybe come out in a weaker year where it would receive the praise it deserves. If this were to match up against say Slumdogg Millionaire or The King's Speech, it would be a no brainer in my opinion.<br/><br/>This film blew me away and it's not to be missed. Movies like Life of Pi are why I love going to movies.<br/><br/>www.themoviesnob.ca<br/><br/>@the_movie_snob"
"jaykay505","10","6","13","13 January 2013"," A film that re-ignites the wonderment of the universe.
","LIFE OF PI (2012) Dir. ANG LEE<br/><br/>Fresh from Oscar-winning Ang Lee, veteran of the groundbreaking Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, comes a film that will make the grey of modern life melt away - and reignite that childhood fascination with the universe you thought you had lost forever.<br/><br/>Set, like quite a few films of 2012, against the colourful and bursting collage of India (well, at least before the boat bit) this is a road movie unlike any other in both the obvious and more magical senses. Our protagonist (unsurprisingly) is a young Indian man called PI, short for Piscine, the French for swimming pool.<br/><br/>During a lavish and wondrous prologue we explore the past of our boat-bound hero - the son of a Zookeeper who has sadly been forced to leave India in search of Western opportunity, PI is about to see the world of magic, colour and fascination he loves vanish from the port window of a grimy Japanese freighter. As PIs origins unfold, we examine the cross-religious makeup of India, and the similarities between religious paths are directly pointed out (as is the silliness in them condemning one-another), interwoven with the unspoken soul of the nation, the culture, and the magic that seems to radiate from the very soil itself. Pi is a curious child, filled with the confidence and love of all things that can only belong to a child, surely?<br/><br/>A storm claims the freighter, and Pi loses everything. His family, his future, his very world. The only thing that he seems to retain in this cataclysm is his positivity, very-Indian resourcefulness, and a charm you can't really figure out.<br/><br/>Reset to zero, Pi has travelling companions who share his life-raft that happened to survive the crash - an Orang-Utan, a Zebra and a mischievous Hyena. But, as we all know from the trailers - there is a stowaway who quickly makes an appearance<br/><br/>Our Hyena is running amok, and after murdering the rest of their jolly band he turns to Pi. He doesn't get very far before Richard Parker leaps out of the storage compartments and flattens him. Richard Parker?<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the Bengal Tiger.<br/><br/>What follows is a touching, funny and sometimes crushingly despairing tale of a young Indian man following his soul - and becoming a citizen of the planet Earth. In the frame of endless nature in every direction, from beautiful sunsets that mirror on the untouched oceans, to storms that seem to conquer all, this film is about the erosion of cynicism, and the embracing of the magic we all deny ourselves. Can a human being co-exist with a tiger? Can a human being co-exist with the Earth? If we can - would it be a happy marriage?<br/><br/>Ang Lee thinks so, and with the use of truly world-class special effects, including the greatest deployment of 3D I've ever known, we see a tale that has implications for the entire universe unfold. This film is for those who watch ducks, love sunrises or the smell of crisp wintry air. For those who smile at the scene of two magpies, or stop to stroke strange cats. This is a film, presented with cinematography that is more artful than functional, that tries to make you believe that you too, can fall in love with the world you were born in, all over again.<br/><br/>Pi's adventure is a testament to what you can see when you take time to look - so take time to go see this film."

","Wow !!!! I haven't been to a movie that left me stunned at the end since Green mile. I looked around and everybody in the theater was sitting in there seats, momentarily stunned, absorbing the wonder of the movie that we all just experienced. This movie is a must see more than once. I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD, I expect I will watch it three or four more times before I feel like I really understand just how grand it is. The story is exceptional, the acting is amazing and the special FX are nothing short of spectacular !!!! Because of that, it is best first seen on the big screen. I think it's perfect for all ages and an instant classic."
"naveenmdopa","10","6","13","29 November 2012"," Amazing cinematic visuals !!
","First of all this movie is an amazing visual treat. Got the pleasure of watching in 3D IMAX ! and boy did I love it ! Ang lee has proved once again that his story narrating capabilities overshadow (rightly so) whatever glitter feature that is present in his movies (amazing VFX in this one). The movie grips you right till the end and at one point or the other everyone can relate himself with the lead character Pi. That according to me is the ultimate achievement of Ang Lee. Speaking about the VFX, this movie could well set a benchmark for all the 3D movies to follow.The visuals don't engulf the narration rather it complements it.Go watch it now. Treat your eyes to something spectacular !!"
"sharad_hn","10","6","13","29 November 2012"," Art at it's purest form!
","Right from the very first shot till the end of the credits, this movie is engaging, exhilarating, entertaining and most of all heart-touching. The screenplay is vibrant and has the power to glue the audience to the screen. <br/><br/>Ang Lee has done a wonderful job and has made a movie that could be regarded as a classic. Every aspect of this movie is breath-taking. <br/><br/>Each shots have been framed perfectly by the cinematographer, Claudio Miranda. <br/><br/>The whole visual effects team deserve a standing ovation. They have proved that there is a very thin line between reality and dream. In some scenes I couldn't tell apart whether the tiger was real or CGI. <br/><br/>The best part, or the part which I loved the most, was the Original Score by Mychael Danna. The music was fascinating and heart melting. <br/><br/>Every detail about the movie is pitch perfect. A wonderful piece of art."
"eyecandyforu","10","6","13","25 November 2012"," ""And so it is with God""
","Life of Pi is an amazing allegory, that attempts to explain a very abstract concept. This will no doubt confuse many, because it touches on the heart of how we perceive our own spiritual beliefs, it challenges our ideas of religion, the things we have held onto since childhood to give us hope and inspiration. Many people will leave the theater thrilled by a story of a boy who is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger and how they formed a bond that saved them both. The film is vividly colorful, exciting and haunting, masterfully directed by Ang Lee. But, just as we think we've had a rollicking good time with a fantastical story, the last part of the film comes at us, and shakes us up. This is the crucial part of the film, and if audiences choose to ignore this, they miss the entire message of the film. As Jung said ""Man must have his myths"". So it is with God, so it is with Life of Pi."
"pitt-penguin","1","8","19","24 March 2013"," Seinfeld's ""English Patient""
","If you ever saw the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine can't stand the movie ""The English Patient"" yet everyone else does--but cannot explain why--this fits ""Life of Pi"" exactly.<br/><br/>I suppose I am so anti-mystic that this would be inevitable. There are no lessons here for life, nor any enjoyment of watching someone else battle the world. The movie starts out as if it is going to chronicle a ""man against the world"" story. But it progressively becomes untenable to hold on to that idea as weirder and weirder things happen. It became so mystical I could barely stand to watch it. And of ALL THINGS dumb, 10 minutes of the camera focusing on someone talking about what you just saw right in the middle of the movie! BORING!!! You watch a movie to tantalize your eyes--this does not. My kids were asking when this would EVER end."
"gulfisaforever","1","7","16","16 October 2014"," A Disgrace
","I have to say this first. Being an Indian, its shameful that Tabu and Irfan chose to be a part of this THING. ! And the young guy that played Pi, should be served a life time ban from movies. ""Richard Parker, I brought water for you, Richard Parker"" God ! Ang Lee made this? I thought he was a good director. This is the first of his films that I have watched. and I swear I will not see any more of his films in my lifetime.<br/><br/>And that terrible accent. For those of you who don't know, its not how we Indians speak English. Seems Irfan had to imitate the young guys accent for the sake of creating the impression, that he was the grown up version of that awful guy in the boat. I wonder how can anyone relate to this horrible character. I just wished Richard Parker lunged at him and finished him off in a single strike. But the tiger is just as lame as the lead character.<br/><br/>Usually Tigers show up well on screen. But they managed to undo that too. So we get a cartoonish Tiger.<br/><br/>When you see the guy reading out some text on surviving sea wrecks, while riding a raft, having just lost his entire family. and the fact that the director has chosen to devote 10 minutes to all that crap, you know you are in for a nightmarish movie.<br/><br/>The only question, the only emotion that the movie evoked in me was, how could anyone make such a movie, and how did it manage to make the money it made. I am ashamed of being a part of this population of 7+ billion, the majority of which found this movie worthy of praise.<br/><br/>This movie and its story is so dumb, I need to make a few clarifications. Wish they had had the sense of consulting some experts before making a movie on religion and philosophy. The first thing is the vegetarian-turns-meateater sermon. For the record, there are vegetarians and non vegetarians residing peacefully and in harmony in India. But the people who are vegetarians don't try to turn the non-veggies into veggies. and vice versa. Now the point that the movie seems to make. That a boy stranded on a boat without food, abandons being a vegetarian and starts eating fish. Well, its OK for him, he is such a lousy character anyway. I don't mind seeing him eat fish. But you cant use such an example for making ur point. There are people who would rather die of hunger than eat fish. I am not talking about those celebrities who turn to vegetarianism for the sake of their boyfriends/girlfriends, or being fashionable and trendy. <br/><br/>I may write more late on. I conclude for now."
"listofnames","6","7","16","6 January 2013"," Not sure what the fuss is about.
","I'm afraid I must have missed something about this film. And perhaps I really did but there is nothing particularly awe inspiring as you might have been led to believe. For one the grand claim about making you believe in God is never really answered. There is a quick vague nod to it at the end but for me it made no sense. The main story has nothing whatsoever to do with God. So I'm a bit puzzled on that one. There is a bit of a semi twist near the end that I didn't see coming. This reveals an extra dimension to the story that was previously hidden to us. However the impact of the twist is never really brought home in any tangible way (that is quite possibly intentional). You would have to watch the film again to appreciate the twist but like me you will probably not be bothered. <br/><br/>The best thing about the film is the cinematography, visual effects, pi himself, young and old (both characters and both actors)and the various animals. They are sometimes cute and have their own personalities. If you like nature programmes you will enjoy it. The 3D was never spectacular but a nice extra. There are a few gorgeous looking tableau like scenes of the boat on the sea with the skyline. Visually the film looks good throughout. <br/><br/>Pi (younger)is an interesting character. He is intelligent and has a hunger for learning. His strange obsession with gods and religions is quite annoying though (especially for an atheist like me)and seems to serves no purpose for the narrative. I think the film might be trying to say something quite profound about religion but I'm afraid it was either made too subtly or just isn't there at all. Maybe you need to read the book. The actor of the older pi is quite brilliant and very engaging. Very stoic and dignified. <br/><br/>All in all not a bad film but please don't believe the hype! Its a sad story really but the way it ends left me kind of cold and underwhelmed."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","3","5","14 March 2018"," Generally tedious despite visual splendour and an interesting premise.
","Showered with praise upon its initial release mainly for its supposedly ground-breaking visual effects, this ambiguously fantastical survival story falls fairly flat thanks to the fact that, for much of its run-time, it's actually pretty boring and all the spectacular special effects in the world aren't enough to save a piece from sinking if it has the weight of tedium tied around its ankle. Even then, the effects in 'Life Of Pi (2012)' aren't all that impressive and haven't held up nearly as well as many pictures of a similar age (not that old at all I'll add) or even older, as well as including a few odd design decisions, such as evolving aspect ratios, that seem sort of justifiable but ultimately distracting. Its somewhat confusing commentary on spiritualism and the nature of truth is actually a nice conceit, but isn't fully formed enough to warrant its rampant lack of conclusiveness or make up for its inherent failings to tell a griping tale. 5/10"
"wraptin","8","3","5","9 October 2015"," Amazing CGI coupled with a pretty good story
","Life of Pi is a technical masterpiece of computer generated images, or CGI for short. It is leap a of imagination containing deep culturally rich characters, smooth transitions, gorgeous score, and a layered story. From the director Ang Lee, who created Hulk and Brokeback Mountain, comes a triumphant technical masterpiece that is on par with movies like Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and James Cameron's Avatar. Life of Pi is a powerful visual adventure that will have the audience pondering the ending while thoroughly enjoying the journey.<br/><br/>Life of Pi depicts a middle aged Indian man from Pondicherry named Piscine Molitor Patel or Pi for short, portrayed by Irrfan Khan (from Slumdog millionaire and Jurassic World) who shares the story about his tragic struggle of surviving 227 days on a boat lost at sea. Adolescent Pi, son of a zoo keeper (played by novice actor Suraj Sharam who received the part accidentally when accompanying his brother to auditions) tells how his family was planning to move to Winnipeg Canada when his boat was destroyed, leaving Pi as the only human survivor. Left on the life boat, he is accompanied by a severely injured zebra, an orangutan named orange juice who seems to have lost her offspring, a conniving hyena and a Bengali tiger that due to a clinical error is named ""Richard Parker"", who all travel on a spatial journey with Pi.<br/><br/>Life of Pi's strongest scene would be Pi's childhood and how he was named Piscine Molitor after a French swimming pool, causing other children to make fun of his name because it sounded like ""Pissing Patel"". Through creative ingenuity, he convinces the kids at school to shorten his name to Pi Patel, and this opening serves as a strong hook for the Life of Pi. The scene with middle aged Pi retelling his story intertwined with his flashbacks does not break the viewer's emersion as it is seamlessly connected through cross fading. It also gives the cruel backstory that will be needed to understand the boat scene later in the film.<br/><br/>The story of the tiny life boat seems intertwined with the many symbols of faith and man verses the environment. The notions of strength, courage, survival and the struggle of faith in Pi's life are present throughout the film. Before the crash, Pi claims to be not only Hindu like his father and family but also a practicing Muslim and Christian, which is a very interesting character trait. Throughout Pi's 227 day journey, God comes to help him in many different forms. Ang Lee captures and presents a full range of the many forms that God takes in this movie, from the giant whale breaching the surface of the water to the mystical island populated by meerkats. Life of Pi from the get-go lets the audience know that it is going to be an adventure that ""makes you believe in God."" Special mention goes to Rhythm & Hues Studio who created the visual effects for the movie, Life of Pi. Without the hard work of the men and woman working on special effects, Life of Pi would have failed to reach its full potential. For the majority of the movie, the tiger, Richard Parker, was created using CGI. However, for the scenes where they did splice footage of the real tiger and the CGI tiger, it became hard to distinguish between the two. In the behind the scenes, it is revealed that the computer had to render 2 million different hairs to make the tiger feel realistic, which is a technical feat. Some other noticeable uses of CGI in the film are the large bioluminescent whale, the swarm of flying fish leaping from the depths below, the ominous island of the meerkats, the crisp blue water and the clear sky. These were all key set pieces that would have left Life of Pi empty if they had been executed poorly or just left out. Overall, the CGI magic used creates beautiful visualization of isolation and faith.<br/><br/>The Academy has recognized Life of Pi with many achievements and awarded four Oscars for cinematography, original score, visual effects and directing. I would highly recommend this film to almost anyone who has yet to see it and for people to re-watch it with information that is presented at the end of the movie. However, I would suggest to those who cannot stand movies that rely on CGI effects and characters that deal with isolation to avoid this movie. But other than that, Life of Pi is a technical master piece that should not be missed out on."
"ironhorse_iv","9","3","5","27 July 2013"," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Lagan. This movie is fun to watch. It's easy like Pi.
","Written by Yann Martel, Life of Pi was one of those novels that most filmmakers thought was un-filmable. The reasons why are because 'Life of Pi' deals with the main character grew up trying to find the ultimate truth of life by questioning different religions and aspires to find that ultimate truth one day. Life of Pi is about seeing the world through Pi's eyes. This is precisely why it's strongly called an un-filmable book because it's almost impossible to visualize on screen the combined feeling of every sight of the amazing spectacles that the ocean can show an young adult like Pi and how they take him closer to the answers for his questions. But, Directed Ang Lee succeeded in making this movie amazing. This movie visuals are amazing. Epic cinematography by Claudio Miranda. Ang Lee was able to make the near lifeless seem boring Pacific Ocean into a wondering trip into self-discovery and survivable. The 3D actually work, and wasn't cheesy at all. I love the soundtrack by Mychael Danna, it was beautiful to listen with the film. Life of Pi just had such a rich story. On the outside, it's basic. A castaway, kind of film. But Ang brings brilliant timing to the film which makes it emotional and strong. It's confusing at times and sometimes feels slow, but you forget about that because the movie is something that has good meaning, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Life of Pi is very faithful to the book, I'd suggest reading first, but anyways most of the film is about a young man name Piscine 'Pi' Patel who father own a zoo. Suraj Sharma plays Pi in his film debut and what a debut, he was great in the film. The scene where he kill the fish was emotional. Anyways, Pi and his family decide to travel to Canada for a better life, and hopefully make money selling the zoo animals. Too bad, nobody makes it beside Pi who survives a disaster at sea when his ship sank leaving him in a lifeboat with four animals on board. There is a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan named Orange Juice. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger name Richard Parker. Unlike, other human & animal relationship movies, that has the character befriend a wild animal to the point, it seem like it's a pet. This movie doesn't do that; at all. Most of the movie has Richard Parker wanting to eat the Indian boy. It wasn't until Pi establish himself as the alpha male that Richard Parker became less of a danger to him. I have to say the CGI tiger was the most realistic computer animal, I have ever saw. Good job! Still, Pi and Richard Parker must now learn to survive this harsh new world. For a PG film, it pretty dark with themes of cannibalism. Research Richard Parker and shipwrecks online. Some critics says it has warning about the dangers of increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and ocean acidification, but I really don't see that in this film. I do like the Gaia hypothesis that some critics point out. I can see it. Without spoiling too much of the film, I have to say that the movie is really good. Still, it took a while for the film to get to the sinking scene with all the attempts at spirituality. While, I did love the scenes explaining who Pi is like the whole French swimming pool story, and Pi looking for religion and love. I just wish it didn't take so long to explain because I think the best part of the movie are the relationship with him and the tiger. I do love the idea that most of the narration coming from middle age Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to the novelist Yann Martel (Rafe Spall). Irrfan Khan gives one of his best acting here. I love the scene, where he explains what happen to Richard Parker. I was deeply surprised he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award for this role. I do hate the fact that Yann Martel plagiarism the idea from Brazilian writer and physician Moacyr Scliar 1981's novel 'Max and the Cats'. Still, I think Life of Pi is a little bit better than 'Max and the Cats'. I have readt both in doing my research for the film. I just glad the director cut the state of delirium scene from the book. The twist in the end was so moving and truthful. It marked how humans are in fact like animals and also gave an alternative to the basic perception of life; do you chose to view life through science and reason, or religion. The movie is deeply religionists, but it didn't bug me like other critics. I love the symbolism of the island of algae. It represents the atheist mindset that we eat till death and we get consumed by the world itself in the end and nothing matters, a bleek future. I myself, as an agnostic, I understand the brute cruelty meaningless of this world. Raw matter organized itself with an organic backbone and over the course of billions of years of improvement, it emerged to artificially build a society upon all that nothingness. I agree, it's best to remain agnostic because you have no concrete answers about the universe. Atheism is a form of concluding one's mind, not a fan. Overall: The thing I like about this movie is that whichever story you believe, your right and both a physically possible whether you believe the literal or metaphorical meaning it is both equally plausible."

Add to that the drama and sense of adventure and survival as he is stranded at sea with some animals and eventually the tiger, Richard Parker. Throw in some fantasy and exquisite cinematography with the nighttime scenes especially. And the cherry on top? The message of faith but not in a preachy way. I think some have tried to read into the religious aspect maybe too much in reading other reviews. This film IMO was generalizing to suit a purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out.

Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story."

I personally believe that the story happened with people which makes the animal story so much nicer, even though it was certainly hard to imagine sharing a boat with wild animals in the first place.

It left me feeling somewhat depressed that everything I had watched for the past hour and a half was simply a coping mechanism invented by a very traumatized individual. Much darker than the trailers or marketing campaigns made it to be. I don't get the hype whatsoever. I agree that it deserved Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects at The Oscars, but how in the world did Ang Lee win Best Director over Steven Spielberg? Much of the work was done for him be effects crews. The effects alone make this movie an 8 or a 9, but the story being a 4 or a 5 out of 10 just bring it down. Very disappointed."

"itamarscomix","9","4","8","3 March 2013"," A fantastic voyage
","The little I knew about Life of Pi before seeing it - a young Indian man is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger - couldn't in any way prepare me for what I was about to see. The truly amazing thing is that that's pretty much all there is to it. Ang Lee weaves an incredible amount of emotion and depth into a very minimalistic, poetic story, and for that reason Life of Pi may be the most impressive cinematic achievement of the year - it's true cinema, a film that doesn't rely on a complex plot, shocking twists or tons of characters, but simply on coherent, free-flowing storytelling, beautiful images and utter precision. There's not a wasted minute or an unnecessary shot - the special effects are impressive but always subtle enough to leave center stage for the story. The film is incredibly easy to get into, it's constantly interesting, it's simple yet deep, and it leaves a lasting impression and plenty of room for debate - really, what more can you want from a film? <br/><br/>Ang Lee is proving time after time that while he hasn't become a brand name like Spielberg and Tarantino, he's one of the most fascinating directors working today, mainly because he doesn't make the same film twice; Life of Pi is a perfect example to use when demonstrating how important a director is, and how much a good director can do with a very lean and (on the surface) plain script. Lee always had an eye for beautiful imagery, though, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography in Life of Pi makes for some of the most beautiful yet; not only the bulk of the film that takes place in the middle of the ocean and is dominated by CGI, but also the live action segments, especially the first thirty minutes. The opening sequence in particular is one of the most gorgeous I've seen in years, and while watching it in 3D makes the immersion a bit quicker, it's by no means essential and it's impossible to not get lost in the film, no matter how you watch it.<br/><br/>A quick word on religion: I've heard about some people who avoid Life of Pi because, as atheists, they reject the religious undertones. I'm a devout atheist myself, and enjoyed it immensely, and I encourage other atheists to watch it too. The film has a spiritual undertone, yes, but it doesn't force salvation down the viewer's throat like some other films. In fact, I don't recall seeing another film that made me feel so sympathetic towards believers; it portrays religion in an ambivalent, affectionate yet critical way, and it leaves quite a lot up to the viewer's interpretation. It also makes a point of showing that, while religion has its purposes and can be of great help to people in tough situations, the division and hate between believers in different brands of religion is the thing that messes everything up, which is a message that I, as an atheist, related to. All religion, Life of Pi says, is pretty much the same - it's a way of coloring reality, of making it easier to handle and seeing the beautiful side of it. Like stories, and like films. Life of Pi is an ode to storytellers, be they Pi, the originators of religion or Ang Lee itself, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of storytelling you'll see."

","As soon as The Life of Pi started and the opening scene unfolded i was drawn in and i stayed there for the entire movie. I cant recall a single moment in this film where i was not engaged and on many levels. From the beginning there was a point and a meaning. I felt that i was discovering something special throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Director Ang Lee has captured a magic in this film. Suraj Sharma as Pi the cast away was truly authentic. Irrfan Khan was subtle and mesmerizing as adult Pi. A brilliant screen play and amazing CGI made this a film experience i have not had for sometime. The incredible thing about The Life of Pi is that its able to encompass all the complexities of faith and religion in a story that seems so simple in it conclusion. <br/><br/>I didn't see Life of Pi in 3D but i was simply blown away by the beauty of the story and that is that faith is a matter of choice."
"jtindahouse","7","4","8","18 February 2013"," Quite the discussion raiser
","Just before I left to see Life of Pi my cat had found a mouse in the garage. It got me to thinking about the food chain and the frailty of life. But it also got me to thinking about why we value one life so differently from the next. Something as simple as the size of an animal can determine how much we care for that animal. No one gives it a second thought if they find a mouse dead in the street, but if they come across a giraffe or an elephant, (which probably have a fifth of the character) in the same state, it'll bother them to no end. It was an amazing coincidence for me then, when the movie had an element of these themes about it too. It took it even further making us question one's faith and even questioning the legitimacy of what we've just seen.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is told from the point of view of the main character Pi Patel, many years after he was the survivor of a sunken ship and spent 227 days at sea accompanied by a ferocious tiger. The story has a lot of similarities with Cast Away, the most obvious probably being the sole relationship of an unexpected companion. In Cast Away it was a volleyball, here it is a tiger. While it is a necessary plot device to have these ""characters"" in the story, it is also fascinating to see just how close and reliant the main character becomes on them. Something that I imagine would actually genuinely be the case if you were in that situation.<br/><br/>The cinematography is astonishing throughout and seeing it in 3D (even though I'm not the biggest fan of the format) was just the icing on the cake. This is a tough film to review because it leaves itself very open to interpretation. The message boards are flooded with questions and every answer to them is unique and of a slightly different opinion. Ang Lee has done well in keeping this a talked about and debated piece of cinema. I have my own opinions on most of the questions too, but to throw them out there now would be wrong. It could lead you to come to a conclusion you wouldn't otherwise have come to and it would also ruin a bit of what is fun about the ending. Go in with an open mind, form your own opinions and then take the time to read some other people's ones too. Life of Pi can be as much fun after the film as it is during."
"biffyclyrolover","10","4","8","13 February 2013"," I Actually Want To See It In 3D!!!!!
","All right people, I'm going to say it loud and clear right now. I thought this movie was awesome. Now, this is a film that talks about religion and I am an atheist. In this film, Pi has adopted all religions and treats them equally. However, many prats on IMDb have perceived this thought provocation as religious propaganda and have evaluated the film just based solely on that single thing. I say to all other reviewers out there, review this film as a whole. Look beyond the religious messages and look at it as a film. Now let's get this underway.<br/><br/>The Good: The cast. Since there is really only three actors to really focus on here who played main characters, let's look at them. Young Pi, played by Suraj Sharma, is one of the best teenage actors ever, in my opinion. His acting is top notch throughout this film, from the time they move from India right up to his discovery on the beaches of Mexico. He has certainly got a big jump early in his career. He plays his character well and that's good enough for me. Irffan Khan, who was also in Slumdog Millionaire, is also very likable as Old Pi. His eyes are filled with wisdom and he treats everyone as equals. His narration throughout the story is nice and calm and adds a lot. And Rafe Spall is pretty damn good as Yann Martel, the writer of the book. As well as this, there's also a small cameo from Gerard Depardieu as the cook.<br/><br/>The story. This story is mind blowing. A true testament to cinema. Ang Lee took all the elements of the book and seemed to evolve them somewhat. As well as this, everyone likes a good story of survival, especially when it has a teenage boy and a tiger having to share a lifeboat together. It also takes an interview style, so the narrative from the books is also included. This is a really amazing adaptation.<br/><br/>The CGI, special effects and visuals. I'm not going to lie, this is the best CG I have ever seen from any film. Ang Lee just knows how to make interesting visuals and with that said this film has some of the most beautiful visuals in the history of cinema. Lord of the Rings geographic shots? Nope, this beats it. The Fifth Element's future New York? Beaten. That is how good the visuals were. The sea, the night sky and dawn all look amazing. This is in fact one of those films where I wish I saw it in 3D! The CGI Tiger. Richard Parker (Yeah, that's the tiger's name) is the best CGI creature ever created. There are shots of real tigers in the beginning of the film and to be honest, there really wasn't much of a difference between the CG and the real thing. As well as this, the tiger is a really good character and this is because he doesn't talk. This isn't Sher Khan from the Jungle Book, no; this is a true adult Bengal tiger with razor sharp teeth. And this is important because the relationship between the boy and the tiger is the driving point of the film. There were several interesting parts where Pi tried different techniques to get on the boat but finally realises he needs to teach the tiger respect in order to be accepted. These were unpredictable moments as the animal is unpredictable. Richard Parker is now probably one of my all-time favourite animal characters.<br/><br/>The thought provoking moments. This is a story where Pi says that it will ""make you believe in God."" I thought to myself ""bring it on"" but as it progressed I saw the angle Lee was going for. And arguably, it is the film's greatest strength. Lee wanted the audience to go out questioning the different concepts of religion. For example, does one have to stick to one religion or can they choose multiple ones? I went out and thought to myself, ""I actually don't know."" The film doesn't give you the answer, unlike many other movies, but instead allows you to think for yourself, as an individual, as to what you think is right. And that is really awesome when a movie can have that effect on someone.<br/><br/>The Bad:  I actually can't think of anything bad to say.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 Instant Classic. This is a testament to adapted movies and film in general. This is truly a great film, probably the best of 2012 (But I still have Zero Dark Thirty, Django Unchained and Lincoln to see, so bear that in mind). Great acting, great story, great visuals and leaves you with more questions than answers. Oh, and Richard Parker is awesome. I want a t-shirt of his face now! Instant Classic."

","The Life of Pi is a wonderful movie adaptation of the book by the author Yann Martel. The movie beautifully shows us that in times of need, the Animal in us will help us survive, but we have to take care to not let it overpower our human nature completely. This is when most people look to God and their beliefs.<br/><br/>Just like the irrational number ""Pi"", faith in God is an uncertain field in itself, but believing in it helps people cope with that uncertainty and see the best in everything.<br/><br/>In The Life of Pi, ""Pi"" Patel retold his Survival story in a glorious, mystical manner so as to portray a fascinating image of his adventure. His narrative holds beauty and wonder over the cold, ruthless experience he had to undergo. And just like in the case of God, it's our choice to believe in the better story. Beautiful."

","This film is cinematically stunning. We watched in on the big screen in a small theater in 3D. How many of the scenes were artificially created really doesn't matter, it was artistically phenomenal. Usually I'm not the type that likes lingering scenes in movies as I'm thinking ""come on, let's get on with the story."" But in this case, the artistry of the scenes make the movie. But the story is not solid enough to engage me on a small 2D screen. At least I don't think so. As an example, it doesn't matter where in the story I pop in on Moneyball on the movie channel, I end up watching it to the end. The acting and the story is great. I think I could listen to it with no picture. Life of Pi requires the picture. I did not read the book, but I suspect the same is true of the book in describing scenes in such a way that eclipses the story. My recommendation is to catch it on a big screen, but not sure I'd recommend it on a small screen."
"jcmann01","8","4","8","25 January 2013"," My interpretation of the Life of Pi
","Warning: This review does contains spoilers, but PLEASE come back after seeing movie and then read it.<br/><br/>I saw the Life of Pi, in which the author attempts to make a few deeper points known about ""What the Truth is,"" whether it be something that is easily believable with our minds or something that you just have to take on faith. In the end, the question is left up to the viewer to decide for themselves. In the movie, Pi, tells the writer that he was going to get him to believe in God by the end of the story, but this is left somewhat mysterious when all is said and done in the movie.<br/><br/>So, I will attempt to interpret what Pi was wanting to convey in the movie. I believe that intention here was to present 2 different stories about events that took place. The first story was what Pi actually experienced, but was so incredible, it sounded like he had made it up to cover his pain. The second story sounded more believable because it made sense, but much doubt was eventually cast on it. In the end the first story was prevailed as being the truth, which had to be taken by faith.<br/><br/>MY Theological Interpretation:<br/><br/>Over the centuries the Bible, in which the stories have been passed down from generation to generation were believed so much that this country's education system was based on the Bible during the 17th century. Now a days, with scientific points of view prevailing, much of the Bible is regarded by many as mere folklore stores that were told around fires and unbelievable to the questioning and the scoffers. So some take it upon themselves to create religions that may seem more believable and rationale to the majority. So they write books explaining the Bible to their followers.<br/><br/>Many have mocked the story of Moses crossing the Red Sea and being very exaggerated, but now we have archaeological evidence of it's truth and still, many refuse to believe the truth. Like Pi's stories, there can only be one truth that prevails in the end and that is what actually happened and not what made sense to those who listen. It is also interesting to note that Pi's life was preserved over the ocean for 270 days with a fierce Tiger and yet he survived the ordeal, which is a credit to Psalm 91.<br/><br/>Hebrews 11:6 says that without faith, it is impossible to please God. What this means is that God will not reveal himself to the faithless and those who constantly question His Word. Christians have a responsibility to give their testimony before the world, but like the 2 Japanese guys, the world fails to believe their testimony of the truth, but would prefer to believe in something that makes more sense to their minds.<br/><br/>PS It is by no coincidence that the character was named Pi, because their is no finite answer to this equation if you try to reason it out with your mind."

","Ang Lee's latest film Life Of Pi which is based of the international best selling book. The movie is set around the story of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) a teenage boy who Is the son of a Zoo owner. He is unusual. He follows every religion and believes them all even though his mother says he can only have one. When his parents tell him and his brother that the family are moving and selling the animals. On their new journey the families boat with the animals on it sinks. The only known survivor is Pi who wakes up on a life boat. On the life boat is a Hyena, Orangatang, A zebra and under the covers a Tiger. I will tell no more. For me to tell more would take a way from the shock of this movie. This movie is all about the Animal Kingdom. It's a battle out there between animals. They all eat each other and couldn't care less. But they do have feelings, for certain. The movie has amazing effects. Some of the best you'll see all year. It is the best movie I've seen all year. From reading this it might not sound like it but the story is heart breaking and thought provoking. There is a twist in this movie that I'd never ruin for anyone! It makes you go ""no way"" it's that good! There are scenes of very disturbing consequences. You'll turn away from the screen as it all unfolds! The story is just so detailed and well wrote that you are captivated. Pi spends over 6 months on the boat and must learn to survivor with the animals. There are loads of events in this movie which are all happening very quickly. The 3-D is brilliant. Some of the best since Avatar. The movie is just hard to explain and to tell. You can't simply review this movie without ruining it. It's just that good! It's amazing! You won't feel anything like you did all year like you did I'm this one. Maybe if your a Comic freak you'll disagree but for me it just had me from the get go. It's just...Wow!"
"pimvandenheuvel1989","8","4","8","23 January 2013"," Beautiful Visuals and Such
","Life of Pi is a really beautiful movie, with dreamy visuals.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I thought; Not another story with animals that will eventually talk. But it looked beautiful so I went to the cinema.<br/><br/>It felt like a relaxing movie to watch. I was really curious in how the story would progress. Luckely no animals where talking. I like this sort of 'cast away' type of movie. I really felt his misery. And that because it's a great actor. Suraj Sharma. According to IMDb this is his first movie. If that's the case, then this is going to be a really great actor.<br/><br/>Then you have the interviewer. I think he's is cast wrong. He acted like a douchebag. I guess it is necessary in some parts because he is not paying a full 100% of attention to adult Pi.<br/><br/>3D and Visuals: This movie was very beautiful. And 3D made it better. And with 'It' I mean the amazing depth of field. The first time I noticed this was at the title sequence. I kept wondering how they put the text behind the elephant. But like in every other 3D movie, U get used to it after a while. But it still was great. When the boat was sinking in the storm the 3D effects looked very realistic. And all the animals too. I kept thinking to myself through the whole movie; ""How did they film this. Where is the green-screen?"". I still don't know if the animals are real or fake. That's movie magic for ya.<br/><br/>GOD-PART: It did not take long for PI to talk about religion. Pi is curious in more then one religion. That's all fine with me. A kid needs to find out himself. That's actually very great about the family he grows up with. In the real world religious parents will force there belief upon there kids when they are born. But not in this movie, because his dad is atheist. I like that. But they kept talking about ""finding god"". I have never seen or noticed any sign of god in the whole movie. Maybe I'm not getting an extra meaning behind all that he sees.<br/><br/>I have seen it 2 times know. And that's enough for now."
"Manal1987","10","4","8","22 January 2013"," The Universe Inside
","""Krishna opens his mouth, and Yashoda gasps she sees in Krishna's mouth the whole complete entire timeless universe!""<br/><br/>The following is a story Pi's mother recounts to him as a kid. The young god Krishna was wrongly accused of eating a bit of dirt. When his foster mother, Yashoda, knows about it, she scolds him and orders him to open his mouth, inside which she sees the whole universe; lands and skies, planets and galaxies, past and future, hopes and fears everything.<br/><br/>This religious Hindu story should be kept at the back of your mind throughout the entire film for it sets ups the stage for Pi's life. The movie starts with the adult Pi Patel who narrates to a novelist his own survival adventure; how he survived a violent shipwreck in which he lost his entire family and his father's zoo animals, and how he managed to coexist with a Bengal tiger for weeks on a stranded lifeboat. The story of Pi, originally written by Yann Martel and adapted to screen by David Magee, succeeds in stripping the confusing issue of faith down to its core. Pi, the result of a world which is part secular (the father) and part shyly religious (the mother), represents the modern man with all his anxiety, confusion and questions. The young Pi could feel a greater power controlling the universe even though he could not place or define this power. That is why he became a Hindu, a Christian, and a Muslim, all at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie is dense with symbolic cues that will need to be revisited and reconsidered every time you ponder on Pi's adventure. First of all, we are told that the Bengal tiger is called Richard Parker because its original name, Thirsty, was swapped with the name of its hunter in the registers. When young Pi gets attached to Richard, his atheist father feels obliged to prove to him that Richard is merely a beast and that it is not soul that he sees in the tiger's eyes but only a reflection of his own emotions. Whether the tiger had a soul or was only a reflected image of Pi is left to the viewer to decide. Moreover, Pi's adventure in the sea can be interpreted as man's journey through life, full of hopes, hardships, miracles and letdowns. Everything Pi encounters helps in his emotional, spiritual, and intellectual growth. However, what makes Pi different is that he manages to live life and see (and make us see as well!) the universe as reflected inside him.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is absolutely brilliant. It gives place for both doubt and belief equally because, as Pi puts it, ""doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested."" After the shipwreck, the hypo-narrative (Pi's adventure) gets divided into two parallel, if not opposite, stories; one is miraculous and incredible, and the other is gruesome yet realistic. The adult Pi gives us the freedom to choose between the two because, according to him, both stories entail the same amount of suffering and sacrifice and have the same result and choosing to believe in one of them depends on the person's internal universe. Simply put, in any given moment of your life, you have all the reasons to be happy and you have all the reasons to be sad.. it is you who chooses, and it is you who writes the story. And this is how faith works. This is how God works.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is certainly Ang Lee's masterpiece so far; thoughtful direction, celestial cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and mature and vivid performance by both Suraj Sharma, who masterfully captured Pi's earlier years of confusion and restlessness, and Irrfan Khan who played the adult Pi with sincere, hard-earned maturity and confidence. The film is relatively long, but there is not a single moment you will feel the slightest tinge of boredom throughout this completely immersive experience.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is a feast for both the mind and the eye. A definitely must- see."
"Staffenburgen","9","4","8","15 January 2013"," A Beautifully Crafted Film
","Wow. That's really the only word that comes to mind. Watching this for the first time a few days ago, I found myself in a perpetual state of awe; this movie is an absolute work of art. This will be a short review, since it's virtually impossible to say much without giving anything away. <br/><br/>The film starts with a small introduction into the life of Pi. It explains exactly how he came to have that name, and how he came to be stranded in the middle of the ocean in only the company of a fierce Bengal tiger. The rest of the story that ensues is absolutely top-notch; I really can't give this film enough praise. The narrative is extremely visceral and interpretive, filled to the brim with symbolism, and the conclusion is very satisfying.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, I was thoroughly impressed. The lead actor is very strong here; he is the only actor on screen for almost a full hour in the middle, and he knocks it out of the park. <br/><br/>Now, the truly incredible part. This film is shot in spectacular 3D and I have never seen it used better. Seriously. People in the theater were literally gasping in awe as some of the more engaging visuals flashed on the screen. The viewer is completely immersed; you feel like you're a part of Pi's universe, stranded right there with him on that boat.<br/><br/>This is one of the year's best films. It's as simple as that. I give it my highest recommendation. <br/><br/>RATING: 9/10"
"dfle3","9","4","8","15 January 2013"," A compelling story. 85+%
","I can't say that I was very excited to see this movie but I thought I'd give it a shot and found it very rewarding. In fact, it has repeat viewing value, given the ending. What surprised me most, perhaps, was the wit and humour in the dialogue. <br/><br/>Not having read the book on which it was based, I have nothing else to compare it to, and found the story worked well as a spectacle...of which there are many.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the story concerns the life and adventures of Pi Patel. We see him as a small boy and as an adult recounting the adventure most of us would be familiar with via the commercials for this film...himself as a teenager (played well by Suraj Sharma) adrift at sea, with a wild tiger as both a constant threat to him yet a constant but uneasy companion. Most of the movie is set at sea and here the cinematography (which I saw in 3D) is absolutely magnificent. You really do feel a sense of the infinite as Pi drifts endlessly on an endless ocean. Even some of the urban settings in Pi's childhood do have a wonderful picture postcard quality to them.<br/><br/>Another contender for most surprising aspect to this movie was the theme of religion. I just did not expect this to be part of this movie, for whatever reason. In a way the movie is about religion. Or stories. A story about stories, in other words. Some professional reviews do mention the issue of how to interpret the movie. Maybe it is a parable? Could it be like a dream, requiring Freud to make sense of it? In these interpretative strategies there is the problem of mapping one thing from the sea adventure to some other thing from Pi's ordinary life. And doing that to account for everything. The desire to do so is powerful but the adult Pi does comment near the end of the movie about the merits of this procedure.<br/><br/>Some professional reviews I've seen criticise the narrative device of having an adult Pi interviewed by a writer. Since I don't know whether this was in the book or not, I can say that it wasn't so much of an issue for me. There was a concern before I saw this movie that it might come across like one of Kamahl's commercials for a certain brand of tea, but it worked well for me. The writer (played by Rafe Spall) functions as an 'everyman' asking the kind of questions the curious audience might want to ask. Being a literal minded person, I did really appreciate the writer's attempt to interpret Pi's sea adventure...it is that titbit of information which gives the movie repeat viewing value...I had expected to give this movie 80%, but it's this potential repeat viewing value which bumps my score up to 85+%.<br/><br/>Special mention should be given to the special effects in this movie. It's great. Having this volatile mix of carnivores and herbivores on Pi's boat interact with each other in a believable way was admirably achieved. At times the tiger seemed to be a CGI creation, but maybe I was wrong on that? It's very rare that you think these special effects don't feel quite right.<br/><br/>It was a surprise to me to see so many young children watching this movie at the cinema. Appropriately, perhaps, the animal life cycle was sanitised on the boat...there is no great gore to speak of, but there are some dark themes verbalised at the end of the movie, which makes me wonder how suitable it is for children. But that darkness houses felt pain, which was another rewarding aspect to this film. It has great humanity.<br/><br/>Whilst a movie like ""Seven psychopaths"" is my pick as the most entertaining movie for the year, I don't think I would be allowed to pick that as my choice for best movie. ""Life of Pi"" seems a more intellectual choice to make and I do feel that an award for the best movie of the year would be well deserved, along with awards for cinematography. Ang Lee deserves a nomination for direction too. Suraj Sharma is also worthy of a nomination. <br/><br/>This movie is a wonderful spectacle but the tale has hidden depth to it, which makes it ripe for revisiting and seeing it anew. Which viewing would explain the meaning of the movie best? That is the question. When Pi's father states his preference for the scientific story of life, I do wonder whether the movie agrees with him or not...or if there is truth in any story...just preferences for one story over another. Was the other story Pi told the writer true?"

","Life of Pi is a beautiful film that can be understood on several levels. The first level contains more of less a fairytale of an boy and some animals who survived a shipwreck. Another level shows the adventures character. So far so good, because it is very entertaining and very interesting images can be seen. On another level however,this picture is about the depth of the soul. Not only with this boy Pi, but it will be clear that his soul is as transprant and yet as dark at the same time as any soul can be.

","This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker. Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual. I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer). A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but thru it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination.

","Ang Lee, the Taiwanese director of films such as Sense and Sensibility (2000) and Lust Caution (2007), has decided to give his latest maturely themed feature the visual aesthetic of a charming children's adventure tale. As such, all trailers, posters and inattentively viewed clips of the film make it seem like the perfect holiday fodder for little ones. The parents who brought their toddlers to the session of Life of Pi that I went to weren't entirely incorrect in their assumptions. It is a magical movie, it does tell a fanciful story, and the effect on its audience is altogether uplifting, but the fantastical element is laid on top of a hard, heavy realism that pokes through more than one might expect. The real world isn't blocked out of the piece like an escapist kid's film: it is contrasted against the spiritual fantasy as a way of showing, not telling, its audience why people turn to religion even when modern science seems to constantly conflict with it.<br/><br/>Young Pi Patel (played by Gautam Belur, and then Ayush Tandon as an 11- to-12-year-old) has been fascinated by religion since he tried to vandalise a catholic church in rural India, where he and his family own an extensive zoo, and encountered astonishing Christian forgiveness. Since then he has also become a Muslim, and confounded his strict father (Adil Hussain) and the young author (Rafe Spall) that he relates his tale too, which we see in extended flashbacks, with his apparent juvenile miscomprehension that is actually an insightful observation that Hinduism, Islamism and Christianity all really achieve the same end, and simply imagine God in different forms. The interspersed scenes between the reminiscing adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) and the curious writer mostly feel as artificial and unnecessary as such setups always are, with the exception of the protagonist's poignant account of the melancholy end to his relationship with Richard Parker, the fierce but magnificent tiger that everyone has seen on the posters, and his introductory proclamation to the writer that this is a story that will make him believe in God, and I suppose there needs to be someone there for him to say this to, but anyone would do.<br/><br/>It takes a surprisingly long time for the teenage Pi (played extraordinarily well by first-timer Suraj Sharma) to be on the lifeboat alone with Richard out on the open ocean wearing a turban, there being a considerable early portion of the film devoted to his family life, but the introduction of the prevalent theme of spirituality runs throughout and the bloodthirsty beauty of the big cat are crucial elements that come from these scenes. Even the mundane, but still mildly interesting, family exchanges, depictions of his school life – where we discover the amusing origin of his name – and a mercifully brief, obligatory romantic sub-plot, are necessary to again show us, not tell us, of his pain when he loses all of this in a shipwreck at about the halfway-point, and begins a compelling and visually stunning fight for his life against the elements, and the astonishingly realised tiger. All of the animals in the film are totally convincing, but it is especially impressive that all sides of the this incredible predator – his strength, his hunger, his nobility, his desperation, his feline grace – are all captured so beautifully, making the multi-faceted symbiotic relationship between the animal and his keeper so totally engrossing. <br/><br/>Their gruelling search for land is depicted warts, and quite a few of those hideous warts, which may have been even more unrestrainedly gritty in the original novel by Yann Martel, were quickly driving all of those toddlers out of the cinema before any of them could discover how Pi's tale could defrost a person's rigid atheism, and a good thing too. The trick doesn't lie in his miraculous survival – that would have probably lost the other, older half of the underage audience – but in the very grisly, hard-hitting alternative ""real"" version of events that Pi tells a pair of reporters that don't believe the version we've seen, which is very reminiscent of John Steinbeck's Lifeboat, for which the fantastical tale seems to be an allegory. When Pi asks, ""So which story do you prefer?"" the hearts of both us and the writer of course unhesitatingly answer ""the one with the tiger,"" before our brains can interfere with shallow logical cynicism.<br/><br/>While not for very little ones, parents should certainly take children past their single-digit years to see this wonderful telling of a robust but wondrous story of biblical beauty."

They were headed towards Canada to sell off their animals and start a new life, but a horrific storm wiped out the entire crew. Pi is stranded alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named 'Richard Parker'.<br/><br/>The core of the story is how Pi manages to co-exist with Richard Parker in the harsh environment of the Pacific, with limited supplies, no help in sight, and unpredictable weather. <br/><br/>The movie is an artistic delight. Fantastic visuals (The best use of 3D visuals since Avatar), amazing storytelling, good plot-line, and compelling camera-work. The narration was largely visual. With only one human survivor, the story couldn't be pulled through conversations. I expected a voice-over accompaniment throughout the movie, which would have been the easy way out. However, it went without the voice-over, like the 2000 movie Castaway - and this allowed the audience to drink in the vast emptiness and loneliness that perseveres through the movie.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, but straightforward. This is possibly why the twist at the end of the story took me completely by surprise. I won't give out spoilers, but a subtle twist that leaves something ambiguous puts an entirely different shade to the whole experience.

"gbacquet","9","4","8","5 January 2013"," A truly extraordinary adventure
","Amidst movies like The Hobbit, Jack Reacher and Skyfall, all packed with action, fighting, shooting, killing and breaking, comes ""Life of Pi"", from director Ang Lee, someone who brings a different kind of cinema to audiences.<br/><br/>I should tell you that I'm a fan of Ang Lee's and he's only let me down once (Hulk, anyone?), but I went into this film with an open mind and ready for whatever came my way.<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" follows the life of Pi Patel from his very early childhood to his grown up years as he tells it to a writer interested in his unusual life story. We get a glimpse of Patel's life as a boy in India, his relationship with his parents, brother, God and.....animals. As a teenager and after surviving a shipwreck, Patel will experience loss, faith and the loss of it as well, but he will also develop a bond with a Bengal tiger that will change and shape him forever, and challenge everything he knew about life.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is spent in showing this relationship and its effects in the leading character. Nothing can really prepare you for what's in store for you: I suggest you abandon any preconceptions you might have and simply enjoy the experience because as simple as it sounds, this story is absolutely surprising and there's no way to tell where it will go and how it will end.In fact, the characters in the movie didn't know it either and this helps your own disbelief.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film is a visual feast. Unlike some other visually stunning films, however, the effects here are used to tell a story and to actually enhance it, not to dazzle the audience with outstanding visual effects. As beautiful as it is, the story is the most compelling part and though it might not be 100% original (we've seen movies of human befriending animals before), I guarantee you, as a movie junkie that I am, that you have never seen one like this; I think the fact that the protagonist is Indian and the director Taiwanese helps this film to be culturally and philosophically very different to what we're used to and this factor made the experience all the more rewarding. <br/><br/>As a side note, this movie is ideal for families: the movie theater was full of kids and they all enjoyed it. There are no scary scenes, no brutality, no cursing: just life, with its share of sadness, love and happiness.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best film of the year, but I can say for sure that you will not see another film that even slightly resembles this one in terms of story, visuals and life lessons. Go see it, you won't regret it."
"dfranzen70","8","4","8","5 January 2013"," Breathtaking visuals complement provocative tale
","In Life of Pi, Ang Lee's philosophical spectacle, makes for a fascinating viewing, succeeding on multiple levels of enjoyment. There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism. <br/><br/>Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.<br/><br/>The animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.<br/><br/>The tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.<br/><br/>Of great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by. <br/><br/>If you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.<br/><br/>In the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope."

","Wow. Simply, Wow. 'Life of Pi' is on of those films which will always stay at the front of your mind. Every scene is so beautifully done, every theme so well interwoven. This film is exactly what I was looking for and more.<br/><br/>The cast (albeit small) performed brilliantly. About a third of the film has more than 3 characters involved in it, while the rest is really just 2 (if you count the tiger as a character). The acting in those solitary scenes out at sea are done brilliantly. You really feel an emotional attachment to both Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's rather humorous name). Every struggle between them makes you feel scared, every pain makes you feel for them. I have never left the cinema missing every character as much as I did with Life of Pi (OK, maybe spirited away was just as heart-tugging).<br/><br/>The plot is very well strung together. Ang Lee has tied in the themes of the book absolutely superbly. What annoys me about some films is that if they do have a meaning they try to hide it, but Life of Pi really doesn't. The meaning is related clearly to discovering God, and how we are really more animal-like than we think (it turns out the story with animals is more human than the story with humans). What also amazes me is how Ang Lee managed to put in sequences which served no purpose to the plot, just there to be purely beautiful, and get away with it! Many films annoy me when they include visually-superb sequences because they detract from the feeling of the film too much, but not this one. The fact that the entire film just looks SO GOOD means that these scenes ,made just to look good, really work. I saw this film in 3D and, despite my hatred of 3D (no film has really justified the price increase), Life of Pi actually looked great in 3D. Every scene had noticeable 3D in it. Whether this was just going further into the screen or, in many cases surprisingly, popping out of the screen, it really did work.<br/><br/>So, #Life of Pi', is it the best film of 2012? No, but then again if it was then there must be something wrong with the world. I say that because this films' meaning is just so brilliant, so emotionally spectacular, that it just cannot be considered to be a film like any other. I actually feel bad about ranking it out of 10, but obviously I have to keep track of it somehow. Really, I would rank it as 'Pure Emotional Brilliance/10', but I'm afraid my IMDb vow prevents me from doing that. 'Life of Pi' offers a superb character ensemble, visuals which , dare I say rival those in 'Prometheus', and a plot so emotional, so perfect that it truly deserves it's 9.5/10 rating.<br/><br/>P.S; I miss Richard Parker"
"Laakbaar","7","4","8","29 December 2012"," Beautiful but unmoving
","I found this to be a beautiful, enigmatic and meaningful movie. In the end, the cinematography is what stands out for me. The landscape and village in India, the vividness of the shipwreck, the scenes of the ocean (and the wondrous things that occur there) and the algae island -- it was all quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Ang Lee also did a fantastic job in showing how the main premise of the book (i.e. a boy stuck on a life boat with a tiger) could actually work. I simply couldn't buy into this metaphor until Lee showed it to me on film.<br/><br/>It's astonishing how lifelike the computer-generated tiger was. The whole movie hinged on this. It worked brilliantly.<br/><br/>How many of the beautiful images were real? It's so well done that I really do not know. It's possible that most of the movie was computer generated. A cartoon, essentially. If so, it was technically brilliant, but it leaves me wondering about the film going experience. What did I just see exactly? <br/><br/>Related to that are my reservations about the realism of the ocean scenes. Beautiful, yes, but do such things actually happen on the ocean? I'm still not sure. I'd like to know.<br/><br/>What was the religious message of the movie? We are told that it delivers a profound message, but I'm afraid I couldn't really get it from the movie itself. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but should a movie have the effect of making you scurry to the internet to find out what it means? The metaphors here were too complicated.<br/><br/>I suspect this movie might speak more to the faithful, or at least to people whose minds are still open to faith. I'm afraid I'm on the same side as appa and amma, and this movie did not convince me otherwise. This is a movie with a profound message, but it's a message I didn't quite get and I think I reject, the artistry notwithstanding.<br/><br/>I have to add that, although I am easily moved, this film did not move me. It did not really evoke an emotional reaction in me (apart from wonder at the beauty). That's the main reason for my score. On this point the movie failed for me. Perhaps I need to see it again, but I didn't empathise with the main character (either the younger or older versions). I'm not sure why though.<br/><br/>To me, the twist at the end complicated the movie enormously and raised disturbing issues. Yes, I would have preferred to see the movie about a tiger rather than the alternative, but how on earth does that relate to religion? I'm sorry, but I didn't get it. Yes, faith and your particular religion are choices, but so is the decision to reject faith and religion as superstition. And I long ago rejected the notion that the grandeur of nature, or the beauty of art, is proof of God's existence. That is nonsense.<br/><br/>To be honest with you, if Ang Lee had filmed the alternative version in the same beautiful way, perhaps that would have been a good movie too. I might have preferred a more realistic horror-adventure film. Or is there some rule of cinematography that a movie like that would have to be ugly because of its theme? There is beauty in evil too.<br/><br/>But I write this review as someone who has not read the book, so what do I know."

","A movie which is totally different from the rest. Life of Pi is a going to offer you a great visual experience. Those 2 hours spent in the theater are totally worth if you are expecting some extraordinary visuals and cinematography. It has one of those stories which is very difficult to tell through a movie. But Ang Lee has done an extraordinary job this time.<br/><br/>The visual effects are going to keep you on the edge of seats all the time. If you want to enjoy this movie go watch in 3D. Its the effects that take the movie to next level. If you are budding filmmaker then there is lot to learn from the cinematography of this film. It is definitely a visual treat for the viewers.<br/><br/>The story telling was so awesome. To depict the movie whose major portion involves just a tiger and a boy in a boat trapped in the middle of a sea struggling to live in this nice way is itself a great achievement.<br/><br/>If you are not much into the effects or you like drama this flick may disappoint you.

"arunjyotiu","10","4","8","23 December 2012"," Life of Pi: A journey to Inner Self
","As I hail from India and the cast and storyline of this film revolves around an Indian family, our traditions and specifically our national animal it appealed to me in the first place than our own Bollywood flicks as well as other English movies.<br/><br/>Its my bad that I haven't heard of the name of the novel but as I saw this film I enjoyed it very much due to its AMAZING 3D in the first place. But when I viewed it 2 more times I tried to understand the deep meaning beneath the uncommon name.<br/><br/>We all know Pi is an irrational number but without which rationality cannot be achieved as explained in the euclidean geometry. Similarly faith although inexplicable by science but it can be the greatest tool to make impossible possible; quoting the Psalms: ""Trust unto god and He shall direct your path"". A child's innocence has always have been an object of humor to the adults but its the meaning we try to avoid by laughing away. And so Pi Patel's father tries to reason with his young son saying that he sees his own emotions reflected back from the eyes of the tiger. But this is how GOD watches upon all of us, no? Actually the power to do good, to do a miracle lies in all of us. What we lack is the courage and that's why we pray, expect Him to do our work. But fortune always favors the brave and victory loves preparation. Being shipwrecked Pi haven't forgot his trust, faith, belief, courage and above all hope. and these made him survive 227 days in pacific ocean growing a symbiotic relationship with the majestic Bengal tiger for survival or we may say GOD in form of the tiger. But during that time GOD made him see what we yearn to see our whole life: the heavenly beauty of His creation both known and unknown, explored and unexplored and also made him realize not to stop until the goal is achieved for which he escaped the sleeping lady shaped island. So after being landed in the shores of Mexico Pi sought, goodbye from the tiger but its justified why it didn't turn back. GOD is all the time watching us, treading beside us so why would he say goodbye? It finally comes to us what we believe and what we choose to believe. And I will say Yann Martel and Ang Lee has both succeeded in delivering this ultimate message."
"sengupta944","10","4","8","22 December 2012"," Mind blowing !
","The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way.<br/><br/>The entire weight of Life of Pi is balanced on newcomer Suraj Sharma's back. The true beauty of this film may be its cinematography, but considering how much of this movie focuses on a solitary human in a boat with a tiger, casting a weak actor in the role of Pi would have been as disastrous as flinging acetone on a painting. Life of Pi is substantial achievement in storytelling. The film covers a variety of topics: spirituality, mortality, maturity, death, and survival.<br/><br/>The idea of human identity is most strong in the end when he asks which story the writer believes. We are then questioned of whether we believe that he was stranded on a boat with a real Bengal tiger or if Richard Parker is the personification of himself and he spend his time on the lifeboat battling and coexisting with his own identity."
"eonbluedan-1","10","4","8","22 December 2012"," Astonishing
","Pi Patel, played for the most part by Suraj Sharma with a confidence defying his absolute inexperience in front of the camera, and surely qualifying him for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars, is thrust into an adventure of survival at sea. The ship carrying his family and their zoo hits bad waters, inexplicably sinks, and from there he must learn how to share the confined space of a lifeboat with his only companion, a tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Like 'Cast Away', due to its idea a great deal of the film is without speech, save for Pi's one way conversations with the animal and the occasional narration by adult Pi, played by a spectacular Irrfan Khan, who is telling his tale to an author, one who is after a great story that will ""make you believe in God"". Also much like another of this year's spectaculars, 'The Hobbit', the front end of the movie is loaded with a lot of setup, which those who who only saw the trailer may find surprisingly hefty. Unlike 'The Hobbit', however, this front end engages you fast and it is not long before you are enjoying the development of Pi as a character, the amusing finding of his faith, his love, and his place in the family. Some genuinely hearty and smart humour can be found in this first act, also. The brilliance is that whilst it is not in any rush to get where we all know it is headed, at no point is there any wish for Lee to push it along faster; there is some understanding intrinsic to the direction that this is all important and not to be overlooked, which even those who have not read the hugely popular book pick up on. To add to this, it must be said that the length and pacing of this movie is outstanding; you would not want any more or less time spent basking in the warmth of the love and care that clearly went into putting every single gorgeous frame on the screen. <br/><br/>The second act is where we really see the film kick into gear and start rolling out what is stunning audiences and critics alike. From the greatest CGI animal I think I have seen on the silver screen, to the overwhelmingly beautiful photography, effects, and perhaps not the first, but certainly the best use of 3D technology to enhance the engagement with a story, 'Life Of Pi' sweeps the floor visually with anything previously held up as a bar setter. Nothing against those previous movies, but it really does. <br/><br/>All of this is obviously nothing without everything else being in place, and thankfully Ang Lee knows that the heart of his film is not how pretty it is, but the story by Yann Martel and the themes with which it deals. So what is 'Life Of Pi' about? The wonderful thing about this piece is that this answer could be different for you than it was for me. It is about a boy surviving at sea with a tiger. It is about the nature of life, death and loss. It is about the balance of fear and respect. It is about love and hope. It is about humanity and compassion. It is about religion and faith, faith not just in a higher power, but in anything in the world. It is about all of these things at once, but what I most took away from this film is how it is about the nature of nature itself. Yes, it sounds heavy and preachy, doesn't it? The truth is Lee gets the balance absolutely spot on; you take from the movie what you want and at no point does it preach at you about anything. It does not matter how you walk in, an atheist, a Hindu, a Christian, but if you are a human being with anything close to an open heart and mind, you might just walk out feeling a better person! Released for the festive season, it is an oddly uplifting film that entertains on one hand, and on the other is positively philosophical about our place in nature, our treatment of her, and of one another. Not often would I say that a film might just change your life, but as the film reached its finale, with both Sharma and Khan absolutely owning their respective final scenes, I realised I had been inescapably moved to tears more than once, had consciously assessed how I think about certain things, and that yes, this film just might change you for the better. Is the preceding challenge to make a character believe in God achieved? That would be telling, but more importantly, it does not matter; in a rather smart bit of writing and beautiful execution, the film underlines that this is not really the point, and indeed should never be. <br/><br/>Ang Lee is a man who directs with a heart full of compassion, and a head full to its brim with an understanding of cinema's sheer power to entertain, engage and challenge, sometimes all at once. A look at his previous work is evidence enough of this; sure, not everything is a hit, but never could his passion for cinema, bravery and humanity, be more on show than with 'Life Of Pi'. He has done what was said to be impossible, taken a book that should never have translated to cinema, and not only made a successful film, but made the all-round best spectacular to hit the big screen since Nolan's 'Inception'! A loss at the Oscars for its visuals and adaption for screen, at the very least, would be a sin! Regardless of one's reaction to the movie, Ang Lee may well have created his masterpiece."

I was pretty amazed at how the director interpret and bring out the relationship between a boy and a tiger, both of which need to depend on each other in a disaster. In addition, the story lines are quite appealing and original, compared to other human-animal films. Generally speaking, to certain degree, it's a movie full of philosophical, religious and literary meanings to me.

","The last time director Ang Lee made a tiger crouch, he walked away with about a dozen Oscar nominations, all from just one film. This time Lee goes all the way by unleashing the dragon – this is not just a beast of a movie, it is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in everything that it sets out to be. <br/><br/>Possibly the best adapted screenplay this year, LIFE OF PI remains true to its award winning source material by Yann Martel; at least for the most part. Just like the novel, the story plays out in three parts, starting with the introduction of Pi and how he was named after a swimming pool in France. Narrated by Irfan Khan as the older Pi, the story is set in 1970s Pondicherry, a former French colonial city in India. Born and raised a Hindu, Piscine Molitor Patel, the teenage protagonist and titular character dwells into the beliefs of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, without claiming any one religion as superior. Pi's father, a business minded zoo owner has other priorities like migrating to Canada, along with some of the exotic zoo animals for sale once they reach their destination. In a cruel twist of fate, the journey is short-lived soon after they sail into the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. Although tragic in nature, the sinking of the freighter, along with Pi's parents and elder brother, is emotionally overwhelming yet visually spellbinding as the first of many sequences Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda has in store for the audience. What follows is a fierce and fascinating tale of survival when Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an injured zebra, a merciless hyena, an orangutan and a fearsome but majestic Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. <br/><br/>Right from the opening credits, Lee and Miranda mesmerises us with one of the most incredible set pieces ever built for cinema. Forget what TV spots and teasers are calling this movie. Judging from what critics have to say, LIFE OF Pi is indeed an epic visualisation but not necessarily justifiable in its comparison to AVATAR. Apart from the novel use of 3D in both films, I personally can't think of any other similarity. Lee's use of 3D is not just immersive for the sake of being so; it becomes the skeletal binding to the pulsating flesh and blood of the story in such a way that I actually forgot about the 3D spectacles resting on the bridge of my nose!<br/><br/>Thanks to David Magee's adaptation, Lee has made possible what acclaimed filmmakers have previously side-lined as impossible to film. From virtual humming birds hovering at arm's reach, to the scene when we first meet Richard Parker, to embellishing the sheer beauty of creation, Lee has broken new ground in the way cinema interprets literature. No doubt there. However, Lee's nuance as a storyteller is in bringing out the book's underlying significance of subtly suggesting the existence of God, through a relentless test of faith. This is done by two actors: Suraj Sharma as the ship-wrecked younger Pi who exalts God even in the most trying situations. The other actor is of course Irfan Khan, whose retrospect narration to a writer proves the very existence of God. For a débutant, Sharma has a large chunk of screen-time and holds the story singlehandedly with some amusing interjections. On the other hand, khan has fewer scenes but skilfully advocates the phrase that less can prove to be more.<br/><br/>From where I'm seated, LIFE OF Pi has a sure fire lock-on for a few Oscar nominations. But the real reason this is a must-see film, preferably in 3D (I can't stress this enough), is because there is every bit of passion in its making from surreal cinematography, a soul stirring original score, to spectacular visual effects, and a phenomenal narration that only ends when you hear an inner voice that says 'Believe'."

","What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator. <br/><br/>We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.<br/><br/>This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner."
"jdkraus","10","4","8","19 December 2012"," Visually and mentally mesmerizing
","""Life of Pi"" is unlike any other film about survival that I have ever seen. The film starts with Pi Patel, an adult who is being interviewed by a Canadian writer who wants to write a great book. Told in flashback, Pi reveals his story, starting with his family, his pursuit of studying different religions, and the animals that his father cared for, including a 450-pound Bengal tiger. His family decides to move to Canada to begin a new life. They hitch a ride on a boat that gets caught in a storm. Surviving the sinking, Pi is forced adrift on a 26-foot lifeboat—with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and the Bengal tiger. While the story seems simple enough, there are many deep, religious and philosophical undertones thrown into the mix that puts the viewer in a position to think and wonder. Part of the beauty of this film, is that it can be interpreted in many ways. What I see as the underlying message or theme maybe different than someone else. It is not only a movie worth seeing, but it is also worth discussing. <br/><br/>With a great degree of ambiguousness and thought-provoking undercurrents, ""Life of Pi"" is supported by magical feats of movie-making. It is a stunning film to look at with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects that are near perfection, and an emotionally driven musical score. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns to the American audience, but they work well in their given roles, specifically Suraj Sharma as young Pi—he gives us a character to care for. However, the character I cared for the most though is the Bengal Tiger. It may seem bad to favor a CGI animal over a human actor, but the SFX geniuses of Rhythm & Hues have given us a being to admire and awe. This movie has been a privilege to see in cinema. I am afraid though that it will lose its impact once it is converted to DVD and Blu-Ray, for to truly appreciate its power, ""Life of Pi"" is a movie that must be seen on the big screen."
"clarkentju","9","4","8","19 December 2012"," A very good movie bearing the message of philosophy solved through rationality
","Life of Pie...the name although did not interest me at all on the firsthand, but after starting the journey with Irrfan khan aka Pi Patel, I became convinced that director Ang Lee had done one of his best jobs with this movie. Mesmerized, mystified I witnessed the adventure of Pi,a pondicherry boy through struggles in life. The questions of rationality, existence,and beautiful philosophy that God can give us having utter faith upon him was so easily depicted. From the little Krishna exposing Pi to thinking on a cosmic scale, to Vishnu showing the supreme serenity, to Christ taking pain for good of all. Pi, a topper of his class, although thought differently because he thaught from the purity of heart. Not always by brain. The way he introduced himself to Richard Parkour nearly killed him, but the way he saved Richard parkour, saved his life too giving sign of a mighty heart. This movie also is a platform to describe us why a faint hearted man can not accept God, but Pi could because of his inner beauty, love and dedication with hardwork to achieve something. Thats why at the end of story, it seems that his mother smiles at the end of table while having dinner. Pi of course,in the end also thanks hid father for teaching him to be rational. He found his God being rational and thats where the crunch of story lies with its beauty."

","This movie is beautifully crafted by everyone involved in the film. The acting, directing, writing, and cinematography are all done incredibly well. All groups do a great job of building up the story from the beginning of the movie through the middle and finally hitting home at the end.<br/><br/>The idea of human identity is most strong in the end when he asks which story the writer believes. We are then questioned of whether we believe that he was stranded on a boat with a real Bengal tiger or if Richard Parker is the personification of himself and he spend his time on the lifeboat battling and coexisting with his own identity.<br/><br/>I played the movie, scene by scene in my head again and again, only to realize not everything is what it looks like. I highly recommend this film to everyone. whether you like it or not completely depends on your perception."
"virindra","8","4","8","18 December 2012"," Astonishing. Best movie I have seen this year.
","I went to Life of Pi special event in our local cinema and the movie was sold out on two screens. I have never seen this before. The movie is about religion and a cast away. The movie is very funny, frightening, serious, dramatic, beautiful, breathtaking, intelligent at the same time. The story behind the story is fantastic. Acting is wonderful. I am glad Irrfhan Khan has put a step out of Bollywood. I loved his movies even when he was not yet a Bollywood star. He had a small part in this movie, but fulfilled that very well.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is a newcomer and an underdog when it come to acting. He did very well for a first time. This cannot be said about most beginning actors or actresses. I hope he will make more movies (as an actor or director) who have a deeper meaning like Life of Pi. I don't hope for this boy to follow the footsteps of Dev Patel who acted in this wonderful Slumdog Millionair and then in this boring Aribender.<br/><br/>Like the beauty of Shravanthi Sainath was breathtaking, so were the scenes of the animals in this movie. I can say it was fantastic. I can imagine that this movie will not make it in India, because it has a heavy take out when it comes to religion. Even in the West the gravity of the real story might for most people be to hard to follow and understand. But for those who can keep their mind to a movie, it is worth watching in the cinema and more times after when it gets out on DVD."
"keyos27","8","4","8","16 December 2012"," The new Cast away
","The title of this review may seem offensive to some people, especially those who exceptionally enjoy the marvelous and emotional performance by Tom Hanks. As much as my affinity towards ""Cast away"" still vividly remains in my memory after 12 years, I can honestly say ""Life of Pie"", based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel is impressive in terms of both staging and acting.<br/><br/>The plot is simply about a French-Indian boy, Pie, encounters a life-threatening shipwreck during immigration to Canada with his family and a herd of Family-run Zoo animals caged in the Japanese cargo ship to start a new life. However, the main story focuses on Pie and the tiger, aka Richard Parker, trying to survive after being stranded in middle of the ocean. The two who consider each other as enemies developing a heartwarming friendship by going through all sorts of conflicts with hand-to-mouth supplements on the rescue boat is what makes this movie adventurous and distinguished. <br/><br/>The Visual effects consists of computer generated animals that interact with people. The magnificent underwater scene amuses me with a detailed presentation along with a giant wave where tremendous storm devours the ship. The most amazing part of the movie is to be able to witness the surreal CG tiger who steals the thunder of other animals using its fierce eye and charisma.<br/><br/>On top of that, a young and novice actor, Suraj Sharma should get nominated for an Award for his incredible performance. Despite there are hardly anyone around him while shooting due to the large amount of CG used in the movie, he executes his role without being awkward. Endeavoring to engage with imaginary CG animals and trying to stay focused while being surrounded by the sea hazards must be as challenging as what Tom Hanks did in ""Cast away."" I can see a bright future ahead of him.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an emotional and inspiring film for everyone who loves watching the nature and survival stories. One flaw of this movie would be a slow-paced storytelling. Things that transpire in the beginning is partially incoherent. However, that does not negate the fact that this is worth watching as it also contains a lot of hidden messages that are worth learning."

"SunnyBMS","10","4","8","14 December 2012"," Prepared to be Wowed. Truly Magical!
","I loved, loved the movie. Makes you think about it long after it's over.<br/><br/>Are there differences between the book and the movie? OF COURSE. So what?!? Many people have not read the book (including myself) and many that did read the book failed to understand/did not completely understand the spiritual and philosophical aspects of it, mostly because many terms are based on several philosophies from different religions and not to mention usage of Hindu philosophical and some Tamil words throughout the story. The movie somewhat simplifies all that and brings an otherwise impossible story to the big screen. It's truly magical.<br/><br/>You may want to look up ""Life of Pi"" terms for better understanding. Also there are a lot of words spoken in Tamil language and an entire song in Tamil â€“ ""Pi's Lullaby"" which actually is a great song - <br/><br/>http://www.amazon.com/Pis-Lullaby/dp/B00A12VUM4/ref=sr_1_1? ie=UTF8&qid=1355507080&s=dmusic&sr=1-1<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of scenes that have so much meaning and depth if you understand the Hindu philosophy and culture. For instance - mom seeing revolving earth in the mouth of young Krishna, Lord Vishnu coming in the form of a snake to save the world or the Kathakali dance sequence. These scenes have deep meaning and importance to someone who is familiar with Hindu culture and the scriptures but even if you don't, the story is still very powerful and leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Mychael Danna's score is awesome. Special mention -""Pi's Lullaby"" This song is in Tamil language. Just like the movie, the sound track takes you to another world! Bombay Jayshree has such a soothing voice that will drift you into another world!<br/><br/>If you are an atheist, I don't expect to come out of the theater a converted believer, but it will make you think about the power of FAITH!<br/><br/>Run, not walk, to the theater and see this in 3D before it's gone.<br/><br/>P.S: To those who wonder and to Mr. Martel - I prefer the story with animals! This is what this book/movie is about!"
"jafar-iqbal","9","4","8","11 December 2012"," A beautiful film, and a visual tour-de-force
","A young writer travels to Canada to meet Pi (Irrfan Khan), an Indian man with an incredible story to tell. It is the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma), who gets stranded in the Pacific Ocean with only a fearsome Bengal tiger to keep him company. The two castaways form a strange bond as they try to stay alive and get help.<br/><br/>That's the story of Life Of Pi, the novel written by Yann Martel back in 2001. For nearly ten years the international bestseller was deemed unfilmable, despite numerous attempts. It was only when Ang Lee took control that the movie became a reality, and it has finally hit the big screen.<br/><br/>The result of Ang Lee's attempts is an epic piece of cinema. The film is absolutely brilliant, with just the right amount of humour, emotion and action to satisfy everyone. I've not read the book yet (I will, for sure), but I get the feeling that justice was done here in regards to the adaptation. Characters are properly fleshed out, major and minor, and relationships are developed well enough to matter as the film goes on. If anything could have been explored better, it would be the relationship between Pi and his mother (Tabu). The influence she has on his life seems understated, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>Life Of Pi is very much a work of fiction; at no point are we led to believe that it is based on reality, and this works massively in the filmmakers' favour. Unlike Zemeckis' Castaway, which is rooted in the reality of it all, Lee opts to focus more on the fantastical and beautiful. There is no real sense of time, and we aren't always told how certain things happen. They just do, and the story moves along.<br/><br/>There are two things that stand out about this movie, and one thing that lets it down sorely. The good first. Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is excellent. Considering he has no acting experience, he is a revelation. And secondly, the movie is visually stunning. Absolutely beautiful from first frame to last. It's a visceral treat.<br/><br/>Now the bad. I watched the film in 3D, and thought many times: why is this in 3D? I counted literally two moments where the 3D worked well. Other than that, it was useless. If the money spent on 3D was spent on shooting it in IMAX, Life Of Pi could have been even better. Instead, it was a bit darker than it needed to be, and everyone sits in a cinema looking like Stevie Wonder for no reason.<br/><br/>The good heavily outweighs the bad, though, and I highly recommend the movie. Like with Avatar, the movie should be seen for the visuals alone. Unlike Avatar though, this is actually a good film. You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll be engrossed with them, and you'll feel a genuine sense of rejoice as everything unravels. I can't tell you if the movie is better or worse than the book. I can tell you that that doesn't matter here: the movie is excellent all on it's own."
"scottaleger","10","4","8","10 December 2012"," I was intensely satisfied
","I was lucky enough to see Life of Pi. I was intensely satisfied. You know Life of pie is based on a novel written by Yann Martel.(BookCover Image - http://bit.ly/U1vpNu ) Also this book is amazing! it is one of the best I have ever read. Enjoyed this book also. Could not put it down.<br/><br/>I agree with palariaa who said - So far this is the best movie of the year. It is an entertaining, well-directed, well-performed piece of art. If you want to see what groundbreaking crafts look like, go see it. Yes, the special effects are mind-boggling, especially Richard Parker, the tiger. But only when you look beyond the 3-D and visual effects that hold you in awe for most part of the movie (and that you have probably read in several critical reviews) you begin to see the real genius of the film and its director. This is a Taiwanese director making a movie with a mostly Indian cast, about Indian characters and places and he pulls it off so well (his India is way more credible than the Dickenson India shown in Slumdog). Life Of Pi is a bold movie made by a bold director who does not shy from making unconventional movies. Yes, it will upset some people for its unconventional subject, and some critics will find the off-beat movie preachy for they have grown so used to understatements and subtleties that they confuse those with art, but nobody can deny the powerful force of the movie. For the most part, the movie has only one human character on screen and yet it never gets boring - slow at times perhaps, but not boring. One last point - the movie could not have been what it is without the actors, particularly the one who plays adult Pi and the young actor who portrays teenage Pi and gives an unbelievable debut performance."

","I love coming of age movies. They have been my go to movies for over a decade. A real world experience that molds a person's character for rest of his/her life is a universal subject that would never dry up. But then there is this book called 'Life of Pi' that I came across and provided more than my staple coming of age diet and take me through a journey of faith and beliefs. This book acts as a disguise to be spiritual (given that is set in India), but at the core is a coming of age story of a boy finding answers of faith and beyond having born in a nation of millions of gods. And to turn this book into a captivating movie, we have Mr. Ang Lee; who clearly love challenges.<br/><br/>Set in India and made by Hollywood studio; you should expect the simplistic description of a very complex nation and its affair with religions of the world. But Mr. Lee manages to breeze through the shallow storyline based in India. Almost all of the situations and scenarios about young boy Pi's life in Pondicherry, India are created to suit the taste buds of western audiences. As we watch the young Pi grow in dreamy India along with a soulfully spoken narrative by Irfan Khan in background; we instantly are lost in the color and the mood of the film. We never look beyond those colors into reality and we are ready to accept anything. <br/><br/>But as we move on from Anglo India into open sea; faith and personal beliefs of Pi collides with nature's fury. After Pi Patel's father, a zoo owner decides to move his family in Canada and sell the animals to a North American zoo for a good prize; they begin their journey. The entire family along with all the animals travels through a Japanese cargo ship across the oceans. There they have encounter with a borderline racist French cook and a very gentle Buddhist. There reel time is only for one sequence, but there presence and importance will be felt late in the movie. As the journey of the ship abruptly ends in a very violent ocean; Pi is survived on a life boat with an injured zebra, an Orangutan, a Hyena and a Bengal Tiger. <br/><br/>And from here on the journey could not be more breath taking and satisfying. It literally and astonishingly unbelievable with Pi surviving on a life boat with these animals and they are animals. They will do anything to survive like humans. The mystery of the journey and whether you believe in the memories of the adult Pi about his experiences across the vast ocean will make you rethink about all the mystical fantasies that we have ever came across.<br/><br/>The story already hooks the audience into the ongoing proceedings and Mr. Lee's breathtaking visuals puts 'Avatar' in its place & carries you through a journey of vast beauty across our planet. After Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, Mr. Lee successfully trumps those monumental achievements in Cinema history with this visual masterpiece that deserves compulsory 3D viewing.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/"

","Spoilers alert!!<br/><br/>The movie to me is more faceted than just 3D. <br/><br/>Pi is the tiger, or the tiger is the embodiment of Pi's animal, beastly side. The tiger was hidden and suddenly ""burst"" out of the canvas when the orangutan( or his mother) was attacked. Several hints were given throughout the movie. Pi's father told him that what he saw in the tiger's eyes was merely his own reflection. The names switch was another hint, and the same foreshadowing went to the moment Pi asked the tiger (more like a monologue) what he saw facing the big, dark yet glistening ocean. In that still moment, Pi stared into a fragmented, chaotic kaleidoscopic montage of HIS own life, in which reality and imagination could not be clearly defined. <br/><br/>A storm hit and the lightning cracked the sky wide open as if God was manifesting self by shedding a light upon Pi. Pi was awe-struck, but the tiger was intimidated, hiding itself under the canvas. Pi forced the tiger to come out and honor God, but it was trembling terribly, as if in the presence of holiness, the beast was not trained, but almost tamed. What was intriguing was that Pi chose to join the tiger under the canvas for the first time. When the storm swayed him between the sea of sanity or insanity, with God above, was the beast inside the human suppressed or did the human finally become the beast? <br/><br/>Pi is also the human-shaped, man-eating island. Vegetarian as he was, he had to eat meat to survive, including the human flesh as suggested in his alternative story-telling in the end. In the morning, he struggled to survive with no time to think much. At night, his stomach, as well as his conscience, was upsetting. His stomach, or the lakes, was churning with gastric acid. He might have vomited out an indigestible human tooth. The lotus could be his conscience or the human part of him. He ""Listen""ed to the lotus as once Anandi had told him to, and fled the island. <br/><br/>After the boat hit the real shore, the tiger strode into the woods without even looking back. Pi felt sad because it was the beast in him that had him survive the journey. But it was the human part of him, or his faith in his faiths, that raised him above his remorse and ordeal. The journey ended, the beast in him was gone(or just hidden until the next episode), and he was back to the human world again. <br/><br/>I guess we can say whatever we want as to which symbolizes which, but above all, it's a phenomenal story told about the beauty and the beast in human."

","Life of Pi!<br/><br/>What a brilliant cinematography? A visual masterpiece! The movie itself had a character apart from that of Pi. The animals seemed to be acting as well, what a brilliant SFX work! The background score was fantastic, you feel goose bumps all over during some extreme scenes! A completely satisfying movie! A couple of Oscars are some deserving jewels for this crown!<br/><br/>I am an Indian, and I can definitely say, in India, some plots explained in the movie do not happen! But they can be excused as it is more of an emotional story, of courage, of faith - more like a fairy tale! <br/><br/>If you watched this movie, you would find these interesting:<br/><br/>1. Anandhi, the classical dancer, makes a sign or a mudra during her dance. Pi later asks doing the same mudra, 'why would a lotus hide in a forest?' And Anandhi is shown to be embarrassed. That's because, in hindu symbology, lotus represents a woman's vagina! It hides in dense pubic hairs, doesn't it? (damn) By the classical dance, it is symbolically meant that the lady is shy and wants to express her sexual feelings.<br/><br/>2. The whole carnivorous island is seen as a Hindu God, Vishnu (the supreme soul) lying on his back! It is a beautiful metaphor! Vishnu has said in Bhaghvad Gita, 'whatever is given to you is taken back!' The island gives you food and shelter in the morning and takes it all away in the night. Such an island is scientifically impossible to exist, but like I said, it's a fairytale.<br/><br/>These are the things I couldn't see anywhere on the internet. But, if you read the novel, you can definitely understand the complex and intricate relationship between humans, life and survival instincts. The whole movie is a beautiful poem! It takes some time to understand it!<br/><br/>I would give a 9 on 10, the movie lacked nowhere, and yet I had to take off the one because of some cast's poor acting! Ang Lee is a great director!"

","Life of Pi is about the incredible journey of Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) after he's stranded on a boat with a couple of zoo animals, such as a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena & the most important animal is an adult Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. The story of Pi's life is narrated by an adult Pi(Irrfan Khan). Pi's story begins in Pondicherry where he lived with his mother(Tabu), his father(Adil Hussain) who is a zoo owner & his brother, Ravi(Mohd. Abbas Khaleeli). From here on the story just flows at an incredible pace where you neither get confused nor do you get bored even for a single minute. LOP is a treat to watch even before Pi gets stranded on a boat with all the animals.<br/><br/>First off, this is the most visually appealing film of all time! The 3D in this movie is more or less the best 3D I've ever seen. It's even better than Avatar because most of the environment in this movie, is real! Ang Lee has portrayed India beautifully. This movie deserves all the Oscars that it's most probably going to get. A note on the performances. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is brilliant as Pi. The viewer doesn't even realize that he's a newcomer. Irrfan Khan is, as usual, mind blowing as the adult Pi. Tabu is great as Pi's mother. Abbas Khaleeli is impressive as Ravi. The other kid actors who played Pi & Ravi at different stages in their life are spectacular as well. Therefore, Life of Pi is a must watch. I promise you that, it's an experience of a lifetime!"
"socrates99","9","4","8","2 December 2012"," I haven't been astounded since grade school, until now
","I bought the book when it was first being touted as a literary gem but then decided not to read it, so I have nothing to gauge how well Ang Lee did in interpreting the book. That said, this is one of the most endearing movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>My first thought having just seen it was, thank God some studio didn't get a hold of it first to do an American take on the book. This movie so deserves and demands its setting and foreign lead actors. I admit I probably would have enjoyed one of our better young leads in the role of Pi, but I'm much better off having grappled with the Indian chosen by Lee who, for some reason, populates this movie with everything from Mexicans, Indians, Japanese and Anglos to tigers, hyenas, orangutans and zebras, but not one Chinese person. I thought that a little odd but perhaps the books that way too.<br/><br/>I saw the 2D version mainly because I was expecting some exploration of the god issue, but I was mostly disappointed in that. The talk of religion is very brief and not very interesting. What was interesting is the survival story and the boy's relationships with wild animals.<br/><br/>I had no idea whether for the most part I was watching a real tiger or not. Let's just say that if Lee had to wait for the tiger to do everything he does in this movie, he by rights should still be out there filming. Someone with a real love for animals and an eye for their behavior clearly had a hand in making these scenes look real. And then there are the shots at sea. The sea rises in great swells and you would think Pi is actually in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific being carelessly tossed around by a violent storm; it's truly masterful, unprecedented filmmaking.<br/><br/>Even my wife who is no friend to animals thought the movie went by quickly and was happy to have seen it."

","I've been reading the IMDb reviews after seeing the film last night (in 3-D). I share the awe and pleasure most viewers expressed. In fact I wonder: why the 9s? Why not 10s? Seriously, on exactly what level do you think this film fell short? The acting? The computer-generated animal effects? The script? I mean, really? Where did it fall short? I've been wracking my brain and see nothing but perfection here. There wasn't a minute I'd rewrite or reshoot. It's just a damn good movie and could stand as the gold standard in quite a few genres. I had a friend tell me he'd take off a point because there were too many flying fish. Maybe he's right. I hope that's the worst thing they could say about any film I wrote or directed or produced or shot or acted in. Too many flying fish. Go see it and be dazzled. If this doesn't earn full marks from you, I seriously pose the question: what would?"

Movies like Avatar and Life of PI, We are going beyond our imagination.<br/><br/>Story, Screenplay, direction are really good and thanks for the author who wrote this book.<br/><br/>The background music score was awesome and with an Indian touch. This was bit similar to the one ""127 Hours"" Movie.<br/><br/>All in all. One of the best cast away movies.

"shaanmenon","9","4","8","2 December 2012"," Visual Extravaganza and Some Great Life Lessons
","After the creative extravaganza of 'The Avtar' and the 'Three Musketeers', here comes another Hollywood movie, that promises a lot on the unlimited possibilities the 3D Technology and the CGI Technology offer the viewers. Having seen, the movie, I must say, the movie has impressed me, almost as much as 'The Avtar' did!<br/><br/>Based on the best selling novel by Yan Martel (not just best selling, but Man-Booker Prize Winner too), the initial part of the story is set in India, Pondicherry. <br/><br/>To go further, Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is having a conversation with his french Author-friend and tells him how he survived 227 days on a life boat with only a Bengal Tiger (Richard Parker, the tiger is named) for company. He is also picked up by two Japanese Maritime Officials so as to investigate how the ship sank. The Officials don't believe his outlandish story and dismisses him. But what exactly is Pi' story, and that's what the movie is all about. <br/><br/>Son of a Zoo-Keeper, Santosh Patel, Pi of Piscene Patel is born to an affluent family. The boy is, pretty aware of the need to co-exist in a world with animals and also is quite understanding of their needs. Raised as a Hindu, he is also introduced to Islam and Christianity and is a believer of the 'Vasudeva Kudumbakom', in true Indian Psychology! The family, one fine day, decide to relocate to Canada due to political turmoil in their native place and sells some of their animals, and also carrying some with them on their journey in the high seas. Their ship encounters a heavy storm and is wrecked and his family along with the ship and the crew sinks. Pi soon finds himself stranded on a life boat in the high seas with four animals, a Hyena, a Zebra, an Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger.<br/><br/>The rest of the Pi's tale is how he survives 227 days on the sea with the Tiger (He names the tiger as Richard Parker). All the while, Pi assigns in each animal, a distinctive personality based upon his observations and the people in his own life. The other animals die as the Hyena kills the Zebra and the Orangutan out of hunger. The Hyena in turn gets killed by Richard Parker. Pi now realizes the need to keep Richard Parker in good humor in order to save himself, and feeds him fish. He eventually develops a bond of friendship with Parker and they both realize and appreciate the need of each other for their own survival. <br/><br/>They ultimately reach the coast of Mexico soon, Richard Parker escapes into a jungle without looking back at Pi leaving him in distress and even making him question their friendship itself.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan plays the role of the grown-up Pi, who is being quizzed by the Japanese Officials about the ship wreck and his tale of survival. The officials don't believe his story of survival along with the Bengal Tiger, so Irrfan then substitutes his tale with another one with people in his real life and asks whether the story is more believable now. He is absolutely fantastic with his accent and does a fantastic job. After 'The Namesake', an excellent performance from him. <br/><br/>Tabu, plays the role of Pi's mother, Gita Patel, with aplomb and is impressive. Adil Hussain is Santosh Patel, Pi's father.<br/><br/>In spite of this luminous star-cast, Suraj Sharma as the teen-aged Pi is the back-bone of the movie and is fantastic. French and Hollywood actor, Gerard Dipardieu appears in a Cameo as the Cook of the Ship and no word is required to describe how this wonderful actor has performed. <br/><br/>Underlying Layers in the Story<br/><br/>Just as the boy finds that his class-mates in Pondicherry is quite amused as to how someone could be named 'Pissing Patel', he shortens his name to Pi, the mathematical constant, having 'no end'. The story, too, has lots of inner-layers to it, and each animal represents a different character or a person in Pi's life. The tale of surviving 227 days with a tiger is as much a tale of how to see with-in and to survive in adversities and believing in one-self. It is a wonderful story of growing-up and survival and is a must watch! If you have not read the book already that is.<br/><br/>Many have asked me, as to what is so grand, about a boy being castaway with a Bengal Tiger for company, and I would say, this is not just a fantasy story. The life-boat represents our life itself, the calm seas and the storms, its ups and downs. The Tiger is Pi's Self-Destructive Alter Ego, and the movie is all about how one should spend his life, fighting and taming the destructive self. It is a story about courage, and self-belief as much as it is a story of spiritual and philosophical overtures. <br/><br/>Directed by Ang Lee, who won Oscars for his 'CrouchingTiger, Hidden Dragon' and has directed 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Brokeback Mountain', The Life of Pi, overall, is a wonderful movie, and can be enjoyed by everyone alike. The only thing that i was miffed with was because, for some unknown reason, Gerard Depardieu has been given such an insignificant role. He appears in just one scene, and it cannot even be called a Guest Appearance. Such a great actor, and he has nothing to do here! <br/><br/>But still, Embark on this adventure and discover yourself along with Pi, on a journey that knows no end! Miss it, and you have missed one of the best movies that has come out in recent times!"
"Yume-no-Yumi","9","4","8","1 December 2012"," Great Inspirational Movie! (SPOILER ALERT)
","SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Do not read if you have not watched the movie...continue at your own risk<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Never Have I watched a movie that inspire me so! For me it was such an inspiring movie conveying the strength of human potential as well as the importance of human identity. In the beginning we see his search for God and throughout the movie we see how everything is torn away from him in order to be able to understand God for the being that he is. It is throughout the whole movie that when everything is torn from his grasp can he understand God himself without the influence of others (ie. his parents, civilization and his first love). Only when left to starvation and the turbulence of storm can he start with a clean slate can he start over. The next we learn is the importance of human identity and the impact we leave behind. This can be seen when he encounters the floating island where he finds a tooth within the flower. He doesn't want to live an lonely existence and returns to the boat again to search for land. The idea of human identity is most strong in the end when he asks which story the writer believes. We are then questioned of whether we believe that he was stranded on a boat with a real Bengal tiger or if Richard Parker is the personification of himself and he spend his time on the lifeboat battling and coexisting with his own identity."
"griffolyon12","8","4","8","30 November 2012"," A Boy, a Tiger, and God
","Within the first ten minutes, the titular protagonist of Life of Pi, Pi Patel, tells a writer that this story will make one believe in God. The story that Pi tells, is that of a shipwreck, which claims a teenaged Pi's family. Amidst the chaos, he found himself the sole human survivor, now floating across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Part survival story, part rumination about one person's faith and their attempts at understanding why God designed nature to do the things in which it does, Life of Pi is an emotion-filled journey that places the viewer within these events and has them pondering the same questions that the film's lead, newcomer Suraj Sharma, does.<br/><br/>In a great many ways, Life of Pi requires an open mind from its viewers. It is not a film about one particular religion, as Pi is a combination Hindu, Catholic, and Muslim. He has always been fascinated by God, whether it be Christ, the many Hindu Gods, or Allah, Pi believes they're all the same. The film does not ask the viewer to believe this same idea as Pi, his beliefs simply serve as the impetus to understanding the gentle, soul-filled character that is Pi Patel, and understand how a 16-year-old boy could survive not just the elements and starvation, but also a man-eating tiger.<br/><br/>The set up of the film is filled with life and energy, detailing the source of Pi's name, his fascination with religion, and his loss of innocence, before the ship wrecks and the real story begins -- Pi's journey to understand God. To his immense credit, young actor, Suraj Sharma, manages to hold the film together thanks to his revelatory performance. Sharma is the heart- and-soul of Life of Pi. He has a wide range of emotions that make him believable as a teen pondering such large questions, keeping the viewer engaged rather than allowing their attention span to wane. Which is good, seeing as how Life of Pi gets narratively murky around the midpoint, with some of the confrontations between Pi and nature running together by that point. Thankfully, the thematic ideas are what I feel that Ang Lee and company want the audience to take away from the film, and the emotions and ideas are so strong, it is very easy to overlook its narrative shortcomings.<br/><br/>Visually, Life of Pi is a marvel. The animals in the life boat are entirely computer generated, and there are many moments where it is hard to find the glossy edges that CGI leaves behind. As well, director Ang Lee uses visual effects and the camera's depth of field to create a more immersive, dream-like feel. Almost every shot seems to have been digitally altered to make it seem more unreal, to make the water more reflective, to make the sky more beautiful, or to make dream and reality often collide. In particular, the way that the camera was always focused on Pi, with most of the other actors out of focus, it really draws one into Pi's state. However, I cannot figure out why Lee changed the aspect ratio in a few scenes. There is no evidence in the film itself to suggest why, leaving me confused. It's only for two scenes, and both are scenes meant to be emotional beats, and yet the film goes from widescreen to fullscreen to letterbox format. It jars the viewer and takes one out of the filmgoing experience.<br/><br/>All in all, Life of Pi is not perfect, but it was a film I do not regret seeing. Thanks to a strong performance from Sharma, marvelous effects work, luscious visuals, and a thematic consistency that never falters in affecting the viewer, Life of Pi is a flawed, yet must see film that will be nominated come Oscar night.<br/><br/>I give Life of Pi an 8 out of 10"
"KineticSeoul","8","4","8","29 November 2012"," A movie you might have to ponder upon to know why it's a great movie...
","So this is a movie based on a novel, now video game movie adaptations doesn't seem to work a lot of times. But it works from novel to movies sometimes and I haven't even read the book. But it seemed like this is a great adaptation. Now I wasn't even excited for this movie or anything, when I saw the first trailer I didn't even know what this movie was about. It just showed a guy and a tiger on a boat. This kinda seemed like ""127 Hours"" and ""Castaway"" combined kinda. But it is a more meaningful movie that has some deep messages to go with it. Now this is a family movie but youngsters probably won't be entertained much by this but for the adults that like psychological and spiritual movies just might dig this one. I can't really say I was very entertained throughout this whole movie, some parts seemed a bit slow for me. But this is just one of those movies you might have to ponder upon about after seeing it to know why it's a great movie. The cinematography is just vivid and beautiful to watch even if it's mostly nature. Most of the running time is taken up while showing the relationship between Pi Patel and a tiger and they are both stranded on a boat. And I especially liked how it didn't go in a far-fetched direction but you can actually buy into the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Overall this is a great movie that is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of action or laugh out loud comedy. Although there are some witty and cute comedic parts in this movie. Without giving the ending away it leaves it up to the audience to choose. Although some might like the message and other won't.<br/><br/>8.2/10"
"jadepietro","7","4","8","28 November 2012"," Life of Pawn
","This film is mildly recommended. <br/><br/>Give me the real thing anytime! Sparkling rhinestones never trump diamonds. Plastic trees and silk flowers can never substitute for nature's glories. Artificial sweeteners are fine for awhile, but usually leave a funny aftertaste. Which brings us to Ang Lee's Life of Pi, a so-so entertainment that is long on style and short in substantial value.<br/><br/>Overdone best describes this film. Visually, the film is a stunning work of art. ( I found the 3-D to be totally enthralling, almost too precise and overworked at times, but still a remarkable undertaking of this process. ) The film's color palette has an exciting vibrancy that is unmatched by other films, but also an artificial over-saturated glow, as if colors were boosted beyond their limits. There are scenes of true artistry that give this film a distinctive allure ( the staging of the actual shipwreck sequence, the surprise meeting of the boy and his tiger aboard the small lifeboat, a surrealistic hallucination that is filled with stark imagery, the colorful sunsets and ominous cloud reflecting upon the waters ). These effects do create an otherworldly atmosphere, which I suppose was Lee's goal, but the film's onslaught of phantasmagoric dreamscapes becomes excessive and outweighs the slenderest of plots: a philosophical and spiritual parable about a boy and his tiger lost at sea. <br/><br/>This paradoxic metaphor is the basis conceit that enables the director and his screenwriter to explore the deeper meaning of religion, faith, and God that, in the end, makes Life of Pi become a preachy treacle, continually musing about our existence in this vast universe. ( Recent films by major directors like Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life, Lars van Trier's Melancholia, and the recent Cloud Atlas by the Wachowskis have explored this territory with similar mixed results. So one cannot fault Ang Lee with his passion and determination to film this novel and its metaphysical ruminations. ) <br/><br/>Ultimately where Lee's film fails is in its conventional storytelling. The screenplay literally sinks the movie. Its script by David Magee rambles on and is especially slow-moving in the first half hour of the film with all its tedious exposition and build-up prior to the shipwreck. Based on Yann Martel's novel, the plot set-up is told in flashback, with the adult Pi bookending the more exciting adventure storyline. As he narrates his tale of survival, the character of the younger Pi ( Suraj Sharma ) emerges, but he is never fully realized. He is merely a pawn in this sea of woe. More time and success is spent on the exquisite photo-realistic rendering of Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. The CGI enhanced Mr. Parker gives a more lifelike performance and upstages the real life actor, Mr. Sharma, who could use some acting lessons. This imbalance sacrifices a real emotional gravitas needed to really care about the central character which I found completely missing in the film. ( In fact, the tiger had a lot more patience that I would have had if I was on that lifeboat and had to subject myself to Pi's religious rants and whining. He clearly would have been dinner by midday. ) <br/><br/>Life of Pi is slightly adrift, a film full of excesses and self-important swagger. Lee overindulges his vision and seems more preoccupied in creating an ethereal world that is quite beautiful and strange to behold but, contrary to his own beliefs, it is also quite annoying to experience all of its religious dogma too. The overall effect of Life of Pi is a mixed blessing, so to speak. Life of Pi is a visually impressive achievement in filmmaking, but it remains intellectually and emotionally off-course. GRADE: B-<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com<br/><br/>NOTE: Years ago, there was a wonderful film based on a children's novel called The Black Stallion which followed a similar storyline: a boy and an animal are shipwrecked and need each other to survive the hardships they face together. That film used a visual, almost wordless narrative to connect story and imagery; this film relies too heavily on the imagery to connect the pretentiousness of its hollow and holiest of words."

","I recently watched the Life of Pi movie and am pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read the book I was worried they might deviate too far from the original storyline as so many book-based movies I've seen in the past have done. Life of Pi was definitely an exception. I don't feel that anything was lost in translation. In fact, I believe the movie actually added to the wonder of the original story through the beautiful cinematography, special effects and acting. There were so many stunning shots throughout the movie, but the zoomed out scenes of Pi Patel's lifeboat floating over the placid sun, sky, and star reflecting waters of the Pacific Ocean were simply breathtaking. I was also very impressed with the 3D special effects, namely the re- creation of Richard Parker (the tiger Pi was stranded with), but overall they did a simply amazing job.

"Jasondelgado1960","10","4","8","27 November 2012"," A work of art.
","This movie was without a doubt a work of art. Weather it was the cinematography the special effects even the storytelling was all exceptional. This will be a Oscar nominated movie very worthy of a win or so. Watching this movie I felt transported into the movie like I haven't been before. With the religious and spiritual themes are simple and deep and reveals more questions about what your faith and belief than to answer them. Sense there was no preaching about religion or spirituality made it also more entertaining. The way the story unfolded it explored how our storied can get us through the worst of experiences and to deal with the aftermath. This was more of a survival story and how faith in god, a higher being, or just in yourself. The way Ang lee did the movie with the narration from old and young pi to music all the whole time so there aren't any slow dead scenes, and the result was a faster more entertaining film. With there being basically one character for most of the movie it was important that the character appeals to the audience feelings, but also having the right actor. Suraj Sharma was excellent as the adult Pi. His ability to make each emotional scene as equal to the others shows the talent he has. Even the tiger on the boat with him almost having human features but still keeping him the wild beast he is. Although the tiger is computer generated it is quite hard to tell a lot of the time with the way it acts during the movie. He was as important a character as Pi was. Most movies that seem to have a lot of computer graphics even 3D sometimes don't add to the movie even a way to hide a weak plot. This movie it was almost necessary especially with the heavy handed religious tones. What Lee invents with the integration of the ocean and the other animals is nothing but spectacular. He ability to marry the imagery and the experience was on par with movies like avatar and Hugo. Lee's preparation for the film and his passion for the subject matter further shows in this magical masterpiece that is a must see movie of the year."
"sashank_kini-1","9","4","8","27 November 2012"," Ang Lee's Task of Adapting Life of Pi to Big Screen is as Mighty as The Ocean Itself, But Lee Won't Stop Till He Reaches Shore. He completes His Task With Outstanding Success
","My first recommendation to any adult would be to watch this film alone- not with their noisy friends, or meddlesome children. The reason for this is simple - in order to totally submit oneself to the visual and spiritual experience delivered by the movie, one has to remain alone, just as Pi does for over two hundred days, being the only human stranded on the lifeboat. I believe this experience cannot be savored when one's emotional response is dictated by the collective feeling of the group (just imagine sitting there holding back your tears because you do not want your friends to snicker at you. In spite of going alone, I was disturbed a couple of times by some people who were wowed by the lion ( it's a tiger, for god's sake!), so I'm glad I didn't bring anyone with me who would have surely robbed me of the delight and wonderment that Life of Pi delivers. <br/><br/>The story of Pi's journey of a lifetime begins with a enchantingly dreamy opening sequence showing animals, birds and reptiles of many kinds at a zoo. What's so astonishing about this sequence is that you are so lost admiring the beauty of the animals shown without narration but with a soulful Indian classical music score that you pay no attention to the opening credits until the name of Ang Lee pops up more prominently at the end. <br/><br/>The first Pi that we see is probably in his forties and has already completed his journey long back. On his uncle's insistence, he shares his life story with a writer. As the older Pi narrates his story, the camera inter-cuts between the present time and Pi's childhood through fluid dissolves and morphs. We get to know why Pi is called Pi - a queer name for an Indian kid; we can make out that Pi is one curious boy who believes in exploring religion and spirituality and has a deep affinity to animals. A pivotal incident in his early days involving Richard Parker changes his attitude towards life and other matters that were consequential to him before. His family decides to move to Canada on a Japanese ship along with the zoo animals; an unexpected storm hits them on their journey and only Pi manages to hold on to the life boat... along with an injured zebra, a friendly orangutan, a cantankerous hyena and the mighty Richard Parker. What follows then is a deeply mesmerizing tale of courage, will to survive, perseverance, realization and ultimately - hope, which is what the world needs right now, hope.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is full of deep and important themes, and I can say, based on the experience I had in the theater, that more than three fourth of the audience were either i) oblivious to the metaphorical allusions or ii) not interested enough to get them. If you give adequate attention to the movie, you shall realize how important the element of water is the film; the swimming pool scene with Pi's uncle, Piscine being named after the pool and the entire journey taking place in the ocean - all three incidents have the element of water in common. Why does Pi look closely at the ocean water and see his life flash before him? Is it a commentary of how fate works? What about the journey of Richard Parker and Pi? Is it only to show the relation between man and animal? Pi fears Parker and distances himself from his fear, only to confront and later conquer his fear (i.e. Parker) but not by destroying Parker but by developing an understanding with him (his fear). What does Pi gain from this journey? <br/><br/>Hope is the word I get whenever I search for answers, and isn't hope required in this world, especially when you lose everything? And hasn't this message been reiterated so many times after 7/11 and the financial crisis in USA? Obama's inaugural address when he was elected for the first time stressed on hope, films such as 127 hours channelize hope. It isn't a surprise that Life of Pi has come this year and is doing well at the box office - people want films that carry the message of hope. And, I think Life of Pi teaches that you can get hope provided you have the will to survive and resist the temptation of an enclosed existence. <br/><br/>There are some standout scenes in Life of Pi which includes the opening scene, the storm scene, the moment Pi looks into the water wondering what Richard is looking intently at and the second storm scene. The third scene from above is especially noteworthy because of the way Ang Lee has filmed it - after the camera takes us underwater to get a view of Pi's vision, it goes back to show Pi's reaction for a second, and then, for about two seconds,cuts to the face of Richard Parker looking at him.This was one unforgettable moment that shook me completely. I've mentioned the second storm scene as a notable one as it gives us some minutes to reflect on whatever has happened in the film, and this is the point people should think instead of answering their cell phone calls ( person next to me).<br/><br/>Irfan Khan so honestly conveyed his sadness towards the end with not more than a teardrop. I really wished Suraj Sharma could do that instead of feigning grief by simply quivering his lips mechanically, speaking without conveying a sense of terrible isolation and not understanding fully the relevance of his character in the film. In many scenes, his eyes do not give us anything and he says important lines without hinting the subtext beneath them. It's still a good job considering he has no prior acting experience."

"somefoolishgirl","10","4","8","27 November 2012"," Truly worth going to the movies for.
","I saw this film last night in 3D. I was expecting a Disney style, jungle book kind of movie, but this was a WOW experience!!! Maybe it's because I see a lot of films, but honestly, I haven't been truly impressed by a movie in years and I was blown away! Ever hear the expression ""killing me softly"" well, that's the only way I can describe the emotion I felt.<br/><br/>This film is truly an impressive masterpiece, in every sense of the word. From the cinematography, to the story telling, to the pacing of the film, it is so thoughtful and grand. I can't say enough about what an authentic soul searching story this film turns out to be. The way it's told doesn't force a spiritual journey on you, but instead, presents you with a story that allows you to journey into yourself. If I just read the from someone else cynical side of me would roll my eyes, but it truly isn't a pretentious or preachy film, it's just a soul affirming experience. <br/><br/>The film makers did everything right in this movie. From the casting, to the thoughtful use of 3D, everything gels perfectly and leaves you feeling grateful for going to the movies. <br/><br/>In short I recommend this movie to anyone but young kids. There is no way they could sit through this whole movie without becoming an annoyance to all the other patrons. The subject matter is too deep, and they would not be able to handle some of the scenes or the lengthy film time. Be kind to everyone else at the movies and go with older kids or adults."
"Hello_Im_David","7","4","8","26 November 2012"," A Journey into the Soul
","This is one of those movie that you go see and afterwords it stays in your head for a good long while. Not because it makes you think, not because it is revelatory or life changing in anyway, but because it has a strange cerebral effect. It is a movie you feel, and those types of movies are the hardest to shake, whether you want to or not, whether they are good or bad.<br/><br/>Life of Pi lives and breaths in the spiritual world. It challenges us to face certain questions that have always been at the forefront of humanity: questions about our existence and what governs that existence. Through the long journey of shipwreck and days upon days of hunger, heat and fear aboard a small life boat, the audience, along with Pi, goes through a long period of soul searching. However all the time we have a deadly and ferocious companion staring us in the eye. For Pi this is an adult Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, for the audience it is doubt. Doubt in the existence of a higher power, doubt in the existence of a world that is more then billions upon billions of years of accidents and improbabilities that randomly resulted in the world and the universe around us. Life of Pi reminds us that the beauty of this world is no mere accident. It is all apart of a greater piece. A piece that was intricately woven by a force beyond human comprehension. This is where the power of the movie lives and where it should have spent a little more time. <br/><br/>The story is told by a much older Pi to a writer, and through this amazing story, Pi seeks to prove the existence of God. This is the weak part of the film, that almost ruined the whole of it. After Pi finishes his amazing story, he offers the audience a different, but more plausible story and he asks the writer as, well as the audience, ""which is the better story?"" The writer of course answers, ""the one with the tiger,"" to which Pi responds, ""So it is with God!"" This revelation of sorts compromises everything the film worked so hard to set up. You cannot spend a whole film defending religion and a higher power, and end it by saying we should believe in God because it's the better story. We should believe in religion because it makes us feel better. We should believe in God, because it sounds nicer then no God. This significantly dampened the experience for me and jolted me out of the spiritual world, forcing me back into the logical one, where answers like that don't fly. This is not a movie that challenges us to believe in the better of two stories. It is a film that asks us to look around us, and see the world for what it is. It is an irrational world, a world of astounding beauty, a world of improbability. This film does not (or at least shouldn't) ask us to believe in God necessarily, but to believe in something. It asks us to tap into our spiritual side, because it is only through the soul that we can see the world clearly, and begin to understand it more fully. <br/><br/>Despite this one flaw, the film is worth a watch, if only for the beauty of the film which presents us with a dazzling array or bright colors and astounding feats of visual effects, particularly the life like CGI tiger. But most importantly, this film is a journey into the soul worth taking. Maybe you can even walk out of the movie early and miss the small part at the end that almost killed the film."

They are superb but only there to underline and illuminate the drama. It's very hard to find words to describe the beauty of this movie. The picture is just astonishing.

"ferguson-6","8","4","8","26 November 2012"," Big Tiger, Small Boat
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we are reminded of just how stunning movies can be. Periodically a filmmaker proves to us that pushing the envelope of creativity still drives some auteurs. James Cameron brought us Avatar, which demonstrated that 3D technology could be beautiful and breath-taking. As beautiful and new as Cameron's breakthrough was, it lacked a story worthy of it advancements. Now, we get director Ang Lee's vision of Yann Martel's worldwide bestseller, and we are left gasping at what happens when you combine a fantastical story with technological advances and perfection.<br/><br/>Ang Lee has provided us with a varied selection of films including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain; and Sense and Sensibility. He refuses to be limited by genre and takes a global and philosophical view of filmmaking. He wants us to think and discuss and think some more. His Life of Pi film purposefully leaves many scenes, events and thoughts open to interpretation. You can see as much or as little of humanity in this story as you like.<br/><br/>The brilliant opening shows real animals in the real zoo located in Pondicherry, India. The colors, sights and sounds are dazzling and give us an immediate feel for the area. We meet young Pi and his family. Pi is inquisitive and ingenious from an early age. His father imparts such wisdom as ""If you believe in everything, you believe in nothing"". This comes as Pi is absorbing multiple religions and considers himself Hindu/Muslim/Christian. At an early age, he seeks answers and meaning. Soon enough, Pi and his family take their most valued animals on a ship to Canada. Disaster strikes when a storm capsizes the ship and Pi is the lone human survivor. He finds himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a huge Bengal tiger.<br/><br/>The developments need not be discussed here, but rather the focus of the story is the spirit of survival that Pi possesses. His ingenious methods of learning to coexist with the ferocious tiger force us to consider what the human race has done to nature in too many regards to count. Pi's religious spirit and insightful ways, coupled with a very specific survival guide, lead him to maneuver 227 days adrift in the Pacific. In the process, we are treated to some of the most spectacular visuals ever seen on screen. At times the sea, and its sea life and sky, are phosphorescent. The story is so amazing that we find ourselves not caring how much is real and how much is caused by Pi's hunger and thirst. Some of the visual effects are tranquil, while others are quite violent. A sequence featuring flying silver fish is something to behold.<br/><br/>The structure of the story is such that an adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is re-telling the tale of survival to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). While this is a traditional story-telling device, it takes nothing away from the anything but traditional story of Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's name). We are told ""This is a story that will make you believe in God"". Whether it does or it doesn't, it certainly makes us believe in the magic of movies.<br/><br/>Some will compare to Castaway, while others will think of 127 Hours. My best advice is to let go and give yourself to the story and the film. There is always time afterwards for debate and discussion. Instead, enjoy the moment and be thankful that a movie like this can get made ... it will lead the industry to even more creative productions down the road. So, just this once, forget what I have said many times, and go see this one in 3D. Allow it to take you away."

","I would consider this movie to be the best movie of this year.<br/><br/>The storytelling is great , The characters development is superb and the cinematography is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The movie conveys a lot without directly stating it . Richard parker, for example could never be seen as not being a wild animal, managed to be someone due to whom Pi was able to survive.<br/><br/>The development of Pi's personality as the movie went along was really natural, I did not just watch this movie ,But experienced it.<br/><br/>The part which really moved me was the end. The insurance people, who were not ready to believe in Pi's first story ended up using it for their report because the story with people in it was too uncomfortable for them.That gives us a insight into how human society works.<br/><br/>This movie is really a masterpiece.Hats off to the director and everyone involved in the making"

"zhongr05","10","4","8","25 November 2012"," second story is the truth, while first is your belief in God
","First all, everything is only my personal point of view and I just try to interpret this movie in my way because it really fascinated me during the 127 minutes and afterward. I am from the Orient and I think I can understand what Ang Lee, one of the greatest directors, is indicating behind those spectacular scenes.<br/><br/>From the very beginning until almost the end, we were watching the first story. The only survivor of a shipwreck, Pi, made it after more than 200 days floating on sea, with the accompany of a tiger, Richard Parker. They fought and cooperated. It was a unbelievable journey and Pi went through a lot changes and transformation. Being a vegetarian, he had to catch and kill fish to feed both Richard Parker and himself. He was both sorry and thankful. He was on a no-one-know-it island where daytime was a heaven but nighttime was the hell. Shining whale brought away his food and another storm almost killed him. Anyway, he made it and survived and was saved finally. <br/><br/>Almost everyone has focused on the first story, especially the amazing and mind-blowing special effects and visualizations. And some even complained about the story line and long opening before they boarded the ship. I was one of them until the very end, when in face of Japanese investigators, Pi told the second story. In this, the chef, the sailor, Pi's mother and himself. The chef ate the sailor and killed Pi's mother, which stimulated Pi and led to Pi killing the chef. Every animal has its meaning in the second story. The Zebra is the sailor, being eaten by the jackal representative of the chef, who also killed the ape symbolizing Pi's mother. The tiger, actually is Pi himself. It was what is inside Pi, also every human being, that without reasoning we are nothing but beasts. In the storm, Pi put himself against it while Richard was so scared. Storm is kind of like test from God or God himself. Our inside breasts are afraid of such tests and failed to confront it. What makes us human being diff from beasts is our belief in God and more generally human reasoning. <br/><br/>In the end, both the writer and the Japaneses investigators chose the first story with the tiger. But what is your choice?"
"shreeshabhat","7","4","8","25 November 2012"," A Visual Masterpiece
","How does one narrate a story like Life of Pi? And then, how does one make a movie out of it? Assuming you manage to pull it off somehow, how on earth do you find any scope for use of 3D in a movie that has no alien attacks, warring robots or swinging superheroes?<br/><br/>Ang Lee delivers the answers to all these questions in spectacular fashion. I have read reviews comparing this movie with Avatar, and i feel it is an unfair comparison. Avatar was nothing more than a three- hour advertisement for 3D, whereas in Life of Pi, 3D becomes a part of the story itself, almost like a character in itself.<br/><br/>The movie opens with debates on religion and spirituality, which might feel a little dull for Indian audiences, for whom these concepts are part and parcel of everyday life, but would fascinate Western audiences. Once the family of the protagonist, Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) sets sail for Canada, along with all the animals in their zoo which they plan to sell in Canada, it turns into a gripping drama. The ship sinks, and Pi finds himself adrift on a lifeboat, which he has to share with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan - and the star of the show, a Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker.<br/><br/>The storm scenes are so realistic, and so superbly enhanced by 3D, that it would not be a bad idea to carry along seasickness bags into the movie hall. As we breeze through storms, shoals of bioluminescent fish, flying fish, exotic islands and so on - the technical prowess of the movie grips you with its brilliance. The screenplay and the camera-work, and above all, the CGI - the tiger is apparently a product of CGI - are all strong contenders for Academy awards. <br/><br/>But the stronger point of the movie is not its technical details, but the emotional quotient. The entire drama is about the relationship between the tiger and Pi, which is among the most unusual relationships ever seen on the screen. Suraj Sharma delivers a memorable performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He showcases his remarkable ability to have you in splits with his comic timing, and at the same time moves you to tears. It's an extremely challenging role - of having to carry the entire movie on his shoulders - and Sharma does a stellar job.<br/><br/>Towards the end, however, the movie sags down inexplicably, as if the director suddenly ran out of creative ideas and asked one of his understudies to complete the movie. Indeed, it is the last 20-odd minutes which caused me to rate it 7 rather than 9, but despite its shortcomings, Life of Pi remains a must-watch, and one of the favourites for Best Movie and Best Director awards."

"anirudhjaura","9","4","8","25 November 2012"," Life of Pi..is spell-binding!!
","I often try to use the movie name or something about it as part of my blog title. However, nothing short of 'spell-binding' does justice to this one. Ang Lee brings to life practically the impossible – a supposedly unfilmable book is presented in a manner that is a treat for the senses making Life of Pi a must-watch all the way!! <br/><br/>Life of Pi starts off slow and after a time you begin wondering where's all the water, animals and action you saw in the trailer - but patience bears fruit. Once the adventure begins you are completely swept away and by the time the film reaches its abrupt intermission (since there's really no intermission in a Hollywood movie) you are well entrenched in the adventure and in no mood for a break. <br/><br/>There's a lot of talk about the 3D of Life of Pi being better than Avatar. I'd just say that Life of Pi is presented in 3D in an Avatar of its own, the kind that perfectly suits the story that is told. The 3D isn't as extravagant, but peaks up at exactly the right moments and some scenes are sure to give you the thrills you would seek from a 3D movie. Clearly some lessons for all and sundry on how to use 3D in a movie <br/><br/>However, while its a visual spectacle, Life of Pi is a real winner more because of the kind of depth its storyline offers. On the face of it, its an adventure, a tale of courage, hope and survival all very well but peel the layers and you find profound depth and meaning to everything you've witnessed in an entirely different light. I myself believe that I have only scratched the surface of what Life of Pi has to offer apart from its visual treat and best of all the director doesn't push you to think in any given direction. Its for you to think, explore and ponder or not <br/><br/>The performances are top notch too, Suraj Sharma the protagonist does a decent job and pulls off a difficult role. The treatment to his character and his visual appearance is thoughtful and consistent, making his unbelievable story come to life. Irrfan Khan delivers yet again and though his initial accent is a little unbecoming, his emotional delivery later in the movie takes the cake. So does Adil Hussain impress with his impeccable accent and delivery in the earlier part of the movie. The only one wasted, is Tabu who given her range of performance is given a rather simple and short role <br/><br/>The real star of the show is however, Ang Lee – first for believing that such a movie was possible and secondly for presenting it so wondrously - with scenes shot under and over water, at close quarters with a royal Bengal tiger and a host of other superb sequences. <br/><br/>After one has almost given up here comes a real winner. One should never lose hope..so is the case with God, and Hollywood too I guess ;)<br/><br/>To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com"
"adamshl","7","4","8","24 November 2012"," Good film
","This film is so beautiful to see, and the director's production so enthralling, that it rather grieves me to criticize the work, but that I'm compelled to do.<br/><br/>The problem with this is that the adult Pi's interpretation of his adventures both confuses and undermines the narrative. He (and writer) are so committed to making this interpretation as vague and general as possible that it leaves one in limbo.<br/><br/>Likewise such things as the ""canivorous island"" sequence dips into the fantasy idiom, which conflicts with its realistic content, making for muddled genre.<br/><br/>Finally, in an effort to be inclusive regarding Pi's religious background, the writer chose to specify particular religions, thereby muddling the narrative's purity. It would have been better to dramatize the spirituality rather than specify it by naming names. This later limits the story's universality and further complicates the narrative's purpose.<br/><br/>By keeping things as vague as possible, I'm sure many viewers think there's something deep here . . . something mystical and of a high plane. Actually I see it as a smoke screen for appearance sake and special effect.<br/><br/>Still, the director's production is at such a high technical level that the film must be correctly be called ""good."""

"rgkarim","7","4","8","22 November 2012"," I Like Pi's Visuals
","Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.<br/><br/>That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie. <br/><br/>A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. <br/><br/>What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.<br/><br/>To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism"

I guess most Indians are over-rating this trash movie, and there are 120 million Indians in the world! That explains why this movie is over-rated. This plot was flat, predictable and dull.

","""Richard Parker"" was the name of the hero of a true story of cannibalism in history. In 1884, the Mignonette sank, trapping four crew members in the South Atlantic, along with three crew members and a 17 year old footman named Richard Parker. Three adult crew members survived after killing and eating the orphan Richard Parker while adrift at Sea. This film is not an outrageous fantasy story of beauty, nor is it a twisted life choice entangled in religious belief and rational thought. The author and director tactfully and explicitly tell the audience this cruel truth in a way that is almost crazy and implicit, which is the repentance of life, the torture of faith, and the reflection of human nature."
"u-70359","8","1","1","21 January 2020"," Life of Pi review
","Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a beautiful adaptation of a bestselling novel by Yann Martel. It chronicles a young mansu journey to survive after a storm leaves him stranded in the middle of the ocean. The film is colorful and draws the viewer in from the beginning.<br/><br/>The story starts as the young Pi is a child in India. His family owns a zoo. Early on we see the dangers of how fierce these animals can be and why they are in cages. Pi father makes the difficult decision to close the zoo when it goes broke. The family and a few precious animals board a ship headed to Canada. Along the way a storm sinks the ship leaving Pi as the only survivor along with a few of the zoo animals. They are cast adrift in the ocean and forced to survive with the hopes of being rescued. This reminds me of James Cameron's ""Titanic"" (1997), when Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet we're clinging to life in the cold Atlantic waiting for a rescue boat.<br/><br/>The director and cinematographer use several camera angles and CGI (computer generated images) to detail the boys journey. The tiger is obviously CGI although some real animals were used in close up shots. The camera appears to be in the water following the boy, this is the viewpoint we see. Almost all of the movie takes place on open water. They do land on a floating island with trees and plenty of food to eat.<br/><br/>The script is relatively short on dialogue. 75% of the movie I'd Pi on his own. The story gets detailed on how he adapts to life on a raft with a bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Due to natural selection the tiger is the last remaining animal. He and Pi end up having a mutual respect and understanding while adrift. Most of the script is told in the narration of Pi's journey.<br/><br/>The young actor does a great job of seeming unmoved by the events that happened to him. One would think he is either in shock or somehow accepting of what happened to his family. Never once does he give up. He makes the view believe he is confident in finding a way to survive. In the end you feel his sadness when his companion, the bengal tiger, walks away into the jungle.<br/><br/>The movie does move along slowly, but I blame that on screenwriter David Magees lack of material. The bulk of the story takes place at sea and perhaps it could've moved along faster if the director and writer would've used flashbacks to Pi's life. This could've been used to move the journey along and also give viewers a chance to connect with Pi on a more human level by showing how important his family was.<br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Life of Pi"" for its beautiful cinematography and endearing story. The young actor is bold and believable and the CGI did a good job of showing the viewer this fierce beast. It's 127 minutes which could've been shortened up with a few changes in script but overall one of the best movies of 2012."

","Let's get this out of the way: This movie is beautiful to look at. That's not nothing, but it's far from the movie's sole strength. Performances from human and animated creature alike are very good, but it's the interplay of the central story and the framing device that engages me the most.<br/><br/>A novelist visits a middle-aged Indian-Canadian at the advice of the Indian's uncle. Pi, a nickname stemming from his full name of Piscine, the French word for swimming pool, lives a small and quiet life but lived an experience that, he says, will convince the novelist of the existence of God. That's no small feat.<br/><br/>Pi's family owned and operated a zoo in India until it became financially untenable. Pi's father determined that they would move to India, transport the animals with them on the ship, and sell them in Canada. On the trip, the ship sinks for never explained reasons and Pi finds himself alone on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena, and a zebra. The zebra dies due to a leg injury, the hyena kills the orangutan, and as the hyena is about to lunge at Pi, a tiger, Richard Parker, leaps out from the covered half of the boat and kills the hyena. Pi uses his wits to establish a raft roped to the end of the lifeboat where he can rest without fear of the tiger getting to him.<br/><br/>Through adversity, the two learn how to live together. Pi figures out how to net fish large enough for Richard Parker to eat. They survive a large storm together. They find a mysterious island populated with roots that Pi can eat and meerkats that Richard Parker can feast on. This island is an oasis in the middle of the ocean. They can live forever on its fruits, but Pi discovers a human tooth in one of the island's flowers at the same time he sees the pool of fresh water fill with dead fish as it turns to acid. He sees this temporal haven as toxic. He packs up his supplies, gets Richard Parker back on the boat (who seemed to understand the island's dangers before Pi did), and they leave.<br/><br/>I think one of the wonderful things about this narrative is how the novelist finds the metaphor in the story and spells it out. It's the sort of easy metaphor that audiences love because it doesn't require a whole lot of thought and can be easily discerned. The novelist saying, ""the hyena was the cook, the orangutan was your mother, the zebra was the sailor, and Richard Parker was you"" is a great way to cut through the obviousness of the metaphor while also lifting the narrative to be about more than a simple series of symbols. The narrative at the core of the film, the time on the lifeboat, is all about survival. It's pretty straightforward, but Pi had promised a narrative that would convince his audience of the existence of God. A thin metaphor of a story about a boy who survives on the ocean isn't going to do it.<br/><br/>What is meant to convince is the framing device itself. This comes out most forcefully in a scene after Pi gets rescued where he is interviewed by two representatives from the shipping company out of Japan. The rest of the story within the story had been bright and full of color. First there was India in all its visual splendor, then the bright blues of the ocean up against the bright orange of the tiger's fur. The interview is in a small white room with white sheets. It's a simple back and forth cut between Pi telling his story and a couple of reaction shots. It's so flat in comparison to the bright and colorful story we had gotten. It's also much more grounded as he tells was really happened. The sailor died of his wounds. The cook killed Pi's mother in a pique of rage. Pi killed the cook and then survived for 9 months on a lifeboat alone. There was no island, and he simply survived.<br/><br/>""Which story do you like more?"" Pi asks the novelist. ""The one with the tiger,"" he replies.<br/><br/>How is that supposed to make one believe in God? Well, Pi frames the belief in God as a choice. You can chose to believe in the mundane, or you can open yourself up to the grandeur of the unknowable. Life with a God in it is much more interesting and full of meaning than one without it. That concept is conveyed wonderfully by building on a simple story and imbuing it with real meaning.<br/><br/>The movie is, of course, a wonder to behold, but it's also wonderful that it's got so much thematic and character driven depth."

","Have you ever actually physically seen a tiger? I had the tremendous fortune to see one once, at a zoo, concealed behind what I presume was a fairly thick wall of glass. They are sprightly animals: expressive faces, strangely full of both confidence and apprehension; eyes which cut right through you when they stare you down. Their agility is quite striking, gracious, but of course deadly, in their hopping and pouncing to and from their chosen platforms. Between the open-air monkey enclosure; the penguin performance and the tarantula on one of the zoo keeper's arms, the tiger was certainly one of the highlights.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the premise to ""Life of Pi"" is that someone, a teenager, is stuck on a small life raft with one of these beasts in the middle of the ocean. The tiger cannot eat the boy, otherwise it will starve, but of course it doesn't know this, and the boy, who is of course stranded, must fish for food to sustain both his own life but also to keep the tiger at bay. Ang Lee, directing, spins a nimble tale out this idea, borrowing, in terms of imagery and general approach, from some of the more successful films of this stock from recent years: ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Amélie"", for instance, while the sense of being stranded in one place and having to rely on resourcefulness calls to mind ""Cast Away"". You know the types I mean: slick, good looking and colourful dramas which glide along at their own pace. Fans of its genre will enjoy it, but there is a little bit more in there besides in terms of its exploring things to do with morality; evolution and where exactly God sits in the world.<br/><br/>The film begins in the present-day, and so broadly speaking consists of one, long flashback, with the titular Pi, a man of Indian descent, in his Canadian home speaking to a struggling author (Rafe Spall). The author is looking for something with some spark to put down into a book, and he seems to think he's found it in the titular Pi, who experienced what can only be described as a unique experience in his younger life. We flash right the way back to India during Pi's youth, wherein his family runs, in actual fact, a zoo. But amidst all the animals on display, hypnotically put to us via the opening credits sequence, it is the tiger which attracts Pi's attention the most - beautiful but deadly, elegant in its movement and monitoring of its surroundings; fur like velvet you can only stroke when it is under anaesthetic.<br/><br/>In a sense, much of what Pi encounters during this opening act in India has little to do with what the film will come to depict, in that he excels somewhat at mathematics at school; has difficulty communicating with girls and swims a bit, but it presents him as a human-being and a boy who, like any boy, has these experiences at school and home. At the zoo, his father forces him to watch the aforementioned tiger consume a goat when Pi becomes a little too enamoured with the creature, and this kills something inside of him he cannot quite define, although to what extent it had to do with anything later on is unclear. Perhaps his experience at sea was the catharsis he needed to rekindle his lost feelings, but it couldn't be as simple as that, could it?<br/><br/>Lee moves the film into the second act with a dramatic shipwreck sequence when Pi's father feels the family set-up and all involved must move across the ocean to Canada; the going down of the liner and our perspective of it eerily, and I'm sure not wholly accidentally, calling to mind the earlier imagery of Pi's father swimming in the crystal-clear waters of a Parisian pool with the bright blue sky in the background. From here, the meat of the film unfolds as Pi and a scatter-shot crew of animals from varying points on the food-chain uneasily congregate on a lifeboat and are left to float on their own. The passage allows the film to mediate on a variety of things, but only via the perspective of a young boy who has happened to read up on the world's religion, but has also lost everything he had.<br/><br/>Consequently, the film teases us with a Darwinian plight involving the animals which, unsurprisingly, goes the way of the fittest. There is a tantalising moment whereby an Orangutan, the closest to human-beings in an evolutionary sense, seems to realise it needs to put on a life-jacket. Pi confronts God via prayer when he is forced into terminating the life of a fish to survive, something which drags us back to the world of the Old Testament when people were forced into the barbarous action of slaughtering bovine animals in order to live before using God to justify it and writing it all down in Leviticus, a sort of apology to themselves. He then does so again via a means he at least thinks is more physical when a tropical storm strikes the boat and we are, again, reminded of how people in dire situations used to put their circumstance and the natural world around them down to a deity punishing and/or testing them.<br/><br/>The film is all at once a disaster movie; a comedy; a biography and a rumination on life and the world, but it is never enough of any one of these things to have it feel contained or constricted to the generic demands of either of these things. Instead, ""Life of Pi"" is a refreshing and often exhilarating drama with a bite as powerful as any wild cat's."

","A reporter, Rafe Spall, comes to interview Irrfan Khan about his experiences. Told in chunks of flashbacks, we learn the extraordinary story about how he survived a shipwreck and floated along on the ocean on a little raft. By all accounts, he should have died, but since we know he didn't, any suspense we could have felt is replaced by sheer curiosity. The younger Irrfan is played by Suraj Sharma, and in his scenes, he has to interact with tons of computer graphics. Tumbled into the lifeboat with him are a ménage of animals: a zebra, a monkey, a hyena, and a tiger. In order to survive, he's forced to eat the animals until only the tiger is left for company. As the movie shows, with a tiger and a tiny survival manual, a man can weather any storm.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is visually pleasing, but the symbolism won't appeal to everyone. If you're the type of person who really loves deep, symbolic stories that you can talk about for hours or weeks, you'll probably really love this movie. I haven't read the original novel, but friends of mine who have were very pleased by the film adaptation.<br/><br/>I was completely taken aback by this movie and had no idea it would be so dramatic. After seeing the vague preview, I thought it was going to be a cheerful cartoon with a talking tiger, like The Jungle Book set in a lifeboat. You can imagine how surprised I was as the movie unfolded and not only did the tiger not talk, but it wasn't very friendly. However, even I ended up appreciating the film. Even I ended up in tears at the end.<br/><br/>Give it a shot if you want to, as long as you know the tiger doesn't talk. After all, you've got to see what everyone's been talking about for seven years, right?<br/><br/>DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend.

","The movie 'Life of Pi' (2012) is written by David Magee and based on the original novel 'Life of Pi' (2001) by Yann Martel. It is produced and directed by Ang Lee and stars Suraj Sharma in the main role as Pi Patel. The picture can be categorized into the genres adventure, drama and fantasy.
Before jumping straight into this review, I am going to give you a quick synopsis for the movie.
At first, Pi Patel and his family live in India and his father is the owner of a zoo. Their biggest highlight is the tiger with the name of 'Richard Parker'. Our main character Pi lives his teenage life as a Hindu, Catholic and Muslim which is contrary to his scientifically minded father who doesn't believe in God thinking that ""religion is darkness"". After some time his father decides that the Patel family will move from India to Canada on a cruise ship. Instead of a comfortable ride on the ship, the passengers and crew members are involved in a thunderstorm. In the following, the ship has to be evacuated however only Pi manages to get on a lifeboat as well as a few animals that he gets on board with, such as a zebra, the orangutan 'Orange Juice', a hyena and the tiger 'Richard Parker'. Unfortunately for the innocent and helpless herbivores on the boat, the impatient carnivores start eating them. As a result, the tiger Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena as well, leaving only Pi behind who is in constant danger of getting himself killed whenever he approaches him or nears himself to the wild animal. Over the course of time, Pi builds a relationship with the tiger trying to survive the sea together while also hoping to be rescued.<br/><br/>As 'Life of Pi' (2012) unfolds, the viewer really gets to appreciate the artistic vision of the director. Ang Lee did a fantastic job at making his story believable, grounded and realistic. His great directing is further on emphasized by his incredible visual effects team who did an outstanding and visually astonishing job with the animation of all the animals included plus the animation of the cruise ship and the animation of clouds being reflected on the surface of the water during gorgeous sunsets. In the making of 'Life of Pi', Ang Lee had his crew build an entire set for this movie. He tried to do as many things with practical effects as he could, even bringing a real tiger and hyena on set for 2 weeks in order to make the animals and the scenes look as realistic as possible. The visual effects team used the real tiger to animate the CGI animal. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Deservedly so, 'Life of Pi' (2012) won the Oscar for 'Best Achievement in Visual Effects' besides the other 3 wins for 'Best Original Score', 'Best Achievement in Cinematography' and 'Best Directing'.
The heart of this movie is first-time actor Suraj Sharma who plays Pi Patel in a very realistic way knowing how to act in completely different situations. He masters his scenes with great acting giving a believable and emotional performance that resonates with the audience. Another strong point of this picture is how the character-driven storytelling can be a real tear-jerker for the viewer.
The screenplay seems to have been translated very nicely onto the big screen. The concept of this story is great and the execution of the idea from the script was also very well handled. 'Life of Pi' dives into really dark and mysterious thematics in its own mythology. However this movie does leave me slightly empty-handed because it should have spent more time on the developing relationship between Pi and the tiger. Instead of a strictly cohesive, unfolding story, we get a smidgen rash plot that definitely explores the relationship but it treats the philosophy between the two characters in a too superficial way.
On the other hand, the story is nicely compelling and fascinating, but the viewer already knows that the protagonist makes it out alive because throughout the entire movie an older Pi Patel tells his life story to an author who is interested in his dangerous, traumatic experience, just like the audience, which makes the ending kind of predictable. Unfortunately this undermines the tension created by the filmmaker. There is also an odd mixture of great dialogue and superficial conversations with deep content that should have been dug deeper into. The editing and the transition between two scenes were very smooth. The director of photography Claudio Miranda did incredibly effective work with his astounding cinematography by using a lot of wide shots in the limelight. These amazingly shot sequences are very frequently supported and underlined by the visual effects team with 1226 members being involved in the process. One of the absolute strengths of this motion picture is the very melancholic, atmospheric and beautiful score by Mychael Danna, Rob Simonsen and Mike Nowak. The music switches from cultural and traditional Hindi music to epic Hollywood blockbuster type of music in appropriate segments of the movie.
'Life of Pi' is mostly well paced which is really pleasant to watch and to experience. This also comes in very handy since it is an adventure movie. However this movie also suffers from slower parts that drag the film down quite a bit and feel even a little bit jarring for the viewer. But this is more of a nitpick instead of a huge problem.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Life of Pi' is a very good motion picture with an interesting philosophy on religion that I won't go into further on because that would result in me talking about spoilers which I want to avoid for this movie specifically.<br/><br/>It is also refreshing to see that 'Life of Pi' is a movie that resonated with audiences in its theatrical run while being a smash hit at the box office making 609 million dollars on a 120-million-dollar production budget.
I definitely recommend 'Life of Pi' to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. 8/10"

","With its' poetic realism and sickly, spiritual subtext, Yann Martel's international bestselling novel Life of Pi was once declared unfilmable. Until now. Directed by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Ang Lee, even if the plot stinks; this beautiful adventure movie is an absolute must-see.<br/><br/>Newcomer Suraj Sharma stars as Piscine Molitor Patel, aka Pi; a well-educated, wistful teenager growing up on the grounds of his family's zoo in Pondicherry, India. The curious son of liberal parentage, Pi is fascinated by the religions of the world, studying them in detail but undecided, what is the correct path for him. Finding the answer and his soul mate, his father declares that the family are broke and must relocate to Canada. Boarding a cargo ship with his family and the anaesthetised exotic animals resting in the hull underneath, their journey across the Pacific is disrupted by the perfect storm; sending the vessel plunging to the seabed. The only human survivor, orphaned Pi is left stranded aboard a lifeboat with a hysterical hyena, wounded zebra, benevolent orangutan and a Bengalese Tiger called Richard Parker.<br/><br/>You don't have to be an ethologist to see that Pi's predicament would cause an infinite number of problems. Once the animals clash, our hero is left as the carnivorous Richard Parker's final prey. But through his resourcefulness and spirituality, Pi manages to survive the fatal claws of his feline shipmate and, over a period of 227 days, the pair end up forming a remarkable relationship, built on companionship, fear and the mutual hope that they will one day be rescued.<br/><br/>Words cannot describe how stunning this movie is to look at. With the help of cinematographer Claudio Miranda and a committed special effects team, the Oscar-Winning filmmaker behind Brokeback Mountain and the ill-fated comic-book hero Hulk has directed the first ever 3-D Art film. A bottomless box of visual delights, colours have never been so vivid, landscapes so luscious or 3D so fantastic. Instead of distancing us from the action on-screen, causing light-loss and nausea, the once-dreaded stereoscopic glasses deepen our engagement with Pi & Parker's ordeal. An extraordinary quest where they encounter millions of flying fish skittering past them, phosphorescent jellyfish glowing underneath, a breaching whale gliding across the starry skyline and an island inhabited by 60,000 Meerkats.<br/><br/>In his debut role, Sharma is fantastic as Pi, able to balance religious fervour, comical flourish and irrepressible charm, even if his supporting catty cast member was almost entirely a digital creation, blended into the live action seamlessly. It's incredibly refreshing to see the ironically named Richard Parker never anthropomorphized. He doesn't talk, nor even exist in the real world, yet his presence in Pi's is what saves him, and ultimately the film, from excessive ""is there a god?"" ruminations.<br/><br/>Adapted by screenplay writer David Magee (Finding Neverland), the cinematic spectacle does it's best to cloak what is ostensibly a very corny plot, but elements of the baggy original novel still creep in. In typical Forest Gump style, most of the story unravels through recollection, with a present day Pi (played by Irrfan Khan), living in Montreal and narrating the tale to a curious Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). It's a telling-over-showing narrative compromise lifted directly from Martel's novel. A thorny branch that jolts the audience back into the mundane world we are all used to, and away from the wonderful realm where we'd rather be.<br/><br/>Whilst my atheism was left unscathed, the rapturous aestheticism rekindled my passion for big blockbuser cinema. Life of Pi is a much-needed bit of heart-warming magic during this frosty festive season.<br/><br/>Find more reviews at www.366movies.com"

","Taking big risks with big payoffs in directing, writing, production and casting were reasons enough for this movie to have won the Oscar for best movie. The story is tight and keeps you focused as no other movie I've seen in years. This movie breaks ground as it doesn't reprocess any story lines like there were in other movies that were in Oscar contention. Because this movie is unique I have to admit it took me a good half hour to get into the swing of what was going on.

","Well. I just wrote a magnificent and long review of this film and then my computer refreshed itself. But i started it like this. I don't know where to start. The great new Leading Actor, this magnificent achievement in Directing, or this phenomenal use of CGI and computer animation. Piscine ""Pissing"" Molitor Patel's life is amazing. I love this movie, flat out. I can only imagine how long and descriptive the book is. Suraj Sharma (Pi) is a fantastic new Leading Actor in this movie. Especially since his supporting actor is the one and only Richard Parker. No, Richard Parker isn't a great actor you haven't heard of, Richard Parker is the name of the tiger seen on the boat with Pi. It is very hard to talk about this movie without giving away any of the plot. But i can say that this young man and his acting incorporated with the visionary computer animations was fantastic. The CGI and Computer animation in this film is in one compound word. Ground-breaking. Even better than Avatar. When you and I are in our elderly years, you being the reader, we will show this to our grandchildren as ""The movie that changed how the world looked at CGI."" I know that CGI has been around for a while as it is a newer thing but i truly think this is the first great usage of Computer Animation in a motion picture. I hope that Ang Lee is proud of himself and his crew. No other person could tell this story the way he/they did. The Achievement in Directing Oscar he was awarded was well deserved. The cast and crew captured this story the best way possible. I loved it. That is all i have to say. I recommend this movie to any and all."
"boydsrus","3","7","20","10 January 2013"," An incredible disappointment
","The first 5minutes of this Ang Lee creation are thoroughly absorbing as you are introduced to a sublime immersion in an incredibly well handled 3D film experience. The following 20mins offer an interestingly warm and humorous introduction to the childhood of the main character. However a raging cold tap is soon turned on as we are treated to a clichéd flashback/reminiscence scenario as 'Pi' relates his tale in an unconvincing manner to an unconvincing 'author' on various park benches and other random seated areas. Indeed Ang Lee suddenly and without explanation has them at the park after previously seeing them in an apartment eating lunch which is a very heavy handed and lazy attempt at creating a bit of narrative. That's by the by as the heart of the film is obviously the boat experience. It has it's moments, some are breathtaking but not nearly enough so to make up for a very very slowly progressing story that repeats mundane scenes with little variation and in the end despite the visuals becomes quite tiresome. The problem is it doesn't live up to the promise. Pi says he has a tale that will make you believe in God. He doesn't. He has a lost at see alone tale with and not much else. In fact just as you come to the conclusion (after endless attempts at forgiveness) that this film isn't deep, moving or at all inspired the story is turned on it's head in a confusing and upsetting way. The overall feeling is of betrayal. And the manipulative emotional music slapped over the monologue quickly becomes sickening. You are left with nothing except a desire to walk out of the cinema. No sympathy for anyone, no astonishment, no surprise...well that the film doesn't work on any level is quite surprising. Overall is very little here apart from stunning CGI. There are no revelations about the character, his experience or life in general. If it was made by Disney is would undoubtedly have been a more fulfilling and moving film."

If you think you are going to a movie about a kid who survives a shipwreck and then makes friends with a tiger at sea, you will be very disappointed. If you love animals and it breaks your heart to see them hurt, then you will be sick to your stomach. There is not one single thing regarding the animals in this movie that is good to animals. I was horrified at what happens to animals in this movie. So, if you are not sensitive to the pain of animals, go see it. If you are, then this is your warning.<br/><br/>The sad part of this is that the ""regular guy"" on the street, like me, will go to this movie. I cried through half of the movie because it made me sad. Movie critics go on about how great it is.

You could remove the intro and ending add just a minute to the story and make this an epic tale of survival in the most incredible of circumstances, albeit with a rather fantastically mystical ambiance at times, but the attempts to weakly convey a religious message ruined the entire drama.<br/><br/>More telling, perhaps, is that it even failed on delivering on its own religious message. Not so much as causing one to think for a second as to its initial claims... except to wonder when the big moment was to come, only to be greeted with the closing credits."

","When I heard that the film adaptation of LIFE OF PI was being released, I made sure to go and read the novel beforehand so I could compare it to the movie. I'm not a huge fan of Ang Lee and his overrated CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this. But I needn't have worried; this is a great movie, a film that fully explores the splendour of cinema and on-screen storytelling, and a film that's better than the book.<br/><br/>The early and, quite frankly, boring parts of the novel are summarised well so that the storytelling is always on the move. The focus is on the survival narrative, which is as it should be, and the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker is brought to vivid and moving life. Sure, there are the occasional mis-steps along the way, like an ill-advised and tacked-on romance, but for the most part they get it right. The CGI is wondrous, especially the animals and an eye-popping shipwreck, and the story is moving, tender in places and full of heart. I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes in parts, and it's all down to Richard Parker, who must go down as one of the great animal characters in cinema. A great example of filming the unfilmable."
"sublimineyes","Null","3","7","22 December 2012"," A dishonest sugar coated soufflé of a film
","This isn't to say that I dislike soufflés. I don't. And it's unfair of me really to associate the sublime quality of something so tasty with this mess, but I keep thinking those behind the film must have had soufflé on the mind when they concocted it.<br/><br/>Visually 'wow'? - check Full of hot air? - check Style over substance? - check<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while a restaurant doesn't offer a soufflé by claiming it is sirloin steak, the same can't be said of the people behind Life Of Pi (the film. Surely the book can't be this bad).<br/><br/>The heart of the problem is that 'our hero' states early on something like 'I will make you believe in God'. What follows is a very drawn out act set on the lifeboat of the poster, with sumptuous visuals, thoughts (shallow, but still thoughts) and zoo animals to endear it to the viewer, followed by a short act in a grey hospital with pestering insurance agents and real life to do the opposite. Had the 2 been in any way balanced, this could have become an interesting story about how religion helped the 'hero' survive his ordeal as he struggled with the elements and himself (the tiger), while letting viewers choose for themselves how they would have survived and whether any religious belief would have helped. But they weren't, and all the tricks of the sugar rich soufflé are bound to win over most viewers and try to convince them they've seen a 'meaningful' film. They haven't.<br/><br/>I should add that I saw this in 2D (had the benefit of stopping the sugar overload getting to me). Which means a side point. If you've got ear plugs handy and just want to see visual imagination at work, it might be worthwhile sticking em in and seeing this in 3D. If, on the other hand, you want to see what all the fuss is about and want to make your own mind up, see it in 2D to avoid the 3D sugar coating. Best of all though, spend your money and time on a proper soufflé at a restaurant somewhere."
"braddugg","2","15","60","24 November 2012"," An adventure that gave me seasickness
","A silly dumb adventure that sails on sea for most part and left me with seasickness.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I was hearing claps in the theatre and I was wondering what have they liked so much in the film because I did not like anything. Yes, the visual effects were good, but nowhere near a movie like JURASSIC PARK. Don't even compare with AVATAR please. The plot, oh, where is the plot, a boy gets lost in a sea because of a thunderstorm and he takes a trip with a tiger and for the good part of it, both are struck together in sea. The episode was too long for me and just made me feel like it's giving me seasickness. <br/><br/>Now, where did it go wrong? If I may say so, then in the writing itself that does not involve audience much. That is, it did not do anything to me. It neither thrilled me nor moved me nor made me laugh out loud. It went on and on and got me drowsy by the end. <br/><br/>The only good thing is special effects that are good, but I am sure many movies in recent past have come with better effects and better ideas. Hailed by many as one of the best films of this year, I would rather say, it's a boring adventure. It is good for the first half hour or even an hour I would say, but after that it goes on and on and the sad part is it has inevitable end. It's not a kind of movie that could have ended anyway, the adventure has to end and the boy has to grow and the big Pi (Irrfan Khan) is going to tell this to his friend. <br/><br/>Hey, now there is a twist, he tells this adventure and he tells a believable story while normal people stick to his believable story, his writer friend likes the adventure. So I as audience, had to give in to something and I was rather interested in the story he told than this adventure. <br/><br/>The best moments are done in the first half an hour itself with Pi and his family in Pondicherry, once he gets on a ship, and gets lost, it stays for sometime, but man, those jelly fish, those whales, even that royal Bengal tiger that was made in CGI did not help me liking it. So I disliked it to the core. Once, he said Richard Parker (Tiger) was gone at the end, I fell into sleep, I just couldn't take that. Damn, we had been there at the very night of a day (Night 11 PM show) and with all the pains taken, we see an adventure end just like that. <br/><br/>It meant nothing for me, and I am going with a 1/5. This 1 rating is for the special effects and the gorgeous titles that were good but not great. Ang Lee, you squeezed me in to this film and you gave me a bad film so this is what I give you back, a negative review. <br/><br/>I suppose I among the very few who are going to criticize this movie as most others are going gaga over this. It's okay; I have my own mind anyways."
"borninca","4","7","23","26 November 2012"," Nice effects, but boring movie
","Nice visual effects, but sorry, the movie was boring. There were so many elements introduced that could have played out as being relevant to the story, but in the end didn't connect together at all. We learn how Pi got his name. That is amusing, but so what? He could have been named Paul or Peter. Being named Pi had nothing to do with the story, and so was a waste of screen time. Similarly, other elements introduced early on carried no meaning in the story. The book was the same way. It's like the author ""felt"" there had to be some meaning there, and so he threw a spaghetti mess of ideas on the wall, hoping some strands would stick. Shoddy story telling. I will say the visual effects were nice. But... visual effects these days do not a movie make. Very disappointing effort over all."

","The dialogue throughout Life of Pi essentially hits you over the head with its purpose from the start: I'm going to make you believe in God. The story does nothing of the sort, and its shallow and irrational protagonist was fairly annoying.<br/><br/>Life of Pi reinforces a pattern set by other western movies supposedly about Indians, promoting a hokey 'spiritualism' with patronizingly simpleminded characters and bright colors.<br/><br/>Pi's conversion to essentially all the major religions in India shows from the beginning that this movie is going to advocate a shallow and ambiguous spiritualism, and ask you to follow a painfully irrational character's actions. Pi is highly emotional and overacted throughout. Perhaps if there was a God to save Pi and help him survive, He wouldn't have caused the shipwreck and death of his entire family in the first place. But it quickly became clear that this was going to be thoughtless entertainment designed to reinforce the beliefs of believers. Bright colors, vivid CGI, and hokey music replaced a substantive plot and message. Instead we are unsubtly told to embrace blind faith, and look at pretty colors while we're at it."
"amaze-mas-x","4","4","11","25 January 2013"," Eh..
","Am I the only one who found most of this film boring? At the beginning it seemed like it would be a good, funny film. It seemed stupid but a bit funny at the start. Irrfan Khan is a good actor and I have seen him in other films. He was particularly good in Billu Barber. He was okay in this film too but obviously did not get much screen time. There was quite an emphasis on religion and God at the beginning which seemed lost to me later in the film. I thought there would be some big connection at least at the end of the film that would explain the whole thing properly but the beginning seemed pointless compared to the ending. The film seemed realistic in an unrealistic way, if that makes sense. The scenes were beautiful, of course. My favourite scene was of the whale that splashed out of the water near Pi's boat. I found myself in reverie (personal thoughts) in a couple of places through the film. To me, the film was boring. The connection between Pi and the tiger. His attempts to survive. Oh wait.. I also liked the island scene with the meerkats. Maybe that's because I like meerkats anyway but I thought the idea was pretty interesting. An island that no one else has really seen. It makes you think. Other than that.. eh, I felt a lot of the people in the cinema were also disappointed. I may be wrong.. judging by the comments on here. I just felt that they could have made a better survival story out of this. The whole thing with the animals seemed stupid. I can't remember many of the points I had in mind about the film because I watched it around 2/3 weeks ago. I thought it was a waste of time but maybe I should have read the book first. It would have probably been a good read. I'm not sure what to rate it? Lower maybe. I'll leave it at 4/10."
"Caterpillar_City","6","4","11","22 December 2012"," Life of Pi is visually magnificent but a thematic dud.
","Life of Pi will undoubtedly receive much attention this award season, and it will appear on many top 10 lists. Some aspects of the movie are deserving of praise, other are not. The visuals in Life of Pi are consistently astounding, both from a technical and artistic level. Ang Lee and his crew do wonders with color, getting a lot of mileage out of the contrast between the white lifeboat against a crystalline blue ocean and the bright orange Bengal tiger. Whether viewed in 2D or 3D, Life of Pi absolutely pops off the screen. There are several scenes that show a level of majestic beauty that most that have to be seen to be believed. The cinematography is also creative, and it has to be. Much of the film takes place on a small lifeboat and Pi's makeshift raft, but this section rarely drags thanks to creative camera-work. The CGI is equally impressive. The shipwreck sequence may be the most stunning scene in any movie from 2012, and the computer generated animals are very convincing. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie falters in its storytelling. The first problem is in the employment of a frame narrative, which is truly bizarre and unnecessary. The story is told in flashbacks as an adult Pi tells a writer his story, from his childhood to his experience stranded in the ocean. The way the story is told removes any tension from the plot, for the viewer already knows Pi survives and ends up living a normal life. More importantly, the scenes with Pi and the writer are incredibly dull and feel removed from the proper narrative thrust. Life of Pi would work much better as a straight narrative. It would be tighter -- about fifteen minutes could be removed, and the movie would lose nothing -- and Pi's story would feel more immediate and suspenseful.<br/><br/>This film also suffers from some pacing issues. The first act details Pi's childhood, and I did find this segment quite enjoyable. It served as a fine introduction to the main character and the film's visual style. Then we get to the incredible shipwreck segment and the story truly gets underway. All of the advertising will lead you to believe that Pi's time on the lifeboat is shared solely with the tiger, but before that Pi contends with a zebra, hyena, and an orangutan. This portion is rushed and we do not get to spend enough time with these animals before the tiger comes in. This is particularly problematic when the ending unfolds, for these animals serve an important purpose, but they feel ancillary instead of essential. <br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, Life of Pi's biggest issue lies in the final ten minutes, which are so catastrophically bad that the movie is rendered almost completely redundant. I did check that this review contains spoilers, but I won't go into details about the ending, so nobody accidentally stumbles upon them. I understand the movie is based on a book and the filmmakers wanted to follow the events therein. I have not read the novel, and I don't know how the author handled the ""twist,"" but the film completely botches it. Almost everything that precedes the ending is retroactively ruined and made less significant, all in the favor of serving some thematic purpose. Life of Pi is not nearly as profound as it thinks it is. The message is poorly handled; for a movie that is so visually stunning, the storytelling is obsessed with telling the audience the message, symbolism, allegory, and themes. I left the movie insulted by the filmmakers, who think their audience would be too daft to understand their movie, so in the last ten minutes they drive home their point with the subtlety of a sledgehammer."

","What we have here is a film that has no direction. Is it an art film or a blockbuster? None of them. While Ang Lee usually has great cinematography, here it serves no purpose, even if it tries to.
Of course, there are big problems with the CGI here. It looks unpleasant for me, it simply doesn't work - it looks fake, especially when it's overused. I'm truly disappointed with Ang Lee for agreeing to use such massive amounts of CGI... Maybe I'm too subjective on this matter, but it really dragged the film down for me.
Another disappointing aspect is that the film literally tells you that it's actually symbolic. <Look, THIS symbol and THIS one, those are SYMBOLS. The ending is also VERY SYMBOLIC because even the things you thought that were not symbolic, it turns out they WERE SYMBOLS.> This forced cheap symbolism really annoyed me.

","It could have been an enjoyable movie, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth. From the beginning the movie seems to be pandering to some wishy- washy conventional ""respect-all-religions"" message, but it's only a front. By the end it becomes clear that the message of this movie is something even more insidious: that life is cold and cruel and meaningless, and humans just like to make up pretty stories to placate ourselves. <br/><br/>The movie would have been fine if they had just told the story without pushing the theme so ham-handedly. The story is touching, the imagery beautiful and masterfully done, it has scenes you'll never forget. But then at the end the movie cuts off it's own legs with its cynical theme."
"awelshmancymru","5","2","4","3 January 2014"," To much CGI window dressing
","First off I have never read the book. If a film is going to work it has to function by itself, that is why the Lord of the Rings movies work and the Harry Potter ones don't (not that i've read either of those franchises either). To understand a film's basic plot it should not be necessary for me to go and do some wider reading afterwards. If it's required then the director simply did a bad job at telling the story. I say this not to claim that Life of Pi does not work as a narrative, but only to point out that my interpretation of that narrative will be based on the film alone and not on what I think the original author was trying to say.<br/><br/>When Life of Pi was released it was heralded as a ground breaking visual effects movie which would change the way we looked at 3D for years to come. Of course they said the same about Smurfahontis (Avatar) a few years back, and that actually changed little once everyone realised it was a silly story wrapped up in some fancy CGI (sad to think that James Cameron hasn't made a movie I've enjoyed since True Lies in 1994).<br/><br/>For me the same could be said for Life of Pi. While the visuals are impressive, I can't help but conclude that they are little more than window dressing which mask a story which failed to engage me. Nevertheless I can still appreciate the work which went into it and the resultant aesthetic.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why it failed to engage me. As a survival story it has no tension given that it's told through flashbacks, so we know Pi made it out alive. No doubt many would claim that i've missed the point by saying this, that rather than a survival story Life of Pi is actually a deeply spiritual movie about the nature of being, memory and God, rather than simply one about someone trying to survive a shipwreck with a tiger.<br/><br/>But while I appreciate that the film may be attempting to address these issues I found the way it did so utterly superficial and uninteresting. Pi begins his tail by setting out the claim that his story will make an author believe in God. How continues to be a mystery for me as even if you accept his initial telling as reality, I failed to see anything remotely divine in its contents. To me there was simply nothing there which needed a God to explain its existence (well except all the continuity errors).<br/><br/>However, the film's final scenes perhaps get to the root of this question better than anything before it, and are perhaps the trump card the movie decides to play. In simple terms it decides to acknowledge all of its own flaws by offering the viewer an alternative version of everything we have seen and highlighting the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that the other version of the story is any more valid that the one we have seen. Further to this it then implies that the decision we make as to which story we choose to believe answers the question of whether we make the choice to believe in God, given the lack of proof on either side.<br/><br/>Now at best this is an extremely flimsy philosophical argument. Presenting the viewer with two options (a seen but implausible one, and an unseen but more plausible one) and then suggesting that their choice is symptomatic of how they interpret their own wider reality is deeply questionable if not dishonest.<br/><br/>But perhaps I am just disappointed that I didn't get to see a film about the human drama of four starving shipwreck survivors drifting across the Pacific Ocean. However, while that may sound a lot less impressive visually than what Life of Pi delivers, it is nonetheless what the film's own logic claims to be if you remove all of its CGI trickery.

","After reading the book, I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie, but had high hopes. And I wasn't disappointed. Ang Lee was able to capture every emotion, every important detail and spin a very compelling tale, while leaving out a couple of details from the book that, in my opinion, needed to be left out. The flashbacks between present day and past were perfectly timed, and the actors playing Pi were flawless. And a big thumbs up to the animal trainers! The tiger displayed just the right amount of ferocity balanced with compassion and a recognition of the precarious situation he was in . And the visual effects.....simply amazing! <br/><br/>In most cases, I (as most others do) find movies based on books to be sorely lacking. This was not the case here. The entire team did a superb job in bringing this excellent book to life."
"l_rawjalaurence","5","2","4","14 July 2013"," A Visual Feast, but Not Much Else
","LIFE OF PI is quite simply a visual feast of spectacle. From the Indian locations of Pondicherry in the past, to the sequences taking place at sea, a quite wonderful evocation of an uninhabited island where the plants are predatory, to the final sequence taking place in sunlit suburbia in Canada, the film is full of memorable images. The moments involving the animals - especially Richard Parker the tiger - are equally memorable; if they have been created using CGI, they certainly did not seem so. Director Ang Lee has a wonderful way of suggesting the animal's predatory nature, yet at the same time its straightforwardness (unlike the human characters). At the same time, I have to admit that the plot of LIFE OF PI is slight, to say the least: one can understand the central character's desire to discover himself and his relationship to God, but the progress of moving towards self-awareness is sometimes a slow one. The film drags on occasions; one wishes that more character- conflict had been introduced, especially involving Gérard Depardieu, who has a memorable cameo as an obstreperous ship's cook."
"p-jonsson","4","2","4","17 May 2013"," Beautiful to watch but hugely overrated as a movie
","I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended. We bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie."

","I thought the storytelling and narrative were great. I loved how things were told in the past tense. The acting was also great.<br/><br/>One part, obviously, which stood out completely was the CG effects. This movie was beautiful, and everything looked incredible. The waves, the water, the colors, the animals, the scenes, looked stunning.<br/><br/>Despite these great parts, the movie fell short of the great potential it could have had. Though touting that the movie would make you believe in god, I found nothing in it doing so. While he did touch upon the idea of ""choosing what we want to believe"", I feel the idea was undeveloped. He could have developed a strong overarching universal message about life or choice, but he failed to pull through. The movie definitely set the stage and enabled him to do so if he really tried. Despite this, there really was no clear universal or moral message - it was way too ambiguous. For this reason, while this movie was good, it could have been even greater."

","I Was in two minds about ""Life of Pi,"" but hearing its high praise from others made me curious enough too see it.<br/><br/>I Can still see it as something people will either take or leave though. Its about an Indian boy who gets trapped on a boat with a tiger, so seems like a random idea to begin with. Or is it an original idea? Either way, its both so visually amazing, and beatifically weird, how the film makes a full length feature out off such a bizarre subject, that its hard to ignore. Making me understand where its Oscar nods are coming from.<br/><br/>It does get a bit too weird later on though, and despite having some laughs, it can hardly be described as a comedy. In fact its hard to figure out what ""Life of PI"" wants to be, but maybe that's part off what makes it so new and unique. Its special effects are what got it noticed, and they are very good, even though that damn tiger does seem to change size throughout the movie. Something the animators still seem too have trouble getting right, even these days."

","When the Narrator of the story is in the title, you can be sure the Narrator will not die. Pi (Suraj Sharma) is the Narrator. He and his family are on their way to Canada to sell their family zoo. A storm comes up and wrecks the ship and the only survivors are: Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger (so named Richard Parker due to a cargo manifest order mix-up when the family bought him). Peter Parker was already taken. HA! <br/><br/>After the Tiger eats the other animals, Pi decides he needs to teach the Tiger to fish or he will be eaten too. Wait, that's not right. What to do? What to do? Well, there is only one solution left and Pi hopes Richard Parker has enough intelligence to catch on. <br/><br/>Now, getting the heavy stuff out of the way, there are 2-stories in here and which will you believe? The mystical one: a tiger and boy on a life boat; or a more believable one where Pi's mother, a seaman, and cook are in the life boat with Pi? Much of this has to do with a belief in God or having faith as the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) unfolds the story to a writer who was told he would believe in God when he heard Pi's story. <br/><br/>Okay, good choice. You selected the boy and the tiger. Once they are in the boat together, there is nothing but tension, wariness, anger, fear and really too much suspense. But this never drags. It is like you are Pi and watching out for the tiger every minute of the day and night; and you don't dare rest – and even though we are watching from a comfortable couch, we cannot rest either. We are riveted as is Pi. <br/><br/>Yes, there is much CGI in here but everything is so well done, we are still afraid to sleep. We see Pi put together a make-shift raft away from the boat attached with a tether. Now Pi is able to get some restand we try too. <br/><br/>We see storms with very high waves, lightning, sharks, whales, flying fish come upon Pi and the tiger and even though Pi, as a very young boy, experimented with Catholicism (even asked to be baptized), and Islam it was the Hindu god Vishnu who he thanked for saving them time and time again. Hey, you go with what you know.<br/><br/>The cinematography and photography are simply outstanding. <br/><br/>Did you go with what you know when you selected your choice as I asked above? Do you know why the Tiger didn't look back at Pi when they landed on the sand? When you know the answer to that, you then know which story was the true one. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

","So, a young man, Pi, en route to Canada with his family and the remains of the zoo they have left behind in India, is shipwrecked along with a Bengal tiger. The focus of the movie is on Pi's manner of survival and his relationships with the vastness of the ocean and 'Richard Parker' - the tiger!<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film - but in much the same way that an Attenborough documentary is beautiful. There are one or two spectacular effects which justify the use of 3D. But I'm not a fan of 3D and rather than increasing the feeling of involvement, I find it has a distancing effect, particularly when watching ordinary scenes of conversation between Pi and the writer, or Pi's family round the dinner table. The added perspectives seem artificial. Add to that the fact that you know from the beginning that he is rescued and the dramatic potential of the story was, for me, diminished. Whilst this meant that you could concentrate on his relationship with the tiger without distraction, it left me by the end wondering whether what I'd been watching had much meaning. The 'twist' in the tale seemed rather an afterthought, as did the notion that the whole movie had been some kind of allegory. Pi's question to the writer at the end - ""Which story do you prefer?"" - seemed to carry insufficient weight for it to be the heart of the film. Although I enjoyed it, I nevertheless felt somewhat underwhelmed by it."
"rgcustomer","7","2","4","27 November 2012"," A story about lying
","At the end of Life of Pi, the talented liar Pi asks the visiting Writer to choose between his two stories -- one a short brutal story of human cruelty and desperation, and the other a long romantic story of bonding with a dangerous animal. (Despite Pi's stated claims, gods actually don't play any part in the long story).<br/><br/>Nobody proposes that the Writer (or audience) should reject both of Pi's stories, even though that's good advice.<br/><br/>The Writer of course chooses the more detailed and uplifting romantic story. It saves him from having to come up with it himself. Presumably, this is the manner in which the Writer is convinced to ""believe in (some) god"" although that's never said directly. In any case, his goal is to sell books, not to seek truth. It's not hard to guess which story is going to sell, and real life is in the process of confirming it.<br/><br/>But the audience eventually wants the truth. We're clearly to assume that one of the stories is true (within the context of the film). Pi insists both stories are possible, suggesting we can freely choose equally. But that's not quite correct. Probabilities must be weighed. I buy the tiger story, up to a point (although perhaps I shouldn't... remember the scorpion and frog story from The Crying Game: ""it's in my nature""). But for me, probability ends at the ""carnivorous island"". It's extremely unlikely that there would be an undetectable island literally covered with fish-eating meerkats, who act indifferently to being eaten themselves, as depicted in the film. I'm more likely to believe in a mentally ill, bigoted ship's cook who takes advantage of a crisis to torture and kill. There is plenty of reason to believe that story over the other. It happens all the time on land.<br/><br/>Somewhere between the two probabilities, it's also possible that the liar Pi survived at sea alone, and didn't just make up one bold lie, but two. But that would be a dull story, and Pi is clearly not one to tolerate boredom and dullness.<br/><br/>The Japanese men appeared to accept the brutal story, but we're never told whether they transmitted that story to others. What of the families of the men claimed to be on the lifeboat? This story would have been an outrage, with possible legal consequences.<br/><br/>Pi's story, because he so easily bears false witness, is unmoving, and I wasn't made into a believer by watching this film. If anything, it all fits comfortably with my unbelief. The film concludes in such a way as to demonstrate that these fanciful and sometimes pretty stories are there to hide darker ones, or more boring ones, and also to cast those who doubt them as somehow being suspect of supporting bad outcomes. We know this is how religion works, but it's nice to see it spelled out so clearly on the big screen.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it's quite an achievement in animation mixed with live action, and 3D cinematography. I'll have to see what The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does with high-frame rate, but Life of Pi should certainly be up for some significant awards in that area. (Yet, truly James Cameron is still the undefeated master of sinking a ship, and creating marvels that glow in the darkness.) <br/><br/>Last, I also just saw Kumaré, which I recommend as a good double-feature with this film."

","As someone who had not read the Life of Pi book, I really did not have any knowledge of this story or what to expect other than what I had seen in the trailer. It seemed like it would be an interesting enough tale and I was curious about what had transpired to bring a young man and a Bengal tiger together in a life boat. This was a spiritual journey that I was so thrilled to have experienced on the big screen. The entire story was filled with opposing ideologies beginning with Pi's discovery of religion. It was interesting that he was able to take a rational look at various religions and apply the teachings to his life that were beneficial, even life saving. The Life of Pi was profoundly engaging, I knew that Pi (Suraj Sharma) would survive the lost at sea ordeal, but none of the intensity of the story was diminished as a result of knowing the outcome. The imagery in this film was spectacular, from the opening scene credits I knew that I was in for a treat when a hummingbird was just inches from my face and literally within my reach. The scenes in which the ocean and the star filled sky seemed to merge into one were breathtaking. I made it a point to view this film in 3-D and it was worth every penny of the premium uplift, and we all know that not all 3-D films are. I'm not sure why anyone would mention Avatar and this film in the same context, although I just did because of the reference in the trailer, but other than the luminescent sea life, the two films have so little in common that it's like someone was reaching to describe the feeling that this story evokes. I love stories that showcase triumph of the human spirit as was the case with this one, but best of all you leave the theater feeling good about life in general, not guilty that your life has been average and happy, not shadowed by some tragedy that makes you evolve into a different person. The two stories told in this film that detailed what happened to Pi (Irrfan Khan) were opposites, I too preferred the one that featured Richard Parker. I was not a fan of the Cowboy story directed by Ang Lee, but am truly enamored by this Indian story, cowboys and Indians still dealing with opposites.

"TaritSengupta","10","0","0","13 May 2020"," Life of Pi: Movie Review
","Life Of Pi is one of those rare films that amaze, inspire and leave you in awe of the human spirit - all at the same time. A screen adaptation of a bestselling book by a visionary Academy Award winning director, one can only expect brilliance. And brilliance it delivers. Man against nature, man against animal, cast away, doomed by destiny-it's a survival story like no other. A story told with beauty, elegance, spirit and an exceptional bit of enchantment.
A story that begins in a small family owned zoo in the enchanted town of Pondicherry, our boy Pi and his family live typical small town life. Each aspect of his childhood story are divinely real, from his name to the entry of the new tiger in their zoo (Richard Parker) to the lessons his father taught him as a child. When the zoo goes broke and they decide to ship themselves and the animals to Canada, a shipwreck dooms the teenage boy to destiny. Cast away by a storm in a life boat with an adult Bengal Tiger in the middle of the Pacific- Life of Pi is an exceptional story of survival. With a bucket, a knife and a guide book as his prized processions, Pi and his fierce companion spend 227 days cast away on an adventure of hope, strength and human spirit. A story like that takes immense bravery to adapt to screen. And what an adaptation indeed.
Ang Lee is a visual artist, he paints on screen, paints like he is Picasso's heir. CGI on Richard Parker the ferocious Bengal Tiger is by far the best animation I have seen. Richard Parker is real, as far as I am concerned- he is no CGI tiger. He is every bit the rival and companion to Pi that we see. Suraj Sharma as Pi pulls of a remarkable performance, emoting vulnerability, spirit and wisdom through his young eyes. Irrfan Khan as always throws in a bankable performance as the middle aged Pi narrating his story.<br/><br/>Despite such a spectacular visual experience and such brilliant storytelling, Life of Pi is still at 3.5 not 4 stars. And there is only one reason to that. A story of this magnitude, a story with so much depth, required far more than a 125 min screen adaptation. No matter how hard you try, you cannot capture the depth of an epic story like that in 2 hours. It is going to lack depth. Pi is going to feel underdeveloped as a character. Pi's childhood in itself is a 2 hour film. His 227 days as a cast away should be as long as a Lord Of The Rings Triology. But with all due respect, if Life of Pi was to be made into a film, it couldn't have been better than this. Kudos Ang Lee, I sense another Academy Nomination here.
It's worth watching. The movie is a little slow at first though, you should give it some time (20 mins) and then you'll start enjoying it. The story is great and meaningful, the visuals are impressive (They may look a little unnatural but I'm sure they are great by 2012 standards). I specifically liked the sunset scene where the sky is reflected in the ocean. The only thing I really disliked about the movie was the ending. It was much better if the writer guy hadn't deciphered the story and openly explained the metaphors. I don't really understand why the director ruined the ending like this, I'd prefer the director to let me, the viewer, interpret the story. 4/5, if the ending wasn't like that, I'd give it 5/5."

","For the living individual, to live is to perceive everything, to die is to have nothing. Both stories may be false, but the fact that PI spent 227 days at sea and ended up the only survivor is indisputable.<br/><br/>Do I want to believe that Richard parker's story is true? I'd love to. Not just because it's more fantastical, more fairytale, more wonderful, but because I believe that the world is full of incredible and inexplicable things happening all the time, and even if we can't see them, that doesn't mean they don't exist. For PI, Richard parker may have done more than god to be the ultimate survivor. So it must be admitted that Richard parker inspired the will and desire to survive the party, but the ultimate saviour was himself. If he ever flirted with the idea of giving up, a few more Richard parker would be an unsurprising split.<br/><br/>So I think the story without Richard parker is false? I honestly don't have an answer. It's like, you ask me, do I believe in the goodness or the badness of human nature? All I can say is, if there is a choice, no one will choose to side with the original evil of human nature, but when there is no choice, who knows? After all, in the real world, human nature is the most vulnerable thing at any time. Remember, there is no choice, human nature dare not make."

A fantasy maritime adventure, a person's suffering and rebirth, wandering in the vast sea, seeing the weak meat and the evil of human nature, no matter whether the sea brings him suffering or gifts, he is regarded as a miracle! He is not constrained. In his mind, the tiger is always with him, and God is always with the tiger. This film uses a beautiful fairy tale to cover up the cruel killing."

In the middle of the island they went to, I think it was an illusion generated by the pie, and I still have some doubts whether Tiger Parker was also an illusion generated by the pie. The second version of the story appeared. It turns out that the truth is far more cruel than imagined. Human beings will of course choose to kill the same kind in the face of survival.<br/><br/>For the setting of Pai and Parker, Pai is a man of faith, but in order to survive he eventually had to betray his faith. Parker is actually a representative school in a sense. First of all, their names are related. I have seen people think of tigers as the animal nature of the school. After his mother was killed and he was also facing death threats, he finally released his hidden animal nature. But he was actually kind. He once wanted to abandon his animal nature, but the animal nature was connected with him, and in the end he still failed to do it.<br/><br/>This can also explain why Parker abandoned the faction as soon as he landed, because he has returned to the civilized world, and the animal nature will be hidden again."

","This is a very unique artistic and philosophical take on a survival story at sea. The movie narrates the life of Pi, a young boy from India whose family decides to move to Canada along with the family's zoo animals. The ship sinks but the boy manages to save himself clambering on a stray lifeboat along with a few surviving animals including a tiger. The two develops a guarded friendship and understanding of one another as they struggle to survive and share an incredible journey to salvation. The movie is heavy on symbolism, philosophy, faith and God. The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. The CGI is also state of the art as the tiger looks genuinely real. The pacing is somewhat slow but this complements the lost at sea narrative where the boy passes time by indulging in philosophies of life, existentialism and rebirth which are central themes of the story. This is not an action movie and more of an artistic and philosophical drama so some viewers may find it boring. But I enjoyed it even though I'm not into symbolic philosophical movies disguised as high art. Spiritually minded viewers will enjoy this movie but some might find this tall tale a little out of reach and fall asleep."

","Beautifully made movie about the complex relationship between Good and Evil, Man and God. The only negative is that the movie is so visually stunning that it may lead the viewer to appreciate it only on the physical concrete plane.<br/><br/>The real point to the movie is to show us that the tiger is not in the boat trying to kill the boy, rather that there is a metaphorical tiger living in each of us, and it is through the mythology of religions that each of us may discover for ourselves how we deal with our own tiger.<br/><br/>In this way, I think that the medium of film cannot match the impact of the written text for a film of such metaphoric import. It is through the imagery created in each individual's mind through the living life experiences of each person reading the passages of the book that give it deeper personal meaning and sense to the metaphor.

","I was a fan of Yann Martel's novel for a long time before I watched this movie, addicted to the detailed descriptions of Pi's day-to-day life and the use of dry humor. After I had seen this movie, it became clear to me that not since the Lord of the Rings has there been a better translation from book to screen. This is a fabulous experience and a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>Acting:
Suraj Sharma as Pi is an amazing young actor. This was his first major role and he absolutely crushed every scene he was in, with his expressive eyes and face and intense line delivery. His character is fascinating yet simple, and it becomes very easy to root for the ""skinny vegetarian boy"". The fact that he carries most of the film on his own shoulders is a major achievement.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan as adult Pi Patel is also a great choice. When this man tells his tale, you feel the weight of all these experiences radiating off of him, and he even exerts a surprisingly high amount of genuine emotion by the end of it.<br/><br/>Tabu and Adil Hussain as Pi's parents are great, given the modest amount of screentime they get, and give strong natural performances.<br/><br/>Rafe Spall as Yann Martel is allright, and it is visible that he is trying hard to be just as natural and realistic as his fellow castmembers. He mostly succeeds, and is likable enough not to be annoying.<br/><br/>Direction:
Ang Lee was the perfect choice for this kind of story: he knew how to present the culture appropiately, has a keen eye for good visuals, and brought a sensitive and magnetic feeling to the whole thing. Thanks to his expertise, the story becomes absolutely gripping on both land and sea.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
The digital imagery with the life-boat scenes and on the ocean are mesmerizing, not just because of CGI, but because how it is presented to us. Claudio Miranda made the journey as immersive as possible with his choiches for certain shots and made something absolutely beautiful. On land, most shots do a good job establishing the mindset and tone of the scene, but are very interesting in terms of lighting or movement, which feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Plot:
Even though a lot is cut from Martel's novel(particulary the first act), the story still feels very familiar from what you already know and some added things actually are very nice. It is not until the actual disaster that strikes Pi's life that the movie truly becomes engaging. The long journey passes effortlessly and is sometimes nail-bitingly intense or fills you with awe. The core message is translated perfectly and at the end you feel just as Yann Martel intended you to feel.<br/><br/>Music:
Mychael Danna delivered a beautiful score, mixing epic orchestral and soothing tunes with wonderful traditional Indian music. At certain scenes you just FEEL the music and the evoked emotion washing over you like the ocean waves.<br/><br/>Production Design:
The town of Pondicherry in the 20th century feels every bit like the mix of French and Indian that it is, without seemingly much effort. Just like CGI, that is the sign of good production design. The Tsimtsum and the lifeboat feel like right out of the novel, and the ""island"" as well. It is in departments like these that Martel's vision is truly brought to life.<br/><br/>Costumes and Make-up:
As Pi travels further, it affects his clothing and physical look. By the end of it, he is so ragged and changed that you truly believe he has been out there for a very long time. It is subtle but very effective work, just as the costumes for the people of India, blending traditional sweeping dresses with simple shorts and dark shirts.<br/><br/>VFX:
The absolute best thing about this movie. We of course start with the tiger. That thing is real. No question. Not Gollum, Ceasar, Joi or Thanos has even come close to how real that beast looks. It is an absolute triumph of CGI that will likely never be topped. Every growl, movement, facial gesture feels natural and like the real predator. The ocean is less convincing, but it isn't really trying to be. It feels like this endless giant swell of water that you just float on for end, looking harsh and unforgiving or gentle and beautiful. It is a character by itself, and wonderfully made. The other animals like the mercats, orang-utan and hyena are equally impressive, and only a very perceptive eye could see that none of it is real.<br/><br/>Editing:
The ""fading"" cuts as we go through several events in Pi's life help support the illusions of a tale being told, and keep us engaged for most of the runtime. Intensity is however a bit lacking in the first act, and sharper cuts could have been made more to give some more energy to Pi's youth.<br/><br/>
Tone:
This movie really feels like a ""story"". not a screenplay, but a TALE. We view the world partially through PI's imaginative eyes, and truly get a sense of wonder, grandeur and fear at the right moments. It is amazingly well done.<br/><br/>Overall Concensus:
A gorgeous looking, well directed and acted movie, with incredible effects and a near-perfect translation from book to screen. 8.6/10"

","I've watched this movie twice, and I understood it both times differently. This story touches various themes, and I think that after each viewing you focus on one thing. Thus, I think that it is about survival, faith, and friendship. All these aspects are shown with the help of the main character, who had gone through all these difficulties. In particular, in this movie, we see a strong character, who managed to survive the hardships, suffering, pain, and loss in the Pacific Ocean. During the whole this period we learn a lot of lessons, which are crucial for our knowledge. One of them is that we should always have faith, even when we are in a hopeless situation. We see how Pi believed that God had been protecting him during the whole time and we really see that God didn't forget him and he managed to survive there. Moreover, we see that his character also played a big role in his survival. Pi didn't give up hope, and he kept moving. This factor shows that it is essential not to give up on your dreams and give up on life. In addition, I want to say that I liked the part when this movie showed that the world believes someone for what they want to hear, not for reality. This is, unfortunately, a real truth."

","Ang Lee's incredible tale of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), a teenage Indian boy who survives a ship sinking that kills everyone on board except for himself and a tiger. Soon the two are on board a lifeboat not knowing what their future holds. I couldn't believe anyone would try and make a movie about a boy, a tiger and a lifeboat but the joke is on me because Lee has created one of the more memorable, magical and uplifting films of the year. I was really shocked to see how tremendous the picture was but what makes it so special would have me giving away countless spoilers, which is something I'm certainly not going to do. I think it would be best for viewers to go into the picture knowing as little as possible but I can say that Lee has created one of the most beautiful pictures you're likely to see. The beautiful images are just so remarkable to look at that it's impossible not to get caught up in the scenery. Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen. I'm really not a fan of CGI unless it's used properly. Too many times I think it's just used to be lazy and save money but that's not the case here as Lee perfectly mixes in the CGI with the live action stuff. The two coming together are practically flawless and that certainly helps bring one closer to the story and characters. Sharma does a terrific job and especially when you consider he'd never acted before and was basically having to carry the entire film. I was a little mixed on the 3D effects. While some where brilliant, for the most part I think the film would be viewed just fine in 2D as it would give one better colors. Still, no matter which version you see, the heart of the picture is in its soul, its character and the lessons he learns while being stuck out at sea for over two hundred days. LIFE OF PI is a really remarkable film."

","15 December 2012. Flaws aside, by the end of the movie there is a fundamental epistemological and for some a spiritual conundrum that underlies even the superficial but powerful experience of the movie itself. Even though the movie trailers are misleading and fail to capture the essence of the movie, even though the 3-D version technically falls short, where a stick use to prod instead becomes unfocused and fuzzy, the use of the extensive flashback is more distracting and lazy-minded, and the two intense physically animalistic deaths are censored unnecessarily, this movie contains a rich narrative, and a struggle for survival between man and beast, nature and rational, logical thought. Even though the movie didn't fully capture the embracing religion diversity of themes, perhaps the movie wasn't really supposed to be so all-encompassing.<br/><br/>There are suggestive themes and visions from the sci fi vision of Solaris (1972 and 2002), of the historical, haunting period film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), and the animal movies of Dances with Wolves (1990) and Never Cry Wolf (1983). The movie would have likely been more powerful presented in its own chronologically evolving way, yet the story and the mystery is so powerful that can transcend the medium and create an intense, emotionally and intellectually compelling movie experience."

The movie is full with great effect which are great but may seem sometimes unreal! The movie tries to stay serious while I had sometimes the feeling it's a bit funny. (Like the scene where the tiger is peeing on pi)
What I like about the end is that he tells the story about the cook and th sailor which makes you wanting to think about wether the story with the tiger or with the cook is the real one.

","Piscine ""Pi"" Patel, a middle-aged Indian man in Canada, recalls his life story to a curious novelist, tracing his early youth from being born and raised in a zoo, his introduction to Islam and Christianity, and a life-changing event at age sixteen when he was stranded in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific with his only companion being a fully grown Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Through a series of surreal, almost dream-like flashbacks, Pi conveys a fascinating story of hope, faith, survival, and ultimately friendship while combating the loneliness and danger of his remarkable journey. Based on the novel by Yann Martel, director Ang Lee creates a gripping and visually striking world that allows you to accompany this resilient young man through his arduous journey, and profound, allegorical themes that transcend the usual survival genre. A truly unique and mesmerizing movie experience. ***"

","An American survival drama. An epic journey of adventure and discovery layered with messages about the true nature of God and storytelling, told in a fabulist style.
Very life-like special effects are used to good effect - critical in terms of telling a story about a young man and a connection with a fearsome Bengal tiger.
The film borders on brilliance because of the skilful storytelling at sea and marvellous cinematography. Illusion must be tightly linked to meaning and truth. Pleasingly, the special effects meet this criteria. Unfortunately, the film's narrative does not. The backstory about a writer who has writer's block serves as bathos, worsened by a self-important dialogue which produces some stilted acting at times. As a fairytale, it keeps nature 'red in tooth and claw' which is a refreshing aspect. Flash-forwards spoilt the tension created by Suraj Sharma's lead performance which was enchanting. All in all, it's a very good film. Its false note is a relentless articulation of thematic aims which failed to create enough subtext."

","'Life of Pi' tells an amazing story of a boy who survives a shipwreck after being marooned on a raft with a tiger for company. With what is either remarkable computer graphics or a remarkable feat of animal training, the film version of Yann Martel's novel is certainly an entertaining watch, even if the tale seems unbelievable. The conclusion invites us to conceive of the story not as literal truth, but as metaphor, for events perhaps too bleak to remember without disguise. Although I haven't read the book, my guess is that the reader's shifting understanding of the narrative is crucial: the film struggles a bit, if only because film always struggles with imaginative metaphor, rendering everything with concrete reality. Film has the power to show us impossible things as fact; it's thus a tricky medium when the point of the story is, in part, that impossible things are indeed impossible. So I enjoyed the movie; but I wonder if the book might not have better handled the uncertain nature of its truth."

","Life of Pi is perhaps the most visually stunning film of all time. The incredible cinematography and CGI makes it a joy to watch, and it includes some of the most beautiful shots and frames that will ever grace your television screen. However, I think that while many were lost in the stunning physical beauty of this film, they refused to acknowledge a few minor flaws with other elements of the film. Pi faces challenges which only become challenges when the plot deems it necessary and interesting - such as thirst, which is a major issue in the film when he has can upon can of fresh water, and yet is barely considered when those cans are lost to a storm. Don't get me wrong - this film is spectacular in every sense of the word. But while the CGI effects and cinematography are the greatest that the film industry has ever seen, some elements of script and plot integrity have been slightly sacrificed. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film with a fabulous exploration of human faith, and is suitable for the whole family. What more could we possibly ask for?"

Hopefully it works, because you should hear this.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about this film before I saw it, probably saw the trailer half-asleep, or maybe I saw some still photos from it - whatever it was, something made me want to go and see it.<br/><br/>It started out nicely, the characters were more than interesting. Then came all the religion, and I very much respect some how people turn to god, but I have already made up my mind, and I'm getting very tired of having this religious propaganda shoved right in my face ever so often. <br/><br/>The worst thing about it is how sad it made me, I'm literally sad because it could've been so good. I was so in love with the plot, and I even tried to look through the religious propaganda in the beginning, but it got too much when they tried making me believe we somehow had a choice in the end of what to believe. <br/><br/>To avoid spoilers I'll make a metaphor out of the ending, to explain what I mean about the so-called choice they gave the audience in this film; The main character presents an ice cream cone in his one hand, and looks delicious as hell (read; beautiful cinematography and touching relations). In his other hand he's holding a big turd - the turd has been through a lot, but a turd never looks tasty. He then makes you choose which one you prefer. (I checked the spoiler box just in case, don't wanna be blacklisted in case I maybe write some less personal/biased reviews some day, this film didn't deserve that though).<br/><br/>This film is probably a 10/10 for the people who likes to be tickled by a turd though. <br/><br/>To summarize my feelings; It could've been sooo good which is what makes me so sad to see it wasted, and if I was religious I would've prayed for this film to drop all the propaganda. At the beginning I was already thinking ""I'm getting this one on bluray"", now all I can think of is downloading it, burn it on a DVD and Pi on it - to get something out of the lost time at the cinemas tonight."

"filmiky","3","3","8","14 March 2013"," The 'un-filmable' story proves just so
","Despite all the congratulatory proclamations of ""Ang Lee did the impossible, he filmed what many thought was essentially an un-filmable story""...well, guess what? It is hard to put on film, and it remains so. Nowhere anywhere near Ang Lee captured the essence of Yann Martel's story. Quite the opposite, so many things went wrong with the final cut, that I believe the original story got some really bad rap and will be tainted in eyes of the thousands of the movie-goers round the world.<br/><br/>I should know better when I couldn't see Yann Martel's name as a script co-writer. Perhaps he was invited to help, perhaps he declined (knowing well that this is a potential failure).<br/><br/>This movie works only on one level - visual. Hardly enough for the spiritual/philosophical jewel that this wants to be. And even the visuals get boring after some time, because there's no deeper core to hold the movie together.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a spectacular eye-candy with not much else. The movie sets the bar really high right from the start - the writer is told he may start believing in God when the story is done. I'm watching for the transformation to occur, but... My opinion is this even wasn't Martel's intention. His book is a nice puzzle, which can be turned round and round in one's mind, while one senses there are many layers down below to be peeled, but the conclusion is left to the reader. The movie - quite some difference, it slaps the belief in God on the screen in first 5 minutes...and then never delivers! The introduction of the 'alternative' story is so botched I couldn't believe it. No cut away scenes, just plain recount, told with such heavy Indian accent that had I not known it from the book, I would have missed it altogether.<br/><br/>This story shouldn't have been filmed, when I think of it. The book has so many nuances, beautiful and not-so-beautiful details (drink turtle blood, anyone?)...but it all comes together so well. The story of a boy and a tiger in one boat sounds impossible to many, but the book manages to pull in some interesting details, and makes it somewhat realistic - biology and dominance factors, circus training principles etc. One detail for all - the boy sets the territory right in the book, half the boat...yet, the movie felt this wasn't working, so the boy gets to wander around the whole boat. There are numerous leaps of faith required, which were beyond my threshold sometimes. Changes were obviously required for pacing what could otherwise be a terribly boring movie, but to what effect? The tiger sure never jumped out of the boat after a fish, and the boy sure never had to help the tiger back in the boat! Jeeezzz...there goes another half of the movie.<br/><br/>After all the buzz, I felt terribly disappointed in this movie."
"JamesHitchcock","6","3","8","15 January 2013"," Yes, it's that sort of a film
","The central character in this film is Piscine Molitor Patel, named for some reason after a swimming pool in Paris even though his family are from Pondicherry in India. As a boy, young Piscine Molitor, tired of being taunted with the nickname ""Pissing Patel"" by his schoolmates, changes his name to ""Pi"" after the mathematical symbol. Yes, it's that sort of a film. <br/><br/>As the film opens Pi Patel is now an adult living in Montreal, Canada. He is approached by a local writer who believes that Pi's life story would make a great subject for a book. Pi therefore relates that life story to him, so most of the film consists of one long flashback. We learn of his childhood in Pondicherry, where his father owns a zoo. Most of the story, however, takes place when Pi is 16. His father decides to emigrate with the family to Canada, and closes the zoo. He books a passage to Canada on a Japanese freighter, taking all his animals with him on the ship, as he believes that he will get a better price for them in North America than in India. Halfway across the Pacific the ship is wrecked in a storm, and Pi is the only survivor. He manages to struggle onto a lifeboat but finds he must share it with several animals- a zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena and a Bengal tiger.<br/><br/>The film is notable for its use of computer-generated digital imagery to render the animals, especially the tiger, and the technological aspects are certainly most impressive. The scenes in the lifeboat could, clearly, not have been filmed with real animals, but the ""virtual"" animals we see are so realistically done that we are persuaded to suspend our disbelief. The film is also, at times, visually very beautiful, as one might expect from Ang Lee, the director of that poetic ballet ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Lee's poetic vision is seen most clearly in the scenes set at sea, particularly the one where the entire ocean seems to be covered with jellyfish shining in the moonlight. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi is clearly a promising newcomer, although I was less impressed by Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi, and there is a brief but memorable cameo from Gérard Depardieu as a vulgar, racist ship's cook. <br/><br/>My main problem with the film was that I could not really see the point of it. It was clearly intended as something more than just an exciting yarn about a shipwreck; indeed, it does not work particularly well as an adventure film because the non-realistic elements keep getting in the way. A film with a hero who is named after both a swimming pool and a mathematical symbol, who miraculously survives a considerable period of time in a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger and who encounters a mysterious floating island populated by carnivorous plants and meerkats- creatures native to southern Africa, not Pacific islands- is obviously not intended to be realistic. It must have some hidden meaning. But what is it?<br/><br/>There is a religious note running through the film. Pi's father is a free-thinking rationalist, but Pi himself is deeply religious- so much so that he follows three religions, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, all at once. The ship on which the family travels is, although Japanese, named the Tsimtsum, a Hebrew word with a technical meaning in Jewish theology. Pi tells the writer who is interviewing him that he has a story that will ""make you believe in God"", but the implications of this are never really thought through. A story which is not only fictitious but also fantastic seems a curious argument for the existence of God. Even if one were to be confronted with a story like Pi's which was undoubtedly true, one could always choose to regard his seemingly miraculous survival as being due purely to good fortune rather than to divine intervention.<br/><br/>I have not read Yann Martel's original novel, but to judge from this adaptation it would appear to be a work of ""magic realism"", a literary genre which combines the realistic with the fantastic, and which often works better on the printed page than on the cinema screen. There have been many notable literary works in this genre in recent decades, but few have been successfully adapted for the cinema, and the few great ""magic realist"" films, such as Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"", have generally been based on original screenplays. Bille August made a very decent version of Isabel Allende's ""The House of the Spirits"", but he did so by concentrating on the realist elements in Allende's novel at the expense of the magic ones. ""Life of Pi"" is technically very impressive, and it has some excellent individual scenes, but it never really unites these into a coherent work of art. 6/10"

My reasoning is that there are sections where you are seeing 'Pi' talking to the journalist, which will have no 3D value.<br/><br/>Overall this was a film that contains a lot of analogies and symbols, it could have possibly been a tiny amount shorter but a very good.<br/><br/>The film works because it doesn't rely on having only Hollywood A-list actors and instead gone for a cast who can portray the characters."

","Ang Lee's ""Life Of Pi"" is a remarkable film. Adapted from Yann Martel's book it tells a story of an idealistic young man who finds himself stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger after the ship carrying him and his family sinks in a storm. Like Ernest Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" it is an allegorical tale that wrestles with some of the most fundamental issues confronting mankind. Suraj Sharma is excellent as the titled character. Beginning life as ""Piscine Molitor"" he shortens his name to simply ""Pi"" after the other schoolchildren start referring to him as ""Pissing"". He frustrates his Hindu father by professing a belief in Christianity and Islam as well as Hinduism despite his father's protests that it is irrational to do so. When the father decides that their future financial prospects in India are not good the family packs up and sets sail for Canada and a new life. Following a catastrophic storm Pi is forced to reconcile his idealism with the primal desire for self-preservation. This is a gorgeous looking picture thanks to Claudio Miranda's cinematography and the 3D is outstanding. ""Life Of Pi"" is a triumph and one of the best films of 2012."

"saad_khi","5","4","13","4 December 2012"," Amazing Parker! Impressive Sharma! Superficial Khan.
","According to Lee, Pi has been an exhausting experience, or rather his most exhausting film. And if exhaustion is an exhilarated feel one gets on achieving the desired results, then same goes for the special effects team. <br/><br/>Where 'The Wedding Banquet', 'Eat drink man woman', Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' (though with effects), ""Brokeback Mountain', 'Lust, Caution' were character driven then Pi is CGI driven especially led or say eclipsed by Richard Parker (the tiger). So I can imagine those in air-con suites working 24/7 on various animated sequences and effects, and creating him and his movements – ultimately credible! And commendable!<br/><br/>For me the only reason to see it was to affirm what I had imagined while reading the book, and must say the film is pretty close to it! But along the way I couldn't emotionally connect to it like I did with the book! I thought maybe it was because I knew what was coming next but a realization dawned! <br/><br/>Transforming more than (I think) 500 pages into 120 plus minutes can be laborious and so, what has been projected are measured situations in terms of (cost and) duration: resulting in calculated scenes (against the green screen) supplemented by effects comprising Pi and Parker in the second hour. And while executing them an exhausting Lee and equally fatigued CG team overlooked many aspects, which made the boat always look neat and not weather- beaten! So much so that after the zebra, hyena and orangutan are devoured there are no traces of blood! Meaning continuity sank here and there!<br/><br/>As for the 3D touch, many portions could have been stunning, but opportunities were lost! Like Pi on spotting a ship signals by emitting smoke and burning flare, could have been shot from the top with the two effects hitting the audience. <br/><br/>But thank Martel for writing about a teenage Pi sailing with Parker and not a 30 plus man! Otherwise, if Irrfan Khan had been selected to portray that role it would have been unbearable! A mediocre or rather below mediocre (so-called ) actor who is over-rated (like Frieda Pinto) and I can't figure out why? He is, to an extent, just OK for the role in Pi or he did in 'Slumdog' and 'New York'. If someone creates a montage of scenes from his films (and a TV commercial), the result will be simply monotonous! <br/><br/>One effect the CG team created and that turned out to be as lame as this actor (by fluke) are a couple of tears that materialize in his left eye toward the end. They just don't trickle down like they do on young Pi's cheeks! And Sharma does a good job!<br/><br/>Khan's stoicism was evident in 'Billo Barber' where he (Billo) was completely stone faced when Shahrukh emotionally poured his heart out about his friendship with him. <br/><br/>So compared to Priyadarshan, Lee had to take the help of an animator to make him emote with an effect! And a pity the tears don't look as natural as Parker: even expressive when he is unwell, and rests his head on Pi's laps! An expression, which would have been very, very difficult for Khan to give! <br/><br/>The (artificial) tear factor can be included in either trivia or goofs."

","Ang Lee makes good looking movies. Here again, he is meticulous in his craft and it shows on the screen.<br/><br/>The problem with the Life of Pi is it starts too soon and ends too late. Because it is a story in flash back you know PI survives. If you have seen a trailer you know the movie should start with a great ship wreck scene. It takes to long to get there. End after the rescue. That interesting shaggy dog story from the hospital bed that was heard, not seen, was not needed and not cinematic. <br/><br/>The movie looks and sounds good but it is redundant. How many storms at sea are enough? The movie might have trouble finding an audience. It looks like a family movie, but it is too violent and intense for younger children. <br/><br/>If you go to see it, take your lead from the tiger. When the tiger leaves, you should too."

"DJRMewzique","8","3","9","23 November 2012"," Visually captivating but somewhat underwhelming.
","First and foremost, I'd like to set the record straight. If you're one of those people who think ""Life of Pi"" is pretty much just a movie about a dude in a boat with a tiger, well, I have news for you...<br/><br/>...you're right.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's latest feature, an adaptation of the book by Yann Martel which, after numerous attempts by other directors including M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Curon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was deemed ""unfilmable,"" is indeed the story of a shipwrecked boy who survives for weeks on a lifeboat he shares with a Bengali tiger. As told to a reporter (Rafe Spall) by an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) from his Montreal home (Canada REPRESENT!), the story starts off with Pi's childhood and religious awakening before spending much time at sea...on a boat...with a big cat.<br/><br/>Religion is the overpowering theme of the film, there is no doubt, but not in a preachy sort of way. Rather than being some sort of moralistic tale, the point I believe the narrative is trying to make is that personal spirituality is important, no matter what you may believe, and we should all just respect each other's points of view. And although I am a non-believer, that is something I cannot fault. If only, right? When a young Pi finds an interest in Christianity after having been raised Hindu and discovering the Muslim religion, his father brilliantly exclaims ""I'd rather you believe in something I do not agree with than accept all religions blindly."" Excuse me if I am paraphrasing slightly there, but the line was very powerful and one I can respect a great deal.<br/><br/>However, despite the lovely religious equilibrium and the cute ferocious animal, ""Life of Pi"" never quite managed to enrapture me. The filming style, with its cuts and edits, came across almost amateurish and TV_movie-like while I found the script slightly underwhelming and the performances merely acceptable. Nothing more.<br/><br/>But who am I kidding...I did not see the movie for the story. What intrigued me about the film was the talk of the visual effects. THAT is what I went for. Having been heralded as the most visually captivating film since ""Avatar,"" I was full of anticipation for this film for that reason and that reason only.<br/><br/>And it is indeed a beautiful movie to watch on the largest screen possible. Definitely in 3D. The scenes are so incredibly drawn and meticulously brought to 3D life, you will almost forget what is going on in the film at times because you're busy staring too long at the CGI tiger going ""wow, how did they do that?"" Don't worry, it's not like you'll miss an important plot point. And you will find yourself asking that exact question many times during this film. However, it is no ""Avatar,"" which remains the most visually magnificent film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing (although I am sure many of you will see elements which have been borrowed from it at certain moments). To be honest, I didn't even find it as visually captivating as ""Cloud Atlas,"" as the beauty of the images hinder rather than help the audience personally connect with a story which seems a tad bit far-fetched as it is.<br/><br/>No doubt Lee, a two-time Oscar nominee for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" for which he won, will undoubtedly get an invitation back to the ceremonies this year for his visual epic, but it's best chances at gold will be strictly technical, as the film itself leaves one a little underwhelmed. That time you spent the night with someone astonishingly beautiful but not terribly interesting? Yeah, kinda like that."
"OCACIA-1","4","5","19","22 December 2012"," Pretentious and very redundant, bad editing, questionable music
","The film was weak the minute it started. The script is sub-standard. It is not the fault of the book (guessing as I have not read it), but the fault of the script writer. It has in so many redundant scenes that serve no purpose at all in constructing the narrative. The prolix debates about religion have no serious connection to the story. They serve absolutely no purpose. The church scene, the issues around Jesus, poorly written, poorly introduced into the narrative. Very unrefined in transmitting a spiritual message. It is certainly not deep, and they had a million ways to introduce the multi-religious themes.<br/><br/>The ship cafeteria vegetarian scene why was it there? The Japanese guy talking about his dish, why was it there? The scene when his father teaches him about the Tigers ways made perfect sense to the narrative.<br/><br/>So after all of that redundant time wasting we get into the meat of the film. Which was okay. Hardly original, You seen Tom Hanks you seen Avatar fuse them together. Tom Hanks on Avatar Island. <br/><br/>Some of the music, esp in the opening did not gel at all. I was shocked by the opening title credits it was absolute devoid of impact. It was like we do not know what to do, let us do something. <br/><br/>And even after making head way they had to go an spoil everything with yet another redundant anti-mood scene in the hospital with anew story. His mother being eaten by sharks, I am like? Why? what did that entire redundant scene tell us? What for. Leave it as it is, the family comes home the titles come up. Weak story telling, Weak subtext, weak editing, weak directing, nice CGI, some nice tension. not well stitched together, maybe for kids."

","So this dude was the lone survivor of a shipwreck, and he floated around for 8 months before washing up on the Mexico coast. That's a rare, amazing story as it is. No need to embellish anything about it. The mundane parts of figuring out how to catch fish, constantly being on the verge losing hope, being unbearably lonely, and weathering storms in a tiny vessel? You can easily tell those stories and keep my interest. As the Tom Hanks character did in Cast Away.<br/><br/>Telling such an incredible, completely ludicrous life story that any sane listener would naturally assume he was embellishing? The charm of Forrest Gump was that the Tom Hanks character wasn't embellishing.<br/><br/>Of course the main point of The Life of Pi is to spotlight the natural human awe of storytelling, particularly to explain things beyond our feeble comprehension like religion. But if I was the author dude, I would have punched this jerk in the face for wasting my entire day. I can't recall ever feeling so frustrated from a movie as I did with about ten minutes remaining in this embarrassment of a film.<br/><br/>That said, visually beautiful and a great musical score, yadda yadda yadda. But the story is so absurdly frustrating and unforgivable."

","The story revolves around a man named Pi (Piscine Molitor Patel), who lives in Canada and is sharing his story with a novelist of how he survived a shipwreck in which he lost his family when he was younger. He starts off by telling the novelist of how he received his real name and his nick name Pi. Gradually, he moves into detail of his family and his experience of vast religions he found and practiced. Then he announced the almost unbelievable story of being lost at sea for months at a time with Richard Parker, a tiger from his father's zoo. He explained the great ups and downs of their extraordinary friendship. Pi believed that Richard Parker was a true friend to him, until one day they washed up on shore and with no hesitation Richard Parker ran into the forest without glancing back. To know that his one and only friend at the time left without saying goodbye or any acknowledgment of his disappearance left Pi devastated.<br/><br/>One of the major things that really grasped my attention throughout this whole movie is how director Ang Lee did such a wonderful job with the main character Pi. Throughout the whole movie we can feel his pain and sorrow just because he does such a terrific job on revealing his emotions. No matter what situation he was confronted with during the movie he always managed to pull through and overcome every obstacle. If a problem occurred he always handled it in a very nonfictional, believable way. The relationship between Pi and Richard Parker was very enjoyable as well as individual roles. Man and animal surviving together, grieving together, and working together is outstanding! Never have I seen such a remarkable outcome between animal and man. I would most definitely refer this movie to anyone; it is a must see of this century! The theme of this movie is that we never know what life will throw at us. We should never take anything for granted as well as never be afraid to experience new things. One of the worst feelings is not only letting people or things get away from us, but not having the opportunity or chance to say goodbye to them especially to those whom we love the most. What hurts the most is not appreciating all the little things that they have done and coming to a realization when it is too late. Last but not least, the most important message of the movie is no matter what life throws at us our faith must remain intact!"
"bob the moo","Null","2","5","8 June 2014"," Runs longer than it needs to and the spectacle hurts the substance, even if it looks good while doing it
","Life of Pi was one of those books that interested me and was constantly on my mind to read but, being quite a lazy man, I never actually got around to it. The story is one told to an American writer by a man called Pi Patel and it involves a ship wreck where the only survivors are himself and some animals which were also being transported on the ship – the most notable of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Pi relates his struggle to survive, the things that happened to him and ultimately seeks to make the writer believe in god.<br/><br/>Although there is an establishing period early in the film where we discuss god and then also see young Pi and his various religions, the majority of the film occurs once at sea and for most people this is the film they came to see. The posters, the awards and so on all point to this film as a spectacle and to be fair it is. Throughout all the animal sequences it is pretty much never unconvincing; the animals look real and look like they are right there in the same scene. Where bigger sequences occur they are also impressive and technically the whole film looks great. I saw it on 2D on only a television rather than the cinema, but it still worked apart from bits of personal preference – I never like those 1950's style scenes of 'poking audience with stick' – they seem in service of technology than story. Anyway, technically the film works.<br/><br/>The problem is that it works too well. It becomes so much about spectacle that we forget all the work in the early part of the film – all that talk about god and ultimately Pi's statement that he will make the writer believe in god. This comes back at the end in a way that is actually quite satisfying because although not as smart as it thinks it is, it does make you think even if it is pretty bleak. The thing is though that this seems stuck on to a special-effects movie, not that a movie about religion had effects in it; so the irony is that the substance of the film really doesn't work as well as it could have done. The need to make the spectacle also means that the film runs much longer than it needed to do if you really were focused on telling the story.<br/><br/>It is still a well made project though and the work of all involved is really up there. From the cast, Sharma is great in his first film – convincing in the emotional and physical sides. He is well represented by the older version of his character by Khan (although I did keep hearing his In Treatment character in his slow tone). There are other good performances in here but generally the film is all about Sharma and it is impressive that he isn't lost in the special effects or scale of the scenes. Life of Pi is a film that works best as something that it is not – a big, technically impressive, spectacle. The downside of doing that so well is that it is runs longer than the narrative actually needs and makes it feel like the substance is the thing that is a bit out of place in the film."

","How many times must i say it? Life of Pi is the greatest film EVER!!<br/><br/>I'll start now, as a qualified media technician i had heard the hype over the film and the tiger for many weeks before i finally sat down to watch it. I finally cracked open the Ben and Jerry's, lit a scented vanilla candle and downloaded the film on my mac so i was able to watch it on the retina display. <br/><br/>This film is a thrill ride straight from the go. Action, Adventure, the film is brimming with plot twists and Beautiful CGI which will have you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Scared of falling asleep through this film? Good luck! is what i say to you M'lady, Pi will grab you by the balls and drag you through 2 hours of boat and zoo related mayhem. <br/><br/>if you're wondering about the plot I'll start now. Its amazing, from when pi is a Jew and that to when he first meets Richard Parker(not to be confused with the tiger from Spiderman) who was superb throughout the film, the puppeteer did an amazing job, i could barely see the wires. I wont spoil any more, but trust me like seriously just so good. I'm still in a state of euphoria from just watching it, my fedora fell of a good few times due to the jump scares and i was very aroused by the beautiful CGI and cinematography.<br/><br/>The Best film i have ever seen, the Coldplay soundtrack, the Go Pro action sequences, its like this film was made for me. My life has changed thanks to Richard Parker. thank you Richard Parker for leading me to true Euphoria."

","Fantastic photography, and a really entertaining storyline that has you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The director has added another feather to his cap of great cinematic achievements. Beautiful scenery and vivid colors, makes you marvel at the wonders of nature, some fantastic ocean storm waves, showing just how big and powerful the ocean really is. But let's not forget this is a fictional movie, and like the Superman or The Hulk etc etc, movies, it's very believable and engaging. In a broad sense, it's also a treatise about mans faith and belief in religion and a God, a personal vs an Abstract God, told allegorically; a boy on a life boat with some other survivors, depicted as wild animals, and towards the end of the movie alluded to be humans (and more specifically inhumane humans), all vieing for survival. It's left up to the viewer to choose which story-line they prefer to believe in: and the analogy to which religion/God they prefer to believe in. So if you can come way from a Superman or Batman movie without it challenging your faith and belief in the real world around you, this movie should be approached in the same way, with the added bonus, that you might view your relationship with reality and religion afresh."

That and some decent visual effects and nice photography.<br/><br/>As for the story - there is not much there. It starts with ""The story will make you believe in God"" or something to that effect, but there is no place for God in it. Some claim it is meant to prove non-existence of God... but I did not see it that way. It is too blah to have anything in it really.<br/><br/>Bottom line: in the world where true mysticism and symbolism is lost, there is no shortage of pretentious works of ""art"" (film, novels, or anything else) which gladly promises to bring some new value. They all have a few things in common:<br/><br/><ul><li>Story originates in a far away land and/or time</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is based on some completely unimportant and ridiculous premise that only young teenagers may be interested in it</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is visually rich</li></ul><br/><br/>Whether it is Life of PI or any other similarly dumb fantasy such as Harry Potter or Lord Of The Ring, it does not really matter. They all require that the consumer have low expectations, poor understanding of human condition, and is easily entertained with anything that seems even a little ""different"".<br/><br/>Often, forced attempts to be different brings us just more of the same, and Life Of PI does just that."
"Buddy-51","8","2","5","15 March 2014"," A Boy and His Tiger
","In an era in which CGI has made it possible to put virtually anything one could possibly imagine up on the screen, it has become harder and harder for a filmmaker to make an audience's collective jaw drop. But Ang Lee achieves just that with his adaptation of Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi."" This movie truly has what we, in modern parlance, like to refer to as ""the wow factor,"" simply because it is unlike anything we've seen on screen before. ""Life of Pi"" is a surrealistic tale of survival about an Indian boy trapped on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean with nothing but a ferocious Bengal tiger for a companion. <br/><br/>The first thought we are struck with while watching ""Life of Pi"" is that this movie would have been impossible to make prior to the CGI revolution in filmmaking. With so many movies abusing that technology for sheer commercial ends, it's gratifying to see a film actually using it for thought-provoking and artistic purposes (see also ""Gravity""). At times brutally harsh while at others gloriously lyrical, the movie combines the realistic with the fantastical, the rational with the spiritual - all to illustrate the many disparate and dichotomous elements that, working in glorious chaotic tandem, make up this vast expanse we call the universe. <br/><br/>The first third of the film focuses on Pi's life before the shipwreck. Pi (short for Piscine, which as it shares a rather unfortunate homonym in English, causes Pi at a very early age to abbreviate it) is innately curious about not only the world around him but the world that lies beyond the physical. He is so fascinated with the spiritual, in fact, that he has adopted the tenets of each of the world's major religions and made them his own. Pi lives with his stern, skeptical father (Adil Hussain), his more open-minded, sympathetic mother (Tabu) and his somewhat less curious older brother (who is played by three different actors in various stages of the story). One of the prime exhibits in the zoo owned by Pi's father is a Bengal tiger that, through a bureaucratic fluke, has been tagged with the name Richard Parker, a prosaic moniker hardly befitting the king of the jungle. When the father decides to sell the zoo, the family, along with the animals, board a Japanese freighter to begin a new life in Canada (the plan is to sell the animals once they get there). On the way, however, tragedy strikes when the ship sinks in a tremendous storm, sending all but Pi and Richard Parker to the bottom of the sea. ""Life of Pi"" is the story of their survival.<br/><br/>Alternately awe-inspiring, heartbreaking and suspenseful, the screenplay by David Magee expands on the ""circle of life"" metaphor to explore how each element of nature is interlocked with every other element, with each action prompting a reaction unto infinity. Though natural born ""enemies,"" Pi and Richard Parker achieve a kind of symbiosis, ultimately forced to rely on one another for survival (RP for his physical needs, Pi for his spiritual), and in so doing, they achieve a harmony that puts them in sync with the rest of the universe. Yet, for all its pantheistic elements, the movie doesn't over-sentimentalize nature, doesn't shy away from showing us the unthinking brutality that is also a part of that universe, underlined by the fact that living creatures can survive only by feeding on other living creatures. It certainly never downplays the very real danger Pi is in at every moment from his feline companion. This cat may be animated, but he's no cartoon character.<br/><br/>Never one to shy away from a challenge, Lee won a second Best Director Oscar for his work here, and someday the Academy might even see fit to bestow a Best Picture award on him as well (he was certainly robbed of that honor for ""Brokeback Mountain""). As he has done many times before, Lee demonstrates a total command of the medium in ""Life of Pi."" There's a hallucinatory quality to much of the film, as Pi frequently experiences preternatural visions that transcend the confines of the material world and of rational thought, leading him to a oneness with God. <br/><br/>Suraj Shama has been handed the challenge - one might almost call it the burden - of carrying large stretches of this film entirely on his own, with only a CGI effect to interact with. It is a challenge the gifted young actor is more than equipped to handle and he fulfills it beautifully.<br/><br/>Though the movie throws the audience for a loop at the end, making us question the veracity of the tale the adult Pi (Irrfan Kahn) is relating to the writer (Rafe Spall) who hopes to chronicle the experience, no one can ever convince the true believer in all of us that this is anything other than a love story between a boy and a tiger. After all - thanks to the technical wizards who've made it all possible - we've seen it with our own eyes."

","I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of the movie. I really did. I even turned to my wife and said, ""this is surprisingly good."" But then the ship sank, as did the movie. The reason I was so surprised by the first 30 minutes, was that I saw the previews, which seemed quite boring. Well, had they starred Tom Hanks in this movie I would have thought it was Cast Away 2. There is no doubt that the movie is visually stunning (thanks to ripping off James Cameron), but you could watch Avater for all the the same special effects. But ""Eye Candy"" candy only goes so far, at least for me. Actually, you could have named this movie many other titles than Life of Pi...Castatar (Cast Away meets Avatar), The Old Man and the Tiger (Old Man and the Sea meets a Tiger instead of a Marlin), etc... I can see awards for cinematography, but that's it! Nominated for Best Picture??? Are you kidding me??? The last hour and 30 is so dull you really want the tiger to eat the boy.

","Life of Pi is an astounding experience that you will not forget anytime soon. It is a very captivating story that is told and acted out very well, about a boy named Pi who is stranded at sea in a life raft with a tiger. It doesn't get more interesting than that. The digital landscape is done so perfectly it is almost breathtaking, that alone, very well might be your favorite part of the whole film. The water seems as if you could just dive right in and go for a swim with the stunningly colorful jellyfish that light up the crystal blue sea. It will have your whole attention the entire time, as you will be trying to guess and see what is going to happen next.

"brando647","8","2","5","5 July 2013"," A Visually Stunning Tale of One Boy's Faith
","Once I watched this movie, it was impossible to shake from my mind for almost three days after. Each time I've watched it, it's left me in awe. LIFE OF PI is a beautiful film with a magnificent story to tell. From Ang Lee (director of HULKthe one with the gamma poodle yeah, I went there), LIFE OF PI is based on a novel from Yann Martel that, admittedly, I've never read. It is, without a doubt, one of the most (if not, THE most) visually stunning movie of 2013 and the story is one that just stirs around in your head, leaving you to think back on what you've watched and question everything about it. The premise of the story is what originally hooked my attention: a young Indian boy is adrift at sea, trapped aboard a life boat with a Bengal tiger. More specifically, the boy is Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and he was raised in India with his family in their zoo. When times become tough and the zoo must close, his family loads the animals aboard a freighter and they set off for Canada. A storm leaves Pi alone on the Pacific Ocean, a lone survivor from a shipwreck, with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger along for the ride. LIFE OF PI is a tale of faith and survival that might, as an adult Pi describes as he recounts his tale to an interested author, ""make you believe in God."" Ultimate belief in a deity is not guaranteed, but an incredible story with mind-blowing effects is.<br/><br/>So, for a little context from this commenter, I am not religious or spiritual in any real sense. You don't necessarily need to be in order to enjoy this movie. This is not a movie to preach religious faith or drive home points about how belief in God is important or whatever. This is one man's account of a life-changing event in his life and how (and more importantly why) it strengthened his belief in God. The character of Pi Patel is more than your average Hindu. He's Hindu, Christian, and Muslim with a possible bit of Jewish mixed in. He's a boy who loves God in all his forms and his faith will be put to the test over the course of this two-hour film as he is trapped in the middle of the largest ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger. As if survival isn't difficult enough when you're trapped thousands of miles from anywhere with limited food and clean water, but a hungry carnivorous cat tends to exacerbate problems. Pi will face hunger, weather, and his fellow passengers in his long quest across the ocean while maintaining his faith that his God (of many faces) is watching over him. And in the end, when Pi returns to society and gives us (and two Japanese insurance adjustors) a second version of his tale, we are introduced to a new understanding behind faith in a higher power and what leads people into it. As a firmly non-religious person, I actually thought it was one of the most enlightening descriptions of religious faith I've heard. And it's all done without being preachy.<br/><br/>LIFE OF PI is, as you've probably heard just about any time the movie is discussed, an amazing visual feast. I don't like to use the term because I think it comes across as corny, but I'll make a rare exception for LIFE OF PI: it is stunning. Ang Lee, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and the visual effects team have created a gorgeous film. It's not often you see a movie of this caliber anymore. LIFE OF PI is a prime example of film as art, as opposed to summer blockbusters or cash-grab sequels. The visual effects in this movie are superb but you might not think so when watching it. It wasn't until after I'd seen the movie twice that I discover that the majority of scenes with Richard Parker, the tiger, are a CG animal. In fact, most of the animals in the film are CG. That blew my mind. Not once over the course of the movie did I question whether the animals I was watching were real. In a time when I can go to your average summer film and count the CG elements, it is great that there are movies that incorporate such subtlety that you might never question what you're watching.<br/><br/>On a related note, I am one that would argue that the Academy Award LIFE OF PI won for cinematography was undeserved because so much of the movie was done as visual effects. As beautiful as this movie was, there were others in 2012 more deserving of the recognition for their work with physical lighting and camera-work."
"bcbubblegum","9","2","5","1 July 2013"," A Beautiful and Heart Wrenching Movie
","Life of Pi is quite simply an amazing movie. Obviously the production value and special effects, but also the acting and subtlety. <br/><br/>Suraj Sharma should have been nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars this year and his performance was supremely undervalued and underrated. You really believed his fear when he is out in the ocean and the emotion he displays throughout the different situations he must overcome throughout the film were paralleled by no other actor or actress this summer. <br/><br/>The script was beautifully crafted and there was never a dull moment. There was the perfect mix of wonder, intrigue and culture. The first quarter of the movie is interesting as Pi's cultural and religious background is explored and the rest of the movie keeps the watcher guessing with the magic that David Magee has so wonderfully weaved into his masterpiece.<br/><br/>The attention to detail was phenomenal. As more and more time progressed, Richard Parker's coat became paler and more washed out and Richard Parker himself was a spectacular feat. I just cannot give this film high enough praise. <br/><br/>The only thing that stopped this movie from getting ten stars was the ending and the fact that I had to argue with most people I knew about what actually happened. <br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie yet, do it now.

","I picked this novel few years back, more for my book collection rather with intentions of reading it actually.This book fell in the list of ""some other day"". Till date I have not read the book. I heard all the reviews talking about religion and philosophy and in my life then I had least interest in these.<br/><br/>Last year when this movie was released, I did wanted to watch it. Just because I love movies made from books. But surprisingly I read bad reviews about this film and eventually this fell of my list of movies to watch.This year it got back on my list, simply cause I have been reading a lot about the director Ang Lee which are floating around the social networks and I decided to see his work.<br/><br/>I really loved the movie( I would have loved the book even more if I had gotten myself to read it).<br/><br/>A story of survival, religion, imagination, beliefs and most importantly how much a human wants to stay connected to something, anything a living or non-living. If you were to compare the movie with ""Cast Away"" I would say they two are unique in their own ways. I loved the ordeals of surviving a ship wreck, and stranded alone in the Cast Away movie more than Life of Pi. In both the movies protagonists connect with something they think is their own reflection. Something that keeps them alive. In Cast Away its a football and in Life of Pi, its a Bengal Tiger. They have conversations with these, they bond with these. Thinking of which, how much a human needs to be connected? How much a conversation with the other keeps you sane? I myself at times( ah who am I kidding with, most of the times), talk with my pet or with myself when am alone. These very ""HUMAN"" aspects are brilliantly portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>"" Words are all I have left to hang onto. Everything's all mixed up, fragmented, can't tell daydreams, night dreams from reality anymore ."" And does a human stop there. They form a relationship. They show their emotions, tantrums, just to feel alive. And then goes way beyond to expectations. At the end of their journey when the protagonist and tiger survive and reach an island, he cries out loud not cause he is alive, but cause the tiger left him without saying a goodbye. The entire movie runs on this theme of ""never getting a chance to goodbye"". This scene is the best of all.<br/><br/>"" I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye. "" The ending is what makes the movie stand apart. Pi narrates two stories of what actually happened. One is what we see in the movie and the other is a more realistic story that everybody especially people who are way too logical can believe in. This puts both the stories in question as to which is true. Director/ author did not leave the choice to us to decide which story is true. Rather the question is which story do you prefer to believe in? Both are stories of survival, and at the end Pi survives, after losing his entire family and past in a ship wreckage.<br/><br/>"" Without Richard Parker, I would have died by now. My fear of him keeps me alert. Tending to his needs gives my life purpose. "" At the end our belief system, religion are all stories. Stories that came out of imagination or mostly from real-life experiences. How you narrate it to yourself or others, is what makes the story or the experience interesting, I need to dig my collection to read the book now!"
"ChristianUnchained","10","2","5","23 April 2013"," A stunning and sensation film
","Ang Lee directs the previously though un-filmable book to the big screen, Life of Pi. How it comes to life is breathtaking; an ingeniously woven tapestry of incredible visual elements and powerfully adept storytelling, all to the affect of discovering the greater meaning of being alive in a situation you would rather die in. <br/><br/>It's an art movie that many audiences will love simply because of the gorgeous visuals, memorable character(s), and incredible spectacle. But for those looking for a deeper, meaty, and memorable movie going experience Life of Pi has you covered. No other movie nominated for best picture at the 2013 Oscars has perplexed me, moved me, made me reflect and think, and swept me away within its lush, visual imagery and unique storytelling. It's a film chock full of metaphor, visual imagery, and raw emotion. But this isn't a discussion of the film's many layers of religious undertones and imagery, but a review. I'll keep it that way!<br/><br/>First off is director Ang Lee's incredible talent on display (for which he won Best Director - 2013). I have yet to read Life of Pi but from what I've heard from friends and book junkies is that Life of Pi is an incredibly complex, almost muddy in direction, novel which many considered un-filmable. What becomes of this epic tale of survival is a clean and expertly directed film, with all of its themes and underlying tones hidden within the visual landscape and story. It's not a force-fed experience, but rather one where you must process the vast array of information and make your own judgment on some of its less touched-on ideas. Whatever creative process Mr. Lee went through to bring this incredibly complex adventure to life is beyond me, and that's a true testament of the genius on display. <br/><br/>You can't talk about Life of Pi without discussing the incredible visuals. Winning both Best Cinematography (2013) and Best Special Effects (2013) at the 2013 Academy Awards, I had high expectations going into Life of Pi. The film starts off, simply put, like any other PG-rated family film. I was nervous that it was going to be a bust. Where the film takes the viewer is someplace completely unique and unexpected. Without spoiling some of the finer moments, Life of Pi has visual panache to spare. There are some incredible moments that are rendered and recreated with such life-like detail that getting lost in Pi's tale is tremendously easy. Its visuals dazzle, but don't distract its storytelling, unlike other films (namely Avatar, which is a visual marvel but hardly a groundbreaking example of storytelling). One of the main strengths in Life of Pi is Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that accompanies Pi during his quest. Little did I know that that 90 percent of his screen-time is completely computer animated. And it's not just that, but the rest of the film; the water effects, the tumbling ship, various animals; all of it is incredible. It maintains a perfect balance of realism and a dream-like quality. Some of the scenes are also shot with incredible vision and beauty. It's simply the most beautiful cinematography of any film last year (other than the Hobbit). I have nothing but praise for Life of Pi's cinematographer and special effects team.<br/><br/>But no story is worth being told without great characters and actors to tell them. Life of Pi's Suraj Sharma (Pi) is absolutely fantastic. Emotional, powerful, and sincere; he is one seriously talented actor for never having been in a role before...ever. While the beginning of the film features a quick romance between Pi and Gita, featuring its fair share of awkward exchanges, its nothing annoying. Pi and his incredible story is what you see 90 percent of the time. It's his story of finding faith in the darkest of times, discovering courage where none should be present, and having the will to continue to live. The rest of the supporting cast does just fine in their various roles, aiding along the telling of a most grandiose adventure. <br/><br/>Everything else is spectacular as well. The original score (also winning the Oscar for Best Score - 2013) fits the pages of Pi's story like clockwork. From the moving ""Pi's Lullaby"" to the gorgeous and ethereal ""First Night, First Day"", the original score never distracts but rather augments the experience, creating some of the most beautiful audio-visual-scapes in any film from recent memory. Sound editing is particularly fantastic. Crashing waves, minute sound effects; it's all done particularly well, especially in its transition to home video (aside from a couple of weird boom adjustments made mid scene that distract the acute ear). And boy, I can only imagine the splendor of the 3D this film had to offer but I, regretfully, was not able to see it in theaters, only on Blu-Ray. The one issue I had with the visual presentation was this, also noticed by Blu-Ray.com: ""There are two spots in the film where the aspect ratio changes suddenly from the normal 1.85:1. During the ""flying fish"" sequence that was used as a teaser for the movie, the top and bottom close in to 2.35:1, and there's a single overhead shot of a whale passing beneath the lifeboat that inexplicably squeezes in to a window-boxed 1.33:1. I'm not sure what the rationale was here, so I can't really comment on it, but don't be alarmed by the out-of-nowhere framing changes."" In layman's terms, the film goes from a whole-screen experience to having the black bars on the top and bottom and sides during two scenes, which is fairly distracting. <br/><br/>Where Pi finishes his journey is up to you to discover and interpret. Where it stands for me, personally, is my favorite film of 2012. Visually spectacular, incredibly engaging, intricately told, and masterfully directed, Life of Pi was a massive gamble that pays off in more ways than one. It's an absolute classic."

","With four people bringing the life of Pi Patel to the big screen, no wonder no Oscars were given out in the Best Acting category. All four seem to function as a unit as the oldest one tells the story of an amazing adventure to a writer who has been told that Pi has an incredible tale to tell. The lack nominations in the acting categories is made up by the four Oscars Life Of Pi won this past year in the technical categories. The computer graphics are something else.<br/><br/>Like Gloria Stuart retelling her life as a Titanic survivor and the audience seeing Kate Winslet playing it out on the big screen, Irrfan Khan recounts his surviving a shipwreck where he and his family are taking a bunch of zoo animals from India to Canada where the Japanese freighter they're on is sunk with all hands lost.<br/><br/>Young Suraj Sharma manages to swim to a floating and empty lifeboat which turns out not to be so empty as a few of the zoo animals also make it there. Including a young and hungry Bengal Tiger cub who is very hungry. <br/><br/>I won't say more because at this point the computer graphic special effects takes over. Some miracles are provided, but maybe the biggest miracle of all is that the tiger and Pi decide they really do need each other. Pi who checked out all forms of religious beliefs calls on all the Deities he's learned on for help. The biggest help granted is if not a change of nature, a curbing of the carnivorous nature of the tiger to save the Life Of Pi.<br/><br/>I was kind of lost at the message part, just what director Ang Lee was saying about nature and nature's God to use Jefferson's phrase. But the technical achievements of the film truly do dwarf whatever message that was being told about life. Those achievements have vaulted Life Of Pi to the top of the cinematic world and it's likely to remain there."

","The Life of Pi which we saw over the weekend appeals to those of who are plagued by the larger questions of life and its difficulty. It is a HUGELY profound film BUT one has to enjoy that type of intellectual challenge to take the time to analyze, walk through its weeds and see the depths of its thought. <br/><br/>Reading what others say about it online is helpful to understand the depth and varying opinion about it. Some things about its essence were not clear to me. The more I thought about and discussed it with others who have seen it the more I can appreciate its brilliance. Ang Lee the director won the Oscar for best director. I surely can see why.<br/><br/>I think to get the film's maximum experience one should see it, if possible, in a theater with 3D disposable glasses the theater hands out or view it in IMAX. Viewing it with 3D glasses makes it a stunning visual experience as one sees, for an example, birds flying in the most vivid color directly in front of you to touch. 3D makes Pi amazing.<br/><br/>It is about man, animals, the universal creation and every living thing's challenge to survive within it. One sees life's diversity, gorgeous complexity but continuously asks why we as sentient understanding beings are left to forge though it seemingly alone with the constant companion of suffering and death.<br/><br/>I believe the major thrust of the film is contained in the Biblical story Job. It is about man's quest to understand and give meaning to the vicissitudes of life without losing faith in a God in the face of life's table of tragedy spread out before us. It is man's quest to find the meaning in life to give it purpose and help us when we are weaker than what life visits upon us. <br/><br/>The protagonist a young Indian boy named Pi Patel is constantly thinking about the same things and even becomes a Hindu, a Christian, a devotee of Islam and even Kaballa Judaism in his quest to seek personal answers and peace. <br/><br/>The film is available On Demand on TV BUT without the 3D glasses one does not gets, the visually awestriking experience. I may see it again on TV so I can re-see the thoughtfulness behind the movie albeit not in as visually appealing form. <br/><br/>I give this film a thumbs-up IF and ONLY IF those aforementioned things usurp your consciousness as they do mine and if you are prepared to think hard about what the film is offering. To some it may seem like a children's movie but I suggest it is far from that. It could be seen by children but they would not have the sophistication, ability to question life and the experiences of it that only an adult could possess."

Being a translation of a novel means ""Life of Pi"" can be, at times, a bit confusing perhaps, but the overall narrative remains strong, and the protagonist is such a rich, well-defined character that the viewer can't help being drawn into the story. I won't belabor things; others have done that quite nicely elsewhere on this site. Let it simply be said that this is a film that any cinemaphile will enjoy, perhaps even despite whatever prejudices or predilections they may suffer.

","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story. Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.<br/><br/>The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: 'In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.<br/><br/>The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar, Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Gérard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.<br/><br/>There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","When I went to watch this movie, of course in 3D in the big screen, I just knew it was gonna be brilliant. And it was. In fact is the first time I can tell the 3D effect accomplishes what 3D effects are meant to accomplish: To involve you even more in the movie... I've read out there in Metacritic a guy saying ''you don't watch this movie, you just live it'' and that's what I felt exactly. In many cases, like the storms, the whale and many others I felt so involved in the movie I could almost touch things! The storm was perfect, one of the best storms put in film. So... effects in this movie are just PERFECT. Period. It really worths the 3D. Acting is also very pleasant and nice. The 3 actors playing the role of Pi are amazing. They've got the essence of the character perfectly. Sometimes I even forgot I was watching 3 different performances. The side characters, while not as important as Pi... are so nice and likable too. Really got involved with the family, very realistic. The romance with the girl was subtle but really nice. In this case I can add Ang Lee really knows how to tell the story... I mean, it was a book before, so Ill give credit to the actual writer. But talking about the movie... they never stay so much in the things they're not the focus. The focus is the Life Of Pi, which I can tell, I just loved how resumed is the title, it tell everything in the movie without saying anything at all. That's what a good title should tell by start. The art, again, outstanding. They really deserve that cinematography Oscar. Scenes are unbelievable, you can see they decisions they made in every single case... they were in everything. Talking about the bas stuff, just a little, maybe the CGI was obvious in some cases... you could tell whenever the Tiger was real or CGI. But it was subtle, I guess it's OK anyway. The music was really delightful, what disappointed me a bit is the lack of personality in this... I mean i remember is kinda ''epic-Indian music'' I remember the flutes... but nothing more. Don't get me wrong, is really nice to hear and follows perfectly the story, but is not memorable. You can hear this kind of themes in a lot of Indian based stories... when I knew they won an Oscar for the soundtrack... I though I would here something really memorable, like that melodies that stick hard to your mind. But it was good anyway. A really amazing tale, epic some times, lovely. It reminds me a lot of the Big Fish. It doesn't matter the story, at the end you decide what to believe. And believe me and go to check this one out! In 3D if possible!"
"seaview1","9","2","5","11 March 2013"," The Meaning of Existence in LIFE OF PI
","Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible. He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe. It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father. The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship. During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker. An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast. As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies. When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience. He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character. Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion. His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story. He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, ""Do animals have souls?"" In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul. Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.<br/><br/>There are unanswered questions. What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth? Is there a more plausible explanation? Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear. Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life. And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful."

","Finally 'got to watch Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' based on Yann Martel's classic novel. This is perhaps one of the few films that pays attention to detail in order to be as true to the book as possible. Of course filmmakers take cinematic liberty and there's nothing wrong with that as long as the final result matches up at least to what the book accomplishes (which isn't the case with most Hollywood adaptations). 'Life of Pi' is perhaps as accurate a film can be to its original. <br/><br/>Now we come to Ang Lee and his art team's fantastic imaginative visualization. It's all about the details. While the CGI images look terrific, I also loved how the live images were captured, especially the colours of India. A majority of the film takes place at sea but even there colour plays a significant part. The detailed CGI designing of the animals especially the characters on the boat is impressive.<br/><br/>Newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sincere performance. Irrfan Khan and Adil Hussian are great. Tabu is terrific in a small role. The child actors are very good too.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the book (read it if you haven't) and those who have, while 'Life of Pi' is a beautiful story of survival, in the end it's more about how imagination and how that alone can keep one alive when all else is lost."
"BooChanan","7","2","5","25 February 2013"," A visual feast.... but so much more!
","Life of Pi. Where to begin? Life of Pi is probably most known for it's stunning visual effects after picking up Best Visual Effects and Cinematography at the Oscars. So, that is a good place to start. The cgi is INCREDIBLE! The tiger looks unbelievably realistic and some of the landscapes are breath-taking. This visuals are commonly compared to Avatar. Life of Pi's are far supreme. The story is also brilliant yet simple; a boy and a tiger trapped on a boat. It does not hold up to the claim that it will 'make you believe in God' yet it is a heart-warming tale with a thought provoking final twist. The script does not stand out compared to the visuals but is witty and emotional and hooks the viewer. This is a Hollywood blockbuster yet mainly consists of an Indian cast that aren't very well known. I feel that this is a bonus because you do not see Pi as a Hollywood superstar but, instead, as an average boy. This doesn't mean, however, that Suraj Sharma (actor who plays Pi for the main section of the film) acted to the standard of a normal boy. The acting was very good (not award worthy) and was clever as Pi was mainly reacting to a CGI tiger. The music is also very good and fits with the cultural style of the different locations. However, I wouldn't say that it deserved the Oscar for it. This film is a visual feast to remember but is also a lot more - a story that will stay with the viewer long after the film and a script and acting that fits well. This is a real achievement for director, Ang Lee, and he truly deserved his Oscar. This film is a real gem and deserves more popularity than it has been given."

","I had doubts about this one - many people said that it was stupid and boring, and that it would end up as a turkey, a flop. Sadly I did not watch this one on the big screen, but waited for a blu-ray release so that I may watch it at home, in peace - what I found out really took me by surprise! This story was very deep and heart breaking, a story about survival facing impossible odds, in the middle of the open seas with little food and water, and a lifeboat that's more hostile then the sea below it.<br/><br/>The real movie-turner here was the ending, when Pi's story isn't taken well by the insurance agents ( since it's much too fantastic) and he explains that the whole story is in fact a metaphor - the animals were in fact people, and the tiger was in fact Pi himself. This made the movie even better in my eyes, and answered some questions about the story itself, and the ''real'' story was much too horrific to be displayed outright - a fact even the Japanese insurance agents seem to acknowledge. Pi is shown as a great story teller, and all pieces fall into place, all of this giving us a very solid, heart-warming story, and it's up to the viewer to decide which story is true.<br/><br/>There were some bad points to the movie of course, simple things that could have been done better: The use of CGI was obvious at some parts, but still I can't remember seeing better animated animals in any other movie ( I'd still go for live animals any day, and if a real tiger was used this movie would score a solid 10 for me - I understand that safety is primary when working with big, dangerous animals, but a LOT of movies have used trained bears, lions and tigers before, with great effect)<br/><br/>All in all I'm very pleased, especially after I learned that M. Night Shyamalan was not going to write and direct this project - that would have been... a DISASTER :/"

The movie begins with PI telling the story about his adventures in the flashback. The childhood of PI where he begins to believe in different religion , his search for truth and his journey from India to the ship has been executed brilliantly. The moment Pi encounters the ship-wreck and left alone on a life boat with wild animal , the movie takes a complete U-turn and depicts the relationship between tiger and Pi brilliantly. Soon , they develop a special bond which eventually breaks in the end. It is at this place where I felt the emotion content is missing and sympathetic feeling is mixed where Irrfan Khan expresses his concern for not receiving proper goodbye from the tiger. I felt this movie was great but not spectacular which would want me to see it again and again.

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","5","13 February 2013"," The story with god in the machine
","Films usually work upon the same mechanisms, it is what religion in old times simply used to warn against. In more typical dramas, the sin is acted out as some part of life, the more recognizable the better. This was fine for centuries, but the invention of the camera opened it up in great ways. More ambitious films visualize the experience or feeling as it arises, more or less vividly render the hell of it (think Lynch), usually with some the ambiguity and mystery it happens in real life.<br/><br/>This is midway between the two ways.<br/><br/>Framed with religion and the search for answers, the story here is of a young boy on a spiritual journey with his animal self. The boy has previously adopted religion, several in fact, and this deeper perspective he cultivates is the film we see. On a simple level, it is a story of survival, but so extraordinary that you know there's more to it, hidden depths. Visualized around him, we have a series of meditations inspired by the elements—in tempestuous seas, in the whale magnificent to behold but wrecks everything, in the magical, by day, inter- connected nature of the island but turns deadly by night.<br/><br/>Visually, the experience has been more evocatively done in Tropical Malady, which is on the same journey to inner self (once more a tiger) and clarity. Greenaway has more puzzling symmetries. But it's a nice film to have, perhaps too clean and cutesy, but clean for a reason.<br/><br/>Here's the caveat. The idea so simplified in the end, is that we can't know one way or the other, but here we are, loved ones perish, we continue to be tossed in an ocean of suffering, and that god is perhaps the more attractive story to grim reality, it provides purpose and color, soothes the soul on her journey. This explains the Disney cleanliness, as his mind not dwelling on death.<br/><br/>The sentiment makes sense of course, but suddenly reduces.<br/><br/>Going back, you will see this reductive logic in places, reductive because it IS logic. The most telling spot for me is the following, it is the one that should be the most emotionally powerful moment in the film, the most purely visual because it is directly of the boy's soul. Among the visual meditations, there is the one of him being submerged in the sea to the quantum level of soul where images bubble up and form everything else, he goes past the animals, past the symbols, and settles on the face of his loved one, all of it illusory.<br/><br/>It is of course the feeling that has arisen in him, but see how it is rendered. Schematic isn't it?<br/><br/>Not unlike its notion of god, which reduces in retrospect by too simple sense. So keep this film to heart, it has its heart in the right place, but imagine how you would do the swim. Zen starry waters without the Disney luminescence maybe? I have similar issues with Koyannisqatsi's constructed nature.<br/><br/>The magic in it being what it is, not constructed, revelatory as it is."

Almost from the beginning it had me interested and by the end had totally won me over. This is nothing like I expected at all. The movie is very religious and extremely deep and very thought provoking. By the end you are questioning everything you saw and leaves you wondering what to believe. That is the sign of a good movie, one that leaves you thinking about it long after its over. While I don't think this is the best picture of the year I did like it much much more then I expected and will say its one of the best of the year. Not bad for a movie that I expected to fall asleep watching. Overall, surprisingly good and very much worth seeing, you will be surprised like I was, the trailer does not do the film justice. I give it an A-."

"uttiyo-sarkar56","9","2","5","7 February 2013"," Absolutely Enchanting work from Lee.
","My Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Enchanting, Spiritual, Great Acting and with Incredible Visual effects, Life of Pi is an amazing story of survival and courage and is backed up with some amazing visual effects, great acting, superb background score and some brilliant presentation of a movie by Ang Lee who has made a perfect move from a novel which was labelled as one from which a movie cannot be made out of, and Lee Deserves a lot of applaud for his devotion and brilliant contribution to this movie.<br/><br/>The Story which is based on the novel written by Yann Martel is about a young spiritual boy named Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) who is the boy of a zookeeper who lives in Pondicherry, but after some issues with their zoo in pondicherry, they decide to move to Canada and take the animals with them, but when they board the ship and after staying in it for sometime, it starts to sink and only Pi barely manages to survive in a boat along with a zebra, hyena, an orangotan and a Tiger named Richard Parker, and after the other animals kill themselves, it's only Pi and the Tiger who survive and Pi must find a way to tame Richard Parker and save himself from the gruel Pacific Ocean and somehow survive through this crises.<br/><br/>Their are'nt many actors in this movie and the cast is quite small compared to most movies, but everyone has done their job's superbly, starting from Suraj Sharma who has portrayed the young Pi brilliantly and his acting throughout the crises time is amazing and he plays his character quite perfectly and has done a lot of good to his career with this. Irfan Khan also does brilliantly as the Present Pi who is grown up after that survival in the ocean and although much of his role is to narrate the story, he has done it superbly and its good to see the Indian Actors do well in this movie. Even Tabu( Pi's Mother) and Adil Hussain(Pi's Father) have done well to ensure that everyone in the cast has done extremely well with their roles. Last But Not the least the Tiger aka Richard Parker deserves a huge amount of credit and although i don't really know if its animated or not, but if its real then hats off to the trainer who trained him. <br/><br/>Well, before this movie was released or was poised to release, there was a lot of talk of how the book cannot be depicted into a film, but Ang Lee has silenced those critics by making one of the most beautiful and visually thrilling movies of the past years which also consists of some great acting and some really brilliant presentation of survival and courage of Pi and Lee has done amazingly in all the aspects of the film starting from the cast(which is quite small and inexperienced) in which he has made Sharma act to his full potential, to the visual effects(for which although the visual effects team deserve the most credit) which are absolutely amazing and I really regret not watching this in the movie theatre, and the presentation of the movie is absolutely amazing starting from the first scene to the last, and the scene's of Pi and Richard Parker are absolutely amazing and visually enthralling. He Deserves the Best Director Oscar award this year and I'm Sure Life of Pi will get awards from many other categories as well.<br/><br/>The Visual effects of this movie is one of the best visual effects i've seen in a movie and this movie was difficult to make mainly because of these quite impossible visual effects in the story, but it's perfectly shown by the visual effects team who have done an amazing job with the sequences after the ship sinks and this movie is bound to get many awards from the visual categories. The Cinematography In the Movie is also superb and the scene's shown of the pacific ocean are simply mind- blowing and the cinematographer Claudio Miranda has done a really brilliant job with the cinematography which also adds to the brilliant visual effects of the movie. <br/><br/>The Screenplay of the movie written by David Magee is quite great and the dialogues are brilliantly delivered by the actors and the novel was quite brilliantly depicted in this movie with the help of the screenplay and Magee has done a great job with the screenplay of the movie. The Background music in each and every sequence is amazing and the survival scene's are really superbly backed up with the background score mainly consisting of Indian Instuments and the background music goes brilliantly with the visual effects of the movie which leave many awestruck throughout the movie and the Mychael Danna has done brilliantly with the background score of the movie.<br/><br/>Well, I Really DO regret not watching this in the movie theatre and this probably has everything in it to please the audience and the visual effects and heart-warming story keeps one awestruck throughout the movie."

","when a person believe that there is someone responsible for the existence of every thing and every body but he doesn't actually believe at any religion......that person should be pi-sen or pi .<br/><br/>may be he loves Jesus and may be he can see the greatness of Islam and at some point he also liked being Jewish and he is actually a Honduran , a weird combination of a believer but it is not a weird thing of a city like India where every one may has his own religion.<br/><br/>but if we have a little look to the other film makers we may realize that it is not really weird and i think it is intended.<br/><br/>the novel writer is Yann Martel and he is a Catholic and the director is Ang Lee and he is a Buddhist a great intended combination of thoughts you will recognize when you see the life of pi and that is a true cinematic achievement for sure ..<br/><br/>does the animals think of us like we think about them ?? is that possible that a relation between the Man and animal may Exists ??<br/><br/>The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have a great script like that script ..<br/><br/>Ang Lee took a novel which a lot of critics thought that it is impossible that it might be made as a movie someday and David Magee made a brief script which explain the novel from Lee's point of view ..<br/><br/>many people may consider that the fearsome Bengal tiger presents some thing more than a tiger and that might be a true thing cause Martel tried to explain that you can't live without fear of some thing and that is the reason that pi said that he is a live till now because of the existence of that fearsome Bengal tiger in his amazing journey..<br/><br/>he tried to tell us that without fear you can't survive in your life and it is a fact , you must fear and struggle also he showed us that a relation between man and animal could be exist but eventually it is a relation between an animal and the man ..<br/><br/>and the best thing about that movie is that Lee let you to choose which story that you prefer the tiger one or the other story at the end of the movie so which one do you like most the realistic one or the the Imagined one and even which one of them is the real one and the imagined one for you ...<br/><br/>the movie helps you to meditate generally especially when you experience it in 3D or Max and of course the visual effects played an important role .. <br/><br/>the sound editing and was quiet and soft and it was Proportionate with the movie Ambiance which also may help you to Meditate ..<br/><br/>the movie has 11 nominations but i don't think that it will gain more than 3 wins specially at the existence of other great movies like tango unchained and Lincoln and Le miserables and others ..<br/><br/>i don't think that it will win the best motion picture of the year or best directing but another wins are waiting like the Sound Mixing and Visual Effects .."

","We've seen many hit and miss 3d flicks.... movies with zero content... banking only on 3d... and definitely life of pi misses that list. The movie right from the start has a soothing effect and the screenplay floats effortlessly,revealing the story line, frame by frame. The movie portrays a cast away tale , staging the struggle for survival of the duo of a boy (pi) and a tiger (Richard Parker). The adventure breathes out intense moments between the boy , the tiger and the ocean. The premium 3d and sound effects are effectively used at appropriate places , amplifying the intensity and no where do we see an overdose of these effects which adds beauty to an already beautiful film.Some of the scenes are literally jaw dropping (when i say 'literally' i seriously mean it.. ).The animals are beautifully and originally showcased. The tiger's ferocity is canvassed brilliantly and the 'storm' scene needs a special mention for its masterful use of digital effects.The film crew have done a marvelous job in producing such a complete movie and Ang lee needs to be credited for reproducing a marvel from a simple script ,with descriptive complexities.If you are looking for a 'not so usual' flick, then life of pi should be your pick and preferably in a Dolby Atmos equipped screen.It is a definite dark horse for the Oscars in all the technical categories and a serious contender for the 'Best Movie' Award.(I had to use the word 'Beautiful' in this review multiple times because it is the only word which makes all the sense in describing this movie).Life of pi will definitely leave your lungs gasping for breath....."

"RioRep","10","2","5","1 February 2013"," So, it is sad...
","As I stated in my comment on the movie ""Jeff who lives at Home"", it is sad how difficult it has become to come here in IMDb to discuss a good movie.<br/><br/>In the past, I used to go to the board of a film, and find enthralling debates, and points of views about the point of view, the intentions of a filmmaker, writer. But now it all became so lame, so plain.<br/><br/>Almost all the questions this film seemed to have raised is about the existence or no-existence of god. Surely the theme is there. But it's not all. What the film tries to instill on us is the fact that is so much better to be a believer.Sure, we all know that our lives is fulled of challenges. But what really makes us endure, and eventually be successful, is how we face these challenges. And the answer to success is always how much we do believe in ourselves.<br/><br/>In the movie, it doesn't really matter which story is the true one, as so many people continue to try to clarify.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, since Pi's intention to change his name, what he shows us is that he's not going to comply, and will try until the end that he should not be mocked. He wants to be recognize as someone unique, and he's determined to do that. That's the same determination he later shows in order to preserve his own life, whether story is true.<br/><br/>He shows us that whatever the ordeal is, however difficult life can be, we should never give up. We should never stop believing. The gods are only a metaphor. Something that symbolizes our strong will to survive.And even though everything should look doomed and desperate, being alive, our lives is always worth for fighting for. Until the end. No matter the odds. Even if we have to live with a ferocious tiger. Being it real, or a symbol of our hardships, whatever they'd be.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is one of the most compelling directors alive today. He's always questioning the real values, our real humanity, our true sentiments. And he does so in such a subtle, sensitive way... This Taiwanese is the most human, humble,deep, and also fantastic director we have today.<br/><br/>I loved this movie so deeply. And it's a shame IMDb is no longer, as it once was, a good vehicle to discuss the art of images and storytelling...<br/><br/>That being said, I'm going to lie down now..."
"Mizbar","7","2","5","27 January 2013"," Enchanting Story with Beautiful Visuals
","Ang Lee is a Master story teller. He has succeeded yet again to deliver us with an astounding piece of work. Beautiful story and incredible visual effects and scenery. The cast was wonderful. Life of Pi takes the viewer to a journey of magic and wonder. It also depicts the vivid and colorful world of India especially during the colonial period. I would have wished the script had been a bit better, and honestly speaking there were few moments it felt a bit too dragging...perhaps overly emphasized on emotional acting. This movie could have been totally perfect with a few improvements. However it still is a sensational movie and Ang Lee deserves all the credit and salute!!!"
"aequus314","10","2","5","23 January 2013"," No sex scenes, only mesmerizing visual poetry...
","First of all; Life of Pi has very little appeal for movie goers unfamiliar with Yann Martel's novel. They will have to glean from whatever information is available before deciding whether to watch it in the cinema or buy on DVD.<br/><br/>Second; movie poster is a ""big heads in the sky over tiny people on the sea"" type, and it doesn't stand out among the ones with catchier designs.<br/><br/>Third; it casts two virtual unknowns--fierce looking Bengal feline and plain looking Indian boy (newcomer, Suraj Sharma). Which means there will be no attractive Hollywood celebs to ogle at and no sex scenes to anticipate.<br/><br/>Fourth; the movie tagline is cliché--""The Journey of a Lifetime."" It is so generic that it can easily apply to any movie off the top of my head: Castaway, Chronicles of Narnia, Titanic, Alexander, Pathfinder<br/><br/>Lastly; the movie poster underplays two things that will most certainly sell the film, Ang Lee and 3D.<br/><br/>**************************** <br/><br/>But watch it anyway because Life of Pi is unlike any film Ang Lee (Taking Woodstock, Brokeback Mountain) has ever made, yet it is the most profoundly moving piece of cinema in his twenty years as a filmmaker. From the very beginning; lush evergreen and a mellow giraffe fade in before enchanting melody drifts across the airwaves--it instantly captivates, right until the very last frame. I would have liked to describe Life of Pi as a genteel; romantic cousin of Slumdog Millionaire but that would be off base. Both exude different energies. One is extroverted and dynamic, while the other is intuitive and intensely dramatic.<br/><br/>Adapted from Yann Martel's 2001 novel, this film is a 3D adventure fantasy drama based on adapted screenplay by David Magee (Finding Neverland). In broad terms, it tells the story of a 16 year old boy named (after a swimming pool in Paris) Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel; and his journey as a shipwreck survivor, adrift on Marianas Trench--deepest part of the world's ocean.<br/><br/>Story is told from one narrative viewpoint—an older, middle aged Piscine in a flashback as he recounts his 227 days ordeal stranded on the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>He lives with his parents (they run a private zoo) and elder brother, Ravi. After an unforeseen land dispute, the family boards a Japanese ship in an attempt to sell their zoo animals around the world before settling as migrants in Canada. But a storm hits and passes; with his family gone, Pi finds himself stranded with a lifeboat and some animals. Hours turn into days; as he contemplates the difficult situation, thematic focus of this film unfolds. Separation, survival, self- discovery, the will to live, hunger and thirst, faith and belief all culminate in one of the most impeccably crafted bildungsroman I have ever seen.<br/><br/>No one in recent years has improvised upon French Impressionism so spectacularly as cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Tron: Legacy, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) did in this film. We see a cloud filled sky blazing with azure before young, curious Pi plunges into the pool but imageries are never indulged for its own sake. Frame after frame; photography continues to fascinate by embodying important symbolic ideas and emotions of the story. Visual poetry in this film is mesmerizing, and I'll be damned if Miranda fails to bag an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the final act that brought me to snot dribbling tears. When Richard Parker stopped in his tracks at the edge of the jungle, right before he enters it. The fact that he has no human characteristics makes it poignant; the emotional impact came very suddenly, I wasn't at all prepared for it. <br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"

I personally believe it was a slow movie, pictured in age old India, talking a bit here and there about faith (but not questioning religion), but a different perspective to the approach of Goodbyes, what we perceive as reality v/s what is one that you will believe. I wish I was not Pi or suffer to any of his situation be it with RParker or with his family or his issues with faith, the ordeal, watching one by one his companion go in the ship by brutal animal and lastly never had to say goodbye... its quite a load one carries."
"theonewithallthecontacts","10","2","5","12 January 2013"," A groundbreaking masterpiece on so many levels!
","Life of Pi is not your average Hollywood film. Most of all, because most of the setting in the film takes place in an ocean, with a tiger and a boy on a rescuing boat, as fellow companions. The movie is based on a screenplay by David Magee, who drew inspiration from a book by Yann Martel. Martel's ""un-filmable book"" could easily have resulted in one of the most boring and weirdest movies of all time! But luckily the person who sat in the directors chair was Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee! A man who has previously demonstrated his dedication and vision on movies such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" which both won him Oscars! I haven't read the book, but my applause must go to David Magee who have managed to write such a beautiful and intriguing screenplay, and to Ang Lee! Lee has managed to keep a movie going and be alive, even though the movie is set mostly in the ocean on the same boat! Lee's dedication and visionary skills is clearly visible in every scene, every twist, every plot- turn, etc. etc. Ang Lee should probably win a third Oscar for this movie, if Spielberg doesn't nab it for his historical turn in ""Lincoln"". But still to Mr. Ang Lee: A job well done! <br/><br/>In the visual department this movie manages to be groundbreaking! First of all, the cinematography is gorgeous even in 2D! I have literally just gotten home from the cinema and I regret not seeing it in 3D! But based on a handful of other reviews, I dare say the the 3D photography is simply out of this world! I wish Denmark had an IMAX-screen! The visual effects and CGI is also very well done and a joy to watch by the human eye! The set-production is astounding and so is the sound mixing and editing! This movie will probably nab a few Oscars in the technical category! <br/><br/>Suraj Sharma plays Pi Patel and he does a remarkable job! He truly captures the essence of what it is like to be out in an ocean with a tiger, and he disappears into the role! Irrfan Khan also does a good job in the adult role of Pi Patel! There are also a number of good actors in this movie, most notably Gérard Depardieu who has recently just turned Russian! <br/><br/>When you mix all these things together you get an astonishing experience, probably one of 2012's best movies! I'm a bit late out considering that this movie only premiered in Denmark a few days ago! This movie has received 11 Oscar noms and my conclusion is that every nom is deserving! This movie has brilliant and tireless direction, a fantastic lead actor, a great script, great visual effects, great cinematography... I could go on and on, but I'm just gonna say: This is a movie you do not want to miss. Go watch it and prepare to experience a movie who is going to become a classic! <br/><br/>10/10"
"billygoat1071","9","2","5","11 January 2013"," Visually Spellbinding
","Life of Pi is a story about a boy who tests his faith and beliefs while being stranded in the middle of the ocean after their ship got sunk by a storm. It's ought to be an inspiring tale to make one believe in God. In the end, there's only few questions to ask, but what made this spectacular is the amazing use of special effects and the direction. You do not always get a film as gorgeous and as highly enjoyable as this one. It's one of the best kinds of experiences you'll get in cinemas. It has real tension, humor, and emotional depth, but the real landmark here is the visuals that are undeniably spellbinding.<br/><br/>The beginning is quite intriguing as it talks about faith and its morality, but the conundrum disappointingly ends up being less subtle in execution. Despite of that, we still get to see something extraordinary. One is a genuine fortitude in every suspenseful and emotional moment which practically compels the whole picture. The other is obviously the visuals. Ang Lee interestingly turned the survival into a whimsical and surreal exterior that made this look so remarkable like when the water perfectly reflects the stars in the sky or the lightning struck at the entire ocean during a harsh storm. The CGI-ed animals are amazing how they move and act like real animals. The enjoyable bits is when Pi interacts with those band of misfits. The film is in 3D and yep, there are plenty of things jumped off the screen(noticeably changes ratio aspect in one sequence), but it also shows some interesting use of it.<br/><br/>There's only few things to say about this since I haven't read the book(rule breaker here), but I'll say it has the same root of Cloud Atlas. The message isn't overwhelmingly executed but the technical achievements and the direction made it a powerful cinematic experience. It could have been a much better experience if it's strong to its themes, but it's all stunning anyway. Life of Pi is a compelling cinematic journey with endless visual wonders."
"OlieRendch","10","2","5","4 January 2013"," The word has kind of lost its meaning in the world of cinema but anyway to describe this film is, Epic.
","Life of Pi. As you may have gathered from the trailer it is about a boy on a boat with a tiger. Something that could be very boring but in this case, Life of P is the complete opposite. This film blows your mind like no other film. It is just an amazing thing to watch. So, here is what I liked about it: First of all, the story line; it doesn't instantly put Pi on the boat, you get quite a bit of back story and his childhood which is really good and you learn interesting things about Pi and his journey through religion. It is also a story within a story so the older Pi is telling the author of the book about his life; and that plays well with the effects it does interchanging from the story to the present. Now the effects I've just mentioned are absolutely amazing; borderlines, if not better, than that of Avatar, and the photography and camera angles are just amazing; and yes, I got to see it in the spectacular third dimension; the 3D is some of the best I've ever seen and feels like a humming bird really is flying a meter or two away from you. Now, this movie is rated PG, but that by no means is meant it is aimed at children, there are very dark tones in this movie that you wouldn't expect and it delves very deep into life, God, and how you look at it all; I'm sure a little kid would get bored or sometimes scared by some of the scenes. But overall it is a very enjoyable life to watch and you come out still absorbing it all. Life of Pi is one of the best movies of seen and I will certainly want to watch it again."
"davidgee","8","2","5","4 January 2013"," Crowd-pleasing turn from Ang Lee
","You already know the story. Emigrating to Canada with his family on a rust-bucket freighter, an Indian zoo-keeper's son is the sole survivor when the ship goes down in a storm. Not quite the sole survivor: he shares his lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utang . . . and a magnificent Bengal tiger improbably named Richard Parker. Mr Parker soon eats his companions, apart from young Pi Patel who retreats to a raft made of debris strung out behind the lifeboat. They survive on the lifeboat's rations and some fortuitous fish catches until they beach on a floating island populated by mongooses (not mongeese, I just looked it up). Over time they reach an uneasy truce, but the script is at pains not to sentimentalise their relationship.<br/><br/>Apart from Rafe Spall as the writer to whom the adult Pi is telling his tale (and a cameo by Gerard Depardieu), all the cast are Indians. Suraj Sharma, who plays the castaway Pi, is not one of those preposterously handsome Asian stars, he's quite ordinary looking (actually I was reminded of an Indian version of Labour leader Ed Milliband!) but as natural an actor as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE's Dev Patel. The animals are mostly CGI but very believable, especially the fabulous Richard Parker. The storm scenes are spectacular; in 3D you almost need to put an umbrella up.<br/><br/>The movie is perhaps a tad too long, but it's never tedious. The feeling of being taken on an adventure rarely lets up. Full marks to Ang Lee, a director whose career has taken many a crowd-pleasing turn. This is a magical alternative to the Christmas pantomime."
"ObservationBlogger","9","2","5","3 January 2013"," I cannot remember seeing a better movie in the Cinema. MASTERPIECE!
","I just got back from seeing it tonight. I can't remember seeing any movie in the cinema more captivating, spiritually enlightening and adventure-filled. This movie is indeed a MASTERPIECE which will be talked about and loved for many years to come. Like Gandhi was to politics, this movie is like an important missing piece of item to the religion baggage as portrayed in cinema.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is such a brave, but elegant director. I grew to love 'Brokeback Mountain' and I now consider that a masterpiece too and whilst these movies are totally different in nearly every aspect Ang Less is able to make Characters shine with such authenticity that amplifies the beauty of human imperfection like so few director's can.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a lot of Amadeus. It had a similar story telling tone and intensity. I think Amadeus is better, (although time will tell) but this movie is also an epic of similar spiritual proportions and has brought to the screen something totally original and an almost child like adventurous spirit and innocence that has been missing from modern-day cinema for nearly as long as I can remember.<br/><br/>I do hope it wins the Academy Award for best picture. Unfortunately, 'The Master' by Paul Thomas Anderson movie wasn't nominated, probably because it's too far ahead of it's time. (see my review for 'the master' - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560747/reviews-208) <br/><br/>It's about time such a movie as 'Life of Pi' gets the nod for being simply a spiritual wondrous adventure filled movie that I always wished I had seen as a kid. It's as though I was thrown back in time. I cannot wait to see it again and again."
"Troy_Campbell","10","2","5","1 January 2013"," A bona fide masterpiece.
","A gorgeous motion picture that wears its heart proudly on its sleeve, this epic survival tale is sweet, poignant and thought-provoking. As castaway Pi (played in adolescent form capably by Suraj Sharma and as an adult by the phenomenal Irffan Khan) defies death whilst stranded on a boat with a ferocious Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, themes such as religion, faith, companionship and solitude are all explored. The beauty in David Magee's screenplay (adapted from Yann Martel's best-selling novel) is that each audience member will walk away with their own opinions and feelings on the aforementioned themes, depending on intelligence, maturity and cultural upbringing. This is not a film about religion in itself, but the context is there if you wish to acknowledge it. Otherwise it's a movie about belief, and having the strength of conviction in whatever it is you do choose to believe in.<br/><br/>If the story wasn't impressive enough, then Life of Pi also serves as a breathtaking display of visual splendour and wonderment. From the sweet opening credits to the majestic island that is inhabited by an untold number of meerkats in the final act, Ang Lee has put every ounce of effort behind the camera (and with his computer effects team) to create an awe-inspiring landscape, in 3D no less, for Pi to exist in. This is our world to be sure, but rarely has it been seen like this. Glowing jellyfish lighting up the way for a whale to jump out of the water at night, a sunrise mirrored in perfect symmetry by the still ocean or a gigantic freighter sinking to the plumbs of the Pacific; every shot is one of glorious realisation that could easily be photographed and hung on a wall. Most importantly, Richard Parker is rendered utterly believable thanks to the seamless combination of a real tiger and flawless CGI. <br/><br/>A bona fide masterpiece."

Because as we see at the end this was only one of the two possible stories since the boy after having reached Mexico and been admitted to a hospital tells the representatives of the Japanese company that owned the ship a quite different story (although dramatic as well) after they told him they didn't believe in the first one. This feature of the plot enhances the quality of the film. Which one was true? We'll never know but both are very rich in their dramatic contents. The visual special effects are splendid and fortunately most of them were made by computer work since a few acts of cruelty against living animals (or presented as such) would have been to blame. Not exactly a very good movie but good enough and worth to be seen."

","Just got back home from watching Life of Piand I am stunned! This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen – and I've seen a lot of them. The closest that comes to this picture was seeing Avatar in 3D. This movie will take your breath away. One the way home, we all played the, ""What was your favorite scene"" thingand this is giving nothing awaybut at one point this little boat is floating out in the middle of the ocean with the sky reflected on the water, the same brilliant colors above and below so you can hardly tell which is up and which is down. To say that it's beautiful doesn't come close to doing it justice. And that is only one scene that will leave you amazed. This picture has so many Oscar's in store for it that, frankly, the rest of the list should simply pack up and stay home. There was not one single word, not one single scene that should have been any different than what it was. And Suraj Sharma who is Pi Patel carries so much of this movie brilliantly, playing against nothing but the ocean and a tiger, that it's nothing short of amazing. Nobody should miss this film. It's one you will never forget!"

","A little intro-<br/><br/>Just got back from watching it, I didn't have an IMDb account until now. Saw the top review wasn't great. Needed an input. Not going for well written full on review. Film student at a prestigious uni.<br/><br/>A beautiful, magic and wonderful visual journey. A magical story with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in my life. A tragic and heart wrenching portrayal of a journey of love, loss, faith, survival and hope. Do yourself a favour and go and watch it, after noticing the gross for this film was so low (probably due to the Hobbit) I felt obliged to write this, if I convince one person to go and watch it then I'm happy. I spent the whole film switching between smiling and tears. As with any great film I don't need to say the acting was great, the soundtrack was great etc. Every aspect was flawless. The thing that stood it apart though was the photography, almost every single still in this film could've been a phenomenal painting or photograph, simply beautiful. <br/><br/>I'm quite a closed minded person when it comes to religion but this (very subtly might I add) portrayed faith in a truly incredible manner I've never seen in a film before. <br/><br/>I could write for hours about this film but I'm tired so I'll keep it short and sweet and say - Go and watch it. Give these filmmakers your money.<br/><br/>A masterpiece in every single way that it set out to be."
"BharatSamra","8","2","5","27 December 2012"," Life of Pi, mi oh mi
","Ang Lee's aesthetic masterpiece has one extraordinary ability: Life of Pi is a film of beautifully sustained momentum throughout. We are so gracefully paced through the narrative and immersed into the theatrical experience, despite the fact the events endured are not necessarily progressive. This is one of the few releases whereby the 3D is actually engaging, not distracting and aids in the artistic integrity of the picture.<br/><br/>This is storytelling! The majority of Life of Pi is presented in flashback form, often returning to the present to have our protagonist show his emotional reaction to the story of his own life. This works. The structural operation in effect in the film is fascinating. We ask questions; why does this one man's story matter? Did these events really happen to the character? What is the meaning of the story? To be brief, the climactic revelation that comfortably explains and answers our queries is so phenomenally crafted and logical that it renovates what was throughout, a seemingly good film, into one of 2012s most fantastic features.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is such a fragile picture that it almost is entitled to avoid negative criticism. Lee's piece is so wonderfully constructed that to say changes should be made is unquestionably difficult as, as the films stands, it is near flawless. Nonetheless, I believe that few additional scenes would benefit the narrative in various ways. I had no emotional investment with the film, which I was constantly hoping for. This is not negative sentiment, more so a hopeful one. Regardless of its existing greatness, Life of Pi could have been greater. Had more character interaction taken place on the ship, we, or just I, would have felt a vast amount of relation to our protagonist Pi, and his story would have felt like my story, yet there was a particular distance between audience and character. This resulted in connecting with the character known as The Writer, whom the story is being told to by Pi, rather than Pi himself. This is something I wanted from the film, rather than disliked.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is a spiritual, visual and telling tale, that absorbs us into a magical journey that feels as if the screen resolution is wrapping around the theatre, giving us the feel of no escape, not that we would want to interrupt this 127 minute majesty. This is the only way I relate to Pi, for he has only himself and Bengal tiger Richard Parker for company, while I felt as if it was just me and the screen in the room. Even the ignorantly talkative cinema-goers behind me failed to disrupt this truly beautiful cinematic experience for me. Ang Lee leaps beyond the satisfactory, beyond the splendid, reaching the extraordinary, that did have the potential to be even more so, though still remains a great stature as this year's film count concludes."
"Likes_Ninjas90","9","2","5","23 December 2012"," In equal parts dazzling, thoughtful and ambiguous
","Based on the 2001 novel by Yann Martel, Life of Pi is the metaphysical and spiritual journey of a character who must question their physical endurance and willingness to sustain their faith in God. This character is named Pi Patel and we first see him in present day Canada as a man (played by Irrfan Khan) who is preparing to tell an amazing story to a writer (Rafe Spall). Pi's story begins at a young age when he is a schoolboy in India. His parents are strict but intelligent and run a zoo with a huge array of animals. The film traces Pi's life to when he is a young man (Suraj Sharma), who is reluctant to join his parents once they sell the zoo and move overseas. Once onboard a Japanese ship transporting the zoo animals to be sold, a huge storm floods the vessel and Pi is separated from his family. He finds himself in a lifeboat with a zebra and somehow survives the storm. A fantasy adventure of imagination begins, where several other animals emerge from under the covers of the lifeboat, including a tiger. Fearful of the tiger, Pi resorts to building himself a mini raft attached to the boat. He must use a survival guide and other skills to control the tiger and retake the lifeboat. <br/><br/>Director Ang Lee has never made the same film twice. His constant versatility and creative mind for unique visual spaces defines his work. His films including Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain each adopted a unique filmic style appropriate to the material. Only someone with such diverse and sophisticated formal knowledge like Lee could have made Life of Pi work as well as it does. Once deemed unfilmable, the film's visual sophistication bridges the gap between an art house project and mainstream blockbuster. Its stunning visual qualities do not stand isolated but provide cinematic representations of complex philosophical questions surrounding myths, religion and faith. <br/><br/>In lesser hands this might have been a more bloated, less intelligent film. Before Lee, the project was passed between several directors including Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Alfonso Cuaron and M. Night Shyamalan, all of whom are considered visual stylists. Lee's personal strength as a filmmaker is that he rarely allows images to be devoid of meaning. His approach to this complex material is wholly cinematic: he challenges the audience to draw meaning from the properties of the screen and the images, realising a film that is in equal parts dazzling, thoughtful and ambiguous. <br/><br/>The only stumbling points are the early scenes where Lee deters from his cinematic approach. The jumble of anecdotes, including Pi being named after a swimming pool, are confused and estranged from the rest of the film. But the screenplay by David Magee finds its footing once it adopts a linear structure to tell Pi's life story. Expositional dialogue is skilfully masked as provocative philosophical statements, which are then attached to the film's Biblical imagery. The film's midsection, spent almost exclusively on the raft with the animals, visualises Pi's desolated world and draws parallels to stories like Noah's Ark. <br/><br/>The animals in these scenes are a powerful example of Lee's emphasis on combing theme and image. Early in the film Pi shows great interest in the tiger. But his father says to him: ""When you look into its eyes, you see only your own emotions reflected back at you"". This statement is problematised by the displacement of the animals on the raft. Are the animals real or part of Pi's imagination? The animals, I think, reflect Pi's shifting emotional states. When Pi is afraid, the tiger shows more aggression. When he learns to tame the animal, it shows more control. These images are also allegories for God's own existence. If one fears God, like Pi fears the dominance of the tiger, doesn't that project our own vision of God in our minds? The basis of the film is therefore how much faith we are willing to place into something that might only be a state of mind. <br/><br/>Using a number of aesthetic devices, the film makes a dazzling case for the power of imagination and visual stylisation over conventional naturalism. Colour desaturation is used purposely, with the white tones of Pi's clothes stressing his desire for a cleansing experience on the boat but perhaps also to show impending death given the unlikelihood of his survival. The tiger's half of the boat is coloured red. It matches the colour of tiger to instigate a place of fear that Pi must overcome. Lee also allows his camera to be unconstricted by reality. The fluidity and tilting movements of the camera are used to stunning effect in a storm sequence that takes on Biblical and apocalyptic proportions. There are gentler moments of great power too, where Lee opts to take us deep under the ocean, delivering some of the most striking images in cinema. Abstract and impressionistic images, like a sea of blue neon lights under the ocean, are enhanced spectacularly by bursts of colour and unintrusive 3D effects. <br/><br/>To define precisely what these scenes mean, and many others including a bizarre episode involve thousands of fish and an island of meerkats, would be futile. The film isn't concerned with facts, logic or realism. It stresses how stories and myths inspire our survival as a species. Posing a belated question about what type of stories we would rather hear, inspiring fantasy or scientific rationale like the survival of the fittest, is clever because the answer is predetermined by the amazing things we've already seen. There's a small end moment where the film undermines its sophisticated ambiguity by explaining a twist too neatly but minor quibbles never deter from the power of Lee's craftsmanship. Life of Pi has the spectacle of a blockbuster but compliments its flair with heart and intelligence - compelling reasons see this astonishing film on the big screen."
"akik1259","9","2","5","23 December 2012"," Great survival story with beautiful 3D
","This movie was better than I thought, not just because of the 3D, but because it's the story of a boy's heartfelt story of survival. After his family decides to move their zoo from India to North America, a terrible storm capsizes their ship. The boy, named Pi (short for Piscine, which is French for pool),finds himself awash on a lifeboat with a giant Bengal tiger. Pi must not only learn to survive at sea, but keep himself from being eaten! <br/><br/>The story is told through flashbacks given by an adult Pi, played by Irrfan Khan, as he recalls his tale to a journalist who wants to write about him, played by Rafe Spall. Teenage Pi is played by Suraj Sharma and he gives a very convincing performance of a boy who has lost everything, but still hopes to survive. There are also flashbacks of Pi's boyhood as he finds enlightenment with various religions and discovers love for the first time. You learn a lot about this boy's background before the main story actually happens. <br/><br/>Visually, this is one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. Right from the beginning, the opening shots of the various animals at the zoo are shot beautifully. The 3D is also very effective. The shipwreck scene, which is quite long, was amazing to behold, with the water effects and animals floating. The Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker, is mostly CGI, but at times he looked so real and so up close that my hairs stood up. There are also other impressive scenes involving luminous jellyfish and agile flying fish.<br/><br/>The movie has several spiritual messages, due to Pi's multi-religious lifestyle, and that may turn off some viewers. The ending may also confuse viewers (I was left scratching my head for a while), but these are the only real flaws I find with the movie. Pi's story of survival is very engaging and beautiful to look at. I think Ang Lee has created his best film yet."
"sleej003","9","2","5","23 December 2012"," As visually stunning as it is inspirational
","I entered the viewing of 'Life of Pi' with a lot of doubt. I thought that the film would be interesting but not particularly 'mind-blowing' so to speak. I couldn't have been more wrong The film starts with the story of how Pi got his name (he's named after a swimming pool in France, his full name being Piscine) and drew me in immediately. As the film continued and we learnt more about the character I began to emphasis with him more and understand him. His beliefs and ideas about faith and religion are particularly captivating. I find myself now thinking about different religious faiths and beliefs. When the climax of the film came around an hour in (the actually crash of the ship) the sequences that followed were awe inspiring and inspirational. Even funny at times. They show how a young boy did not lose hope, even as death drew ever closer. I was never bored at any given scene with every scene having some meaning and showing some kind of poignancy, interest, visual brilliance or lesson of humanity. I also found it to be as visually stunning as it is inspirational. For me, it is a film of a love, loss, faith and never losing hope. Something we can all relate to, even though we may not be ship wrecked with a 450-pound Bengal tiger."

"gur-dhar","10","2","5","22 December 2012"," Very finest cinematic experience !
","The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.<br/><br/>Tabu has a strong screen presence and given the small role, yet she makes a long lasting impression. In her second international project after ""The Namesake"", Tabu makes the best out of the limited opportunity she gets. Adil Hussain is competent aside a dominating actor. Irfan Khan as the narrator & the older Pi is also refreshing. Suraj Sharma is an inexperienced actor but that never shows.<br/><br/>Believe in god or not, but if you believe in cinema, you will surely be blessed with a gift. The word I would use to concisely describe Life of Pi is: ""beautiful""."
"bashlal","7","2","5","20 December 2012"," scientifically challenged
","I think the possible scientific explanation of this entire event that the boy experienced could be nothing but dream or hallucination or delirium. the most logical sequence of events as i see it is that the boy hits his head or may be due to extreme state of starvation, dehydration or stress is either hallucinating or dreaming while he laid in the boat in an unconsciousness state until he hits the beach where he is rescued by Mexican guys. the whole dramatization is pretty much unreal otherwise. the appearance of this unrealistic floating island which is not known to exist and disappearance of tiger supports this argument. good for a change though."
"papukamakshi","9","2","5","19 December 2012"," Outstanding visuals, surprisingly funny, impressive debut by Suraj Sharma
","Loved the movie, despite the divergences from the novel.<br/><br/>I laughed more than I expected to because Ang Lee has done a great job with the way dialogs are delivered, the timing of responses, and the intensely accessible facial expressions he has managed to extract from the younger actors. <br/><br/>Irrfan Khan as the older Pi is enigmatic and appropriately wry. He is an actor of magnificent understatement and terrific depth.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma deserves every kind of praise because he has had to carry the film with probably only empty space to act with. Imagine, there's a projected animation of a tiger and a wide endless sea for environment. Suraj Sharma has done virtual one-man acting through much of the film to pull of something of a masterful debut.<br/><br/>I hope we get to see more of Adil Hussain. His character exudes strength and he conveys the character's love of family with exceptional sensitivity.<br/><br/>Then there's the ever-stunning Tabu, who appears fleetingly and is still utterly impressive. <br/><br/>Ang Lee thinks in light and color and movement. What a genius to convey what he imagines to millions via technology and a team of skilled professionals. <br/><br/>See this movie. It is the sort of movie that leaves you with images never experienced."

","I'm sure I was like so many who had read the book. Frankly we were skeptical and didn't want to go. We were more than skeptical; we were cynics, doubters and we were almost afraid to go to see the film fearing it might adulterate our love for the book.<br/><br/>How could you turn this amazing book, this amazing yet highly personal and internal journey into a visual feast? Who could film some of the parts of the book that were almost dreamlike and yet intensely realistic and violent? How to convey the utter sadness and yet the exhilarating triumph of this individual journey? What would happen to the writer's unique use of language, his pacing in the book, his quirky scene setting? How would this all fit in? <br/><br/>Wow Ang Lee obviously loved the book just as much as we all did. I guess when he read the book he could picture it all visually as a visual storyteller supreme. Certainly the best movie of the year. A ""tour de force"" in film making. You wanted to stand at the end and give the film a standing ovation."
"kunalkhandwala","9","2","5","12 December 2012"," Mesmerizing, contemplative and enjoyable
","For years, a best-selling novel was deemed to be non-filmable due to its sheer scale of fantasy involving a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck. Until a visionary film-maker adapted every element and enriched it with today's latest computer-generated imagery to give us yet another masterpiece. In what could be one of the best adaptations of a fantasy novel, director Ang Lee celebrates with the modernity of cinema to tell a compelling tale that captivates one's imagination. Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi' is brilliantly visualized while maintaining a powerful narrative in spiritual and emotional harmony. <br/><br/>The writer (Rafe Spall) meets Piscine Patel (Irrfan Khan) in the charming backdrop of Pondicherry where he inquires about Piscine's origins. In a most natural manner, Khan narrates his childhood and upbringing, including the origins of his eccentric name, how it evolved to 'Pi', his religious explorations and his father's principles. ]The writer then inquires about the most interesting part of Pi's life. In the tumultuous period of emergency that was declared in India, Pi's father decides to move to Canada while selling off all their animals from the zoo they managed.They set sail on the Tsimtsum with its kind Buddhist sailor and brash cook. Woken by a thunderstorm, Pi's initial enthusiasm about it is soon turned into a nightmare as the ship begins to capsize and he is left stranded on a boat, watching the vessel take his family down into the ocean with it. Pi has no time to react to such tragedy in the storm as soon enough, he realizes that he isn't alone on the lifeboat. While the Hyena kills off the zebra and orangutan, the Tiger named Richard Parker (clerical error at the Zoo) overcomes the vile creature and becomes the King of the boat. Pi's struggle to survive off the boat, safely distant from Richard Parker poses emotional, logistical and mental challenges. Below that surface level though, we witness Pi's determination to get rescued, his will to keep the tiger alive to give purpose to his own existence and his mental strength that made him resourceful in every circumstance. Spiritually, Pi suffers it all and through hunger, pain, fear, dejection and eventually determination, he sees the work of God in everything around him. Yet, Ang Lee's version does not dive deep into the spiritual realm. Nor does it portray the extreme harshness of being stranded in the middle of the Pacific ocean. The film's strength is in its tender moments of silence between Pi and Richard Parker as they witness the different tides together. Ang Lee chose to overpower the viewer by immersing into the sea of visual artistry rather than have a debate over God and food on a boat; And it worked.<br/><br/>Ang Lee has most effectively used three elements to dazzle the viewer. Water, light and life. Never before has the ocean looked so daunting, rough, dark, transparent and serene, all in one movie. Through Pi's rigorous struggle to survive storms, we witness the ocean take on a ferocious form which is captured in a spectacular manner by Claudio Miranda. Then we witness the beautiful marine life in tranquil waters that are phosphorescent (the whale shot was phenomenal) and the serene waters when the Tiger and Pi are simply staring into the depths of the ocean. Then of course, the CGI of the animals and especially that of the Bengal Tiger. Someone would have to tell you that it wasn't real. That's how good the CGI work on Richard Parker was and every expression, reaction and movement was very real-like. A refinement that we had last witnessed in 'The Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. The hyena, the millions of meerkats on the carnivorous island and the flying fish were equally stunning creations. In the midst of all this, there were some beautiful 3D elements that were dancing and moving on the screen which gave us a sense of 'Avatar'. Overall, the film is a must watch in 3D because there is just so much creativity that sets a benchmark for future productions that indulge in fantasies. <br/><br/>Irrfan Khan is just splendid. His narrative comes so naturally as though it was his personal story. The narrative is so finely balanced between fact and allegory and Khan never gives you a chance to choose one over the other, thus leaving an Inception kind of ending to ponder over. Adil Hussain was impressive as Pi's father with a versatile performance whereas Tabu did not have a role that would challenge her by any means. Andrea Di Stefano as the priest who introduces Pi to the son of God was remarkable in a cameo. But the film is heavily dependent on Suraj Sharma to carry the various emotions that a survivor of a shipwreck would have to exhibit in various circumstances at sea. Suraj easily relates to Pi's trauma upon being stranded, his desperation to live, his fear of the Tiger, his anger with the Tiger, his determination to survive, his despair at losing hope and his regaining of hope. His is one of the finest debut performances we have seen in a very long time and the credit goes to Ang Lee and David Magee's screenplay for extracting such brilliance from him.<br/><br/>""Maybe Richard Parker can't be tamed,"" Pi tells himself, ""but with God's will he can be trained."" Ang Lee refrains from being preachy about Pi's religious sentiments in a storm or in solitude. Instead, he highlights the face of humanity in adversity. He touches upon various religions but the importance of having one is seldom the focus. The older Pi may have narrated the story of him and the Tiger to the writer to make him believe in God but the audience is never driven to it. Spirituality lingers in the background, never being direct. Perhaps that subtlety is the reason Life of Pi is such a universally enjoyable film. <br/><br/>8.85 on a scale of 1-10."

"darthmatthew-442-606491","9","2","5","8 December 2012"," Visually stunning, but remains focused on a deep main idea
","Every decade or so, a film with such potency is released that it is clear that it will be a classic. I had the honor of watching one such film, Life of Pi, the depths of which I am still exploring. Ang Lee's masterpiece is visually breathtaking, and yet in all its beauty remains focused on its main idea, a feat not claimed by many VFX heavy movies.<br/><br/>The visual effects weren't just high quality, they were bursting with creativity. The animals are nearly indiscernible from their flesh and bone counterparts, but they pale in comparison to the stunning shots of the still, mirrored ocean reflecting the light of the rising sun; glowing fish swarming around the life boat at night. Some of the shots were so perfect I nearly cried.<br/><br/>The strange thing about this film is that I don't have much to say about it, and I suppose that should be the goal of film--simplicity. The acting was flawless; it did what it needed to do without wasting time being ""cool."" That characters weren't breathtaking in any way, but they served the super objective, keeping the focus on the ideas rather than the characters. In the end, I wasn't thinking, ""Oh, that Pi kid was really interesting."" I was left to ponder on the ideas presented (I will discuss those ideas under the spoiler warning section for those who wish to see more evidence) That's what film should do.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is simply the embodiment of the purpose of film. It presents an idea, develops it, and supports it. It is subtle. It doesn't ram the ideas down our throats with superfluous narrative, nor does it waste time explaining things that don't benefit the ideas. If I were to answer the question of ""What is film?"" I would direct people to Life of Pi. I feel like I have experienced not merely a bedtime story, but a dream, straight from the mind of Ang Lee.<br/><br/>**Spoiler Alerts** **Spoiler Alerts** **Spoiler Alerts**<br/><br/>As I have heaped such prestigious amounts of praise on Life of Pi, I feel the need to explain more in depth the reasons for my comments on the depth of the ideas in Life of Pi. Many people have accused Life of Pi of merely being a ""Call to Conversion."" And while it does deal with religion, it is not merely about that. It is a story about faith and how that faith teaches us about the nature of our hearts.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, Pi and his family are sitting around the dinner table, where his father is lecturing him on the benefits of science and reason. His mother interjects, and says while science does teach us about the intricacies of the world, faith is the manner in which we learn about what's, ""In here,"" pointing to her heart. The faith-based events following that scene are analogies that support that idea. Their move to Canada represents changes in life, and how people should strive to view them as opportunities. The shipwreck represents discouragement/disappointment when opportunities don't work out as planned. But as Pi reads in his survival manual, ""Do not lose hope."" It represents viewing challenges as a way to grow in strength. The floating island represents places which are, ""Good enough."" It warns us not to become complacent, and that in staying there, we are slowly being eaten alive by loneliness. It is not our home. When Richard Parker leaves, he doesn't look back, symbolizing letting go and not looking back.<br/><br/>Finally, in the end, the Japanese businessmen ask why the ship sank, not believing Pi's outlandish story. So Pi told them a realistic story grounded in reality. Pi's entire experience was an analogies for his mother's comment during that conversation. It doesn't matter that the ship sank, what matters is how we grow as a result. The realistic story much like science gives a more explainable answer to what happened, but it would have taught Pi nothing. The fantastical one was better because it taught him more about the nature of his heart, showing the usefulness for faith. It argues that simply believing in things unseen requires us to give up trying to use our minds and instead live by our hearts. Pretty deep stuff if you ask me."

","Known as the one man who will take various risks of making a movie out of almost every single film genre imaginable, Ang Lee, of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" fame, directs his latest hit, ""Life of Pi"", based on the popular novel of the same name. It's that rare movie that will transport audiences into a world unlike no other, succeeding to entertain in both visual style and story. This is one of the most memorable, and one of the very best films of the whole year. ""Life of Pi"" tells the brave story of a young teen nicknamed ""Pi"", whom ends up on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, accompanied by a ferocious Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker (I know, it's weird). But I know what you're wondering, ""How did these two unfortunate souls ended up in this mess in the first place?"". Well, without spoiling anything, it's told through the point of view of older Pi, played by Irrfan Khan, as he tells a writer his entire life story, from his experiences at his family zoo, to a massive shipwreck during a journey to Canada for Pi and his family to start a new life, and how it lead to a situation considered impossible where Pi, as a teenager, got stuck on a lifeboat for weeks, with a tiger! Filmed in gorgeously breathtaking 3-D technology, ""Life of Pi"" is one absolute visual marvel. Director Ang Lee has thrown in some of the most beautiful images ever seen on the silver screen, and uses these images as his own unique way to tell the story. I recommend that everybody should see this movie in the theater, in the 3-D format, on the largest screen possible. It's a better way to experience this visual spectacle with such a massive scope. From a technical standpoint, ""Life of Pi"" succeeds in the use of cinematography, editing, and visual effects. But from a performance standpoint, while Irffan Khan does one of his best performances as older Pi, the scene-stealing breakthrough performance comes from Suraj Sharma, who does a rather brilliant job in capturing the heroism of young Pi, while at the same time, trying to communicate with a computer-generated tiger. It's a performance that I hope will score him his first ever Best Actor nomination. His relationship with this tiger is something to enjoy to watch unfold on screen. Their various face-offs with each other show the accurate profession of animals between humans. Although sharing complete loath between each other in the beginning, we find a strange friendship somewhere, as well. This movie delivers every human emotion to the audience, whether making you laugh, cry, or giving you a strange feeling of hope. At a well-paced 127-minute running time, ""Life of Pi"" is one of the best movie-going experiences I've ever had. From start to finish, Ang Lee has brought me on board for an incredible ride, while finishing off with an ending that will definitely leave a smile on your face. The incredible visuals, the spell-binding cinematography and editing, the stand-out performance from Suraj Sharma, Ang Lee's masterful directing, and the movie itself, are all worthy of Oscar consideration. ""Life of Pi"", in my review, ""visually enhancing, a masterful journey""."

","Synopsis:<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" Yann Martel's 2001 best-selling novel, is a magical adventure story of a young boy, Pi Patel, son of Santosh Patel, a zoo owner living in Pondicherry, India. The family decides to move the zoo to Canada, hitching a ride on a huge freighter. After a shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a 26-foot lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, all fighting for survival.<br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>Novel ""Life of Pi"", and film director Ang Lee's version seems, I never imagine its possible to combine the philosophy into the film screen. The imagination through the novel was fantasy in my opinion when the film version is magically realistic. The use of modern highest resource of 3D technology is a merit of success achieved by the art-direction team, I salute. The film made me speechless even after it ends I was sitting and waiting to watch more and more. I was thinking where the digital entertainment is sailing the boat for the NextGen?<br/><br/>The movie contains good sense of humor regarding the dialogs. In market, Pi was following a girl he saw at the dance class. When she catches Pi and asked why he is following? Pi innocently asked at the dance class she ended two wrists joined loosely cupped hands, what does it mean, he wonders. The girl tells him, the lotus hides in the forest. Pi asked, ""Why lotus will hide in the forest?""<br/><br/>At the end when Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger left unceremoniously, Pi says, ""All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.""<br/><br/>Is God exists? <br/><br/>The narrator promises at the beginning that he will prove God exists. Well, in Yann Martel's book he did, but in Ang Lee's movie, did he or not? In 2012 film ""Life of Pi"", you see the floating island of vegetation with its own ecosystem that could be boarded and had animals living on it out in the middle of the ocean. It seems far-fetched, but does anything you notice in the movie?<br/><br/>Pi Patel's confession of faith was regarding Lord Vishnu, the Vedic God who masters the past, present and future, the one who supports, sustains and governs the Universe and originates and develops all elements within. Its called Vishnu sleeps in the ocean of milk with his companions. Did you see very carefully the structure of the floating island? The art-director shaped the island like sleeping Lord Vishnu! I was surprised to see the art work at a glance.<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie is a lifetime experience, so don't miss the movie and as well if you did not read the book then read it too. This is one of the remarkable philosophy of film-art."

","Elite club of exquisite works by Yan Martel, Ang Lee and team. Kudos to the ravishing and bold depiction of cinematography by Claudia Miranda. The struggle for survival becomes elegant when you have wealth of faith. Even the most horrifying experience hold a beauty within. Surviving a shipwreck for 227 days in an open sea with the dynamic mate such as a Bengal Tiger and crossing Pacific in a life boat is perhaps an unusual occurrence. However faith, friendship and perseverance can make such a tale. Superlative 3D technology and other technological and visual effects are simply jaw dropping and give a tactile essence. Story's opening fashion sets an anticipation of belief in God which is carried thematically. Drama and tension keeps the film truly electric. Odyssey that can rightly set on a voyage on cinematic triumph of a beautiful class. Pondicherry is textured as a delight. Visual mastery is the x factor of the movie and the best part, it never any where dominates the emotional and humanitarian aspects of the creation. Convincing enough to be called as a visual feast."

","People sometimes are pretentious. Even if they know that they wouldn't like a particular type of film, they barge in the theaters with their oh-I-am-cool-as-I-am-Sarcastic attitude, moan endlessly 'how boring the movie is!' end up making clichéd, snide remarks about the protagonist and his leading lady followed by raucous laughter. If you are that kind of persona, you shouldn't read further nor watch 'Life of Pi'. It's not for you. Unlike '127 Hours' which is based on a true story, this movie is based on the novel by the same name written by Yan Martel.<br/><br/>But when a true story inspires the spirit, the figment of imagination uplifts and gives wings to the spirit to soar high in the sky and not give a fig to reality. Not one but two stories emerge as Piscine Molitor Patel recounts his tale to a writer in search for a story who is referred to him by Piscine's uncle. And of course, it is upto us to choose from either of them! But of course, I would like to give you an overview of the more liked story ! Piscine Molitor Patel (named after the swimming pool in France), is the son of Santosh Patel, who is a businessman and a zoo owner in Pondicherry. Going through his turbulent teens, Pi (3.14 ), finds himself following three different faiths as he searches for the meaning of his life, not knowing that he would find one, one that would jarringly disconnect him from reality. His father, staring at the bleak prospects of his family's survival which is in the hands of the whimsical government of the day, decides to sell the animals and immigrate with his family to Canada. Pi unknowingly embarks upon a journey that would take his loved ones away and pit him in a battle of survival on a boat in the stormy waters of Pacific Ocean with an Orangutan, Hyena, zebra and a Bengal Tiger for company. The ship was ravaged by storm, killing all but him (if you choose to believe this more liked story) and a bunch of, some docile, some extremely wild animals. Soon enough, it's just him and the tiger on the boat against the mighty ocean, with its ethereal beauty and its gut-wrenching ire! This is a story of survival; this is a story of how faith can spell wonders ! This is a story of turf-war between the man and the wild, as even a slight misstep can get you inside the stomach of the tiger. Of course, as you know, I am least concerned which actors performed and which underperformed, would N. Shyamalan have proved a better director than Ang Lee, was the cinematography and the 3-D comparable to 'Avatar' and ad infinitum. I leave that job to the experts. All I can say for myself is that watching this movie was a cracking good way to pass time. Hope you enjoy it! P.S.:- If you like the movie, you can read the book. You're Welcome! P.P.S.:- Though this movie is made by American Production Houses, I beg someone to please change the entry on Wikipedia as this movie isn't an 'American Adventure Drama film'!!!"
"wmdm2024","8","2","5","1 December 2012"," Visually stunning, beautiful movie
","I will be brief. I have now read the book and seen the movie. The movie, seen in 3D, was incredible. It is the most beautiful movie I have seen visually. It is often compared to Avatar, but Avatar had no connection to reality and does not have the depth. It was pure fantasy, even James Cameron would agree. While both films, in my view, are the gold-standard for the use 3D technology, the visuals in Life of Pi are more artistic, real and stirring. The director is to be commended, the boat sequence is shot like an organic memory.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant with exception. But I believe the director struggled with the ending and how to shoot it, as the book does not translate well to film in this single pivotal area. In the end Ang Lee has the young Pi give an account to the investigators which makes sense, but i would have the older Pi, narrator (Irrfan Khan), give the account simply because I found him to be the more impactful performer. Also the account, as delivered by Pi, removes all doubt for the viewer as to what happened on the boat, whereas the book leaves room for interpretation which I preferred.<br/><br/>It is a brilliant movie, beautifully shot, and well acted. See it in the theatre, and pay the extra cash for 3D."

","Lot of movies have come on cast-aways or survival in difficult conditions. But Life of Pi definitely stands out differently than all of them. It not only gives an outstanding treat to your eyes but also some very touchy moments to your heart. Story starts in a bit off-beat and unanticipated way. Though initial part shown out of India creates some background for the main story, it becomes a bit lengthy after some time. That is exactly when director turns the plot skillfully to take the audience on an unimaginable journey. Ang Lee has done an excellent job in directing and story telling. He has brought out the best in all the actors as well as animals. Different eye-catching scenery has been mixed with the story beautifully. Some of the emotional interactions between Pi and the tiger are completely heart touching and unforgettable. All the actors, editors and supporting staff have done an excellent job creating this venture. Definitely 127 minutes worth spent...!!"

The screenplay is tight and the story is simple yet director Ang Lee has artistically made a different world in the movie. The CGI animation and effects of the tiger are so admirable that you won't believe that every shot on the boat with Suraj Sharma(young Pi) doesn't have any real tiger. That also shows the brilliance of Suraj's act as Pi patel, who was chosen from 3000 hopefuls for the lead role. Irfan Khan has such a good command over his dialogues, he grabs your attention instantly. Tabu and Adil Hussain are good in their brief roles.<br/><br/>Honestly, the movie did remind me of one of my favourite movies, 'Cast Away' starring Tom Hanks, which is incomparable.

"caseymoviemania","9","2","5","29 November 2012"," Casey's Movie Mania: LIFE OF PI (2012)
","Once deemed ""unfilmable"" by three directors (M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuaron and Jean-Pierre Jeunet) who came and exited the big-screen adaptation of Yann Martel's award-winning novel, LIFE OF PI, Taiwanese director Ang Lee takes up the challenge and he succeeds beautifully. LIFE OF PI is one of the year's most cinematic motion pictures ever seen -- it's visually stunning, emotionally gripping and thematically inspiring adventure drama that pushes (almost) all the right buttons.<br/><br/>From the first moment itself, the movie is intoxicating enough to hold your attention. The way how director Ang Lee establishes a serenity, Zen-like tone with a variety shots of the animals in Pi's father's exotic zoo is truly a sight to behold. With the help of Claudio Miranda's lush cinematography and Mychael Danna's soothing score, the opening scene evokes the kind of popular nature documentaries you found in TV's Planet Earth. While the opening act is undeniably slow, it's also crucial that Lee takes his time to establish his characters and the tone before he gets to the main point. At the hand of a lesser director, such approach can be a test of patience but Lee and screenwriter David Magee knows how to endear the viewers to Pi's life story, which is told in such elegant and poignant manner. And like how interesting life story is meant to be told, there's a healthy dosage of gentle humors and heartbreaking moments that feel so vivid, yet involving enough to make you care. By the time the movie reaches midway, Lee hits full gear ahead, beginning with one of the most terrifying storm sequences ever seen in a long time and of course, the subsequent sequence where Pi has to survive with a bunch of animals in the lifeboat. Here, Lee has also delivered some of the most breathtaking visual spectacles ever created in a movie -- at times it feels magical and stunning. Among them are the night scene where Pi encounters a swarm of jellyfish illuminating under the ocean as well as a run-in with a giant whale, and of course the unlikely battle scene with a school of flying fish passing through.<br/><br/>All the cast (mostly unknowns) are exceptionally top-notch. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is a real gem, and definitely a teen prodigy. Prior to this movie, he has no acting experience at all but thanks to his sheer determination and personal guidance by Lee himself, Sharma is very convincing as a teenager struggling against all odds while stranded in the middle of the ocean. Like Tom Hanks' magnificent one-man performance in 2000's CAST AWAY, there's the similar acting impact echoes within Sharma as well. No doubt he can handle both physically and emotionally-demanding scenes like a seasoned actor. Then there's Irrfan Khan, who plays adult Pi with such poignancy. The way he narrates his life story to the young writer is truly mesmerizing, as he captures the tone of a voice filled with enthusiasm and heartfelt emotions. What a remarkable storyteller, he is. Adil Hussain, in the meantime, is perfectly cast as Pi's strict father. Lastly of course, Richard Parker the Bengal tiger itself. You will have a hard time trying to differentiate between the real and fake tiger, thanks to the startlingly photorealistic CGI ever put in a movie. Not only that, Lee also successfully made that tiger a compelling character to watch for.<br/><br/>LIFE OF PI is almost a pitch-perfect movie experience, but Lee stumbles a bit during the finale. The particular finale, especially where it concerns the aftermath of Pi's survival in the ocean, is unnecessarily overlong. That excessive fat aside, LIFE OF PI remains a must-see movie for everyone."

","Life of Pi is National Geographic in 3D. Plus William Wordsworth's poetry. Plus Pablo Picasso's painting. Plus Relations. Plus Philosophy. Plus God. Yann Martel's story couldn't have been more picturesquely depicted. Ang Lee has capitalized on 3D technology to deliver a visual masterpiece. The movie opens 3D for new genre of cinema and proves how a movie adapted from novel can be made to reach that imagination level with help of technology. Here imagination is not just the animals or the landscape, but even in moments when the protagonist is lonely, you feel you are there right there with him in moments of disdain. Moreover, as an Indian, am proud of Suraj's impact debut and Irrfan Khan's benign presence in the movie."

","'LIFE OF PI': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Director Ang Lee's adaptation of the popular 2001 book (of the same name) by Yann Martel about a boy who survives a shipwreck only to be trapped on a boat in the Pacific Ocean with a deadly Bengal tiger. The screenplay was written by David Magee (who also wrote the script adaptation for the 2004 film 'FINDING NEVERLAND') and stars Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan in the title role (at two different stages of his life). The film is presented in 3D and packed with visual effects (for the telling of what was said to be an 'unfilmable' book). I found the film to be visually stunning but slow in places. It does build to a satisfactory conclusion though, about spirituality and how we all view the world.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Pi Patel (played by Sharma at age 17 and Khan when he's an adult in his 50s), who was named 'Piscine Molitor' by his parents (after a swimming pool in France). He changed his name to Pi in secondary school after growing tired of constantly being mocked for his name by fellow classmates. He was raised Hindu but also takes up Catholicism and Islam at age 12. His family owns a zoo but decides to sell the animals and move to Canada due to political problems arising in India. A storm causes the ship to sink and Pi is the only one who makes it on to a lifeboat, except for four other animals (a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a orangutan and a Bengal tiger). The hyena quickly feeds on the other animals before being killed by the tiger. Pi must then find a way to live on the boat with the deadly tiger (without being eaten by it). He tells this story to a reporter (Rafe Spall) when he's married with children and in his 50's.<br/><br/>Of course Pi's religious teachings come in to play while struggling to survive on the ocean. That's what the film is really about and it plays a part in a twist ending as well. What the film says about religion (in the end) might offend some viewers while enlightening others. I liked the overall message of the film. It's definitely a little slow at times due to the fact it primarily takes place on the ocean with one human castaway and a tiger. In that way the film is a little like Robert Zemeckis's 2000 film 'CAST AWAY' as well. Visually it's stunning and probably worth the price to see it in 3D (unless you just don't care for 3D). Not my favorite Ang Lee film but it's definitely a decent fantasy adventure.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8-fGGKVWPc"

","So far this is the best movie of the year. It is an entertaining, well-directed, well-performed piece of art. If you want to see what groundbreaking crafts look like, go see it. Yes, the special effects are mind-boggling, especially Richard Parker, the tiger. But only when you look beyond the 3-D and visual effects that hold you in awe for most part of the movie (and that you have probably read in several critical reviews) you begin to see the real genius of the film and its director. This is a Taiwanese director making a movie with a mostly Indian cast, about Indian characters and places and he pulls it off so well (his India is way more credible than the Dickenson India shown in Slumdog). <br/><br/>Life Of Pi is a bold movie made by a bold director who does not shy from making unconventional movies. Yes, it will upset some people for its unconventional subject, and some critics will find the off-beat movie preachy for they have grown so used to understatements and subtleties that they confuse those with art, but nobody can deny the powerful force of the movie. For the most part, the movie has only one human character on screen and yet it never gets boring - slow at times perhaps, but not boring. One last point - the movie could not have been what it is without the actors, particularly the one who plays adult Pi and the young actor who portrays teenage Pi and gives an unbelievable debut performance."

"The_Film_Cricket","10","2","5","25 November 2012"," And what a life it is! What a visual masterwork that Ang Lee has brought to the screen.
","Oh! And what a life it is! What a visual masterwork that Ang Lee has brought to the screen. Here is a story brimming with excitement, adventure, poetry, and the strange whims of drifting destiny. Here is the story of one life, one extraordinary man and his adventure to find himself and his way back home. It is based on a best-seller by Yann Martel, but it reminds you of the kinds of stories by Rudyard Kipling. It's that good.<br/><br/>Life of Pi tells the life story of an Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo in Pondicherry, India. We meet him in a series of opening passages that have a tone all of their own. He was born with the name Piscine, a word which, when translated from French to English means ""swimming pool"", but his parents overlook how the word looks on paper and so everyone calls him by an unflattering euphemism for urination. He silences their mockery one day in the classroom by demonstrating his wizardry at mathematics by showing them the constant of 3.14. From this, he shortens his name to Pi. We follow his upbringing as he comes to questions the nature of religion, settling on theories of Muslims, Hindus and Christians, trying to get a grasp on his purpose in life. His mother wants him to explore, but his father wants him to be more practical and real. These are lessons he will take with him all through life.<br/><br/>The zoo starts losing money, so Pi's father informs the family that they have to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They pack up their belongings and a few of the animals and board a Japanese freighter bound for their new home. Then one night a storm hits that is so ferocious that it could have come from the Bible. Pi falls into a 25-foot lifeboat and the freighter sinks. All on board are apparently killed but Pi finds himself briefly sharing the lifeboat with a zebra with a broken leg; a seasick orangutan; a hyena; and an ill-tempered Bengal tiger that turns the other animals into lunch (not to worry, it happens off-screen). Pi builds himself a raft out of oars and life-preservers and sits tethered to the boat until he can figure out how to deal with the tiger who has taken up residence in his boat.<br/><br/>Much like Robert Zemekis' Cast Away much of this movie deals with one man's fight for survival. The two are similar in their observations of trying to deal with survival under limited conditions, but this one takes place almost completely at sea. Pi tries to keep himself hydrated with rainwater and freshwater that was stored aboard the lifeboat, and with the few rations that he has. He also tries to keep the tiger – named Richard Parker – nourished with fish that he catches with his bare hands. He knows that the beast will eventually get hungry enough to turn on him if he doesn't keep its belly full.<br/><br/>The relationship with the tiger is not what we expect. Pi has several chances to let the beast drown or starve to death but he refuses. He admits, in his journal (which makes the excuse for voice-over narration), that the tiger is giving him instincts that he never felt before, like a new sense of alertness. What is so brilliant about the relationship is that Ang Lee never makes the mistake of making the tiger sentimental. This isn't one of those bond-with-animal movies from Disney. Lee never takes away the tiger's savage nature and that brings the story tension and a sense of grounded reality. A bond does form but it is more out of respect for the situation. Their final moments together are as real as they are touching.<br/><br/>That reality is necessary because the film occasionally breaks away from the real world and allows us some moments that are surreal, like a visit to a living, breathing island that seems prepared to have Pi and Richard Parker for lunch. Visually the movie is breathtaking. There are shots here that are not just computer effects but are shown just to allow us some moments of pure beauty. One shot in particular takes place underwater as we are looking up at the boat with the sky behind it. There doesn't seem to be any water there and Pi seems to just be floating on air. The CG effects here are miraculous, especially in giving life to the tiger. He is a savage beast, yes, but eventually we see him as Pi sees him, and we come to like him without finding him cuddly. This is a movie that respects animals by not making the mistake of trying to humanize them.<br/><br/>What happens in the film's final act is a question left to the viewer over the validity of what we have just seen. There are many questions to be raised about those moments and many that are difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The ending will illicit many deep discussions afterwards.<br/><br/>To watch Life of Pi is to observe how few films really consider their characters, how few consider the spiritual journey of the adventure they are undertaking. A lot of films are about journeys of violence or revenge but can hardly be bothered to deal with what the characters have learned. This movie is so much more than that."

","Life of Pi â€“ don't miss it! It's not just another 3D movie for kids and by the way, calling it a children's movie will be Life of Pi's biggest insult. Unlike other 3D movies, the director Ang Lee has used digital effects not only to entertain but also to explore the finer thread that binds together the human understanding of fate, faith, religion, and god. To that effect, he seems to have done an awesome job, which might as well win him a third Oscar nomination for the best achievement in directing. The 58 year old Taiwan borne director has won the award once before for the 2006 flick Brokeback Mountain. Acting is another strong point of the movie. Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan look profound and amazing. Their acting may ensure them more such fine performances in international cinema. <br/><br/>All and all, a wonderful journey into the unknown and hence the unexpected!<br/><br/>CAVEAT: In the last five minutes of the movie, Ang Lee tries to give a cerebral twist, which may make you yawn especially since it entirely lacks 3D special effects which until then drive the whole movie at breakneck pace."

","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).<br/><br/>Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of ""Pi,"" a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with ""movie stars."""

But I was also nervous that the movie might not actually be as upto the mark as the novel, as the story is totally one of its kind. But MY MY..The movie without diverting a bit from the novel(except the lightning whale scene) has captured every bit of the book and by creating a visual masterpiece Mr Ang Lee has even surpassed the effect the novel had on myself. I watched it last night and even after a long night of sleep the movie still is not out of me yet. Watch it if you haven't already, and if you have then watch it again, as most of you from the later category would agree that it's worth a second watch in the theater. Also please watch it in 3D only. I haven't seen a better 3D movie except Avatar and Kung-Fu-Panda-2. Watch it otherwise you won't even know what you missed and that will be a real pity..."

","Director Ang Lee has done a great job in the ancient art of storytelling. This story of survival of the fittest at sea is visually beautiful although there are scenes that can be a bit disturbing. The story is being told by the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) to a down and out writer (Rafe Spall) who is looking for material for a new book. The film does an excellent job of explaining how Pi got his name and how the lessons of his father helps him to cope with the difficulties that he is about to encounter. I think that the incorporation of religion also added some depth to this film by surmising that religion is not as important as spirituality. Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, hyena, orangutan and a Bengal Tiger (affectionately named Richard Parker) are the survivors of an unexplained shipwreck. From that point on Pi has to figure out a way to stay alive, not just from the animals, but also from Mother Nature herself. I can tell you right now that if it was me on the boat I probably wouldn't have lasted a day. But I guess you never know what you might do when presented with extenuating circumstances. I was not really familiar with any of the actors in this film except Gerard Depardieu who played the cook. Now that I think about it, he was a cook in the last film that I saw him in (Last Holiday with Queen Latifah). Apparently this film was based on a book that no one thought could possibly be made into a film; I guess they were wrong. The mere idea of moving a zoo from one continent to another is pretty mind boggling in itself. I do have to say that the CGI in this film was amazing and took computer imagery to a whole new level, but I would not expect anything less from Lee. I especially liked the scenes in the ocean and the events on the mysterious island. Although this film had a ""G"" rating, I am not sure if it would be appropriate for very small children but I enjoyed this film very much. I do want to add that the minor plot twist at the end kind of makes you wonder what to believe. There is no need for a life jacket for this one. I am giving the film a green light."

"HannahToucan248","7","2","5","22 November 2012"," This movie is about a boy named Pi who is part of a shipwreck and ends up on a life boat with a tiger.
","This movie is very good. Not life changing, but very good. Pi's adventures are very inspiring. You can catch yourself mentally cheering for Pi and the tiger.<br/><br/>***Spoiler Alert***I say this only for the sake of advising people about content*** Don't be fooled when the parental guidelines say that there is no fighting and intense scenes. My nine-year-old sister who usually is perfectly fine in movies was very upset and disturbed by this one. There are some sad scenes including the following: It shows Pi as a young boy trying to feed a tiger at his father's zoo. His father comes in and witnesses him doing this, and not only does he harshly scold him, but he decides to teach him a ""lesson"". A man brings in a live goat and ties it to the tiger cage. Pi's Mom is shown covering Pi's eyes and we later see the tiger with a bloody goat in his mouth.<br/><br/>Pi is on a boat with lots of animals. There is an intense storm that may be frightening to younger kids.<br/><br/>During the storm, the boat sinks, killing Pi's family. Pi is the only one who makes it out alive.<br/><br/>Pi is on a lifeboat with a zebra, hyena, orangutans, and a tiger. Things quickly get out of hand. The hyena kills the zebra, and Pi is on the verge of killing the hyena when the orangutans and the hyena start a fight. The hyena ends up killing the orangutans. The tiger swoops in and kills the hyena, but Pi is now in danger. This is all shown very graphically, and it's the most intense part of the film.<br/><br/>Sharks are shown as a threatening thing in the water throughout the film.<br/><br/>Pi and the tiger are on an island with lots of meerkats, and the tiger eats some of the meerkats.<br/><br/>It looks at one point that the tiger will die.<br/><br/>Pi has to make up a story in the end of the film which is very disturbing.<br/><br/>That is about all of the intense scenes in the movie, but another point is that the movie is very religious, and some young kids may be bored by that. For a PG movie, this is fairly intense. I would advise not taking a child younger than nine or ten to this movie unless the child is 100% always okay with all movies."
"rivertam26","5","5","20","25 November 2012"," Fails to connect
","Acclaimed director Ang Lee has taken the supposedly unfilmable book and turned it into an overlong, technically brilliant mixed bag. Centering on a young boy who finds himself stranded on a boat with a Bengal tiger after a ferocious storm sinks the ship he was on. There is about 40 minutes before leading up to those vents where we meet the main character and his family. I got the themes of truth vs. fiction, coming of age in the face of tragedy and the symbolism of an animalistic nature, but i can't say that I got anything to deep or profound from this film. And there are many reasons I believe I didn't but here let's start with the good. The movie is technically brilliant. The effects are truly sensational especially the animal design. it's truly captivating to say the least and the movie also has some inspired whimsical cinematography. Now for the not so good I found myself unimpressed with the films human performances especially the central one. It's not that he was bad but he failed to engage especially in the face of such incredible events it just didn't feel emotionally resonant and engaging like it should have and part of that lies in the direction which I'd like to say was solid for the most par. But here's the thing once you discover what this film is about it kind of is unfilmable. It's something that works much better on the page. Because as a film it just doesn't mesh well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone thinking of seeing it. but if you're expecting to be inspired and feel as though there is a strong profound message that will mirror something in your life, you're going to be disappointed. The film is just what it is and nothing more in my opinion at least. It moves along ploddingly and although it has genuine moments of cinematic inspiration it fails to really connect on a level that counts and after a while it all feels like you are the one barely surviving."
"ifredpr","3","4","15","14 January 2013"," Visuals yes, ending no.
","Pi by Ivette Fred-Rivera The beginning sets partially the premises of the narration: a pond, animals, birds, humans, interacting serenely in a natural setting. A mural displayed at the background, a very common element in the Indian landscape, reiterates this atmosphere. Indian landscape is one of the first things that capture our eyes, strikingly exuberant, shrubbery, trees, flowers, animals, green everywhere. On the left of the screen, we can see an image of god Ganesha, son of Hindu gods Shiva and Parvati, whose head is that of an elephant, showing the divine nature that animals can have in the Hindu pantheon. ""I was prepared for the first day of classes. I'm Pi"", he explains about his school life in Pondicherry. Boys and girls are separated at classrooms. Pi is an irrational number. Never settles into a permanent repeating pattern, as the teenager Pi. Indian newspapers publish student's high scores on national academic tests as a way of expressing national pride. Religion was the only contact between Pi's mother and her culture. ""I knew Krishna first"", explains Pi. Krishna contains the entire universe in his mouth. 'Animals have souls. I have seen them in their eyes', Pi says to his father. ""Animals do not think. The tiger is not your friend. You are projecting your eyes on him "", the rationalist father responds emphatically. We have to be careful. Tigers are called 'big cats' but are not pets. Richard Parker is a digitally created Bengal tiger, though looks amazingly real. Who does not want this tiger in the garden? The protagonist is the tiger. His first appearance is phenomenal. Indians are very resilient people. Pi wants to know what happens, whatever it is. ""Thank you for giving me my life"", he says during the storm. Watching in another previous scene the beautiful innocence in the eyes of Pi and Anandi â€“which I have seen so many times all over Indiaâ€“ reminded me that the Delhi gang rape victim watched this movie just before being raped. She fought desperately for her life, but, very sadly, could not survive as Pi did. 'We have to let things go, but the worst is not being able to say goodbye. Appa was right. The tiger was not my friend. He did not look back to say goodbye."" But, Pi, remember, Richard Parker was in captivity from the very start. It was his time to be free. The Japanese bureaucrats, who came to the hospital after Pi's rescue to ask him about the ship wreckage, did not like Pi's story, found it unbelievable, how the tiger did not eat him? It did not explain also why the ship sank, the technical reason involved. Pi invents a flat story and then asks them: 'Which story do you believe: the fictional or the true one?' Pi asks, in turn, the writer: 'The one with no animals, no island, no carnivore islands? In both stories, my family dies, I suffer. Which one do you prefer? So it is the same with God', Pi affirms. 'It's an amazing story. The story has a happy ending', answers the writer. 'It depends on you, The story is up to you now', says Pi. I do not like the end. It should have ended when the tiger disappears on the island. This is a fatal error, it weakens the narrative. Although the idea of choosing between the stories illustrates the belief issue, it could have been presented more creatively. Pi equates believing in the story with the tiger with believing in god. The alternate story is so boring that no one will like it. So we become believers trivially. Work on India is very hard. We, non-Indians, run the risk of being superficial, either dismissing or idealizing it. The cultural imaginary conceives India as the land of spirituality and magic realism. India is the last place to find god since it is the last place on earth that he will abandon. The majority of Indians are very good people. No other way is possible for us to see them. A very good Bengali friend in Kolkata once told me: ""We are not that good, you see us better than we are"". ""Through our gaze you may see your better self"", I insinuated. I am surprised this movie has 11 Oscar nominations. This is excessive. Animal lovers should see it! Excellent visual effects, the tiger, the storms, and the music. In this respect, Philip French has expressed it beautifully: ""The movie does for water and the sea what did Lawrence of Arabia for sand and desert."""

Credit must go to the director Mr. Ang Lee. There is good message beneath the entertainment that never ever lose hope. They touch the religion based God issue in very light but sensible way. VFX is seamless. It is hard to differentiate between the real scene and VFX. Now with the help of VFX it is possible to show the impossible.

","I guess everybody has seen the trailer to this movie. For the most part, the movie has not much to add to the trailer. The main point in which this movie takes pride is its CGI, especially animated animals, and particularly the tiger. The CGI team obviously worked a lot, but the animated animals are still so distinctly artificial that it totally breaks the suspension of disbelief. You always remember that nothing in this movie is real. Plus, the secondary story told in the end makes it even harder to believe. That said, I have to admit that the story is completely linear and dull. In the beginning, the Indian guy sort of challenges us that we would start believing in God after we hear the story, but alas, these are empty words. This movie relies heavily on the visual side generated by a team of CGI specialists, and it looks, well, OK. But not at all interesting. The only thing that appealed to me about this movie was the name of the tiger."

There is nothing more frustrating for me, than watching almost a whole film with joy which near the end changes completely. There, you understand that the script is based to a sick and awful allegory. And of course, I wouldn't be concerned about the nature of this allegory if the movie wasn't introduced to the public as a movie for adults and kids.

Now, let's get this straight. Life of Pi has just shown that there<br/><br/>is life left in 3D. It may be, on the whole, a gimmick but the exception can still prove the point. Only two movies have made the 3D entrance fee worth the extra IMHO, Avatar and this. <br/><br/>It's a tough movie for bibliophiles to even want to see because the<br/><br/>book is so magnificent (in my all time top ten probably) and many I've spoken to who love it equally are just downright scared that Ang Lee was going to blow it. The odds were strongly in favour of<br/><br/>that happening because it's a pretty full on philosophical workout. <br/><br/>So full credit has to go to Fox pictures for shelling out $120 million on the ultimate movie gamble. <br/><br/>How Ang manages to retain the existential angst of the book AND make a blockbuster movie that holds the attention from start to finish (yes, including the pretty turgid first 100 pages) is not only anyone's guess but a cinematic achievement of considerable merit. <br/><br/>It's the storytelling that wins the day but it's wrapped up in cinematography of the very highest order. So many times one gasps out loud at what's on screen that it's like a day out in a theme park. Surely the Oscar for this is certain to go to Claudio Miranda (Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, Benjamin Button). <br/><br/>The acting is universally good but it's the tiger, Richard Parker, and his four legged companions that really steal the show. CGI has never, ever been this good. This might sound like it's the technology that carries the movie but don't think that. It's an honest, stunning exploration of the true meaning of life, religion and truth and it's an absolute must see. <br/><br/>I would not discount it winning best movie come early March and I certainly wouldn't grudge it. <br/><br/>Ang Lee's finest hour."

","First of all, I have to admit that this is a great movie to be seen for it's exquisite picture, realistic animation, great composition.

Basically it's about a child who's searching for God so eagerly, that as an adult he identifies himself as a Hindu Muslim Christian who is occasionally teaching Kaballah...I did not read the book, but in the movie this religious mix is accentuated but so superficially treated that it was annoying for me not understanding that child's religious philosophy, despite the director's hint contained in the father's warning that having several religions means actually having none... The story of Jesus was also misfitted... Pi Patel, during the quest of his life, finds himself as human, as son of God, as a tiger, for us to later realize that all the story he describes was actually a mastermind allegory of the real situation, with the explanation that we like to believe the beautiful stories, not necessarily the real ones...Pitiful, pathetic and sad religious thinking"

","Life of Pi is ultimately a flawed film because the writing fails to involve the viewer enough in the story.<br/><br/>It is a very enjoyable film but fails to be great. The reasons are related to the story and, since I prefer not to discuss specifics, I'll just say that the decisions made in presenting this story are awkward and lack the brilliance and daring required to make the viewer believe in and truly root for the central character (let alone believe in God). The over-reliance on visual style and beautiful photography means that, however hard everyone tries, the film grabs your attention but can't win your heart. <br/><br/>The technical skill on display is brilliant, don't get me wrong, this is a good moment at the movies, just that, in the end, it rests on the surface of things much like the raft Pi himself floats on.<br/><br/>There was possibly a beautiful love story or a brilliant fable somewhere to be polished enough until it shone through (Shyamalan would have brought it out for sure, shame he dropped out...) the skill would have been in finding the madness and the bravery in faith and giving the whole thing a profound meaning.<br/><br/>The tiger is very cool... but it's still not quite enough. You can almost hear the Hollywood execs' pencils scribbling equations like: 'Titanic' meets 'I Bought a Zoo' meets 'Slumdog Millionaire' oh yeah and throw in some 'The Usual Suspects' for a adapted screenplay Oscar bid, oh yeah, and it's from a critically acclaimed bestseller, yippee! Add it all together and throw in some 3D and fluorescent glowing nature scenes to remind everyone of Avatar! 20th Century Fox have created a prestigious blockbuster fry-up screw story or character, or actually making a good film, that's why I hate those business school grads and their Venn diagrams and powerpoints!(sorry for the rant)If only those jerks died out and got replaced by real people we'd have even more good films to watch, oh yeah, and we'd need less advertizing, lobbying, brainwashing, propaganda...

","Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.<br/><br/>There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.<br/><br/>But regardless, this movie redefines the word ""beautiful."" I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.<br/><br/>i watched it in Dolby Atmos which was amazing!<br/><br/>Overall a good movie with beautiful visuals :)screen play could have been much more faster. many felt a bit bored inbetween."

","This film is about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck while cruising the Pacific Ocean. The twist is that there is a tiger on his lifeboat.<br/><br/>The film tells a tale of survival, of how Pi has to battle the treacherous ocean and at the same time fear for the ferocious tiger. His constant battles to survive is engagingly presented, as each challenge is so real. It's amazing how desperate situations can bring another side out of us. As the plot continues, something feels not so right, until the twist comes that everything makes sense again. This twist serves not only to surprise and entertain, but adds a whole new dimension to ponder upon. The struggles presented initially all pales in comparison. It's intensely moving. After watching the film, I felt tingles around my body because the emotional cascade lingers on."

","The setup and foundation for this story were interesting and unique but there are some fundamental flaws which give the story a fragmented feel. The writer tried way too hard to establish motivation for the main character. When a character's motivation is too obvious, the story loses meaning. I am not sure if the writer intended to push a religious agenda onto the reader or he/she didn't know how to keep the story moving without a spoken ""meaning"" behind everything Pi experienced. Sometimes it's enough to just tell a great story. The visuals were impressive enough to keep my attention throughout the film but overall, I would rate it as a mediocre experience which is quite a shame since there was so much potential."

","Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' begins with a delightful opening scene in a zoo with various animals and a melodious song playing the background. The rest of the film is also replete with fascinating scenes, but somewhere the connect is missing.<br/><br/>Narrated in flashback mode, it's the story of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma when young and Irrfan when grown up), a man who is a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian and who also teaches other religions. He is the lone survivor of a sea disaster in which he also loses his family. Now on a small boat in a vast ocean, he has to survive. And to give him company is none other than a deadly Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>'Life of Pi' is a visual treat. There are no two ways about it. There are many scenes which will mesmerize you like the scene in which blue lights are lit in the ocean and when the ship is hit by a storm. Alas, beautiful scenes alone don't make a wonderful film.<br/><br/>It has the right intentions but lacks the soul to be a great film. There are many things the film wants to say (like not losing hope), but they aren't narrated meritoriously. You feel underwhelmed as you don't really relate with the main character. And it also drags in portions.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma delivers an inspiring performance. He handles his character with great poise. Irrfan is perfect. Watch out for the scene in which he breaks down. Tabu is good in her small role. But perhaps the biggest star of the film is the tiger. The relationship which he shares with Suraj Sharma is endearing. The cinematography is spotless and the editing of the film is swift with some wonderful transitions.<br/><br/>'Life of Pi' isn't full of life. Watch it for the visual experience, if you must."

"dkwhitehorn","10","1","2","17 November 2018"," I am really surprised that the movie polarises
","Relatively many seem to take offense at the religious themes. They feel that the religious undertones are thick and overwhelming. I thought that the openness of Pi to all religions and Atheism sorted all that out; and that early on in the movie and very thuroughly, as well. This opens the viewer's mind to the plot theme of ""matter of perspective/circumstance"" and Pi representing the spectrum of human nature. It covers all from purely survival driven instinct to questions of higher purpose. I myself am an Atheist and I get swiftly annoyed with religious narratives. Annoyance at that (or anything, for that matter) didn't even occur to me here.<br/><br/>The most ridiculous negative criticism I read was that the main character didn't evolve or learn anything at all throughout the movie. Here, I can only conclude, that that person did not grasp the animals' symbolism at all. Maybe they had already mentally tuned out by the end of the movie, where it is all revealed really quite simply and blatantly.<br/><br/>I was late to the party with this movie.

The visuals and effects are indeed impeccable, but that's as much as I enjoyed about the film. The fact that Pi was telling the story and the actual story were flashbacks, removed every inch of suspense, as I knew nothing was going to happen to him. Why they chose to do it that way is beyond me. It also suffered from way too many plot flaws and was anything but credible. You honestly want me to believe the tiger was under the canvas of the raft for more than a day without making an appearance or even a sound?? And what was the purpose of the weird meerkat island? Nothing their made any sense and did not contribute to the story whatsoever, apart from adding to the already long running time. When Pi finally got to shore, the tiger just ran off!! I was expecting so much more, as Pi tried gaining the tiger's trust all along, and it seemed to work, until they reached the shore. Idiotic tiger!

","I'm not gonna lie, Life of Pi is absolute eye candy. The visuals are striking and impressive, especially considering more than half of the movie takes place in the middle of the ocean. However, maybe Life of Pi was best left as a novel; the translation from paper to the big screen just doesn't stack up. The undeniable brilliance of Martel's novel is muted by rushed filmmakers trying to squeeze 227 days out at sea into a 2-hour time limit. In addition, some of the transitions between scenes were corny in all the wrong ways. Long story short, the people making this film really love to fade characters on and off the screen. So, despite seamless computer graphics and gorgeous cinematography, it's not a satisfying product overall.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, and I was excited to see just how the contents of the book could be projected into a film. But after reading the novel, it falls flat. If you want to enjoy this movie, don't read the novel, or better yet, skip it all together and get ahold of the book instead. The bottom line is: it's not awful, but it fails to do Yann Martel's work justice."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>Life of Pi is a visually stunning film that has some touching and powerful moments. The story is told in a flashback and has some very original content. 
Most of the visuals are very good but there are some that blatantly look like CGI. All in all, I found the ending to be very powerful and that made the film very good.<br/><br/>The acting is good. There are only two notable actors throughout the film and that is Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan. They both do a great job. I do not intend to sound racist, but the accents used throughout the film get horribly annoying after the first half hour.<br/><br/>The pacing is very slow. The film drags one in the first act but picks up towards the conclusion. The runtime is also very overlong.<br/><br/>Pros: Good story, powerful ending. Good acting, some good visuals, the tiger CGI, and the orangutan named Orange Juice was awesome<br/><br/>Cons: Very slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some ugly CGI, and the accents are very annoying<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7.4"

"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","2","1 September 2015"," Gets off to a strong start, but the wheels seem to fall off slightly in the second half
","I'd put off watching Life Of Pi for quite some time as I was concerned that the premise of a man being stranded on a boat with a tiger may be a rather flimsy plot to base a two hour film on. However, as this had Ang Lee's name against it and had won a whole host of Oscars I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. Sadly, my instincts were correct (at least partly so)...<br/><br/>Life Of Pi starts well and tells a nice story of a young boy living in India. From his early days where he gets teased by his schoolmates for his unfortunate first name, to his struggles with religion to his eventual departure to Canada with his family. It's a nice introduction to Pi and his character and seemed to be building up to something very special indeed (albeit it is a tad preachy and heavy-handed at times). However, Life Of Pi seems to lose its way in the second half (after their boat sinks).<br/><br/>What follows next is around an hour of Pi first of all doing everything in his power to stay clear of Richard Parker (his tiger) to then reverting to his survival book to try to get the upper hand to then attempting to bond with the tiger. The problem for me is that a lot of it just didn't come across as convincing and the ease with which Pi achieves all of these objectives seemed to come far too easily. There are also times when it comes repetitive and annoying (the first scene on the boat with the hyena, zebra and orang-utan went on for an eternity and ended up boring me to tears). The bonding that starts to exist between man and tiger essentially acts as a framework for the second half of the film and as mentioned I just didn't find any of it convincing and for this reason I didn't find this aspect of the story all that compelling. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that I had some issues with the story, Life Of Pi is at least a beautiful film to look at; the visual effects were absolutely phenomenal (the CGI animals look so real and convincing that it's possible to actually feel scared for Pi on the boat). The special effects are also equally impressive. The problem with Life Of Pi is that I felt at times that Lee & Co were letting the special effects get in the way of the story (the scene where all the fish are flying past Richard Parker and Pi was impressive to look at, but also served no purpose) and is something that can only be described as 'pointless showboating'. <br/><br/>Life Of Pi is a well-meaning film and despite some of its problems it is quite a nice story. It's heart is always in the right place and some of the scenes between Richard Parker and Pi were amusing and heart-felt. However, too much of the second half was repetitive and the bond that developed between Richard Parker and Pi wasn't entirely convincing (which was one of the reasons that I didn't care much for the turn of events at the end). It's not a bad film, but it is slightly disappointing especially from a director of Ang Lee's calibre."

","Maybe I was expecting too much but got bored in parts and after the hype was found wanting for some profound life changing or at least thought provoking moments. Sure, the acting was good and generally it gelled together well but maybe I don't need enlightening. At least it was different I suppose but after hearing positive reviews I was left disappointed. Obviously it's a fantasy film but it didn't stretch my imagination or leave me wowed. Was I missing something? or maybe I was looking too hard for some kind of message. I preferred the first part of the film with the family situation and pi's childhood learning. Some of the film was a spectacle visually but nothing extraordinary."
"drystyx","6","1","2","1 July 2015"," ""Perception"" in modern day Liberty Valence story
","This can be viewed as a modern day Liberty Valance film, and I don't think that is specific enough to be a spoiler.<br/><br/>It's also a story of ""perception"".<br/><br/>It's a slow paced film, which usually only works when the characters are credible.<br/><br/>The characters aren't ""credible"" here, but that might work because all but two of the characters are told from the point of view of a sole ship wreck survivor.<br/><br/>The trouble is that the second of the two characters not told from his point of view, a writer, is not credible. We learn this at the end when he immediately has a revelation of truth that could only come from piecing a puzzle together.<br/><br/>The writer character is poorly written for this reason. His immediate understanding of a puzzle is like a man reading a cryptogram and not even looking at all the letters, but solving it immediately, the first letter, then second, and so forth, in a normal cryptogram puzzle.<br/><br/>Despite this, the story itself has its merits. Another problem is that we sit too long through the two characters droning on in a very dull way. Not that they're dull, but just that they aren't interesting. And it takes too long to get to the ""story"" part.<br/><br/>I understand that a background is set up for the ""point of view"" of the sole survivor of a ship wreck, but this background part fails, or at least gets a ""D"" grade, for being overly long, when it could be just as well described in seconds by a good writer. Also, the character of the story teller doesn't seem credible for his background.<br/><br/>The story teller explains himself in an Agnostic way, and a way that questions everything he sees. And we get this effect in the first story he tells. In the second story, however, he questions nothing, and his description of at least one character looks suspiciously made up.<br/><br/>The dynamic part of the story could also have been better. There are some good cinematic touches, but this is very slow paced.<br/><br/>What does bring this film up a level is the psychology of ""survivor"" stories. If one ever reads accounts by survivors of battles, wars, disasters, one sees pretty much a common element. The survivor almost never describes himself as nice, and in fact, almost all survivors try to describe themselves as harsh, tough, and a survivor because of natural selection.<br/><br/>We do see that in the survival story here, in a good allegorical way. We also see that the survival story is told in such a way that we feel the survivor does perceive the events in ""flash photo"" form, which affects his perception of reality. Those aspects are well done.<br/><br/>It's too bad that is about all that was done well. It's a good idea, but just not well written."

","The summary is the phrase that made me wanna see this picture. It's been written in the movie's cover, and considering I read good reviews about it everywhere, I decided renting it. Many people put this movie in the same level as modern classics like ""Titanic"", and I think I disagree with them. The first half of the movie is completely involving, thanks to a good directing, scenario and performances. I really entered the Indian ambient and recognized beauty in everything of their culture-- and I constantly pictured young Pi as Rajesh from ""The Big Bang Theory"". The family concerns are universal and convincing, which is a good step in the story: something everyone can be related to. However, the boat scenes in which Pi has to live with the tiger didn't impress me that much. Firstly, due to the fact that the tiger felt very fake, and anyone could easily notice it was pure CGI. In fact, every animal in the ark felt computerized. Secondly, because they took too long. The ending, on the other hand, has a beautiful message about what really happened, and it doesn't let you know which of Pi's stories was the real one. Either way, the doubt is intelligent and provoking, so you'll not have a clichÃ©d outcome. In my opinion, it doesn't beat up movies like ""Titanic"" and ""The Green Mile"", but it's a good entertainment with some new ideas."

","As a personal rule, I don't watch movies based on books first before reading the book itself. That always works for me. And that's what I did with Life of Pi. But let me tell you, reading the book and watching the movie are both different experiences. Although majority of the things written in the book are captured in the movie, I tend not to compare and contrast. Have I done such, I would have keep on looking for some scenes that should be there and would have kept asking why some scenes were not shown. Then I won't enjoy the movie at all.<br/><br/>Life of Pi tells us about a 16-year old boy, Piscine Molitor Patel or (as he insisted in the movie) Pi. His family owns a zoo which gives a great influence to his interest in animals. But one animal interests him more than other animals combined, a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker (tiger's got a name, huh?)<br/><br/>Tough time hits India and Pi's father decides they move to Canada. The ship crosses a storm that causes the ship to sink and Pi's family to die. Pi finds himself alone but it takes a while before reality starts kicking in. <br/><br/>Nothing much is altered from the book but watching the movies is like watching another adventure unfold before you. If you're good at shutting your brain from memories while they flash before you, good on you! But you don't really have to with this film. In fact, it helps putting colors to your imagination and putting a face to Pi's name. The latter, I warmly welcomed knowing that is the Pi I am waiting for.<br/><br/>Talking about the specifics, there is no question about the cinematography. It's a straight 10/10. When I finally got to the part where Pi discovers an island with meerkats and edible plants, I am at a loss for words. It's perfectly captured. The photography is another thing. I have to say it really did great in setting certain moods in most scenes. Making the film in 3-D is another cinematic feat for the movie. The choice is both daring and a worthy venture. The visual effects are impeccable and almost made me wish I was there with Pi notwithstanding the dangers from the huge Richard Parker and the ocean.<br/><br/>The development of characters, especially that of Pi and Richard Parker, is another asset of the film. Pi is a young man faced with an adult's trials. I like that the chosen actor (Shuraj Sharma) has done justice to the character of Pi. When he is deprived of his right to mourn and has to struggle to survive, I mourned for him. When he finally gets the chance, his mourning was heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>The most dominant symbolism is Richard Parker. We all have Richard Parkers in life. It may not be a Bengal Tiger but it could be something bigger, more dangerous, and heavier. <br/><br/>Life of Pi is about survival, life, and faith, in no particular order. These themes are universal languages that appeal to human emotions. With that, you get a movie which will give you a spectacular movie-watching experience. One that you cannot forget."

","''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.<br/><br/>You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.<br/><br/>The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.<br/><br/>The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.<br/><br/>In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.<br/><br/>""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat."

","Having read and enjoyed the book, I approached this movie very cautiously, wondering how ti could possibly live up to the novel on which it's based. In truth, it didn't. Rarely does a movie based on a novel manage to do that. However, while it doesn't meet the standard of the novel, I have to give credit to Ang Lee and others who were involved in the production. ""Life of Pi"" (the novel) would have been a very difficult novel to adapt for the screen for a whole variety of reasons - but I think Lee and others did a commendable job of bringing the basic story to life.<br/><br/>The film starts out relatively slowly, with an exploration of Pi's upbringing. Named ""Piscine Molitor Patel"" after a swimming pool in France, Piscine adopts the shortened form of ""Pi."" He's raised in India, spends much of his time observing the animals at the zoo owned by his family and embarks on a spiritual quest, raised as a Hindu, but also adopting Islam and Christianity, because he simply wants to love God. Then, his father decides to move to Canada, and while on the way the ship they're travelling on sinks and Pi finds himself the only human survivor, adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger named Richard Parker for companionship.<br/><br/>The shipwreck and the voyage in the lifeboat is wonderfully portrayed, if a little bit (to say the least) unrealistic. Of course, when I say that I'm falling into the trap of the Japanese ship owners, who also can't accept that Pi's story can be real. This, of course, is the spiritual crux of the story: what, exactly, is reality? Are some stories too good to be true? Are some stories so good that they can only have come from God? It's an interesting spiritual exploration - not at all heavy handed, but often front and centre.<br/><br/>The ocean voyage is basically a one man show, carried effectively by Suraj Sharma as Pi. The other characters, of course, are the animals in the lifeboat: Richard Parker the tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. The animals are animated, but incredibly realistic. The older Pi, who tells the story, is played by Irffan Khan, whose soft-spoken portrayal captures the essence of the character.<br/><br/>It's a commendable adaptation of the novel. The opening scenes in India left me a bit dry to be honest, but the very powerful portrayal of the ocean voyage drew me back in completely. Overall, a pretty decent adaptation of the novel. (7/10)"
"kirkwuk","6","1","2","25 June 2013"," Could have been a classic
","After watching some harrowing horror art-house recently, I had the sudden urge to watch a modern day ""feel-good"" movie with my partner. Life Of Pi seemed to fit the bill with the promise of some of the best animal CGI ever seen, and as far as that goes it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The storytelling of the main character at the beginning is masterful and draws you into the world of Pi and his screen partner. Once the main story begins the film really is two hours of a courageous boy lost at sea with a Bengal tiger. As crafty and original of a concept that is, at times it did seem grating and I found myself pleading for a change of scene, for them to find land and move the adventure to new pastures. Life Of Pi however is not that kind of movie. Towards the end the story seems to swan dive into something symbolic containing an island consisting entirely of Meer cats and strange flowers which contain teeth. This seemed out of place to me and a little confusing, and the film lost its grasp on me at this point. When Pi and the tiger eventually arrive to safety on a beach, the tiger simply walks into the jungle, never looking back. I was hoping to see a nice friendship evolve, a precious love between species - but alas I was disappointed. I wasn't expecting a Disney film per-se, but it could have completed Life Of Pi for me as one of the modern classics, but instead it just tried to be a modern movie overhauled by a flawed concept.<br/><br/>There are scenes here which will upset younger viewers. It's suggested the main character has his entire family drown at sea; parents and the animals they kept. Animals are also killed by the tiger, although this is usually done off-screen, but you can see the aftermath. Definitely not the feel good movie of the year! Life Of Pi isn't a bad movie, sure it's a flawed one depending on what you expect from it. The CGI is breath-taking, the visuals are incredible, perfect to show off your new Blu-Ray and LED screen with. The story didn't quite grab me like it did others, and I found most of it quite drawn out, and too symbolic for my liking. For that I can only feel disappointed."

","My only complaint about this film would be that it is both beautiful and ordinary. At times the beautiful images are so well-composed and vibrant that it makes the other scenes seem lifeless. I would rather have seen it all look more natural. I also did not see it in 3D, but I imagine that amplifies this effect.<br/><br/>However, this is a must-see. Lee captures your emotions by developing the boy's character well, and building empathy for the tiger without personifying him. Also, we get a nice taste of Pondicherry India before the main story begins. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Now I have to read the book. Great."
"chaugnurfaugn-269-83012","4","2","7","30 April 2013"," Like being mugged by a concert pianist. Visually stunning but culturally questionable.
","I thought I would review this title for the release of Life of Pi on DVD and blu-ray in the UK.<br/><br/>As with all book to movie adaptations the inevitable comparisons will be made. As I've mentioned in other reviews, I feel this is pointless. The two mediums are so different and loaded with their own workable protocols that, in my view, both should be viewed as separate entities based on the same root mythology - the difference, to pluck an analogy from the air, between the bible and Charlton Heston's Ten Commandments. For this reason, I find no flaw between the film and book versions of Life of Pi. This is a review specifically of the film.<br/><br/>Visually, LoP is as near to perfection as a moving picture is likely to come, a treat for the eyes and senses in almost every scene. The only comparably stunning visual treat currently able to match LoP is Rise of the Guardians, an animation but also inspired by the epic visualisations of novel writers and an equal in terms of imagination, spark and wit.<br/><br/>Character development is ponderous but fun. The retrospective narration has flavours of Forrest Gump while the juxtaposition of modern style and epic Indian colour with old world vibrancy add greatly to the establishing scenes. Irrfan Khan is a tour de force as the self possessed guru of Pi's elder-self and brings both pathos and realism to an otherwise textbook cast of caricatures (Rafe Spall's skeptical hipster is an off-the-shelf model, fast becoming a tiresome clichÃ©, while the skinny wild-haired Indian boy made popular in Slumdog still seems appealing enough to sell seats to bums but may also be reaching its use-by-date).<br/><br/>On a core level, none of this matters particularly in terms of the story. The same tale could be told on a shoe-string budget, though the CGI sugar coating does wonders in tipping off-guard the casual viewer.<br/><br/>Because at its root, Pi is a cynical and oft bitter story about withdrawal. The central character is a fantasist and his tendency to embrace the irrational over logic is, nestled secretly in the bosom of the film where it rarely shows its face without a veil of mystery (cowardly really), the heart of the film's message to its audience.<br/><br/>Pi is an atheist grandstand for a contemporary audience weened on the outspoken repetitions of modern anti-theists, an opening movement fuelled by the despicable acts of fundamentalism and misguided far right theism. It panders to the popular, but, at the expense of the integrity and purpose of its characters, the picture it paints is surprisingly bleak, smeared as it is in the colour, light and spectacle of religious iconography.<br/><br/>The grand majority of the film sets the scene not for some startling revelation about the existence of God, as determined by its main protagonist's early suggestions, but in order to paint a sorry picture of a disillusioned child scrabbling through his imagination in an effort to impress the cold, robotic facade of the modern day mind.<br/><br/>Pi's choice of religion (and he chooses many) is irrelevant come the story's conclusion. Faith has nothing to do with god, spirituality, personal inner-revelations or esoteric connection with eldritch systems of belief and everything to do with choosing that which fires the imagination more than the cruel and the mundane. In short, faith is a cop-out, a crutch upon which the weak and pathetic are wont to lean.<br/><br/>Bolstering the core theme is the scientific undertone of pi itself, an inescapable aspect of our hero's personality and name. The rational, as Pi's obnoxious father is keen to point out across the dinner table, is worthwhile - all else is mere distraction."
"MartinHafer","8","2","7","11 April 2013"," What's one more review?!
","By the time I got to see this film, the Oscars were long past and there already were a ton of reviews for ""Life of Pi"". On top of that, I have noticed that for big pictures which most everyone likes, I rarely have much to say. After all, I agree with the majority--""Life of Pi"" is a very good film. So, my review will be brief.<br/><br/>THE reason to watch this film is pretty simple: You cannot say that the movie reminds you of anything you've ever seen before or since. Sure, you could try comparing ""Life of Pi"" to ""Avatar""--but that is only because they both used gobs of CGI to create fantastic stories. But the story itself, is so original. In addition, the acting, direction and artistry of the movie is tops. While I would agree with the Oscar folks that ""Argo"" was a better film, it wasn't by much. Well worth your time."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","2","7","17 March 2013"," Visually impressive and nice acting but has some plot problems
","I was very hopeful for this movie, and while I was expecting a lot more out of it I won't say that it was a bad movie. It was good. The visuals were breathtaking and obviously a lot of work went into making the animals realistic. However to go along with the visuals there is some solid acting and an interesting premise. However, the movie's final act is where the film stops floating and begins to sink and this final act makes me mad because the movie could've been a lot better.<br/><br/>So the movie starts off with a book author visit our main character (Pi) who is an adult man who wants to tell an interesting story to the author which will make the author believe in God. Then Pi goes on to say that when he grew up he believed in three different religions... this is one of the incredibly stupid moments in the movie. While the idea sounds interesting, it doesn't work because two of the religions (he becomes a Christian and a Muslim) say that worshiping other gods is wrong and he is also a Hindu (who believe in many gods). Now if he said he liked the attributes of each and made up his own belief then that would make sense, but for him to say he is devoted to each is a lie. His father actually says one of the smartest things in the movie: ""I would rather my son believe in something that is false than to believe in everything, because believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing"" and this is true. However for some reason the father is looked down upon even though he said the most intelligent thing in the film.<br/><br/>Continuing: Pi also tries to befriend a tiger (his father owns a zoo) named Richard Parker. However, his father wants to prove to Pi that animals are dangerous, so he puts a goat outside of the cage and... MAGICALLY THE TIGER PULLS THE GOAT INTO THE CAGE! I laughed out loud because it is never explained how the tiger managed to pull a goat into the cage.<br/><br/>So Pi is on a ship with a bunch of animals which are being sold. Pi goes on deck and notices that the ship is sinking. When he returns he finds a zebra in the hallway he just walked out of a couple of seconds ago. Did the people even think about the zebra got there? All of the doors were closed to the hallway but some how it magically appears in the hallway. Either way Pi gets stuck on a boat with a Zebra and finds an orangutan floating on a raft of bananas. Shockingly enough Pi is stupid enough to NOT GRAB THE RAFT OF BANANAS AND USE THEM FOR FOOD! Soon it is discovered that a hyena is on the boat and was hiding under the boat cover and it kills the other two animals but is then attacked by Richard Parker (who was under the same boat cover). <br/><br/>Most of the movie revolves around how Richard Parker and Pi creating a truce. They encounter storms, rain, beautiful ocean views, and a strange floating island. The floating island part of the movie really bothers me because it is a raft of vegetation with a legion of meerkats (if the ship sank it Japan and by the end of the movie he is saved in Mexico then that means this island was in the pacific but meerkats live in Africa). Apparently the floating island has pools of freshwater (WTF) and has fish that live in the freshwater but the freshwater turns to acid at night and the plants digest the fish (Again if it is floating in the ocean then the only fish it will get are saltwater fish and even if freshwater fish got in then they would all be dead in one night but apparently this happens on a regular basis. Pi also finds a tooth in a flower and realizes that the plants must've eaten someone but if it ate a person then THERE WOULDN'T BE TEETH GROWING OUT OF FLOWERS! That's like eating a chicken and having a beak growing out of your arm!<br/><br/>EITHER WAY, Pi is saved but no one believes his story so he tells another story that involves real people instead of animals and it is much more realistic. However, nobody like his realistic story so everyone goes back to believing the original (non-sense) story. So the question is: how does this make you believe in God? Was it the miracles? Was it the way he was saved multiple times? Nope, it makes you believe in God because he says religion is the same as his two stories, EVERYONE BELIEVES THE FIRST STORY BECAUSE IT IS MORE FUN! His argument for why you should believe in God is because it is more fun.<br/><br/>The movie's ultimate problem is that it is wrong in so many ways. Believing in everything IS believing in nothing but the movie says otherwise. The final reason for why you should believe in God contradicts the entire movie as well. Furthermore, I'm surprised that this movie spent SOOOO much time on animating animals realistically yet it missed some very obvious things. Bananas don't float (so orangutan would've been dead), the tiger can't get to Pi because his claws keep on digging into the boat cover so he gets stuck, maybe the book/movie forgot that tigers have retractable claws? Pi would've been dead. When the zebra, hyena, and orangutan die there are flies on their bodies yet they are in the middle of the ocean, there are no flies. How come in the movie there are no dead bodies of the animals literally from one scene to the next. It is just plain stupid how much this movie misses."
"pvsavla","8","2","7","26 December 2012"," Captivating Film
","The success of the book 'Life of Pi' by Yann Martel and the film's previews in newspaper dragged me to see this movie and I was glad to see the same, as it met all the expectations raised by the feedback of the book and the film.<br/><br/>The storm in the sea and the sinking of the ship, reminded one of the chill of 'Titanic' to some extent. The whole film was engrossing excepting, the stay in the boat in mid sea, which dragged a lot, although it was filled in with some wonderful cinematography of the night sky and sea. <br/><br/>The picturization of the zoo in the beginning, amidst Indian surroundings and its characters was enchanting. Watching this film on a 3D screen was an exhilarating experience. Scene of a floating island inhabited by meerkats and carnivorous algae was thrilling. <br/><br/>To some extent this film was autobiographical, as the writer Yann Martel had indeed stayed in India for about 13 months visiting mosques, churches, temples and zoos, and spent two years reading religious texts.<br/><br/>Overall a film worth watching."

This film not only captivates the audience with its majestic imagery, it holds a solid story which moves the viewers through the museum of Pi's most intimate experiences effortlessly. <br/><br/>This really is a tale of Man Vs.

","In the same way that ""Avatar"" was visually amazing but had a flimsy plot, this was visually stunning but left me bored. But I must give credit where credit is due. Ang Lee has some fantastic shots in the movie: Pi underwater while the ship sank; the bio-luminescent algae and the whale; those effing meerkats. I assumed that this movie was going to be primarily about Pi and the tiger, but there was a whole other religious part of the movie that wasn't advertised at all. And while it is based on a book, you've still gotta be accommodating to people who haven't read the book. Old Pi (who was awesomely in ""Slumdog Millionaire"") converts a writer to several religions by telling the writer his life story, which sure I guess could happen but it's hardly an interesting idea for half of the movie. So despite the non-lifeboat parts, it's a beautiful movie, and maybe you'll like it more than I did.<br/><br/>PS: The fact that Pi's eyes remain white was the most annoying aspect of the movie."
"magpiez_forever","2","5","29","9 January 2013"," Boring unrealistic animated film
","This film was a first for me, the first film in my entire life that actually had me snoozing through it from boredom. The storyline is quite slow to take off as it meanders through his humdrum life, they get on a boat in a storm and out he goes on the the apparently in jest trying to incite the storm gods but apparently they were in a bad mood and slapped the boat around even more than before. Pi goes to escape with just one or two other people, where is everyone on board??? and ultimately after a wave or two hes on his own,.. oh except for the bizarre suicidal leap of a zebra over the rails into the descending boat. So contrived and obviously animated that it was ridiculous. Now getting away from the the story for a few moments (what a relief) my other complaining is that nothing in IMDb or in the cinema describes this film as animated or being based on computer generated images, which it so obviously is and very poor ones at that. Science fiction and other fantasy environments yes you would expect it and they are often fantastic but they are crap in this movie and not openly advertised for the public make an informed choice. Getting back to the story,... the kid spends almost all his time afloat on a lifebuoy which over time is somehow upgraded into a raft like structure. Ultimately they do get together in the boat after a another terrible storm but weakness from near starvation has the tiger incapacitated an no threat at all. Throw in a mysterious floating ""carnivorous"" island that eats lifeforms (yes supposedly eats people) and you will be close to bored witless. They escape from the island and eventually wash ashore where unlike Robinson and Crusoe PI and the tiger go their separate ways never to see each other again. OMG boring boring boring, silly animation that just doesn't look natural and leaves you wondering what you are actually looking at, is it computer generated or is it some kind of robotic device. Huge disappointment extremely boring."
"maximkong","5","4","22","1 December 2012"," Surprised at Lee's attention to detail; Unfortunately, the tiger is still 'crouching', and the dragon/potential still 'hidden'
","I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive effort carried out by Ang Lee to keep the movie as faithful to the book as possible. The setting (a mixed infrastructure landscape in India , culture, and the animal environment) I believe were correctly chosen and helped to blend in the scenes to be as natural as possible. The animation, is possibly one of the most accurate and realistic depiction of animal behaviour that I have seen in a movie, despite being CGI. Truly an Oscar-deserving achievement and a new high benchmark has been set for future CG animations out there. Kudos to this effort as the non-human characters are part of the essential recipe to bring out the best from this movie. The Indian actors did very well in their roles, many of them are actually well-known actors but I am not excluding the main actor (a newbie I believe) who was adequately into his character throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>However, I have to be serious when I said that the movie was only adequate. Reasons being: - <br/><br/>1. The potential, I am afraid, was not utilised to the maximum. Many of the subjects and issues being brought up are massively complicated...While the movie did a good job in the first half of the movie, towards the second half the effect has tapered substantially due to too many unnecessary CG effects. I am not referring to the effects that contribute to the novel's intention. For instance, a prolonged scene of the lifeboat being unrealistically tossed around the ocean and nearly ramming into the sinking ship, like a mini toyboat, is best taken out of the movie as it left behind a lot of doubtful impression in my opinion.<br/><br/>2. Rebalancing is needed. This is the most critical flaw in my opinion when comparing Life of Pi versus some of the best movies within the same genre. Some of the CG effects (excluding the animals) were not only unnecessary but took far too long, and sadly did not help to build up progress in the hidden message this movie is trying to deliver fundamentally. The movie was disappointing in this way because some of the things that has happened, they did not need to be elaborated extensively in order for the audience to comprehend. A slow pace is okay, but the main culprit lies in the extra screen-time just for the sake of special effects, other important details that could have been highlighted were sadly sacrificed. Really a rebalancing of CG effects vs critical points in the flow of plot is needed. <br/><br/>3. In fact, narration should be given a stronger role. Life of Pi was initiated with the narration from the older Pi, I don't see why it would not be feasible to input some narration to hear the young Pi's thought during his ordeal (and yes I know what happened during the ending). I did not read the novel, but I had the chance to glance through parts of it and recall that the novel focuses a lot on its inner thoughts rather than the surrounding effects. No matter how good CGI can do, it cannot capture small details that can be crucial to the plot and that is where this movie needs to rely on more than one medium to bring it to new heights. <br/><br/>4. Again, the main actor's performance as Pi was only adequate. Although it is unfair to scrutinize his attempts given that he had to portray Pi through probably more than half of the movie, when anyone is under such an ordeal (for the sake of survival) I would expect something more complicated or changes in his character behaviour. Especially given the ending which offered the audience a full picture of what was going on. This is probably a fault that should be attributed towards the imperfect direction of Ang Lee. For instance, he has illogically displayed too much energy during times when he was supposed to be conserving energy, seemed to be unaffected by hypothermia and other physical deterioration (especially when he was swept into the cold ocean several times in the mid of night) and he has illogically presented himself as too calm a person at times, given that he was a unique teenager character under severe physical and mental trauma.<br/><br/>5. Anyone can tell me if 'you are able to find god after hearing my story' has serve its purpose? It did not, for me.<br/><br/>All in, this movie is a worthy Oscar contender, especially for CG effects, but unfortunately, the tiger is still 'crouching', and the dragon/potential still 'hidden'"
"abertodano","7","2","8","24 December 2012"," Good movie that tries to make a point but doesn't
","The movie tells a wonderful story of survival, with great cinematography, good acting and some humor. This would be a great movie if it didn't try to make the point that in the end the author who hears the story from Pi will believe in God when the end makes no reference to this. The faith of Pi is a wonderful thing but the ""theology"" of the movie is shaky and should not be used to make a big point which is not made in the end anyway. Also there is a pointless hospital scene near the end where Pi comes up with another story which is more believable and therefore a little confusing since it was even hinted that it may be the true story. The story is a fantastic tale and should simply be left at that."

A teen abiding more than two hundred days on a life boat, being the only human survivor with a Bengal tiger who wants to eat him! I didn't read the book and came to know about it after the movie only. WOW! What an adventurous journey of a man left me speechless giving Goosebumps. It's another remarkable achievement in the account of the director, both creative and monetary. The film starts with narrative chit chat of Pi (known and bantered for long as Piscine Molitor Patel, named after a swimming pool in France by his broad chest- thin legs uncle) with the writer and goes into flashback and tells his experience. The young Pi develops inclination for multiple religions. He does not choose one over the other because the one who believes in one religion discards the other.(Maybe he wanted to be logical and rational and his parents helped him a lot in this) He made a witty sarcasm, he was a Muslim, a Christian, a Baptist too and of course a Hindu because they have approximately 330 million 'Gods' . He falls in love in the music class, his mother asked to join and eventually leaves without ""satisfactory goodbye to Anandi- the almost love of his life"" His father owns a zoo in Pondicherry and decided to relocate in Canada. They had all their animals, quite a large number of beasts. The ship sunk and somehow he managed to survive on a life boat with a zebra. Later he got to know that about the hidden Hyena and the Orangutan. The Hyena kills the zebra and the Orangutan. Finally with a 'solid entry in Bollywood style' the tiger appears and kills the Hyena who wants to kill Pi. (I think the tiger meant as a parable for how clashing cultures can learn to dwell without leaving their basic beliefs ) Then the journey of survival begins, to win over another species, to deal with unfavourable conditions, correct- incorrect decisions, the carnivorous jungle, ray of hope and not quitting.

To get hope of life from keeping Richard Parkar alive - so lame ðŸ˜’ - there were so many fish in the sea that would have given him 'hope of life' he's after. Headache."

I now look forward to any movie that he is directing, because you know you will get something very special over and above the script, acting and the visuals.<br/><br/>There are plenty of analogies and religious themes, but its not done in a preachy way.

","I watched Life of PI with 8 friends in Sydney Australia about two years ago. When we got out of the movie hall all of them seemed to be puzzled that the movie did not make sense. Being a fan of Hindu philosophy and the Matrix movies, I got the plot completely. Yes there were numerous animal references to the food chain and how eventually one day it won't exist but it clearly sends out a message that it is better to be more spiritual and less religious. I don't like the reference to 33 million gods as there are only two or three real gods if one was to dwell into the texts of Hinduism. The story of survival between the Tiger and Pi is touching and shows the instinct needed for survival when it really counts. I don't understand the need to contrast religions. I still give an 8 out of 10 for the concept is refreshing."

But it all looks a bit too perfect to me. This is the new generation of movies looking more like video games than classic movies. If even the environment seems to be computer generated than I wonder where it will end. Do we actually need human actors in the future? Too bad the investment in high graphics usually renders pretty weak plots. ""Life of Pi"" is here no exception.

The son of a zoo keeper, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior, a fervent love of stories, and practices not only his native Hinduism, but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes .The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them ""the truth."" After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional--but is it more true ?<br/><br/>Life of Pi is at once a realistic, rousing adventure and a meta-tale of survival that explores the redemptive power of storytelling and the trans-formative nature of fiction.

"williampsamuel","9","1","3","12 December 2014"," An enchanting and thought provoking visual delight.
","Ang Lee's Life of Pi is one of the most incredible, original, and dare I say magical films I've ever seen. It has the fantastical quality of an Arabian Nights tale, but with depth that would make Bergman or Ozu proud. It boasts some of the most impressive visuals since Avatar, but its true magic comes from the story and the central character. Though the bulk of the film takes place with no changes of scenery and no new characters introduced, it never becomes stale or repetitive. Hollywood has never made anything quite like it before, which is really saying something in this day and age.<br/><br/>As anyone who's seen the trailers can guess, it's the story of a man cast adrift in a lifeboat with a tiger as his only companion. But it is also so much more. It is impossible to fully describe the series of events that lead to Pi's unlikely voyage, but every bit of his life story is fascinating. Before he ever sets sail we've already explored matters of faith, family, and the nature of the human spirit. Of course nothing from his early life compares to his unlikely voyage. Forget what Dos Equis has told you, Piscine Molitor Patel is by far the most interesting man in the world.<br/><br/>There's something magical about watching Pi reach an accord of sorts with the deadly carnivore that he finds himself trapped with. At first the tiger is an object of utter terror, a ravenous beast who drives Pi from the boat to the relative safety of a cobbled together raft. But through a series of mishaps and close calls, their relationship slowly changes from one of fear and violence to one of familiar coexistence and mutual respect, almost a friendship, if such a thing were possible with a fully grown Bengal Tiger. It's rather like the Black Stallion, though with higher stakes and no margin for error.<br/><br/>Nor is the tiger the only danger. Against the constant threats of starvation, thirst, and boredom, Pi's body and spirit are tested to the limits of endurance, and in every case he overcomes. Through determination and ingenuity he provides for his physical needs. In caring for the tiger he finds purpose. And through his belief in a God above he finds the strength and the hope to endure. And how can he not believe. Even adrift with only a deadly predator for company signs of providence are everywhere. Rains come just when water has all but run out. Flying fish arrive like manna from heaven. Were this a true story, it would be enough to make all but the most hardened skeptic believe in God.<br/><br/>The film's positive and prominent depiction of faith is a major strength, but i. Pi is clearly a man of faith, and his belief in God sustains him through his ordeal more than anything else. But even he seems a bit fuzzy as to which god. He describes himself as a Catholic Hindu who is also a Muslim, and the movie seems to take this at face value. At one point his father teases him that if he converts to three more religions every day of the year will be a holiday for him. His father's agnosticism doesn't make him the best source of advice on spiritual matters, but he is right in saying that one who believes in everything may as well believe in nothing. At some point you do have to choose, especially between faiths that make mutually exclusive claims. That said, it is good to see a movie that doesn't treat faith as an anachronism or mere window dressing, even if it is a bit shallow in the treatment.<br/><br/>And I haven't even begun to speak of the visual effects and cinematography. They are simply incredible. Every shot is stunningly beautiful, whether of endless waves and sky or the lush foliage and colorful denizens of an Indian zoo. More beautiful still is Pi's vision of the ocean depths, which leaves reality behind for the realm of human imagination. And this is one film that must be seen in 3D. In full 3D it's almost like you're in the boat with Pi, and the flying fish scene alone is worth the extra money. If this doesn't win best cinematography at the Oscars I will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>Ang Lee has truly created a masterpiece here. One that is inspiring, mesmerizing, and greatly rewarding. He's taken a book that was supposed to unfilmable and made it into one of the year's best movies. This is a movie that everyone should see. During the bleakness of winter, it just might be the best way you can spend an afternoon."
"Tweekums","9","1","3","10 December 2014"," Alone with a tiger in the middle of the Pacific
","This story opens with a writer visiting our protagonist; an Indian named Pi. He wants to hear the story of how Pi survived alone on a lifeboat after a shipwreck; Pi corrects himÂ… he wasn't alone he had Richard Parker for company. As Pi introduces his story we learn how he got his name, his unusual 'multi-faith' belief system and most importantly we learn that Richard Parker is an adult Bengal Tiger! His father runs a zoo in their hometown but when it looks like they can't continue running it he decides to emigrate to Canada with his family and the animals. Shortly after entering the Pacific Pi goes on deck to watch a storm then Pi finds himself thrown into a lifeboat as the ship starts to sink. He isn't alone; part of the menagerie is with himÂ… an injured zebra, an orang-utan and a vicious hyena. The hyena soon kills the zebra and orang-utan then the previously unseen tiger erupts from under a canvass and kills the hyena; it then turn its attention to Pi. He gets out of its reach and constructs a raft so he can keep away from the creature. Over the course of the film he comes to realise that Richard Parker's presence is keeping him saneÂ… while never forgetting he is still on the menu!<br/><br/>This film was a delight. Even though we know Pi must survive to tell his tale there are plenty of tense moments and I was genuinely concerned for Pi's safety. For most of the film we are just watching Pi and the tiger; this works because both characters are so believableÂ… perhaps a little surprising when one knows the tiger didn't existÂ… it is however the best CGI I've seen; it is hard to believe it isn't real. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, does a great job convincing us that he is on a small boat in the middle of the ocean with a tiger. The whole film looks great; at times it takes on an almost dream like quality as the boat is becalmed on a mirror flat sea and when the sea lights up thanks to bioluminescent plankton. Some may find the ending a bit of a cop out as it appears that much of what we have seen didn't actually happen; an alternate scenario is presented and, as Pi says, the viewer must decide which story they prefer."

","'Life of Pi' is a critically acclaimed novel that sparked the interest of readers nationwide. Now you get to see the film version! Film is the greatest artwork in the history of mankind. It captures the way we see the world and incorporates an infinite amount of art forms that no other art can. ""Life of Pi' is the story of a young Indian boy named Pi. Pi lives with his family in the most beautiful part of India and has a perfect life until his father makes him and his family move to Canada. In India the family owned a zoo. This caused over 100 animals to be brought aboard the ship to Canada. When a viscous storm kills everyone on board the ship except Pi and a few animals including a Bengal Tiger, Pi embarks on the most difficult and amazing adventure of his life; survival. Pi experiences wildlife at sea like no one can imagine. He forms a bond between the tiger which he named Richard Parker that is more moving than any Disney motion picture. The spectacular beauty the visual effects team created are remarkable. Almost entirely are all the animals digitally mastered throughout the film! They look so real! Ang lee directs this film superbly by making every film aspect over viewed and guided perfectly. The cinematography, film editing, and music are absolutely gorgeous and provide visual art that cannot be matched. The screenplay by David Magee is true to the book very well. The key factor that makes 'Life of Pi' so special is that it can relate to every audience. Children can enjoy seeing beautiful animals and exciting storm scenes while adults can be entertained with them. The deep metaphors in the story are easily explained making it impossible to miss them. I love how this film was PG so that parents can explain the rich depth this film captures making it explainable to youngsters. Life of Pi has rich cinematic structure with beauty and grace to portray one of the greatest stories ever told in the greatest art form ever invented."

Nope. Pi didn't actually save a tiger or bond with it in any way.

"jackasstrange","9","1","3","1 December 2013"," One of the very best films of the XXI century
","Life of Pi is really one of the best films from this century, and is steps ahead of 'Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon', another great film, and also steps ahead of the 'Brokeback Mountain', the infamous but excellent drama about two cowboys lovers. <br/><br/>The existential conflicts are always an interesting subject to put in film, and maybe this is why Life of Pi has the best character development that i've seen in a long while. The dialogs and thoughts of Pi about the religions, disbelieves and faith are so interesting and honest that this alone made me fascinated with this film. You can understand 'Pi', because his thoughts are relatable to anyone, or almost anyone, i suppose. Asking for the 'why' of life and if God exists or not is something inevitable for the great majority of people in the world. But unfortunately, it starts to lose this honest essence when Pi, born as a follower of the Hinduism, changes his religion for the Christianism. This was like a punch in the face, because really... It becomes clearly, at least for me, that this film was doing a Christianism propaganda. It becomes blatantly obvious, i must say. I don't believe in these myths, but i can realize how offensive this film may be for people from other religions, specifically for the followers of Hinduism. <br/><br/>But i loved the allegory of Pi taking care of the Tiger and what it represented. He needed the tiger in order to survive. The Tiger represented 'the animal willing for his life', using his basic instincts to survive. As we can see in the end of the film, The Tiger was probably Pi himself, what explains absolutely everything. This is why<br/><br/>in the end there is no importance of which story was the true one, because in the end, both were true. They are just told in different ways..<br/><br/>The cinematography is fantastic. One of the best that i've seen, top 5 for sure. It's breath taking, incredible and amazing, and it also is a big 'shut up' for the people which defends that CGI is taking the magic of cinema away. Life of Pi is the proof of why CGI can be used to turn the films even more powerful and fantastic than the traditional films which uses the 'practical effects' . The animals in the boat are extremely real.<br/><br/>A must watch film, one of the very best of 2012. 9.5/10"
"lakesidentertainment","3","1","3","17 November 2013"," Beautiful but Silly
","I'm not a fan of movies that feel like they are trying to convert you to a religion, which makes me wonder why on earth this movie attempted to convert me to three religions at the same time. In the end, it makes sense, but it doesn't. The way the movie ends is just unnecessary and I would have appreciated the movie without the last 20 minutes on it. Let us address the CGI: Breathtaking. The animals are stunning. However, the lifeboat was pointless. There are shots where the lifeboat is CG'd in, whereas there are shots where it isn't. I believe this would have fit into my masterpiece collection if there hadn't been so much unnecessary CGI. My main complaint about the movie is the religious tone it has, I believe that movies should let viewers watch without feeling they're attending a mission meeting. Every time I started to enjoy the movie, something about religion would pop up and I'd ignore the movie until the storyline continued. Watch this movie, it's worth it."
"anamargaridasantos4","10","1","3","13 October 2013"," Life of Pi Special effects
","Life of pi is a great example of how special effects can be used to significantly enhance the viewing experience. The film tells the story of a young boy who manages to save himself from a sinking ship in the middle of the Pacific ocean. Being the sole survivor of the ship, fortunate enough to land on a lifeboat he witnessed the ship sink with his whole family inside. However he was not alone. A Bengal tiger which managed to swim across the floating wreckage pieces and reach his tiny boat possessed the exact same instinct of survival. When it comes to special effects, this film shows us how far we've come in computer animation, as the tiger was fully computer made as well almost all the scenery and weather conditions throughout the film. Would this film be as enjoyable without the special effects? First of all it would be way more challenging and even dangerous for the actors, director and crew to capture all the tiger footage with a real animal. And if they manage to accomplish that some of the most beautiful sceneries of the film would not be possible to shoot since they're simply not real."

I do remember my mind churning when Pi was talking about his views in life. I sometimes argued with him in my mind and sometimes agreed... so I guess there was some self-discovery going on in there. At the end,you kind of want to go back and watch it again for pointers to what was really going on...but no more spoilers...

"JPfanatic93","8","1","3","23 September 2013"," If you see it, see it in 3D as Lee intended
","Grand tale of survival, man ""versus"" beast, the importance of hope and the personal nature of religious beliefs, which won Ang Lee the 'Best Director' Academy Award. A man from India named Pi (Irrfan Khan) tells his life's tale: growing up in a zoo, ultimately moving the whole animal circus to America as a boy, only to lose everything (including his family) in a tropical storm at sea. Stranded on a life boat, the young man (now played by Suraj Sharma) has to contend with the only other survivor, an adult tiger named Richard Parker (created by a fabulous mix between CGI and the real deal, the two blending in so seamlessly that few people can tell the difference: a VFX Oscar well earned!). Stuck with each other for months on end on the ocean desert, Pi recalls their various encounters, the good, the bad and the bizarre, with the message that no matter how bleak things seem, there's always something to enjoy about the circumstances life has in store for you. Lee serves this viewpoint from an atypical religious angle that celebrates the good in religion by allowing Pi to take the best elements of various religious belief systems and appropriating it to form his own feel-good personal religion. The surprising result (for hardcore atheists like myself at least) is that, despite the fact Pi opens his story with the line 'I will tell you a story that will make you believe in God', the movie is never to be considered a pamphlet to convert anyone to any organized faith, but a call for total individualist religious freedom, to belief in whatever you want to belief to make the world work better for yourself. And so, despite having lost his family at sea and having to take care not to be eaten every day, Pi cannot help but marvel at life's grandeur, as he witnesses splendid sights seen by few, including a whale feasting on phosphorescent plankton at night, a carnivorous island populated only by meercats and eventual mutual survival for Richard and himself against all odds. As is expected from Ang Lee, such a colourful tale comes with his typical ingeniously rich visual imagery, leading to many breathtaking and haunting shots ('Best Cinematography' too), made all the more effective by its grandiose use of 3D technology: hence, watching this film in 2D is like listening to music with your ears closed."

Pressed by a sense of wonder and an insatiable drive to understand life, Pi and his family undergo a long and dangerous sea voyage aboard a Japanese cargo vessel. Encountering a huge storm and a shipwreck, Pi soon finds himself alone in a lifeboat with the remnants of what used to be a Zoo. The struggle to survive in a boat is arduous enough, but to maintain himself and a hungry Begal Tiger is doubly difficult. Still, the adventure taken by Pi to strange places unknown, prompts questions which lie between reality and mystical illusion. In addition the fantastic movie invites the audience to experience the incredible and harrowing ordeal with him. The result is a film not easily forgotten especially with the help of international stars like Gerard Depardieu. Easily recommended to all. ****"

If a person has to live with a tiger in a narrow space, it will be very terrible and unbearable. This movie will make people feel nervous and surprised from the beginning to the end.

At some point, I had failed to understand why Pi's journey, described realistically at first, suddenly seemed fictional and not in sync with the beginning. At the end, all is revealed. It actually reminded me a bit about Don Juan de Marco (film).<br/><br/>In my opinion, whether or not the main character believed in God did not matter in the main message of the novel. What really matters is brought to light when a writer (a character in the film), given two different accounts of Pi's journey, prefers the one which was magical although fictional. Pi concludes that it works the same way with (believing in) God. I believe that Yann Martel masterfully demonstrates why many people are naturally inclined to believe in a supreme being. Believing in a god (or in gods) can offer hope and optimism, even if it's hollow. We can also see that with Pi's mother, whose religiousness is only because she misses her past (according to Pi).<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this film. The only downside to me was that the journey on the sea was dragged a little, but then there wouldn't be much else to talk about if it weren't for that! Highly recommended!"

The movie is about Pi's fight for survival on a little life boat Not only does Pi have to find a way to survive being stranded in the middle of the ocean, but he is not alone. He is stuck in this small boat with an aggressive Bengal Tiger.<br/><br/>The story is amazing it is very entertaining and full of excitement which surprised me seeing as 90% of the movie is set on a small boat. Before watching this I was thinking that this would be quite a slow movie and there would be parts that would be boring but there isn't. It really does keep you glued to your seat.<br/><br/>Yes, the story Pi is telling is very unrealistic and when I watched it, a few times in the movie I was thinking that if this happened in real life he would be dead.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is probably the best looking film I have ever seen. The images and scenery were amazing. All the way through the movie I was thinking (as a photographer) that I would love to be there with my camera. I have a photography website and there were so many images there that I wish were real so that I could go and visit and get some amazing shots. The colours were amazing, very vibrant and they jumped out from the screen. I could imagine that in 3D it would make the experience even more beautiful.<br/><br/>The only thing negative I could say about this film would be that the effects were not always on form. Most of the time it was brilliant, but then every now and then you could see that the tiger was computer generated and not real. That goes for some of the other animals too. They just didn't look right in some scenes. They didn't move realistically.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect. Suraj Sharma plays the main character. This was his first movie and I hope he gets a career out of this because he did a great job. The only famous face in the movie was Gerard Depardieu, but he only had a cameo.<br/><br/>I will give this film 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Excellent effects, excellent action, excellent story, excellent acting.<br/><br/>""Animals have souls...

"ibosoydan","9","1","3","2 August 2013"," life of pi
","the best movie of 2012. It became one of my favorites. The island will be delivered in the first place for me in society seemed to have gained a comfortable layout. Excating college years you know, do not know what life will bring, and then get used to the routine of life, starting a business, business, home, car, family life, it is a routine and comfort, can easily go. This island was represented by the routine to work for me after watching the film. This represents a direct member of routine life who live there. If you pay attention not leave the bottom of your butt all pi tries to sleep. people in the community, such as the interloper into their lives mirrored each other to me. and one of us in this routine, going to live a comfortable life without forcing the pursuit of our dreams and the real world, you're going to fade away. back and forth, which do not represent the end of the female is up to the individual person as well as in society as it is here. there is a set of ideals that were sometimes leave a comfortable environment to work with, you need to strive. here we leave behind the island of pi can also symbolize the struggle for ideals, I thought."

","Clever as ever I kept thinking, and as great a movie on so many dozens of levels including a mind-altering degree of movie realness as so far anyway, ones senses will tend to get.. and SO disproportionate to the difficulty one would expect such a challenge to assign; and in an honest and brilliant fashion, painstakingly showing us that given great reverence a furious fate should never be able to burst up every bubble and even when hope seems gone, to demolish every bet... I feel a little like Charles Dickens (who was paid by the word) in having to complete 10 lines and abandon my intended effective use of witty brevity in favour of extra letters in words and sesquipedalian choices thereof!

","Having yet to read the book, I watched the film mainly as an illumininator for the novel, which I am now eager to start. I can only say that LIFE of PI is like no other film that I have ever seen. I expected it to be good but also feared it might have some of those fluffy ""Oh, aren't I deep and brilliant?!"" qualities. My fears proved baseless. LIFE of PI incorporates mystical and philosophical themes very well without detracting from its very engaging storyline. It's also touching and poignant without being the least bit sentimental. Despite a few choppy bits, there isn't a seriously dull moment here. Suraj Sharma/Irrfan Khan play the protagonist quite convincingly, but it's the fine cinematography that really makes this film. Absolutely stunning views of the ocean and its life and, of course, Richard Parker the tiger and various other animals."
"suzayj","10","1","3","29 July 2013"," Incredible, Inspiring, spiritually moving!
","This film not only kept me entertained, throughout its entirety, but it also provided a lot to think about after I was finished watching. I loved the seamless plot but besides that, the concepts of religions being malleable because in actuality, all religions are one and the same, depending on how you look at it. It was a beautiful concept that several religions could live at peace in one person, who had the open-mindedness to believe in them all! The story was both gripping, and stretched the imagination to new heights. If i could insist to everyone reading this to watch this movie, PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE! It will move you, I can almost guarantee that! (unless you are uneasily moved)"
"Jimmy714","10","1","3","27 July 2013"," Amazing......A Must See Movie
","When you see an Ang Lee directed movie you know you will not be let down, and Life Of Pi surely delivers. The story is well written and told by Ang Lee with awesome special effects that will attack your senses.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie but ended up renting it after it had received rave reviews and Oscar nominations. I thought I would sit through it and then question why all the hype? Well, this movie surely did not let me down. The story centers around Pi, a teenager who is lost at sea with a Bengal tiger in a lifeboat after the ship he and his family were traveling on encounters a violent storm and subsequently sinks. Pi loses his family and then spends the next 227 days at see. Initially there are a few animals on board his lifeboat including a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and the tiger. As time passes it is just Pi and the tiger who survive throughout their journey. Life Of Pi shows the need for co-existence between man and beast if they are to survive.<br/><br/>The special effects and breathtaking cinematography achieves what I am sure Mr. Lee was looking to deliver. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves to be on everyone's must see list. I highly recommend it and assure you that you will not be let down either."
"SerenaMoodie","9","1","3","19 July 2013"," Such an amazing movie
","This movie was a true masterpiece. But, like I bet most people said it wasn't really like the book. <br/><br/>Some things were missing and some things were added. One of the thing that was added that I liked was the scene when he went diving to go look for his family and he saw the boat underwater sinking.<br/><br/>That part touched me and made me want to cry. It was so in detailed. Even the smallest scenes. For example when the zebra broke his leg, you heard the crack as he wend crashing into the life boat. But the island scene was just very confusing a little even in the book. The rest of the movie was great. And really amazing."

"leonblackwood","8","1","3","9 July 2013"," A Visual Spectacular! 8/10
","Review: This is a visual spectacular, with a great storyline which touches the heart. The director used today's technology to the fullest to bring the movie to life. You really believe that the tiger, and other animals like the hyena and zebra, are really there, which makes the movie even more enjoyable. The leading character was a great choice and he also put n a convincing performance, which must have been hard with so much graphics being used. This is a bit weird to say, but the relationship between Pi and the tiger was brilliant. It reminded me a lot like Wilson and Tom Hanks in Castaway. Anyway, this movie should definitely not be missed because there won't be another movie with such a deep and meaningful storyline for some time. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I did find the ending a bit corny, after going through such an emotional ride, but it doesn't take away the greatness in the film. Although the storyline is great, it's the visual effects that must have taken a hell of a long time because of its precise and believable realism. The whole shipwreck scene will put Titanic to shame, but in some ways, its not the type of movie that you will watch time and time again, for a some unknown reason. With all that aside, this movie must look excellent in 3D, which is the format that I recommend to everyone who watches this movie and check out the wicked names for the animals.<br/><br/>Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $609million (Well Deserved!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who like there emotional, fantasy/adventure movies with a touching storyline. 8/10"

"jjgooner","9","1","3","1 July 2013"," A Visual Masterpiece
","Life of Pi<br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>127 mins/PG<br/><br/>Cast: Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Rafe Spall, Gerard Depardieu<br/><br/>Director: Ang Lee<br/><br/>Plot: When a young Indian boy is involved in a shipwreck he is forced to survive alone at sea, with only a tiger for company.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: 'Life of Pi' is one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my entire life. Many viewed Yann Martel's book unfilmable and to perfectly honest it almost is. How can you make a tiger, zebra, hyena and a human be on a single rowing boat at the same time? How can you fill an island with thousands of meerkats at the same time? And how can you have hundreds of flying fish soar past you at once? The answer to all these questions is wizardry. Special effects that look so real and amazing that you can actually believe that a tiger could tear Pi to pieces. <br/><br/>The film starts off describing Pi's life from a boy (well narrated by Irrfan Khan) and each of these scenes, from how he got his name, to finding his first love, are made with such charm and innocence. As a boy, Pi starts to discover faiths and ends up being Christian, Muslim and Hindu at the same time. While funny at the time, it brings up amazing philosophical arguments like if you believe in everything, then surely you believe in nothing. <br/><br/>Further on in the film, once he has become stranded in the sea, Suraj Sharma's scenes are nothing short of first class. The emotional stress he shows, and how he acts so well with the tiger despite never actually being on set with one. The film also brings up many more questions on life such as dreams and reality.<br/><br/>A modern classic, 'Life of Pi' is that rare film that can make you think so much while being entertained by it's stunning visual effects. Ang Lee should be so proud of his remarkable achievement. Unfilmable? Think again."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","3","26 June 2013"," Interesting ideas but otherwise middle-of-the-road. Best scenes are the ones on the raft with Richard Parker.
","Life of Pi is one of those books that I distinctly remember looking at the book cover on the floor and thinking ""I'll wait for the film."" So, 10 years later, here I am, and now I'm actually quite interested in the book. Ang Lee is one of those directors who I always seem to have a strong yet divided opinion about. He's made some of my favourite films and some I've loathed so I'm really surprised that Life of Pi is so middle of the road for me. While it does have some great ideas that are very thought-provoking, particularly in how the protagonist has many religions, Lee's execution isn't as strong as it could have been. Its main weaknesses are the introduction and ending, particularly with the use of a very weak and tired framing device of the older version of the character telling a journalist or writer their story. However, it must be noted that I am big fan of Irrfan Khan's subtle and emotional performance as older Pi, which was a great surprise as I disliked him in Slumdog Millionaire for his wooden deliveries, ironically as a character in a similar style framing device.<br/><br/>It's one of those films that's been hyped for its great use of 3D so I decided to indulge and try it out. I really don't think I'm one for 3D. Unless the director thinks out every single shot of the film, the 3D holds it back. It especially betrays simple medium shots of people where they're the only thing in focus because it makes it look so unorganised and sloppy. Perhaps I should rewatch the film in 2D as I didn't feel as though the 3D added anything to the scenes where it was clearly intended for. However, these scenes, where Pi is alone on the boat with the Tiger, remain the film's strongest and most focused moments. Post-crash scene, Life of Pi finally came into its own with fascinating, sometimes funny and really beautiful scenes of simple survival. Unfortunately, Suraj Sharma, who plays teenage Pi, isn't a strong enough actor to hit his big emotional scenes and they come off and false and contrived. The film does have its merits and mostly on a technical level (forgetting the 3D), but the third act is really messy and doesn't climax in a satisfying way, cinematically or emotionally. I understand its final note on its themes regarding faith and beliefs but the execution doesn't do the idea of it justice. How anyone could gain a faith in God after a story like that is beyond me. It's an enjoyable and watchable film, but quite underwhelming.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Karina2013","10","1","3","25 June 2013"," A tale you have to watch!

I just watched this last night and though i would write my take on this while its fresh on my mind. Its about a boy who survives a ship wreck and is telling his story to his friend. The movie starts with colorful scenes, animals, beautiful background music and makes you think you are in this fantasy land. Something i love about this movie is the way this story is showing many of the religions we have today with such respect and honor. Its a movie for both adults and the youth. It will sure touch you, so don't miss out on this movie go watch it."

","Very Impressive. I think it is the best Symbolic movie I ever seen. The Story writer is just awesome and the Director is also because he makes the story more beautiful. ""All that the Island gave him by day , it took away at night"", ""When you look into his eye, you are seeing your own emotion reflect back at you' There are so many quotation like this in the movie impressed very much. This movie is not like other symbolic movie, It represents a story with some of other story. There are many of the people have story like this and they can not express because there is no evidence of the story. People always prefer a story which is very easy but sometimes there are some exception occurs which is very hard to trust."
"felixmartinsson","7","1","3","7 May 2013"," Unbelievable!!!
","My rating on this film might be confusing because I say it was unbelievable, but I'll explain it later in this review. <br/><br/>The visual effects were so incredible that I can't even find any words for it! It was so well executed, and the sound effects together with the visual effects were once again just unbelievable! <br/><br/>So, what made me vote 7/10? It's because I think it was way too long (2 hours), it was so much details that I thought wasn't necessary. Overall the acting bits was just perfect, I really enjoyed that!

It's a fantastic experience!"
"gwhiz611","9","1","3","4 May 2013"," Finding One's Path, According to Life of Pi
","The Life of Pi is perhaps the most meaningful movie ever made. It follows the quest of Pi, an Indian religious zealot who is unsure of which religion he is zealous about. His quest, as displayed in the movie's cover, appears to be his survival on a boat with a tiger, but is actually a quest to find truth. And ultimately, the story is our quest too.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie depicts Pi's childhood search for religion. Dabbling in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, he receives a small degree of flak from his family, especially his father, who believes that reason — not religion — should be one's starting point. His mother taught him the ways of Hinduism, and somewhat disagreed with her husband, saying: ""Science can teach us things out there, but not in the heart."" <br/><br/>The second part of the movie follows Pi's survival on the lifeboat. His family has to leave the country and take up residence in Canada. Since they are zookeepers, they bring their animals on the ship. Unfortunately, a storm rages against the ship, and Pi is thrown to the ocean, along with some people and animals. Only he, a zebra, rat, tiger, hyena, an orangutan make it to the desperate shelter of a lifeboat as he watches his past sink beneath him.<br/><br/>From this part on, the filmmakers pull out all their cinematography stops. From leagues of jelly fish to scores of flying fish the heavily incorporated CGI footage appears realistic. On the boat he learns how to survive on the ocean and cope with the tiger, the only surviving animal (for obvious reasons). He retains his commitment to never take a life for as long as possible, and is cautious, but not malicious, towards Richard Parker, the tiger. He learns survival coping skills, becomes resourceful, and lets his instinct rule as danger resides above (with the teeth of animals) and below (with teeth of sharks). The tiger's presence was good for Pi, as he reflected back on his life, ""Attending to the tiger's needs gives my life purpose.""<br/><br/>Yes, Pi did eventually live, although he had given God everything, and felt he and the tiger were about to die. In the crux of a storm, he cried: ""God, thank you for giving me my life."" By good fortune he found an island disconnected from humanity, with plenty of food, animals, and water, but he concluded that it was not enough to truly sustain him. He traveled on until he reached the Mexican shore, survived, and went on to have a wife, cat, and some kids.<br/><br/>Nice story.<br/><br/>Yet, when he was picked up, nobody believed him. The amazing twist of this story is that all of this may not have happened. At the tail end of the movie, two Japanese men ask Pi to give them ""a believable story"" for their company. And Pi, after showing us the entire movie with the tiger, goes on to explain another — more ""rational"" story. But why, after all the beauty we've seen? Most people have given this movie high reviews, raving about the mesmerizing scenes, the CGI, the tension between Pi and the tiger, great acting, and sheer imagination in the film. While the movie contains all of these, I might suggest that the core of the movie is about none of them.<br/><br/>This movie is like a bag full of gems. One could easily unpack the thousand symbolic wonders of this film. But the most unusual part of this movie is that it encourages the viewer to decide completely for themselves what to believe. We first see the story of the tiger, but the tiger could also represent Pi's evil instincts. As the movie unfolds, every event on the boat could be symbolic . . . or not. The island could be the bosom of a god. Or it could be symbolic of resting in humanity. Pi could have been interacting with the animals, or he could have been cannibalizing people (it goes to show that depth of content indeed can be found in PG rated movies).<br/><br/>So, a dilemma occurs. Which do we choose? The first story was about miracles, phenomenal, sentimental, yet hard to believe. It is about what God was doing. The other is plain and believable: Pi simply sat on the hospital bed and told us. Yes, tears were streaming down his face, but it's easy to trivialize, and easier to forget. Nobody forgets the tiger.<br/><br/>I believe that Pi told his story in such a way as to not be trivialized. Whether anyone believes it is up to them, but as the story unfolds, our hearts want to believe in the tiger. No matter which story we believe, the second story is given so much more depth and meaning when told in light of the first.<br/><br/>If the first story wasn't told, it would be difficult to believe that God had a hand in the process. When someone shares their story, it's easy to trivialize their deliverance. Pi may have fantasized his story so we could see how important his deliverance is — physically and spiritually. He was able to realize in tribulation that God was making provision for him.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, The Life of Pi is open-ended, but not without leaving us in tension. It is our choice in how much we draw from this movie. Will we choose the logical, fact-driven view, rationalizing all the mystery, or should we embrace a providential, terrifying God who guides us as we trust him? Pi has given us all the options; now we must simply have faith."
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","3","21 April 2013"," math symbol moving to the next stage of life
","In the grand scheme of things, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is about moving on to the next stage of one's life. Pi Patel's having to share a lifeboat with a Bengali tiger practically turns him into a new person. The movie's visuals have to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Ang Lee had already had some impressive achievements with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", and he continues with this movie. It is just not a movie that I can describe. The one scene that was a little weird was when Gérard Depardieu appeared as the cook (a big name in a small role interfered with the movie's plot). But otherwise it's a really good movie. I recommend it."
"gokhan-erguven","10","1","3","21 April 2013"," A great movie about a journey of one, and about finding God.
","To be honest, I had doubts about this movie as I knew that most of the scenes were CGI (computer generated images) and wondered if this could bring the story and the message accurately...<br/><br/>BUT, all my doubts, worries disappeared five or ten minutes after I began to watch the movie. The discussions about religion, God struck at the heart of me. I'm not a religious person, but the discussions about whether believing religion/God or not in this movie is one of the best ways of bringing religion on the table.<br/><br/>Moreover, the journey of Pi, his interaction with the animals, especially with Richard Parker the lion, his encounter with dangers and beauties on the sea are the best depiction of God. If you watch this film, you will be satisfied as you've seen God in the entire story.<br/><br/>Ang Lee brings a very good story in a very good composition; I can easily confess that I cried in some scenes. A very great job and an excellent movie. 10 stars from me!"
"inkblot11","8","1","3","17 April 2013"," Gorgeous imagery and deft direction aid the telling of a complex story
","Pi (Suraj Sharma as a teen, Irrpan Khan as an adult), has quite a story to tell a Canadian writer (Rafe Spall) when he comes calling. As it were, Pi was named after the longer word for swimming pool, Piscine, in French but an obvious, objective nickname became the norm until he demanded to be called Pi. His father and mother ran a small zoo in their Indian city and loved swimming pools, too. Pi got in dreadful trouble one day when he attempted to feed a Bengal tiger through skimpy bars. His father and mother made him watch the animal, named Richard Parker, long story, kill and eat a goat, as a lesson. Pi understood quickly the power of this beast. Later, due to financial difficulties, the family decided to move to Canada, where they would sell the remaining animals, including RP. Alas, on the boat, where the cook (Gerard Depardieu) belittled their vegetarian needs, a storm arose. A Japanese vessel, everyone sunk except Pi, Richard P, a zebra, a hyena and a monkey. These five managed to make a lifeboat, but because of the laws of nature, soon the only ones left were Pi and the tiger. For awhile, Pi hooked up a few life rings, by rope, to the small boat, whenever Richard Parker didn't get enough to eat and was on the prowl. Miraculously, this went on for weeks but when would they be rescued? Would they be? Bravo, dear Ang Lee, for making a film out of a complex novel, albeit a great one. There is much talk of religion and other philosophical matters in the book, as the story unfolds, and a great deal of this is captured. The first part, where the family life in India appears, is lovely, with great scenery and acting. Once on the waters, too, the imagery is likewise fantastic, as the story turns to the fight for survival. There are also flashbacks to the present, where the older, married Pi tries to elaborate any peculiar details. The acting is also wonderful, with no familiar stars except Monsieur D, in a rather small role, but no matter. All are compelling. The varied direction is enchanting, with its use of cutting techniques to keep the viewers involved in the action. Alas, I chose not to see this in 3-D at the theater, what a mistake of the decade! But, even on a small screen with no bells and whistles, this is an enthralling piece of cinema."
"raphaklopper","10","1","3","16 April 2013"," Ang Lee's first time on 3D??? WOW!
","I don't even know what to say about ""Life of Pi"", the film is wonderful, that's all I can say. Ang lee outdone itself with this film, and of course David Magee (screenplay). Both managed to carry the book more indecipherable already done by Yann Martel, and turned it into something simple ... a 16 years in a boat with a wild tiger in the middle of the pacific ocean, simple as that.<br/><br/>The story is really about the ""Life of Pi"", Piscine Patel is a very smart guy, bullying sufferer, who during his life had learned many religions and took all as his own. When his parents start to have a financial crisis on its Zoo, they decided to move to Canada and sell their animals and start a new life. Everything is going ""well"" yet the freighter where Pi and his family were traveling was shipwrecked. Pi is the only survivor, plus a tiger that belongs to his family, and from there both must learn to survive together.<br/><br/>The movie is very well done from beginning to end, the history raises several questions, but no waiting for an answer, they are all to carry on our lives. The way Ang and David can put this story as ""simple"" as a pretty intelligent way from beginning to end, and how they can make the story as real, the characters are all the scenarios as real, and also their actions and instincts.<br/><br/>The visual effects are superb, the animals are super real, even seem real, the sets are magnificent, and fantastic soundtrack fits everywhere, the direction of the film not to mention, as I said Ang Lee outdone itself.<br/><br/>Not only him, but as the entire cast, but I must say that Suraj Sharma is FANTASTIC for a first role in movie is nothing bad, but PERFECT! Very well built, very well directed, well acted, messages who persecute you, unforgettable scenery, a story truly exciting and fun for the entire audience, ""Life of Pi"" is one of the best films of his year and of all time!"

"ParanoidAndroid97","10","1","3","12 April 2013"," A beautiful and enthralling tale that explores and displays the wonders of life
","I wasn't sure what to expect going into Life of Pi. I had never read Yann Martel's 2001 novel and decided to see it based on the content of the trailer alone. I was expecting something good, but I was certainly not prepared for this. The story centres around an Indian boy called Piscine (known to most as Pi) who is confused and unsure about his spiritual beliefs and his faith. He is taken with his family across the sea to find a new home- but after the ship sinks he is left alone, the only survivor, in a lifeboat, accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra and a tiger, Richard Parker. As he tries to survive and create a bond with Richard Parker he is forced to explore his spiritual beliefs even further, and prompts the viewer to do the same. It is this thought-provocation that makes this film so excellent- the viewer, even if adamant about their faith or lack of it, can't help but stop and think as the film goes on, as well as be amazed by the natural beauty of the world that becomes Pi's home as he battles against the forces of nature and is also amazed by them. The performances are excellent from all involved. Irrfan Khan is superb as the older Pi, delivering his wise lines with serenity mixed with seriousness. Suraj Sharma also delivers a fine debut performance as Pi's 16-year-old self. The script is very good indeed, with some lines taken almost directly from Martel's novel (which of course I went on to read). Watch and prepare to have all you believe in challenged, but also accepted. And any movie that can thrill and excite, provoke thought, entice emotion and create both scenes of beauty and scenes of horror can only be worthy of a 10/10."
"witster18","7","1","3","10 April 2013"," all the strengths, and even some of the weaknesses you'd expect from an innovative film..
","""Life of Pi"" is one of the better films from 2012.<br/><br/>I had heard it was a landmark film in terms of moving into the ""digital-age"", and the visuals definitely set this film apart, but I have to admit that the movie had a better storyline and under-lying meaning than I was expecting.<br/><br/>The visuals were only one facet of this fine film, and on occasion, the films only weakness. The digital make-up of this visual wonder allowed the actors, animals, and the vast ocean to share the same space - while never sharing the same space. The films use of generated 'space' is unrivaled. It's a backwards movie in terms of production. The plus-side is no formatting issues. The film blends many computer-generated visuals along with the digitally captured live-action.<br/><br/>It's a landmark in film-making much like Tron, Last Starfighter, Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and Roger Rabbit, in that it uses a new technique that opens up all sorts of doors for the future. BUT, if you look back at the films I just mentioned they all have weaknesses(well maybe not so much Blade Runner). Like a new model car - they might have few recalls down the road.<br/><br/>Ang Lee did a good job here meshing all this together, but he also took some liberties with all this technology - occasionally taking it a bit too far. That's about my only gripe. After all, most of the film is told in flashback style which gives you the ability to embellish without necessarily being untruthful, but there are a couple of moments that might have been better-off if they were toned-down just a bit.<br/><br/>The acting is superb.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes involving the animals are hard to watch, but I think the film actually took great care of that aspect of the film.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend this as something that is much more than a man on a boat.<br/><br/>You MIGHT like this if you liked: Tree of Life(not as good and slower), Slumdog Millionaire(better and stars one of the same actors), Titanic(about equal in every way, but Life of Pi is only 2hrs not 3).<br/><br/>79/100 Should have no problem holding a top-ten spot for 2012. Right now, I'd have it around 7 or 8, having seen about 80 of the 85 films on my 2012 watchlist."

","This review has spoilers in it. First off I do not agree with the philosophy of the film and it is frankly insulting to monotheism however I must say that this is a very good movie in terms of entertainment. It is based on a book that pretty much stoled from another book most of the major things that make this movie so good. You should look up the book it is called ""Max and the Cats."" I haven't read that book but if you read the summary for it you can see that it is pretty much plagiarism. <br/><br/>REGARDLESS of the things I listed above this movie is great and a must watch because the story is so, so good and grabs you. The ending reveals.. the ending is just awesome. (Same ending as Max and the Cats but whatever) Ang Lee knows how to make a movie. His Hulk was awesome, his Flying Dragon was great and I am sure I saw a few other things he did but I can not think of them right now.<br/><br/>I can't wait to read the books. Both 'Max and the Cats' and 'the life of pi' I hate the author for his straight up plagiarism but I love the story he told.. even if it wasn't from his own imagination for the most part."

","This is one of the few movies I didn't see in theaters last year, but last night, my sister, brother, myself included, and mother watched it together after hearing the Oscar buzz it received. Later, I found myself crying after watching it and now I understood why this will go down as one of the best movies of 2012.<br/><br/>Before I would go to the praises that I would like to point out, my only nit-pick is that it does get pretty slow and it does drag on some parts of the film, but like I said before, it's just a nit-pick.<br/><br/>Everything else is brilliant. The cinematography is awe-inspiring and the scenery plus the visual effects blew my mind away. Even the CGI effects on the animals is perfect if feels like you're seeing all those real creatures. I may not be a fan of Ang Lee's works, but I think he did a nice job with his directing here. It's atmospheric and has a sense of wonder. The script is smart and touching with a strong beginning and uplifting ending along with the story which is so emotional.The music is pleasant and beautiful, but the strongest aspect, like the story, would have to go the acting. Pi is an appealing lead thanks to the young actors and Irrfan Khan as the adult Pi and the other actors did a fine job with their supporting roles. Not to mention the animals are very cute.<br/><br/>Overall, Life of Pi came this close to becoming a masterpiece if it had a much nicer pace and I have yet to read the book this was based on, but thanks to it's emotional story, solid editing, nice music, and creative characters, I would recommend this to those who haven't seen it yet.

The young Pi shown in the movie describes the dynamical Indian society very well and the way life is lived.All thanks to the visual effect the feeling of wow came many times as we went on watching the movie. The Pi on the boat played by Suraj was an very interesting character, he's funny but knows how to handle responsibilities as and when required. I wish i could write the same about Mr Parker. Narration by Irfan Khan seems satirical many times simultaneously making his point. Above all an amazing visual experience.

"sawfish666","10","1","3","17 March 2013"," SPOILER!!!! A Divergent Interpretation of The Life of Pi
","I seldom give ratings of excellent, but after having mulled over this film, and its story, repeatedly for about 6 months, I've come to the conclusion that the story told by the film is extremely powerful, uplifting, and universal.<br/><br/>But it is not the story of a boy in a lifeboat with a tiger, finding ways to co-exist at sea for 227 days...<br/><br/>READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM, BUT WISH TO....<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The main narrative that occupies the vast bulk of the film is not what happened. The main character, ""adult Pi"" has survived the ordeal that he revealed in his *2nd* explanation to the Japanese transport investigators. The ship went down, he got onto the boat, along with his mom, the cook, and one other identified crew member.<br/><br/>After a time the cook killed both his mom and the other crew member, and partially ate one or both. The younger Pi killed the cook. He then likely ate the cook or the crew member the cook had killed, but hopefully not his mom. There was not tiger (this is Pi), hyena (the cook), orangutan (his mom), or zebra (other crew member) on the boat. They were allegorical personifications that Pi, as he grew to adulthood, created in order to live at peace with himself. As a result, we can see the adult Pi as a whimsical, happy, and cheerful--even charming--man.<br/><br/>The reveal aspect of the fascination with multiple religions has no bearing on the theme: it is merely colorful character development, similar to his first name, ""Pi"" (being derived from a swimming pool in France (""piscine"") where his uncle had competed, and shortened to ""Pi"" based on a recitation of the mathematical constant, pi). There is nothing theological or metaphysical about the theme. It is the story of survival under the most extreme and degrading conditions, and the psychological mechanisms that allow personal redemption of sorts. Thematically, it is much closer to Sophie's Choice or The Pianist than the way it appears superficially on screen and in the way it was marketed--akin to Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>There is context internal to the narration that support this interpretation, and in some ways the film almost *tells* you that this is so. At one point, Pi, himself, tells the author that he was the tiger.<br/><br/>So in this view, the story is of brutal survival, followed by years of constructing a narrative that rationalizes that part of Pi's life, and allows him to live normally and happily.<br/><br/>...and *that* is a remarkably powerful message in itself.<br/><br/>If you go back and deconstruct the film narrative in this light, it shows a brilliant and masterful job of both story adaptation and of creating the film narrative, itself. On top of that, it has some truly beautiful Hollywood bells-and-whistles added to enhance the dreamlike parts of the constructed rationalization."

"fellow456","7","1","3","10 March 2013"," Better At the End Than the Middle
","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.<br/><br/>This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane on screen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.<br/><br/>Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, ""When are they getting on the boat?"", ""Why are they not on the boat yet?"", ""Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?"", and, ""Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?""<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as ""tiger."" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.<br/><br/>Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.<br/><br/>All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches the boat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.<br/><br/>In Short:<br/><br/>Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling."
"BeneCumb","7","1","3","26 February 2013"," Playful and showy, but too much ""wreathed"" worldwide
","Although the movie has a nice balanced approach of visual and spiritual, the plot is still hectic and with too long scenes and repetitions - its duration of about 2 hours could have been avoided. Directing and camera work are, of course, excellent, and powerful nature (the sea, above all) and animals are catchy to follow, but this shipwreck story becomes a bit annoying soon (thanks to the tiger, not totally boring though). Moreover, the flashbacks and recollections could easily be shorter. And the ending, well... Just the joy of storytelling.<br/><br/>As for actors, they are not so memorable, typical Bollywood, and Gerard Depardieu has too small part. Speaking of India-related movies, I would definitely prefer Slumdog Millionaire or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."

"theredraylives","7","1","3","21 February 2013"," Beautiful, but self-defeating
","Life of Pi is an encouraging and optimistic tale about human survival and the struggle to battle ones inner demons. Visually dazzling and filled with great tension, Ang Lee's latest does a lot of things right in its quest to steady the soul. Its themes and its overall narrative, however, are purposefully deceptive, which leaves a lot of the film rather muddled and lost in its own message. A stunning testament to the human spirit and to love, and in the end, the journey one man takes to find himself and to find God. It is too bad that Lee's presentation comes off as a little overwrought.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan stars in the film as Pi, who recounts the tale of his life to a writer (Rafe Spall). He was the son of a zookeeper and his wife, living in India. Through some happenstance, the family decides to move to Canada, taking the animals with them, which they plan on selling once they arrive in order to financially establish themselves. En route, the Japanese cargo ship sinks, the animals escape, and Pi finds himself stranded alone on a lifeboat with a few of them.<br/><br/>The bulk of the narrative revolves around a younger Pi (Suraj Sharma in a fantastic performance) and his attempts to survive stranded at sea with an adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The two share a fantastic voyage across the sea in which Pi learns about courage and finds the strength to survive, often out of fearing for his own life. However, the narrative often seems a touch too fantastic and out of touch with reality- a fact given a great deal of attention since the older Pi prefaces the story with a warning about how fantastic it is.<br/><br/>As a young boy, Pi spent a great deal of time searching for himself through faith- proclaiming himself to be a Hindu, Christian, and a Muslim simultaneously. His father (Adil Hussain) tells him that one who believes in all things at once really believes in nothing at all, and urges him to choose a path. He asks him to listen to reason (one could argue, a faith all its own). Life of Pi is, at its core, a metaphor for religion, but not one specific religion, and ultimately argues there is no one path to peace and spirituality, to faith, love, and wisdom. It instead marries all of the ideas together, showing that there is no one true path. Science, reason, faith, and religion, all different paths leading to the same destination.<br/><br/>Life of Pi asks whether the journey is more important than the destination, and the film clearly argues that the former is more important; at the end, the elder Pi recalls telling two stories. In both stories, his ship sinks, his family dies, and he survives. Yet he asks which is the better story; the writer responds, ""the one with the tiger."" With this, the elder Pi replies, ""and so it goes with God."" Life of Pi, then, places upon the viewer that the destination- finding God- is always the same, but that each must find the best way.<br/><br/>In revealing his narrator as unreliable, Lee unfortunately detracts from the themes that he is trying to present. It would have been Lee's masterstroke had he simply let the film tell this story; his attempts at selling his point of view to the audience are weakened by placing doubt in the mind of the viewer. The film makes the point he wants it to without the ham-fisted exposition, and it forces the vigilant viewer to ever question the journey. Without the needless revelation- by cutting out anything regarding the adult Pi until the end of the film- it would have been absolutely magnificent. As it stands now, it is just one flaw too many in a film that spends half its run time on a boat with a man and a tiger, which is devoid of tension since the audience knows how it ends.<br/><br/>In the end, take away from Life of Pi the thematic questions it raises and the points it makes, but don't expect it to unfold naturally. Despite all of the nature, the serenity, and the unpredictability of the setting of the film, it has a simplistic, mechanical feel that is too inorganic by comparison.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"
"t-lizzle","7","1","3","4 February 2013"," Visuals are this film's shining achievement
","Anytime you come into a movie having already read the book it is based on you will have biases. It's rather unavoidable. I did read the book beforehand, and I did the best to avoid pointing out all of the differences in my head, because to do that is to just ruin the movie for myself, when I should just give it a chance. Now, anytime a book has fantastic places or scenes, there is eager anticipation to see it realized visually. This movie delivers on that front and creates scenes rather similar to how I thought they would be and other times make them even greater. What is really missing from the movie is some of the details and stories early on about the zoo animals which was really my favorite part of the book, but it is very understandable that these are missing in favor of the larger events of the main story. I believe ultimately any short coming in the movie was also a short coming of the book's narrative: the way it drags a little in the middle and the surprising ambiguity in the ending leave something to be desired. The book is better, but you can get by with just checking out the film."

","Life of pi is a very good film, What Ang Lee does visually using 3D and the surroundings are amazing throughout and a testament to his confidence behind the camera. The themes of religion and story telling and all that hoo hah are presented well enough and I had a lot of moments where I was all like ""this can be applied to my own life and stuff, man"" so I'd be surprised if you walked away from this completely unaffected.<br/><br/>The majority of the film that takes place upon the boat is incredibly well handled and often told through purely visual means without having a character speak. The computer-generated animals are also a marvel to watch and came about as close to seeming tangible as I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>One of my problems with the film is it's bookended by the grown up Pi relating his story to the shell of a journalist that presumably once contained a personality, and as far as existing to provide a basis for the narration it works, but it's a VERY obvious narrative tool.<br/><br/>If you're looking for some competent awards season fare that raises some mildly interesting questions about faith and identity while also having some very life-affirming moments give this a watch. If not, I recommend you watch anything by David Cronenberg and feel violated in knowing you just saw what you just saw."

Rationalism and spirituality, deduction and inspiration, science and art, Krishna and Christ are not all that different but are compatible manifestations of and portals to the same underlying truth.<br/><br/>Life of Pi does this not with a dry lecture, but through a gripping journey and tale of survival that stands on its own without the metaphysical underpinnings. <br/><br/>I did find the beginning out of place though very beautifully shot. The ending was a bit heavy handed (as was Pi reading ""L'etranger"") but maybe Ang Lee knows his audience and that he has to tell them what it is about.

","This was a beautiful movie to watch, from the opening credits all the way throughout the entire film. The CGI...some of the best I've ever seen. I was really impressed. And the acting...top notch. As far as the plot, I was left feeling like a movie that tells ""a story that would make you believe in God"", ended more sacrilegious than anything. So much so, that I was left wondering are they really saying religion is just a coping mechanism??? I guess their objective was for you to continue thinking about the movie long after you've watched it, so mission accomplished. However I'm thinking about it for all the wrong reasons & I can't help but wonder maybe something was lost in translation. I must admit, I did not read the book. But maybe ""the book that couldn't be made into a film"" really couldn't after all. I guess I have to go read it to find out."
"rubenm","8","1","3","19 January 2013"," Stunning
","Stunning. That's the only appropriate word to describe this film. Almost every minute, Ang Lee has some visual treat in store that makes you wonder: how did he do it? Already during the opening credits, with paradise-like scenes from a zoo, you know that this film is going to be a feast of spectacular images. <br/><br/>It's not just the scenes with the boy and the tiger on the lifeboat. That in itself is a marvelous accomplishment for a film maker. But it's so much more. The way Lee uses visual effects makes this film a sort of cinematographic fairytale. Everything is colourful, bright, beautiful and a bit unreal. <br/><br/>Of course, we know how Ang Lee did it: with computers. But the fact that a lot of what you see is computer generated, doesn't make it less impressive. Lee is able to tell a story with computer generated images that can make the audience laugh, shiver, an perhaps even cry. At the end of the film, the audience understands how Pi feels about the tiger. And that's not because of the special effects, but because of the way Lee has told the story. <br/><br/>You could argue that it's just that: a sort of fairytale. There's no deeper meaning, no link to the real world. 'Life of Pi' is a visual showcase, not a gripping realistic drama. But that didn't bother me. I was awed by what I saw. <br/><br/>Perhaps the film could have been more focused. The references to religion ('thank you Vishnu, for letting me know Jesus') are a bit out of place. I suppose the philosophical and religious aspects of the story are much more elaborated in the book than in the film. Also, the visit to the floating island with the meerkats could just as well have been left out, because it isn't really necessary for the story. That was the only part of the film I thought was a bit overdone. But then again, without it we would have missed some spectacular visual effects. And that's what it's all about in this film."

","""Life of Pi"" is further evidence that Ang Lee is a filmmaker who favors craft over money. From the wondrous visuals to the meaty storytelling, Life of Pi takes appreciative audiences on a journey of curiosity, despair and faith.<br/><br/>Many called ""Life of Pi"" an ""unfilmable"" book due to it's literary complexity. Ang Lee himself was weary while filming this, but much like he did with Brokeback Mountain's controversial plot line in 2005, he took risks and succeeded.<br/><br/>The film opens with Pi Patel as an adult (played by Irrfan Kahn from The Amazing Spiderman) reminiscing about his childhood with an author (played by Rafe Spall from Prometheus). The audience is first treated to several shots of colorful, strange animals living at a zoo during the opening credits. This emphasizes how Pi's childhood was filled with wonder and curiosity in religion and how he saw the world as magical.<br/><br/>Pi spends most of his childhood exploring different religions. He is fascinated by all of them, and yet he cannot chose one. He is wondered by the stories of Krishna and Ganesha in Hinduism, he admires the sacrifices Jesus made in Chatholisism, and he appreciates the themes of togetherness and meditation in the Muslim religion.<br/><br/>However, Pi's father is much more skeptical. He is a polio survivor who feels like he was saved by medicine, not God when he was ill. Therefore, he reminds Pi that he must value logistics and skepticism over religious stories and faiths in order to be more intelligent. Pi's father's lessons in logic become the most clear when he scolds Pi for trying to feed the tiger because as Pi puts it, ""All living things have souls."" In order to teach his son that animals are savage and soulless, he forces Pi to watch a live goat being murdered by the tiger.<br/><br/>This theme of skepticism vs. faith is perhaps the most important theme in the film, as it is an important tool when it comes to interpreting the story. Throughout the film, Pi encounters many wondrous sights and questions God's motives when he is eventually shipwrecked and separated from his family.<br/><br/>Deciding that they need to sell their zoo and gain more financial support, Pi's family decides to move to Canada with their zoo animals and possibly open a new zoo. However, on the way there, they are shipwrecked and only Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger survive the wreck and make it to a lifeboat.<br/><br/>(SMALL SPOILER AHEAD)<br/><br/>The hyena, zebra and orangutan die from various causes, and Pi is left with only the tiger (named Richard Parker) for company. The film then focuses on Pi's attempts to tame Richard Parker.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a fascinating and wonderfully deep story woven with much craft by David Magee (who previously wrote the 2004 film, Finding Neverland). The dialogue is smart and despite mostly taking place on a lifeboat, the film is never boring and always throws in something to grab the audience's interest.<br/><br/>Newcomer Suraj Sharma plays the role of Pi with conviction and true feeling. It is clear that he and Ang Lee made an excellent team, and his dedication to the role is more than commendable. Here's hoping they collaborate on future projects. It's a shame his performance did not get much attention from the various awards shows, but it is certainly one to remember.<br/><br/>I am certainly grateful that the claims of ""Life of Pi"" being ""unfilmable"" did not deter Ang Lee from bringing this masterpiece to the screen. As a fantasy film, it soars, as a story of religion, it succeeds, and as a film, it is beyond praise. It is an absolute must see."

","I have not read the novel, but thoroughly enjoyed the film which far exceeded my expectations. The direction and photography are among the best I have seen, so there is nothing to compare with. However, I wondered whether it was necessary to have the film in 3D, as one felt that the film could have been equally well enjoyed even without that. Irrfan Khan is as usual at his best, as the older Pi. The special effects are also fantastic, with the island of carnivorous trees so believable! And so is the quality of editing and casting. No wonder that the film has received several Oscar nominations. But, the only major point which jars is the controversy back home in India regarding the opening lullaby, over 80% of which is a straight lift through translation into Tamil from a celebrated Malayalam lullaby, Omanathingalkkidavo, composed by Irayimman Thampi exactly 200 years back, in 1813, on the occasion of the birth of Swati Tirunal, declared king even before birth, and who later became one of the four leading composers in Carnatic music of the era. Barring this obvious bit of plagiarism, the rest of the movie was thoroughly enjoyable. I wouldn't mind watching it again, merely for the cinematic skills."

","I should first confess that i have not read Yann Martel's novel, am not a vegetarian, and do not believe that all religions are the same. All that notwithstanding, i love this movie with the inspiring message that if life throws you lemons, make lemonade. When Indian boy Pi Patel faces taunts in school, he turns that to his advantage. When, as a teenager, he becomes shipwrecked and shares a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, he learns to deal with the situation and because he never gives up hope, he gets to be amazed by the wonderful experiences brought about by his predicament. Suraj Sharma injects his performance with a combination of innocence and tenacity, while the virtual tiger named Richard Parker is an impressive work of art. Both complement each other beautifully. The screenplay is sharp and observant, while the music score is striking yet unobtrusive. Yes, director Ang Lee has delivered yet another masterpiece."

","The movie has a saying that if you hear the story of Pi you will believe in God, well I did listen and watch his story and I have to say the story is both mystical and as it was made out to be spiritual. The movie is intense, and it starts with a light comic introduction of the lead characters, as I haven't read the book, I was wondering if the movie was going to fall in the genre of an outrageous comedy, then it drifts ever so gently to dramatic scene where the protagonist Pi meets the Tiger Richard Parker. From then on the movie holds your gaze and it is just an exceptionally good drama.<br/><br/>The power of the CGI used is so high up there I believe that Avatar (James Cameron) has been bitten when it comes to the use of 3D imagery to make all things look real, from the production set which was done in Taiwan where the crew built a tank that could hold 1.7 million gallons to shoot all the ocean scenes to the interaction between the animals and Pi, you will be taken off your sits.<br/><br/>Ang Lee, was the man in the directors sit for this movie; Lee's famous movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and his Academy award win for best director movie Brokeback Mountain (2005) gave him the edge and knowhow he needed to make this another Academy Award movie, with Life of Pi getting eleven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director.<br/><br/>Based on a fantasy adventure novel by Yann Martel which was published in 2001, the movie and book plot was about Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel, an Indian boy who got involved in spirituality and scientific reasoning from an early age. His father decided to move the family to Canada, and sell off his Zoo animals, but on their way on a Japanese freighter tragedy struck and Pi is shipwrecked and stranded on a life boat in the Pacific Ocean alone with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>The movie/book is about how Pi survived 227 days stranded on a boat, and how he managed to take care of himself and the Tiger onboard.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is as I have said before, a great movie that all should get the chance to see and enjoy. I see this movie winning Best Visual Effects at the Oscars, and probably more.

"cameronmorewood","8","1","3","12 January 2013"," Life of Pi
","Ang Lee, a director who's talents shine through screenplays which allow room for visual spectacle and impulsive emotion, does not always choose his projects wisely, i.e. 2003's ""The Hulk."" He is; however, brilliant when a film rises to his level of directing, i.e. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" The 3D world Lee and his crew creates and calls ""Life of Pi,"" is his third great film, and it astonishes. <br/><br/>One worthy accomplishment of Lee's adventure spectacle, is the striking utilization of CGI. Many novice moviegoers would perhaps be surprised to find out the tiger was completely computer generated- as were many animals and additional effects. Unlike, this year's ""Wrath of the Titans,"" the CGI isn't misguided, but nearly flawless. Every movement, every motion, and even the deep soul within the tiger's eyes are crafted with a master's care and precision. The use of 3D, though I am not a fan, is also very good. ""Life of Pi"" doesn't try to be a 3D jaw-drop and awe show, it simply tells its story and lets the visuals come as they do. I imagine the film would be equally riveting when seen in 2D. There will be an injustice if Lee's Pi doesn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. It's also a shoe-in for nods in Cinematography and Sound Editing, but the winners in those categories will probably be The Master and Skyfall, respectively. <br/><br/>What Lee brings to the screen here is nothing short of visual brilliance- Life of Pi takes you on a sort of magic carpet ride created by brilliant imagineers. But this magical adventure did miss the 'four star' award for good reason. There is one scene at the end of the film where Pi tells an alternate story- and though it is meant to draw parallels, it in fact takes away some of the magic."
"ahmed_joey_10","9","1","3","11 January 2013"," A journey through Life of Pi
","As I went out of the theater, I kept thinking what I should write about Life of Pi, I honestly can't describe what this movie made me feel. All I knew is I never had this much fun and satisfaction from a movie theater experience since I was a kid. Because even when I watched movies that I consider to be some of the best movies I've ever seen, I never felt that engrossed and invested in a movie theater before.<br/><br/>This is easily Ang Lee's best work to date. Unlike his previous movies, Life of Pi never loses focus or delves into a sub-plot. It feels like a journey from the start till the end, a journey through faith, isolation, despair, hope and beauty. And he makes sure you think about everyone of those as much as it's possible using his simple, yet mesmerizing camera work. His attention to detail is reflected and felt throughout the whole movie and his suitable pacing constantly commands your attention. When it comes to cinematography, Life of Pi's is nothing short of brilliant. Every frame feels like a portrait, portraying the beauty of life and nature like none I've ever seen before. Claudio Miranda's masterful use of lighting is nothing new to his career, but he definitely surpassed himself this time around. The movie is also technically stunning, its groundbreaking visual effects, tender score, smart editing and accurate sound mixing contributed in making it a more believable, more heartfelt ride.<br/><br/>My only concern with Life of Pi is its not very talented lead, Suraj Sharma. While he must be commended for losing much weight (reminding us of Tom Hanks in Castaway), his performance never rises to the movie's caliber and the level of emotional depth that it demands. He sometimes feels like the anomaly that deprives Life of Pi of being considered one of the greatest movies of all time, and instead just a great one with a not so very great lead.<br/><br/>Storytelling never gets any better than this. Life of Pi is a story about friendship, belief, self-discovery and hope...and it never draws any conclusions for you, it's all left for your own interpretation. By the end, you are left with a choice to make, a choice that may not only change the meaning of the whole story, but also your own idea of friendship, faith and the nature of humanity.<br/><br/>Simply, the best movie of the year, do yourself a favor and go watch it."

"illbebackreviews","5","1","3","7 January 2013"," 'Life of Pi' is one of the few examples of mind blowing beautiful films
","'Life of Pi' is simply one of 2012's best movies made but also one of the most emotional films ever made. Despite the premise of Life of Pi and the Hunger Games being pretty similar, Life of Pi feels like a realistic movie in which case Hunger Games doesn't.<br/><br/>Let me start off with the acting in the film. The acting by everyone in the film is outstanding. There isn't really any weak spot for the film when it came to acting. Young Pi's actor did an extremely realistic and believable performance playing the courageous adventurer whose life has been torn apart by the death of his family. Old Pi also did a great job playing the role of a now elderly man who feels like he went on an adventure. The acting is safe! Its brilliant!<br/><br/>Now, off to the best thing about this film and that is the characters in the film. The characters in this film are all lovable. They all have the touch of human-like feeling to them. They feel like people we can follow. People we can admire. Pi was a superbly entertaining protagonist. Normally, when the film is based on a small child it turns out disastrous (eg: Star Wars: Phantom Menace) but here the acting is brilliant and the character himself is extremely interesting and a person we feel for. All the other characters were fun, especially Richard Parker and the father. The characters were the greatest strength about the film.<br/><br/>Now the story is the weakest element of the movie but is written to be such a simple story with extreme emotions. The story is told as a recount which usually sparks one major issue. It removes all tension about the main character. But here, half way during the movie I actually forgot the Pi was recounting the story that happened and so the whole film, you pretty much forget that Pi survived. That takes superb directing to get it right<br/><br/>Now the film itself looks amazing! Its a visual treat to the eye and deserves to truly win ""Best Picture"" Oscar this year! The dialogue to the film is also extremely entertainingly written.<br/><br/>Now the ending of the film was something I just didn't expect. This is also where I have a minor little nitpick. When we see Richard Parker betray Pi at his most urgent need, I was heartbroken because I cared for the character and their friendship and how it grew during such difficult times. I thought that was a great little surprise and I, all the way along, expected them to end up friends or pets! My minor nit pick was when Pi was at the hospital and the two Chinese Journalists wanted a story that they could publish without humiliation. I understand it was all symbolic and it was clever in that way. But here, I feel that young Pi's acting was a little over the top and the scene just didn't seem to end. Also, for a two hour movie, I was surprised it had a 20 minute ending to it but that wasn't really an issue. The one issue is when Pi tells a different story using symbolic elements including the monkey, his mother, the zebra and the tiger. It just dragged on there and I had an issue <br/><br/>Throw aside that little nitpick I had at the end of this film about the dragging on of the symbolic story, I absolutely loved every minute of this film. Its something that rarely happens anymore! <br/><br/>9/10! Brilliant must see film at cinemas!"
"dario_malic","8","1","3","7 January 2013"," To live is to think
","The latest Ang Lee movie, ""Life of Pi"", is an adaptation of a beautiful prize-winning novel of the same name written by Yann Martel. For a long time the novel was considered to be unfilmable so Lee's work was awaited with reserve, but only to thrill almost everyone upon its release.<br/><br/>""Life of Pi"" is a story of Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi as he renamed himself. Pi grew up in Pondicherry, a little town in India, where his father ran a zoo. He was a curious boy who looked for answers beyond his father's scientific approach and embraced Hindu, Christian and Muslim religions along the way. The life was sweet in Pondicherry but unfortunately, due to financial difficulties, Pi's father had to close the zoo and the family prepared to move to Canada. They were traveling on the same boat as their animals from the zoo which were sold to western buyers when a great storm hit them. After the storm came down Pi found himself as the only human survivor, in a lifeboat with zebra, hyena, orangutan and a tiger named Richard Parker. There began his true search for God, meaning and the limits of human strength.<br/><br/>For a movie most of the time containing only one boy and a tiger to succeed, those two really had to be something special. Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, is a newcomer. A risky choice for a role so important and complex, but one that enables us to focus on the character without the distraction of a familiar face. Considering his inexperience, Sharma has done a very good job with just a few unconvincing moments. The tiger on the other hand remained flawless. It's mostly CGI with only a few scenes containing a real animal, but the CGI is incredibly lifelike and among the best I've ever seen. It gives so much depth to the tiger, making it a rounded character completely deserving of a full name.<br/><br/>The movie was filmed in 3D which is an unusual choice for a serious drama but Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda made it an indispensable part of the completed work. The cinematography is mesmerizing and its effects are greatly helped by the 3D which feels so natural you simply enjoy it without even being aware it's there. The beauty of the images emphasizes the meditative nature of the story, its plot serving only as the ground for spiritual ideas to grow.<br/><br/>The message of the movie can be interpreted in different ways. Some will say it is a religious one, but it can also be said to deny the existence of any kind of god. There's also the message about the importance of stories. The way we pick them, digest them, and the impact they have on us. Nevertheless, it's not the precise meaning Martel or Lee had in mind what's most important, but the one every person finds for oneself, for ""Life of Pi"" is one of those rare movies which are not complete without someone watching them. Therefore it has as many interpretations of the story as there are those who watched it. In that way it does two of the most important things every piece of art should do, it makes you think and it makes you discuss it. If for nothing else, it should be seen because of that.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","""Life of Pi"", directed by the Oscar winning Ang Lee, is a film, at first glance, of survival, as Pi (Suraj Sharma) attempts to live on an open-top boat in the Pacific after the ship the Tsimtsum sinks. However, it is in fact a philosophical drama about religion that only rarely becomes heavy handed.<br/><br/>Based on the Booker-prize winning 2001 novel by Yann Martel, this exploration of faith is anchored in Suraj Sharma's performance. Apart from one scene with Gérard Depardieu as the ship's cook, Adil Hussain as Pi's father, there to spout scientific platitudes about religion that fail to organically grow from his character, and Rafe Spall as a writer to give a trigger to the telling of the story, this is Sharma' film. With only a perfectly CGI-created tiger to work with, he manages to evocatively to bring out what it would be like to be stuck in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is a tour-de-force, a true feat that never falls into actor's tricks.<br/><br/>The special effects for the tiger, Richard Parker, the other member on this boat of literally lost souls, are incredible. Every hair and every sinew is present and his eyes, previously a difficult proposition in the realm of effects, make him look like a real Bengali tiger. A triumph, this construct is groundbreaking in terms of what can be achieved with a computer and surely will be capitalised on in years to come by Hollywood and its environs.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Claudio Miranda, a man who has worked on many of David Fincher's films, is ineffable and will surely with the Academy Award. Overhead visions of water, still as glass, showing us the tiny lifeboat as the sky is reflected is brilliant not just for it's beauty but also serving a story telling purpose to: not only does it shown how alone and isolated Pi is, but also immediately tells us the audience what time of day it is from the colours of the sky.<br/><br/>The 3D is well used, giving the sea an ethereal quality and a scene with flying fish demonstrates how the medium works at its best.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's direction is sensitive but he can handle the big set pieces like the sinking of the ship excellently. Being based on a book, a few novelistic things are held over and do not works completely and sometimes, early on in the film, the discussions on religion are too blunt and direct. These are minor quibbles though; this is a major achievement in filmmaking, its $120 million budget well spent and the $300 million it has made so far has been well earned, showing to Hollywood that there is an audience for superbly intelligent, contemplative movies."
"michaelglb","9","1","3","3 January 2013"," I like more about the second story
","Life of pi is such a beautiful movie that the magnificent scenery haunted my mind long after I had watched it. In addition to the scenery, the storyline is also thought provoking. Born in a non-religious family, I have got no tendency to believe in god. As a student who is particularly interest in science and chose physics as my major at college, it is especially hard for me to believe the existence of any form of god. But this movie really set me thinking. Actually I do not intend to believe the second story, which is generally claimed to be the true story of Pi. Instead, I think the first story which suggested the existence of a real tiger is more romantic and thought-provoking. In my opinion, the second story stress more about the fight between a ferocious Pi and a thoughtful Pi while the second story pay more attention to Pi's adventurous journey and amazing coincidence which proclaims the existence of god. In the mind of a science student, events in life are no more than accidental incidents, which happened predetermined by probability. However, like the story of pulp fiction, the occurrence of certain series of events that led to a romantic or miraculous ending just prompt us to believe in god. I have not seen the miraculous ending yet, but nonetheless I did experience some coherent events that happened one by one which seem to guide me to some secret places although it has not been apparent yet. After watching this movie, I feel better about my past and become more optimistic about the future. Maybe someday in the future, I will believe in something, like god."

","I firmly believe second story was the right one. The animals were the human beings and the tiger was Pi's alter ego. During the journey he mentions that it's fear that kept him being awake and let him struggle till the very end. Therefore I think the fear generated his alter ego which made him stronger on the way to survival.<br/><br/>The Island resembles his state of mind. The lotus is nothing but the memory of the subtle dance that revealed the beauty and grace of his girlfriend. He was on the verge of madness and death but it was the willingness to live that kept him going on.<br/><br/>Why didn't the tiger look back? I think that's because again the tiger was his alter ego which gradually became himself. There was no need to for the tiger to say goodbye as the tiger is he himself.<br/><br/>Overall I think it's a great movie which can be interpreted in various ways.

","Ang Lee is a capricious talent, capable of misfiring (Hulk), but when on top form there is almost no film-maker in the world today to touch him. His masterful adaptation of one of those supposedly unfilmable (pfft) novels has overcome the obvious technical challenges with possibly the best use of 3D and most realistic CGI animation yet put on screen. Such things will, in time, be surpassed; but what won't fade with the years is the virtuosic rendition in light and form of an apparently simple fable, but one shrouded in delicate layers of humanity and spirituality. <br/><br/>The central adventure and survival tale, ravishingly shot and stunningly acted by newcomer Suraj Sharma, is bookended by initially innocuous scene-setting and reminiscing sequences that gently, imperceptibly, shift the meaning from the story being told, to the meaning of the telling of the story. A sublime meditation on faith and the power of belief... with a stonking great tiger."
"squicker","7","1","3","30 December 2012"," Nice Film But Not Perfect
","By now everyone will know Life of Pi is the story of a young boy and a Bengal Tiger trapped on a small lifeboat after the sinking of their ship. Visually the film is without peer, with strong acting and well drawn characters. We are treated to some superb CGI renderings of sea and land creatures and the 3D is used to good effect. I believe Life of Pi features the best CGI rendered creatures to date and makes the likes of Avatar look like a 1980's computer game.<br/><br/>I saw Pi yesterday and I did very much enjoy it, but I can understand why some people might be disappointed. It really depends on the level of expectation you are going into the cinema with. I went in merely expecting a nice story and for me I got this. The story is driven nicely along and never becomes dull, despite long periods without dialogue or any particularly action. The story itself is so simple and enjoyable that it could be the film is best enjoyed at that level alone, but there is another level, a parable, and that worked for me too. But I was acutely aware that the symbolism and metaphors used in this level were laid on very thick and that subtlety is not Pi's middle name.<br/><br/>As an example, there is a short bit of exposition near the end and it was like being hit by a sledgehammer, talk about patronise the audience. Clearly these ham-fisted elements are designed to convey meaning to those audience members who are more at home reading picture books with big writing, but it's this side of Hollywood that detracts from films and grates on a lot of movie-goers.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is a very simple story and is very easy to decipher, there's no great reward for decoding this sort of film. And there is nothing wrong with that, sometimes the simplest stories are the best, but when the film attempts to elevate itself above its station via heavy use of symbolism or allegory, it can become self-important and even pretentious. I think Pi dallies with the former but does avoid the latter, nonetheless the heavy-handed application of these elements do detract from what is a very good film and it's quite clear the message could have been delivered far more elegantly.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, if you go into the cinema just wanting to see a good story told via the magic of cinema, you will be pleased with the Life of Pi."

We do what we are told by the ""Mad Men"" and the other purveyors of common cult-ure. <br/><br/>Do the Wise Men from the East understand our foolishness so well now that they mount their enlightenments in 3D, sfx-saturated, action- adventure epics?

Maybe there might have been a little less... I mean why are movies getting so long lately? I was completely taken in by the 2nd 'believable' monologue regarding what took place on the lifeboat, as the artistes intended, dismayed at Pi's apparent fabrications accompanied by the emotion! So when all was revealed, metaphorically, that was quite a coup. Began to appreciate the substance of his movie in one blow. nice We were wondering coming out about the tiger being Pi but Pi being there but... it makes a lot of sense, with Pi sort of ""behind"" the tiger. Especially when the tiger leaps off the boat and comes at Pi. This would be when Tigerpi considers or attempts suicide after all he's seen. nice And then I really admired that for all the talk of God, Pi denies that the ship was sunk on account of whatchacall ""an act of God"", which in this case would be the Christian thing to do, allowing the bereaved families to collect compensation? That's how I interpret it anyway. Very nice!"

","It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma is a newcomer and an underdog when it come to acting. He did very well for a first time. This cannot be said about most beginning actors or actresses. I hope he will make more movies (as an actor or director) who have a deeper meaning like Life of Pi. I don't hope for this boy to follow the footsteps of Dev Patel who acted in this wonderful Slumdog Millionair and then in this boring Aribender.<br/><br/>Verdict: It's a must see. Either if you're a fan of the book, Ang Lee's films, just want to be entertained or seek inspiration from a story beautifully told."

","I Loved this film,this film is the only production I have personally seen that can make the audience be hooked even though the majority of the film is on a row boat, it is full of mysteries, magic and passion.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film was very hooking, I adored the use of cross-cutting to tell this mans story, it was not only used to enhance the magic of the film, it was used to the best of its potential. There was also a balanced opinion on each religion portrayed it was not at all bias, Which was very pleasing. Life of Pi was a real eye-opener it made you look at the creatures in this film from a completely different point of view.<br/><br/>The scenes which you saw Pi progress ( as in growing more hair etc..) were successfully done, Pi did not look to over the top, You could really empathise with him and that was an amazing feeling. I have too admit I did in fact shed a few teardrops when Pi and his new dear friend were parted from each other, The narration played a very big part at that point, I felt that it just made it truly realistic. I put myself in his shoes and thought about what it would feel like if my Best friend had left me and never looked back, It was truly fantastic The only criticism I have is when the older Pi poses the question as to which story the author preferred, It made you question which one was true? Did Pi psychologically replace people with animals? I did not like how all your questions were answered and then suddenly more questions are posed when the film ends.<br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and it was well worth the time and money put into this. A classic has been born."
"cat_ranchero","8","1","3","29 December 2012"," Stunning!...
","First off, it looks stunning; every shot has been meticulously worked out and executed with a high degree of skill and care. The VFX are quite amazing (I have to say for the record that I watched it in 2D). For me the film is in three parts, the story of Pi before he leaves India, the story on the ocean and the story when he makes it to land. It's the middle section I found the most compelling; every time there's a cut- away from the boat I couldn't wait to get back. A very metered pace to proceedings allows the audience to become enwrapped in this tale. Ang Lee is very good at this kind of filmmaking and I have to applaud him for this particular effort. Over all, visually stunning and beautifully made; I thought the young actor Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi on the boat was truly excellent in the role. It may not be to everyone's taste (too few explosions for some I suspect), but I certainly enjoyed it – it's well worth a look.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","When I read Yann Martel's magical 2001 novel a couple of years after it was published, I was aware that there was interest in filming it, but I could not imagine how this would be done. The delay of almost a decade in bringing the story to the screen has worked to the benefit of the enterprise because, as well as attracting the directorial talents of the wonderful Ang Lee - who has made such terrific films as ""Sense And Sensibility"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" - the technology has developed so much that the combination of Lee's art and CGI science is an absolute triumph.<br/><br/>At the core of the movie is the 227 days that young Indian Pi spends aboard a life boat with only a 450lb Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker, a female orang-utan called Orange Juice, a zebra with a broken leg, and a hyena for initial company. Amazingly this part of Pi's life is represented by Suraj Sharma, who has never acted before and even had to be taught to swim, selected from more than 3,000 boys seen, and only 17 at the time of most of the filming in a vast tank of cold water in an abandoned airport in Lee's home nation of Taiwan.<br/><br/>I saw the film as Lee wants it to be seen - in 3D. I confess that I am not a fan of this format and, since the magnificent ""Avatar"", I've seen little successful use of it. However, ""Life Of Pi"" works brilliantly in 3D since it is such a surreal story."
"Ben_Horror","10","1","3","28 December 2012"," A large scale yet very intimate epic
","Based on an apparently 'unfilmable' book, Life of Pi tells the powerful story of an Indian man named Pi (after a French swimming pool but shortened to the name of the mathematical number) who recounts the tale of his epic – and fantastical – survival at sea in the company of a Tiger named 'Richard Parker' (seriously) and some assorted wild animals after their ship sinks and they are cast adrift in a lifeboat. <br/><br/>First things first: this is an absolutely incredible movie. In fact, this movie is so good, it ranks as one of the best of 2012. And if there is any justice in the world, it will garner an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director (Ang Lee), Best Actor (Suraj Sharma – young Pi), Best Supporting Actor (Irrfan Khan – adult Pi) and Best Visual Effects, but more on all these later. Heck, let's throw Best Adapted Screenplay in there too, because this is a movie so well made, it actually hearkens back to a bygone era, almost eradicating the term 'They don't make 'em like they used to'. The scope may be massive, but the movie that is so old fashioned, you could easily imagine it being released eons ago in the 1940s. <br/><br/>Ang Lee, director of the underrated 'Hulk', really deserves a lot of props here. While the easier route would have been to drastically change the story and cast an American in the lead role (stand up M. Night Shyamalan who did just this in 'The Last Airbender – subsequently angering an entire generation of Asians), Lee goes the opposite way and casts an Indian actor, or rather in this case, an Indian non-actor: Suraj Sharma - who plays Pi - had largely no acting experience prior to being cast, making the performance Ang Lee has coaxed out of him all the more extraordinary. You believe his every nuance and considering ninety-nine per cent of the time, he was probably acting with something that was not actually there, the conviction he injects into each scene is amazing. <br/><br/>There has been animosity from some quarters regarding the whole framing device of the adult Pi recounting the story to a writer, dismissing it as an unnecessary obstacle to the crux of the movie: the survival at sea. But those criticisms are wrong; the introductory scenes of the adult Pi recounting his early life in India to the writer interviewing him are a hundred per cent necessary for what eventually transpires. In fact it could be argued that these early scenes are what make the movie: they give a much needed back-story to Pi's youth: being raised at the family zoo, how he got his strange name, and his relationship with his decent - but very tough - father (a brilliant Adil Hussain), who teaches him a very harsh lesson about life and death. These scenes are riveting in themselves and serve as the icing on the cake for what's to come.<br/><br/>Strange as it may sound, the movie actually has a few things in common with a huge sci-fi movie: Avatar. Avatar looked great and the fear was we would have to wait until Avatar 2 before we would see a movie as beautiful again. Not so. Life of Pi is the first movie since Avatar to look THIS amazingly good. As with Avatar, the imagery has a fantastical element mixed in with all its sheer beauty. Furthermore, Life of Pi is also one of the first movies since Avatar to feature a CGI creation that is so photo-realistic and lifelike, that you can't actually tell which is which. The Tiger - Richard Parker – is a complex blend of real animals and computer generated ones. When it moves around on the boat, it's actually difficult to believe it's not a real Tiger – they got the weight distribution and movement so accurate, it's actually difficult to believe it's CGI. The effects company who did it deserve a lot of credit because they must have done a lot of research into the movements of Tigers to get such an accurate representation here. Let's just say Richard Parker in the Life of Pi puts Aslan the Lion in the 'Chronicles of Narnia' movies to shame. The seemingly small scale of the story somewhat underlies the evident technical wizardry that has gone on behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The movie moves fast, is very clever and intelligently executed, and always remains engrossing – despite the hefty running time. There is a very obvious religious motif that runs through the entire thing, which may irritate those who don't like being sledge hammered with spiritual doctrine. You see, much to his father's chagrin, Pi follows three religions simultaneously: Hindu, Christianity and Islam. If you came here for some fast 'put your brain in neutral' action, then you came to the wrong place, pilgrim. <br/><br/>As with Avatar, the 3D stands out as one of the better examples of the format (check out the lizard running up and flicking its tongue into camera at the opening). Refreshingly, it has been shot in 3D rather than being doctored in 3D in post-production and for the most part avoids the old hurling stuff at ya' template that has become the common, go-to practice with movies such as these. With 'Life of Pi', Ang Lee has created a modern classic. Yes, there are elements of darkness to this tale, but surely all fables have those? Simultaneously life affirming while teaching a life-lesson too, this movie will have legs. While a lot of movies come and go, some even largely forgotten, this one looks and feels like something whose life can only extend and whose fan base can only build over time – due, no doubt, in part to the fact that it will become one of those perennial favorites; those rarities that are replayed endlessly every Christmas for new generations to enjoy. Yes, it is THAT good."

","What could you expect from a film that was shot in India by a foreigner director? It's like India itself: a cauldron of contrasts! It's interesting, magical, exhilarating, maniacal, depressing and incredible - all at the same time! <br/><br/>Pi Patel, the younger son of a zoo owner, a highly intelligent and eager to know everything about God kid, survives a terrible shipwreck during a storm in the Pacific Ocean along with the Bengal Tiger! This much is enough to know to be impressed by a story-line. The visual effects are so hypnotically beautiful that audience can lose their minds! 3D just boasts computer-generated effects, especially a ferocious tiger named Richard Parker, that's truly jaw-dropping. <br/><br/>Only do not compare this film to Cameron's ""Avatar"". After watching ""Life of PI"" this entire week people keep on sharing opinions and comparing these two 3D magical films . I consider it wrong. James Cameron's idea was to grip you attention with visual effects from start to finish in ""Avatar"", and if we talk about Ang Lee, he changes what you knew about the appeal of monodramas, about water and about relatively new, fast-evolving field of computer-generated imagery, he marked those special scenes in film, even though they change it's tone...<br/><br/>""Life of PI"" is an exceptional film incredibly made, I have decided it's one of the best films of the year!"

","Could not think of anymore words to express the visual treat I had by watching this film. Made from the house of the Academy award winning Director Ang Lee the movie meets the expectations when watched in 3D (I treated myself in ""IMAX"" Hyderabad). This is a fantasy story about a boy's journey who survives a ship wreck, along with a strange companion. The whole way the story has been taken like a narration by the hero makes us feel as if we are reading a novel. ""Vazhga Tamil""(Long Live Classical Tamil)the movie started with a beautiful title score in Tamil sung Bombay Jayashree and parts of the movie even has Tamil dialogs. (Great go Tamil on world stage Thanks to the director for setting up the story on Tamil base) Coming to the casting Suraj Sharma plays the lead character Pi and done it picture perfect may it be his expressions, body language and his physique change as day's passes for him on starvation. Well done! The director has got most out of him in his first movie. The next important lead is the crouching Bengal tiger named Richard Parker simply superb creation. Coming to most seen names in the promotions of the movie i.e. Tabu and Irfan. Irfan plays the adult Pi and narrates us the story and Tabu as Pi's mother comes in an extended cameo role. The whole movie can be enjoyed with the family in good theaters and only in 3D because 2D would not be as satisfying as this movie is meant for that technology. Verdict: A true 3D visual extravaganza of the year. A Must watch entertainer.<br/><br/>-Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran(bsiva84@gmail.com)"
"naveenrajeev","7","1","3","29 November 2012"," A delicious Indian Pi
","A boy and a tiger in a stranded boat. Hmm...Now how interesting can that be. <br/><br/>Everything . Every damn thing. For the naive, the title is just too timid to fool you to think of another story of a stranded guy (if anyone told you that already), as sooner you realize the scenes and the walls around you take a life of spellbinding artistic imagery and spectacular scenery of an Indian boys amazing adventure of self realization.<br/><br/>As colorful as the nation he comes from, Pi's life is injected with the faiths of all the major religions. Set in sun soaked Pondicherry vividly portrayed basking in colonial inspired lifestyle and architecture, Pi realizes early in life from his mother the playful antics of the Lord Krishna and tribulations, from a Priest, of the Son of God; to praying to Allah, all at once, to the disdain of his rational zoo owner Father. <br/><br/>Armed with the self knowledge that there is a soul in every living being, Pi is put to a horrendous test of faith when he loses all that holds dear to him and tragedy strikes on his exodus family, as he leaves behind an innocent love story on Indian shores. In midst of the ship wrecking storm (superbly done in 3D), a cue is put forth to the audience when Pi shouts out ""who let the animals out"" which has surprising revelations at the end.<br/><br/>And thence the stage is set for the ordeal, fear, bitter struggle of life and death between a tiger and a 17 year old boy. <br/><br/>It dawns up on Pi that it's in God's creation the tigers and its like are carnivorous, with no fault of their own. To avoid being the next bait to a hungry Bengal Tiger, Pi takes the life of a fish to feed it. His agony of snuffing out another life (being a pure Hindu vegetarian himself) is taken by Pi as one of God's many tests. Magnificently portrayed in luminescent and glowing waters of the Pacific, Ang Lee shows one bigger species usurped by a far bigger one in a never ending cycle of life and death that we are all enslaved to. Animals are not categorized as animals but given a distinct name, and we, well, just happened to be higher in the food chain due to power of reasoning. Pi, the Indian boy with a French name and Richard Parker a Bengal tiger christened after his English capturer, are no different - reflections of oneself in the other, as Pi puts it. But the ending comes as a whimper, like a balloon inflated to the hilt just squeaks away with dead flat climax that I thought initially was a rude joke until everyone around me went dead serious. :S<br/><br/>There is no need for a note on Irfan Khans acting. He is so much at ease with his Hollywood stars and Tabu played the perfect mother. What was indeed as spectacular to watch was this boy who did a great job for a newbie. <br/><br/>Its been ages since India has been told with so much positive vibes.It could be karma or his Asian lineage that this movie had to go through the rejections of 3 directors before Ang Lee tamed it. The canvas was Ang Lee's for the taking. Brush strokes of far reaching clouds and still blue soaked ocean coming to life with flying fishes; it wouldn't be surprising if he just walks away with the golden statuette in the coming months. <br/><br/>All said and done, this is an experience not to be missed in 3D (which I'm usually not a big fan of) bringing to life fascinating islands you wont find in an Attenborough video and the species of the abyss James Cameroon can only dream to see, that makes it a humbling experience - Life of Pi portrays the antics of God's beings and His never ending mavericks of the cosmos. <br/><br/>At the end we, just by accident, will end up believing an incredulously told story."
"akash_sebastian","8","1","3","27 November 2012"," Soul-Enriching and Visually-Stunning Cinematic Masterpiece!
","Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' is a soul-enriching and visually-stunning Cinematic Masterpiece. It's a consistently riveting coming-of-age tale of a meek and young Indian boy nicknamed 'Pi', who's a zoo-keeper's son. It's a story about hope, faith, survival and companionship. <br/><br/>A castaway's epic journey through the Pacific, where he forms an unlikely but striking connection with a fearsome Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. On his spellbinding journey, Pi comes across so many beautiful beings of nature, which makes you wonder - if you've seen anything at all, in the world yet. It makes you understand why Pi would believe in God, sacrificer of innocents, examiner of souls and creator of magnificent beauty.<br/><br/>Ang Lee still holds his place in the top league of directors. Claudio Miranda's spectacular camera-work, combined with Mychael Danna's intoxicating score, takes you to Yann Martel's paradise. Suraj Sharma, the lead protagonist, is brilliant in his performance. He exquisitely conveys every feeling of Pi, from hopelessness to euphoria, with his wide foray of facial expressions. Irrfan Khan, Tabu and Adil Hussain form an elegant and talented supporting cast. Irrfan Khan is perfect as the narrator and Adult Pi Patel.<br/><br/>There are a few moments and dialogues, which remain etched in your memory long after the movie is over. My favourite two moments would be: (No Spoilers!) 1> The moment 'after' both, Pi and Richard, reach the Mexican Coast. 2> When Pi asks ""I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer?"". The writer answers. After this, Pi says something which blows your mind completely.<br/><br/>Final Word: Ang Lee's 3D adaptation of a supposedly ""unfilmable"" novel achieves the near impossible. It's an astonishing feat in technical achievement and powerful storytelling which, in end, is quite emotionally rewarding. It's a film for all ages. Don't miss it for the world!"

This Simple Boys story stirs the Writers mind and clears the cloak of atheism into the Beautiful world of God. The Director has portrayed the Beautiful creatures of Nature in every Scene with utmost perfection with no exaggerated Pictures. The Movie adds a Laugh and drives the audience from their into a relaxed world with few Light moments between the Tiger and the Boy The Link between the Tiger and the Boy is bonded into a picture of sentimental value and the Director has used that point and has gained the Tears of all the Audience when the Boy and the Tiger separate. The Movie basically starts in the Future, where the History is pointed out to bring out a valuable Gesture and an important thought.

"patrickwigington","10","1","3","26 November 2012"," The Beautiful Beast
","Too bad more movies aren't like this. From the very beginning, Life of Pi thrusts its viewers into a world of wonder, and onward to the realm of the fantastic. Ang Lee delivers a heartfelt and miraculous adaptation of the book by Yann Martel.<br/><br/>The story is of a young boy named Pi, who lives with his family in India. His father is a zookeeper, and Pi is close to the animals. Pi lives out his childhood by exploring the marvelous world around him, and as he gets older he tries to become more connected to God. He does this by exploring practically every religion at once, much to the disapproval of his father. When Pi is 16 the family decides to make a new life for themselves in Canada, so they get on a ship along with all the animals they intend to sell once they get to the New World. However, on the way the ship crashes and sinks. Pi is the lone survivor and is stuck in the middle of the ocean on a life boat with a rather large Bengal Tiger.<br/><br/>What follows is a fantastic tale of survival on the open sea. Ang Lee directs the film with stunning clarity and beauty. He creates a world that is marvelous to behold, and sequences that are absolutely breathtaking. The shipwreck sequence is particularly astounding to take in. Lee also creates a wonderful dynamic between Pi and the Tiger, as the boy struggles to survive and not be eaten by the beast. Lee's style is magical, and the world he shows us is full of mystery, beauty, and danger.<br/><br/>The Tiger is computer animated, and maybe mixed in with some real tiger or puppetry. At any rate, the face is all computer, but that is barely noticeable. The Tiger gives a great amount of emotion and depth to the movie. The Tiger may be artificial, but he is so real within the story that it doesn't matter. Whether this relates to the entirety of the movie, you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The acting is, needless to say, as amazing as the rest of the movie. Suraj Sharma plays Pi for the majority of the film as a 16 year old. Sharma gives a brutal and honest performance as the young man fighting for his life. Pi's family is wonderfully portrayed, especially by Adil Hussain, who plays the boys harsh but loving father.<br/><br/>The music by Michael Danna is quintessential to the movie. Danna brings to life the adventure and fantastical elements of the movie. The score really highlights the beauty of the movie; and along with cinematography by Claudio Miranda, it helps to create an overwhelmingly marvelous movie.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is an exceptional movie. Ang Lee and company bring the art of filmmaking to its highest potential, and create a true masterpiece of art. The movie explores themes of survival, God, and humanity all at once to make the singe best movie of the year so far.<br/><br/>thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"

","I am not completely sure what to think of Life of Pi. Certainly, the majority of my thoughts equal a thumbs up. But when all said and done, it seemed...hard to pin down.<br/><br/>Pros: Almost everything; Directing, writing, casting, acting, music, cinematography, and most especially incredible, unique visual imagery and artistically gratifying use of 3D.<br/><br/>Cons: There is long one shot scene near the end that felt like it scrubbed a lot of the story's momentum, and put more questions in my mind as to what was really supposed to have been going on. That may be the intended effect, but I found it more confusing than intriguing or thought-provoking. Also, like several other films that I have seen this year, the ""main idea"" is not nearly as well fleshed-out as it aims to be. What is this story really about?<br/><br/>Overall: Life of Pi contains some of the most gorgeous, overwhelmingly magical, otherworldy visuals that I have ever seen, and it is the first time that I have enjoyed watching a film with 3D glasses on. (All others that I have seen in 3D, which granted did not include Avatar, struck me as cheap, artistically bankrupt gimmicks - but not this one.) It is worth the price of admission for that alone. And there are plenty of other reasons to see it, which I will not spoil. Ang Lee is, for my money, one of the best directors out there, and this film most definitely does not fall into any ""lowest common denominator"" category. It is something special.<br/><br/>Is it a masterpiece as a whole? I am not willing to go quite that far. Avatar has a more concise story, and that counts a great deal to me. However, Life of Pi is arguably the more genuinely intriguing of the two. I would recommend it."

His father was right as the kid, again inexplicably, studies comic books of Hindu's 30 million gods, then drinks the holy water (literally on a dare) and comes to Jesus, and then walks by a mosque and gets into Allah. <br/><br/>After the family decides to take a ship to Canada and sell the zoo animals they own on their zoo, for some unexplained reason the ship sinks in a storm -- and it wasn't a perfect storm.

","The film's protagonist is shipwrecked on a boat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker for 227 days at sea. The tiger eats everyone but him. At the end of the film gives the viewer a chance to understand that each animal was one of the crew of the ship that also tried to save the boat, and at the beginning of the film it became clear that he had failed to save anyone. So much of the film is wasted with beautiful surreal scenes.

","My expectations were up. The preview showed some computer graphics that were some of the best I've ever seen. I had hoped that this film would be a redemption for the fiasco that was, ""Avatar: The Last Air Bender,"" in terms of Hollywood having the integrity to cast an Indian fantastic story with an Indian protagonist complete with huge budget and high production value. As the lights went down, coming attractions past, I saw I was in for a long ride within the first two minutes of the film, as the story would be told to an American novelist in Canada, begging for a good story to write about after living in India for two years, ""Because India is cheaper than Spain,"" while writing a novel set in Spain that he threw away. Already, my attention is being diverted from where it really belongs... this amazing story that on it's own is full of beauty and majesty, but cut short too many times to get a soggy corn flakes response from the American writer, played forgettably by Rafe Spall. I was wondering why Ang Lee felt the need to leave this spectacular story of mythic proportions about a shipwrecked boy, played very strongly by Suraj Sharma, surviving with a Bengali Tiger to this retelling motif as if the story needed to be validated by the American writer, to be worthy of the telling? This is a film I would love to reedit and can the whole present day part of the film, and stay with the journey of Pi... which is really beautiful. As it's an adaption of the book by Spanish writer Yann Martel, it would have been much better as a film loosely based on the novel, with a different ending and different approach to the story telling all together, in my humble opinion. I'm left wondering when the big Hollywood Studios like 20th Century Fox will have some courage that audiences have enough emotional intelligence to have a visceral connection with protagonists that are of a different race, different age, different language, different culture... think about how black folks love Kung Fu theater movies, Jamaicans loved westerns for years, and white American males have always been the largest consumers of Black Gangster Rap, and Hip Hop in general when it comes to buying the albums. So Hollywood, go ahead, get some courage to tell stories that maintain integrity to the cultures they take place in... folks will still come out and consume the product, and you won't leave so many disgruntled folks who gag on your outsider point of entry characters who do nothing to enhance the telling of the stories! Be Brave!!!!!!!"

","I've had a positive opinion of Ang Lee in the past. But having seen this movie, I think his stature and the state of the financial world is ruining him. The best movie of his I've seen was Eat, Drink, Man,Woman. I found that truly original and accessible. This movie seems more influenced by things like Thor and The Avengers. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much use of special effects. Plus, the storyline is way too much like The Namesake. Both movies have Irrfan Khan telling a story, including an explanation of the name. Gogol or Pi. Tabu was the main female character in both. Both protagonists end up in North America. Mira Nair told the story of The Namesake in the same way that Ang Lee told the story of Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, very personally and with some subtlety. I really prefer Mira Nair to tell Indian stories. I even prefer Danny Boyle. Ang Lee is, at best, third. He approaches it with the awkwardness of a foreigner.<br/><br/>Slumdog Millionaire and The Namesake didn't burst like sensations on the movie scene. But once word of mouth got around, they ran for months and months. I am skeptical that Life of Pi has that kind of legs."

","From Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain), I saw the trailer and reviews for this film, most said it was a films that you had to see in 3D, so I went to see it in the hope it would be worth it. Basically a Writer (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son) has been told that immigrant Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Irrfan Khan) from Pondicherry, India, now living in Montreal, Canada, has an amazing story to tell, and he is keen to hear it for his next book, and it starts by explaining that he was named after a swimming pool, Piscine Molitar, his first name being pronounced ""pissing"", so he changed it to Pi, like the maths term. In flashback, we see his family owned a zoo, five year old Pi (Gautam Belur) gained an interest in animals, especially Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger named due to a clerical error, he even puts himself in danger trying to feed it, his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) forcing him to watch it kill a goat to show its carnivorous nature. Twelve year old Pi (Ayush Tandon) is raised Hindu and vegetarian, but he finds interest in the Christian and Islam religions as well, he follows all three at once, and later in life he would lecture in Kabbalah at university. Aged sixteen Pi (Orange Rising Star Award nominated Suraj Sharma) is devastated when the family closing the zoo to move to Canada, meaning the animals will be sold, so they all board a Japanese freighter called Tsimtsum, with a rude cook (Gérard Depardieu) on board. One night the ship encounters a heavy storm, causing it to sink, Pi tries to find his family, but he is thrown into a lifeboat by the crew, all he can do is watch the ship go down with the crew and his family drowning. Alone in the middle of the ocean he is joined by an injured zebra and an orangutan, but he gets a shock from a spotted hyena who jumps out and kills the zebra and mortally wounds the orangutan, but the real shock is Richard Parker jumping out and killing the hyena. To keep himself safe from the tiger Pi finds food rations and builds himself a smaller raft to float a safe distance next to the lifeboat, and he feeds the tiger caught fish to protect himself from the animal, and he collects rain water for both of them to drink, and he shows compassion putting a ladder on the lifeboat to help the tiger out of the ocean when it jumps in. One night a large whale comes out of the water, and it causes many of the supplies to disappear, and starving he can only eat raw fish, and he realises to survive he should be able to get in the boat with the tiger, so over time he trains Richard Parker to let him in, and he finds that helping the tiger is keeping him alive. Near the point of exhaustion and with hardly any strength the lifeboat drifts during the night onto a floating island with a forest, edible plants, fresh water pools and hundreds of meerkats, so Pi and the tiger can regain their strength, but time passes and water turns acidic killing the fish, and he finds the plants are carnivorous, so collecting supplies they leave the island. After a long time at the sea the lifeboat finally reaches land, the coast of Mexico, Pi crawls onto land and rests on the sand, and he sees tiger Richard Parker walking towards the jungle and briefly stopping, he expects it to look back and acknowledge him, but he eventually walks through and is never seen again, while Pi is rescued by people who take him to hospital, he weeps because of the tiger leaving him. In hospital the sinking of the freighter is causing concern for some insurance agents, and they want to hear the account from the only known survivor, he tells the story he has which they do not believe, so then he fabricates a tale that is less fantastic but believable that he was in the lifeboat with his mother, a sailor with a broken leg, and the cook. In present day the Writer is asked by adult Pi which story he believes and prefers, he finds the parallels in the story that he concocted for the insurance guys, and he answers that he finds the story with the tiger much more incredible, 227 days at sea was a remarkable feat, and he is allowed to take this story to use for a novel. Also starring Tabu as Gita Patel, Andrea Di Stefano as the Priest and Shravanthi Sainath as Anandi. Newcomer Sharma gives a very endearing performance as the young man struggling against the odds to survive, computer animated tiger Richard Parker is a convincing character because he is so realistic looking, I completely agree that this has to be seen in 3D, for the appearance of the tiger, the exciting sequences with storms, whales and underwater moments, you could argue it is similar to Cast Away, but on a boat, and there should be a little more plot, but it has the moments of tension, you sympathise with the characters, and it really feels like a journey to watch, a great fun adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Mychael Danna and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Song for ""Pi's Lullaby"", Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Cinematography and Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Film, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Original Music, Production Design and Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama.

Pi grows up in India where his parents own a zoo. He is teased at school due to his name but he is smart and aims for the attractive girl in the music class for which he plays an instrument. When his father receives possible job opportunities in Canada they load up some of the animals for sale and set sail via ship but a nasty storm hits.

When hunger takes effect the hyena kills the zebra and later on the orangutan but is demolished in return by the first appearance of the tiger. Central plot regards Pi struggling to adapt to living with this tiger and the fascinating adventure they endure, which he narrates now in his fifties to a writer who takes in every spoken word with great interest. Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi narrating his experience, while Suraj Sharma plays the younger Pi who uses every possible resource to survive and co-exist with a tiger. Adil Hussain plays his strict yet resourceful father who questions Pi's introduction to Christianity. Rafe Spall plays the writer who is asked ""which"" story he prefers.

","Director Ang Lee adapts the interesting Yann Martel novel. Considering all the big name directors previously attached to the project, he does an admirable job bringing this unfilmable movie to the big screen.<br/><br/>Pi Patel lives his childhood in Pondicherry, India with his zoo owning family. Eventually they had to sell their animals to the west, and move to Canada. They travel on a Japanese freighter with the animals. The ship sinks and Pi gets to a lifeboat with a menagerie of animals including a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Much has been said of the great CG animals. I don't need to add more to that. The lifeboat scenes look great. Ang Lee has filmed the unfilmable. I do wish the island be more otherworldly to clue in the unrealism of the story. And the island had a more religious overtone in the book which is missing here.<br/><br/>I also wish they filmed the real lifeboat with the people characters. A visual depiction would be much more dramatic. The violence could be cut out if they needed to keep the PG rating. In fact the ratings might be why they decided to reduce that section to a simple narration."
"Michael Kenmore","10","1","4","1 June 2013"," The best picture of 2012. Maybe one of the best movies I've ever seen.
","This comment should be prefaced, even though the given rating is a ten, with a strong reservation of mine about the minor element within the movie that is racially offensive, concerning the perpetration of a certain European stereotype. This film would be perfect without the unnecessarily implicit derogation, even though I have not read the book that is the subject of the adaptation.<br/><br/>Putting aside the complaint, Life of Pi, considering the totality of the story and visuals with everyone involved in the development and making of the movie, is a rare masterpiece. It is hard for me to explain why this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, this film inspired the range of emotions from mild amusement to incredulity to awe to empathetic introspection and, finally, ultimately moving.<br/><br/>The heart is the right place to tell the story in the adaptation of Yann Martel's fiction book, said to be unfilmable. This comes from the uncommonly professional direction by Ang Lee, who is unlike any other established filmmaker in terms of top-notch filmmaking expertise. (Except for his flat-out mediocre The Hulk, which should be forgotten as an embarrassing point of Lee's otherwise near-impeccable directing career.) The way Ang Lee expertly handled the adaptation with deft and superbly professional-caliber direction, without an iota of saccharinity and occasional sensationalism seen in the other established movie directors' movies (such as the shakily-shot and slightly overacted scenes to indicate tension and violence, which itself is a common cliché), from the beginning to the end, with the gentle guidance is astonishing in merit.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's gentle yet powerful in slow-burn sentimentality (the intended word was originally meaningful as the guide towards truth, until it carries the presently negative connotation; therefore, I meant the word only in the positive context as it was formerly intended) direction may remind of Terrence Malick's past and better films before The Tree of Life with similar subliminally emotive qualities combined with the majestic beauty of nature and humanistic storytelling.<br/><br/>I cannot explain precisely what the movie is really about, because deconstructing the movie is unnecessary, not to mention losing the meaning of the story. However, one thing is certain of the movie: it speaks to the humanity in us all, the attentive moviegoers.<br/><br/>The compassionate and superlative direction by Mr. Lee, who came from Taiwan in humble beginnings to become the master contemporary filmmaker, is incredible that stun some moviegoers to the speechless state with the misty eyes and mind blown at the visual-aural spectacle that seamlessly merge the uncommonly human storytelling.<br/><br/>There are some indescribable scenes that enlighten, move and astonish, assisted by the magical fusion of VFX and cinematography. This is why we go to the movies, as the participants in the filmmakers' vision that conveys the rare sentimentality, without a care for cynicism that pervade this rapidly changing world.<br/><br/>The team effort that made this film, with Oscar-winning visual effects (the sadly bankrupted and bought-out in auction VFX house Rhythm & Hues), musical score and cinematography, has produced the uncommon (that is, a deliberately mature movie yet is not offensive with strong or moderate content such as sensationalistic violence, casual nudity, and profanity & vulgarity, with the rare PG rating assigned to non-childish movies) masterpiece in the 21st century cinema, outside the typical and frequently cynical art-house fare.<br/><br/>Considering the uncommonly amazing quality of the movie, Ang Lee deserves his second Oscar for Best Direction. Because, above all, he has guided Life of Pi to the full spectrum of narrative cinema richness, like the rarely scrumptious fine dining produced by the master chef and the entourage of sous chef, prep cook, and pastry chef, and has respectfully given the gift to the audience to partake in the visual-aural feast.<br/><br/>Being a stone-hearted cynic, Life of Pi speaks to the humanity in me, and this moved me immeasurably, without resistance.<br/><br/>I regret that I skipped the movie because of the teaser trailer with the cheesy-looking CGI tiger shown before the movie Prometheus in 3-D format. I was mystified how long The Life of Pi remained in theatres in the first-run theatres even after the home video release.<br/><br/>Then I rented the movie on Blu-ray from Redbox, after feeling bored over the weekend, searching for a movie that doesn't look like sleazy Hollywood and direct-to-video trash.<br/><br/>One phrase should stand by that one cannot judge the cover of the book. I judged the teaser trailer and waited until home video for my discovery that unlock the fantastical world of cinema.<br/><br/>Henceforth, Life of Pi is a masterpiece, yet to be discovered by more people as the word of mouth spread how incredible the movie is. A hard-weathered cynic who says he is not touched by the movie occasionally and at the end will always have the heart of stone."

Many a time with films, the books are almost always better, but this film Im pretty sure is as great as the book. Not to mention all the award nominations and awards it did win. This movie actually made me tear up and smile and think that when the worst comes there will always be hope in different forms and that you can't just assume something without trying and without fair trail.

A watering down of deep convictions and hopeful beliefs. The message here is not well grounded and is left floating about meandering every which way and is so heavy handed that it can be a detriment to its own determined thesis. <br/><br/>Undeniably stunning at times it is the disjointed editing and the completely cop out ending coupled with the thick Theology that keeps this from being completely successful in the way of The Way. <br/><br/>There is simply so much shallowness to the Script that it is barely saved by the expanse and the exciting vistas.

Personally, I didn't find the movie in itself that interesting and could have been told through a short film. The story is very tame, but certainly had the potential to actually be interesting. With that said the cinematography and soundtrack is what carries this entire movie. Every single scene in this movie is visually breath taking and makes me think of James Cameron's Avatar. Just like Avatar it demonstrates what happens when you have an unoriginal manuscript but an overambitious director, skilled cinematographer, and truck loads of CGI. If the movie had had more substance to it and wasn't just a display of modern technology it might have actually won the Academy Award for best motion picture."
"wodesan","6","1","4","26 February 2013"," It was a good movie but let's keep it 100.......
","Do I really have to reiterate the plot? If you don't know the Life of Pi is about a young boy stranded at sea with a Bengal Tiger, then I want to know what rock you've been sleeping under and how long. But seriously, that's pretty much what the movie is about. The movie also chronicles the life a young boy named Pi from his early childhood up until and after the ordeal.<br/><br/>Let me start off by stating the visuals are excellent. I saw this movie in 3D (as if there's any other way to see it) and I think the composers did a masterful job creating a dynamic of animals and humans with the same feelings and facial expressions. The movie utilized awesome 3D visual effects to put you smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but intriguing. There is something about the idea of being stranded in the middle of the ocean that awes the public. Add in the fact that your stranded with a wild animal is even more fun. The film focuses on the struggle of human survival in addition to spiritual enlightenment.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking. ""If the movie had all these good things, why did you rate it a 6?"" That's a good question, so I'll give you my reasons. After about 40 minutes into the movie I began to wonder where all this was going. The movie seemed to drag on and on with little indication there was any meaning to it all. You go through about an hour and a half of fishing, sea storms and animal taming. It was like Cast Away on the Pacific Ocean. The offshore adventure was fun until about 45 minutes. After that, the film just seemed to drag on with one futile triumph after another.<br/><br/>There were religious and faith-based references throughout the movie, and the narrator made it clear there would be some type of revelation at the conclusion; leaving you with an anticipation of an prophetic event or climax. However, the film never really delivered. As weird as it sounds, there was nothing much out of the ordinary that happened in this story from any other story about a boy stranded in the sea with a wild tiger. The fact that he was stranded at sea with a wild tiger was what was out of the ordinary. Get me? I came into the movie expecting to be taken on an epic journey that left me with some great revelation. Instead, it was like watching an extended HD documentary on the discovery channel concluding with a dubious spiritual message. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. I mean, I like watching the Discovery Channel. As I mentioned before, the movie had great visuals and an interesting plot. I just don't think it lived up to all the hype and had the phenomenal effect so many people claimed it to have. To each his own though."

","I went to see this with a friend after reading half the book. I hadn't intended on seeing it before I'd finished the book, but I don't regret seeing it at all. Firstly, the acting is pure class. Pi, the main character, brings pure emotion into his acting...he made me feel happy and sad and whatever. I don't like seeing animals dying, but there was nothing too disturbing nor brutal, though highly emotional when Orange Juice died and the zebra's suffering. The story, as it is expressed in the book, is meant to make you believe in God. Coming from an ex-atheist, I would now say, yes, I fully believe in God. The film was so powerful. It brought out every emotion in me -- I felt like crying; then a few minutes later I felt like bursting into fits of hysterical laughter! Overall a must-see for everyone, aged from around 8 up."

Picture, colors, characters, all fit in just perfect.<br/><br/>But the overall result is just that bit too slick to make you care.<br/><br/>Emotionally the main character is more or less remote. Yes, he shows some grieve about loosing his family. And he is in despair, at times. But only to an easily bearable extend. If the audience would be confronted with the full force of his emotions, the story would not be nice or lovely after all.<br/><br/>The same happens intellectually. A portion of the film deals with man, god, believe. And yes, the main character has a lot of reason to doubt god. But again, this doubt is not going too far. It just scratches the issue, so everything remains easy. Nothing too serious here. So it has hardly any meaning.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is nice to watch, but do not expect something with real substance.<br/><br/>By the way: This movie will work in 2D as well.

","This is my first ever review.<br/><br/>I didn't go into the cinema expecting a great deal from this film as it was actually the girlfriend who wanted to see it. The trailers looked all nice and that but it didn't give a whole lot of details as to what I was going to be watching. But I actually enjoyed it a great deal! It didn't start too exciting, just a writer looking for a new story having been told that this older Pi had one to tell. So it starts as reminiscing of his childhood, learning of different religions and generally experiencing life etc... at this point I was thinking she'd pulled a fast one telling me I'd love the film, it looks great...<br/><br/>But it did get better. I won't go into too much detail as I can't stand people who, accidentally or not, summarise a film to somebody who hasn't seen it. I feel, personally, this film is about imagery, though some might say it's about metaphor. Maybe in the book you're supposed to read in-between the lines, (which I haven't read, BTW) but I feel the film is simpler than that, and just wants to show you the fantasy in reality. The entire film is a work of beauty. Even the simplest of things is captured in a way to stun the audience. Be it a night sea lit up by thousands of jellyfish, or a simple, yet frightening storm throwing pi and Richard Parker - the Bengal tiger - from bow to stern was cinematic-ally, a truly breath-taking experience.<br/><br/>I think this film is a breathe of fresh air in cinema as of late, you can leave feeling that you've seen something relatively different for a change. Not just a remake/reboot of something milked to the teeth (though I don't have a problem with those kinds of film, it's just nice seeing something new).<br/><br/>I saw this film a few days after seeing the hobbit, and can honestly say I've thought about this film more in the days after. I'll leave that to you to ponder what that means regarding the impact of the 2 films."

","Widely publicized as a spectacular, visionary project with a spiritual touch, Life Of Pi was eagerly awaited by both the appreciators of meaningful cinema and the lovers of realistic 3D technique together. Also promoted as the most astonishing visual achievement after Avatar, the makers were successful in putting many innovative ideas in the mind of the enthusiastic viewers waiting to be shocked and amazed by some unbelievable kind of content as shown in its promos.<br/><br/>However, the film makes a mixed kind of impact as it ends wherein the creative team perfectly fulfills the main aspect of their promises made regarding the superior technicality of the product. But at the same time the film is not able to cater the spiritual or emotional aspect of its storyline that impressively. Adapted from Yann Martel's novel, its unarguably a superb visual experience without any doubt. The execution of its unimaginable plot and sequences through a fresh colourful palette on the screen surely transports the viewer into a different fantasy world in its two hours of duration as a novel experience. So if you are willing to see an eye catching extravaganza supported by some outstanding hard to believe computer graphics, then you would love watching Life Of Pi a lot.<br/><br/>But in case you are expecting an emotionally moving spiritual experience talking about a rare journey in the sea lived by a young boy and a tiger together then you may find it a lot less appealing than promised. Enacted well by Suraj, Irrfan Khan (ignoring his accent), Tabu and Adil Hussain, along with a graphically created incredible Bengal Tiger it's a difficult film directed by Ang Lee and remains a stunning treat for your eyes throughout as far as its cinematography, under-water takes, frames, sound, treatment and execution is concerned.<br/><br/>Yet Life Of Pi cannot be rated as a movie with a highly emotional quotient giving you some enlightening insights of a divine existence around us through its fictional characters. The few initial moments of the film devoted to the discovery of various religions by Pi fall flat without any clear vision and the same can be said about the questions raised on the subject of Life, Death and Faith in its various tense moments. <br/><br/>To conclude Life Of Pi is surely a life time achievement by director Ang Lee if one only considers its unique, never before kind of visual impact alone. But honestly I couldn't feel any human heartfelt touch in it and couldn't applaud it whole heartedly as I was willing to."

","I have not worn 3D glasses since watching Bwana Devil in the early 50's. It was a surprise to discover that the process has been improved upon. The clumsy paper frame with two plastic lenses, one red and one green as I recall, have given way to what might pass for ordinary sunglasses, and the screen effect is quite satisfying.<br/><br/>I also liked the superb animation in this film. I have no idea at all how it was achieved, having not yet bothered to read other people's reviews. Not only are the various animals made to act in a certain manner consistent with the story line, the visual images seem uncannily true to life.<br/><br/>That said, I found the conclusion of the narrative ever so slightly sententious and disingenuous, suggesting two possible interpretations the viewer might entertain. What had been up to that point an exciting and colorful tour de force became instantly pallid. For what it's worth, I chose the allegorical version.<br/><br/>As a frequent traveler on cruise ships that offer on-board cinemas, I can confidently say this film will never be shown there. My physical response to the maritime scenes even knowing I was actually surrounded by desert bordered on nausea."

"supreeta-arya","9","1","4","9 December 2012"," A visual and spiritual treat
","Yann Martel's Life of Pi, a Man Booker Prize winner is no doubt an enchanting read..I would never have imagined it coming to life on screen, but Director Ang Lee achieves the unachievable. If you thought Crouching tiger..was exceptional, Life of Pi is even more so...the story of sixteen year old Pi who survives a shipwreck and his unending adventure in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat  with a Royal Bengal tiger for companyfor 227 days before he reaches the shores of Mexico. No.the tiger is not a speaking one like the benevolent lion Aslan in Chronicles of Narniait is wild and ferocious  also a survivor in the shipwreck ..while being transported from India to the Americasso then what happenssee it in the Life of Pi  an immensely watchableactually a must watch film in recent timesof an exceptional quality as was Avatar. <br/><br/>What's so great about thisanother fantasy?....yes and no.Life of Pi is a story intended to make you believe in God and his marvelous plan.with layers and layers of revelationsthe script is unbeatable and together with Ang lee's vivid imagery , cinematography and sensitivity .a spiritual and visual masterpiece. Cynics would like to dismiss it as a naive quest for spiritual fulfillment, but understanding Life of Pi necessitates a certain kind of awareness and sensitivity. <br/><br/>The movie opens to the tunes of a soulful lullaby sung in Tamil while the camera in slow motion scans the zoo ... owned by Pi's family  the start of a vivid narration of Pi's childhood captured so lovingly bringing a magical quality to the mundane. The unpretentiousness of the cast and characters is heartening. Ang Lee's brief but unprejudiced and accurate portrayal of a foreign cultureis laudable <br/><br/>The amazing part of the movie though begins after the shipwreckhow Pi survives the journey, while taking care of the needs of a full grown royal Bengal tiger while needing to save himselfthe revelations that he has, his resourcefulness , courage and spirit Ang Lee's direction and Suraj Sharma's ( young Pi's) earnestness bring conviction to Yann Martel's absurdly magical story as perfectly plausible.the unbelievably real looking tiger ( named Richard Parker! ) is actually digital the oceanic scenes are unadulterated pleasure to behold. The script is designed to make you take stock of your own life, while Pi stumbles on major revelations when Pi decides not to be scared of Richard Parker, but to learn to communicate with him as he decides to train him while battling and surviving in the stormy Pacific. Particularly poignant when he utters the words.. "" Oh God I give myself to you. I am your vesselWhatever comes I want to knowshow me"" Ultimately beyond our skepticism and smartness, we need to have faith and let gowith that comes a new found courage and confidence that ferries us beyond the shores of uncertainty and the unknown. <br/><br/>Irfan Khan as the adult Pi and Tabu as the mother of young Pi are effortless actors, the young Pi played by Ayush Tandon is marked by heart tugging earnestness, and Suraj Sharma the lead Pi, chosen for his personality and ""soulful eyes"" ( Ang Lee in his interview) , does mesmerize you with his performance. So even without any fancy hallowed Hollywood actors, Ang Lee churns out an unexpected treat... the sort that churns you deep within. The last lament of Pi is that Richard Parker , the tiger leaves him at the shores of Mexico without a proper goodbye( maybe too much to expect of a tiger) but it is to remind us of the importance of proper goodbyes in our lives and maybe not to expect when we do not receive them."

One of which is a tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>This movie was very emotionally and visually compelling.

","Brilliant..It is one of the words that can be used to describe this movie. I walked into this movie with a certain picture in my head,as to how this might turn out to be. I was wrong about it. Scenes from movies like Cast Away,were flashing through my brain. This is not 1 of those movies. Sure,the Basic plot is the same (virtually),that of a ship wreck and of survival. But the presentation was different by light-years. I would say that the story is pretty much,above average. But the direction,acting and visual effects more than makes up for it. I compliment the direction and acting for some of the heart touching scenes of this movie. It was not at all over done(Considering the fact that,there was a scope to explore the boy-tiger relationship). The pace of the movie was also,excellent. Without too much delay,we get to the meat of the story. But,the most important aspect of this movie is its the visual magnificence. Some of the scenes of this movie can make you believe that you are watching a James Cameroon flick. The 3-D effects are equally beautiful. All in all,a beautiful movie"

","The plot opens with many interesting branch stories such as the naming of Pi ( the hero) and Richard Parker ( the Bengal tiger). It explores Pi's yearning to learn about multiple religions and their shared thoughts. His child like curiosity to befriend the tiger and a rude lesson on animal behavior from his dad. It is a fast paced narration that makes the audience sit tight and enjoy the first half of the movie well.<br/><br/>The story then moves on to a ship wreck in a storm and Pi and Parker being stranded in a boat for many months. Pi realizes the rules of survival in animal world as defining one's territory and establishing a means of communication. This approach helps him to coexist with the tiger in high and rough seas albeit with trepidation. They part company once they find a shore but Pi is left with a bitter feeling that Parker didn't show any emotion while parting! Suffice to say that the second half of the movie alternates between exciting encounters between Pi and the Parker and boringly long sea scenes.<br/><br/>I felt that the story line could have been tightened to bring together many loose ends. The religious exploration of the early years, emotional binding with a girl etc do not find a strong connect to the later part of the story. Even the Japanese quest to find out why the ship sank seems irrelevant to the narration.<br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning and acting is superb. They would justify one visit to the theater."

Told mostly in flashback form you now have a grown Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan)and Pi recalls the times and days of his India zoo keeper family. And the most life changing and memorable moment that would shape Pi's life is when his family took a ship movement to Canada only to be wrecked by a sea disaster in the Pacific ocean. After the wicked waves of the Pacific have departed Pi's family on the lifeboat he's left with his most notable zoo animals like a zebra, hyena, orangutan and most watched is a fierce growling grown to love Bengal tiger. Along the way this is a cat and mouse game of will and survival for Pi to live it shows that on an unexpected journey skill and wit can be learned for survival. Aside from the film's personal themes of will and determination the special effects are top notch.

Overall this film is a tribute to courage, wit and the will for survival."
"turk_rooster","7","1","4","6 December 2012"," Lost and Found
","For me, Life of Pi was a yo-yo between overt romanticizing of vignettes of Indian life and times by a non-Indian author, and a movie that has some seriously profound insights in spite of the same. The quaintness of a zoo in Pondicherry, finding religion, the mystique of Indian dance, the uprooting of a family owing to economic circumstances - all had an overtly lyrical, if not particularly original - aura. Then, suddenly, we find Piscine Molitor Patel aka Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) - a castaway in the middle of the Pacific ocean - with all his beliefs called into question. Is there a point to overt faith? Can a human and a large carnivore be (to borrow from Star Wars) symbionts? Where does a man who has lost everything find hope, and the will to move on with one's life? Somewhat if not profoundly moving, Life of Pi is about how we are shaped by our bouquet of experiences, and how, from those experiences, one can draw upon great reserves of strength"
"ysamat","8","1","4","4 December 2012"," Ang Lee's Versatility in Life's Metaphor
","Ang Lee has outdone himself once again with this incredible film. The sheer creative lushness hold the relatively weak dialogs into an enjoyable visual treat. With Crouching Tiger and Brokeback behind him another one would have been a hard act. But Ang Lee proves himself to be a maestro of his profession. (Don't bother seeing it on a plane. Would be a waste to see this gem on a tiny 2D screen.)<br/><br/>Set 75 years ago in India and the Pacific, this one as authentic as it gets. The actors pull of their part well pretty well though the dialogs are limp. The tiger and other animals are very realistically conjured. Mystical and magical, God plays his/her part although bringing God as an anchor reference was quite unnecessary. India is portrayed in the copybook magical fable land. The reference to Hindu Gods and their roles (pantheism holds in India) was a first time in Hollywood. The universe metaphorically inside the mouth of Lord Krishna was a first and displays the intense commitment to to authenticity since this is a relatively obscure legend. So also the dinner conversation of the Hindu family with its flexibility and openness to all the spiritual influences. Most of India does think like this. Hindu proclivity for compassion is superbly portrayed too.<br/><br/>The philosophical treatise was nice but the film per se carried itself on the back of the challenge of a tiger learning to co-exist with man in a Mexican standoff.<br/><br/>The 3D effects are superb. It was overall a great film. More gripping dialogs would have lifted this a notch higher."
"nikhil_taneja","8","1","4","1 December 2012"," Life of Pi will make you believe in Ang Lee
","""Your uncle told me that you have a story that will make me believe in God?"" questions the writer (Rafe Spall) to Piscine Patel (Irrfan Khan), better known as Pi, in a conversation at the beginning of the movie. It's an incredible premise, setting up enormous expectations for the story to follow, and leaving you roused in anticipation, even more so than all the early reviews, the stunning trailers and the featurettes gushing about its 3D, and the distracting hype that Oscar-winning director Ang Lee's stature carries with it, have doubtlessly had already.<br/><br/>But twenty minutes into the movie, you've forgotten everything. You've forgotten the Oscar buzz and the 3D argument. You've forgotten the jarring accents that bothered you merely five minutes ago. You've forgotten the horrendous Peter Sellers-like brown-painted white man with the offensive Indian twang and you've forgotten the painfully trite use of sitars and tablas in the background score to give the Hollywood- manufactured ""feel of India."" As astonishing as it may be, you've also forgotten the breathtaking, timeless beauty of Tabu that you longed to stay with, just a little bit longer. (And you've somehow forgotten that bitter feeling of envy that comes from Adil Hussain working with the most gorgeous of Indian women.)<br/><br/>Because twenty minutes into the movie, Life of Pi creates within you a strange feeling of calm, as the striking visuals and the powerful storytelling take over. You are then not just a viewer of the film, you are a part of the film's wondrous, expansive world; a world in which you are Pi (Suraj Sharma), the 16-year-old boy stranded on a life boat in the middle of the ocean after a shipwreck, and a world in which you are also the carnivore, the majestic Tiger, who is stranded in the same boat with Pi, the only relatable part left of the habitat that once surrounded it. Twenty minutes into the movie, you are the movie, as Lee taps into your innermost, most primal emotions and immaculately plays them back on a screen grand and fitting enough to match the scale of Yann Martel's ambitious novel of the same name.<br/><br/>Masterfully using the big screen as a canvas and painting a series of gorgeous images on it, but ones that are deeply rooted in human emotions, Lee infuses 'life' into Life of Pi, a novel largely about the 227 days that its protagonist, Pi, spends in the middle of the ocean with a tiger for company, and one that has largely been considered unfilmable. The movie is reminiscent of the Robert Zemeckis directed and Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks' movie, Cast Away, in its basic premise of 'Man vs Wild', but is infinitely more gripping, and superior in driving home the point that everything you thought you know about life and its meaning change when you have to survive at sea (and of course, when you are in the company of a carnivore).<br/><br/>The tiger in the movie is, at times, a digitally (but astoundingly) created tiger and at times, the real animal itself, and more than just young Suraj Sharma's remarkable portrayal of Pi, the triumph of the movie lies in the way Lee has used the tiger, both as a creature we fear, respect and perhaps one we are yet to understand, as well as a metaphor for survival, endurance and persistent grit, at a time when it could seem that your faith in God could only have been misplaced.<br/><br/>The cinematography, direction, special effects and art of the movie scream ""Oscar"" and superlative performances from the entire cast only help the movie's cause. And for once, the 3D actually helps. It's also gratifying to finally see Irrfan Khan in another Hollywood role after The Namesake (although it is again an extended cameo) that does justice to his talent – the final scene of the movie will make you understand why. But yes, though I personally loved the movie's ending, if you are looking to be spiritually moved or find answers to the questions of life, reading the book may serve you better than watching the movie.<br/><br/>Because this is not a movie that will make you believe in God. It is a movie that will make you believe in Ang Lee."

How he survives in the boat, what all things he learns and how he finally gets in contact with human civilization, forms the rest of the story. Although the basic gist of the story is not that great, its the amazing way of storytelling by the director and good portrayal of characters that makes it worth watching. The way Ang Lee has used technology and visual effects in this movie is just fantastic. But the most beautiful thing about the movie is the way the director has let the viewers have their own conclusion about the story(pretty much like inception). Whether you think of the movie as a spiritual journey or an adventure story or a movie that portrays the bitter reality of life, it will all make sense. And for that same reason,some people may hate this movie but only when you sit back,think and realize that how the director has effortlessly taken you with pi in his incredible journey , you will realize that its a great movie."

","""Life of Pi is a movie with some stunning images but it fails to reach the spiritual entente it is trying to tell the audience"" <br/><br/>Based on the Yann Martel novel of the same name Life of Pi tells the story of two characters who have to learn to get along in order to live. Adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) tells the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma) when his family sold their zoo in India causing them to move. During the boar journey in sinks leaving Pi alone losing his family. He does not end up alone because a couple of animals join him and most promptly is a tiger called Richard Parker. The two start off conflicting but go through a horrible ordeal that brings the two closer together as they must work close in order to live and return to some sort of home.<br/><br/>Ang Lee is probably the most versatile director working today because he can direct a film about Karate fighters, Gay Cowboys and Hulk. This new film is mainly set in the ocean after spending some time in India introducing us to Pi and how he ended up where he is. Since most of the film is set on a boat and life raft not much dialogue is spoken except for a voice-over from Pi as he explains how he survives and deals with this viscous animal. Lee has made this simple boring story more interesting by providing some thrilling images as the characters go through there adventure. An example of this is the use of bright luminous colours which can either be seen as too distracting or fitting to the story and some of the images shown to me worked while others were to jarring and took away some of the enjoyment. The way this tiger was filmed is very sharp CGI because i was not thinking about whether the tiger was real or not and that shows the talent Lee has to make reality and fantasy blend into one great visual.<br/><br/>First time actor Suraj Sharma plays the main character Pi and this is his first screen performance and acting overall. He brings life to Pi but his performance seems to forced at times and I blame that on his lack of experience acting in general. He can be great at times but for most of the film I was not into his acting. Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi is few scenes as he sets up this story he went through as a young boy. He is just OK because he is not really emotive compared to Suraj and for most of his film is used as a link back to the journey story as he tells it to the writer who will be writing this story Pi went through.<br/><br/>The film's story is the main problem because it is mostly placed in the middle of the ocean and taking the risk gives you the disadvantage of sometimes not presenting the best story you can give all the time. The bright colours and fascinating scenes Lee filmed kept my interest throughout but overall the film fails mostly because of the lack of talents it's main actor has as he acts opposite this mostly CGI tiger.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: C+ (Irrfan Khan)"

The actors are brilliant, irrfan is as soothing to eyes as ever and creates the calmness which he often brings to screen. Suraj sharma's vulnerability creates relativity with the viewer and emotional connect becomes apparent. The most brilliant thing in the movie is Richard parker( for people who haven't seen the movie yet or read the novel, its the Bengal tiger!!).

I liked all the shots of underwater from under the boat, with the fish and all.

They really were good. Nevertheless, something that could have been improved was the cinematography. I would lie if I will tell that the camera rolling is awful because it's not. My point here is that they could have not overused the camera roll techniques in most of the scenes in top and underwater views.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as how I perceive a movie, it must not end on the technical aspects alone, but also on the substance of its content.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, the perception that came into my mind was that it was a narrative movie as much time was consumed by Pi in beginning to tell his story. But, all those are not much important as the storyline progresses. The rising action saved the introduction as it was very very good. However, when it reached its peak, I can see no more progress. After some series of events happening on the climax, it came to its denouement and ended with sudden change of events -- not much smooth flow of plot.<br/><br/>If you will focus more on the adventure side of the Life of Pi, then you must enjoy the movie. But, if you analyze the central theme of the movie, it wasn't the life of Pi after all. It was just a hinge of his life.<br/><br/>There were good sides, but also bad sides. And thus, leads me to the decision of giving it 5 out of 10."
"sharpthoughts","7","1","5","24 November 2012"," Visually Excellent, Emotionally Subtle
","Life of PI should be counted as a visual treat more than an emotional experience. Yet it should be considered as one the very good movies Hollywood has shown to the world in the past few years; where visual effects are dominating the screens.<br/><br/>This entire story is about Faith and Hope. PI as a child was fascinated towards God, Rather restrict himself to one religion, He understood that ways of God might be different but destination in one. He accepts every thing good in every religion. He understood the concept of Faith in Hinduism and When He was introduced to Christianity; PI does not say Hinduism is wrong, He thanked Hindu God for introducing him with Jesus. The same positive approach was maintained throughout the movie in this character. When He was left alone in the ocean with Tiger, He says to God that he surrenders himself to him. That was truth. He surrenders himself to God and whatever comes in his way he went through it and took his life and way as God is taking him forward and his action is only to pass through the stages but not complaining or loosing hope. At one moment we believe in this where PI tries to survive, God tests him more in the form of Richard Parker (Bengal Tiger), Second Storm where he looses his total food supply, Prepared to be taken away by God (Death). Then God gives hope as a floating Carnivorous Island and again making him move forward without loosing hope.<br/><br/>Richard Parker is a character rarely seen in movies. A silent villain character who makes the Hero survive. Imagine without Richard Parker, PI would have died in loneliness. As said in the movie, The terror of death from the Tiger kept PI alive. If Parker is another test by God, PI passed it by taming him. The relation between these two went very well through out the story when it started as predator and prey it transforms in to Master and Animal and finally hunger makes them both good friends in their own emotional levels. Though PI wanted Parker to look back and get his final greetings, Parker accepted them by stopping for a moment and leaving him alone without hunting down.<br/><br/>Movie is visually astounding but visual beauty dominated the story? Certainly for an extent where there was not much story happening in the Ocean. It was lagging and on slow pace. Then comes the magical Island for rescue. But an immediate climax was a disaster for the movie. The way PI concluded the story before Japanese Cargo employees is good. But due to visual domination and partial drawbacks Life of PI just missed to be a Classic but almost there but worth watching once or twice. This movie cannot leave you in a trance where you go home and spend some hours thinking about it. Once you walk out of the theater the movie is over."

Lots of beautiful scenery but the relationship between the boy and the tiger just does not convince. The movie is in 3D so there are lots of scenes with the tiger coming towards the boy (you) but after a while that becomes a little repetitive - rather like the guy on the horse in The Virginian. The ending is disappointing. I am not sure there was a need to put things in black and white. I know that many people dsilike ambiguous endings but there really was no need to spoil the illusion. In summary, an enjoyable movie but far from a great one."
"sohansurag","7","1","6","14 December 2012"," How to turn a Classic to an Over-rated Visual-heavy flick!
","Life Of Pi, directed by Ang Lee, adapted from Yann Martel's Booker prize winning novel of the same name seems to be the talk of the town now. From the moment I'd seen the previews, I was not so sure I wanted to go for this one. This would just be another Avatar-clone cashing in on the 3D and 'jaw dropping visuals' and nothing else. And I was correct.<br/><br/>Going with the 'monotonously obvious choice' for a cast when it comes to a Hollywood movies, Ang Lee went with AAA Indian actors like Irfan Khan and Tabu. I am not saying its a bad choice but weren't there any other Indian actors who could replace Irfan Khan/Tabu? The most interesting portions of the movie is with the boy, the tiger and the ocean and thus Life Of Pi could be watched for its powerful singular performance of débutant Suraj Sharma taking the whole show on his shoulders. The completely CG Tiger (I still have suspicions that almost all of 100 minutes of it is CG) is a work of marvel indeed. Gollum was the last one I was impressed with and although 'Richard Parker' wasn't as impressive as Gollum, it did manage to convince me and question me whether it was a real tiger or not. Add to that a remarkable score by Mychael Danna, Life of Pi does incredible wonders to both your sensesthough but it still seldom manages to touch your heart.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised if 'Life Of Pi' ends up in the Oscar buzz or even winning one just like the way the very-over-rated 'Slumdog Millionaire' had done. I never thought 'Slumdog Millionaire' deserved an Academy Award.its a technically sound, well adapted, well directed entertainer and there's nothing else to it. Likewise 'Life Of Pi' is a visually extravagant, well made piece of adapted material. Some books are so good they are called something: A Classic and movies adapted from them, no matter how well they are made, wont be called the same. 'Life Of Pi' might stay with us till the Academy Awards or until all these dust of visual gimmicks settles down, after that I am sure not many people would even remember it. Nonetheless do watch it and take your kids along with you, they wouldn't care all the philosophical and spiritual babble and chances are that they'd end up loving it more than you."
"TheSquiss","8","1","7","12 December 2012"," Visually beautiful, strikingly brilliant but damaged by 3D gimmickry.
","My recollection of Yann Martell's source novel is hazy but, yes, I know the outcome and, no, I'm not about to spill the beans. However, I invited a friend who hasn't read Life of Pi to join me for the screening and he declined saying ""I watched the trailer and it clearly has no basis in reality"" and promptly made a statement, based on his assumptions, which, if I repeated it here, would cause bellowed accusations of plot spoilers.<br/><br/>His other main point was that the trailer rekindled bad memories of What Dreams May Come, a film with a fantastic car crash that then became, well, a car crash. And so it was with trepidation I approached Ang Lee's epic, hoping for the quality of The Ice Storm and dreading another Hulk.<br/><br/>In actuality, the film in Lee's canon it most closely resembles is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for its visual splendor. Even when not relying on visual effects, Lee paints his images across the screen with confidence and striking brilliance. The colours excite, the movements draw the viewer in and we are invited to admire a sumptuous ballet of shapes and hues that are sometimes stars, sometimes jelly fish and always beautiful. At one point, the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) explains to the writer (Rafe Spall) that the water in the pool was unbelievably clear, and so it is with Lee's shots and effects; on numerous occasions one isn't quite sure if the lifeboat is floating on a clear sea or in the sky, and it highlights the hugeness of Pi's world, life and God while accentuating what a small but significant part he plays in it.<br/><br/>As with Avatar, the principal attraction of Life of Pi, for those who have seen the trailer but not read the book, may well be the spectacle upon the screen and the apparent strangeness of his imagery. Those viewers will not be disappointed and that is where Lee excels. The beauty of the story belongs to Yann Martell and Lee nurtures it, almost babysits it, rather than adapts it. His opening scenes that introduce us to Pi Patel, his family and the zoo they run in India are fun, lively and provide a fascinating game of Which animal is that? <br/><br/>But there is a sense that Lee is enjoying himself too much with these moments rather than favouring pace in order to satisfy the studio's demands for 3D 'moments'. For the most part, the 3D format (alas, there was not a 2D option last night) learns from Avatar's example and presents us with a far greater depth of field and a richer experience, but too often Lee slips into gimmickry with lizards running at us and poles lurching into our faces. It isn't funny and serves only to distract.<br/><br/>For those who loved the book, Life of Pi is a faithful adaptation (from what I can recall); it is always a challenge for a director to recreate on screen the images we have firmly on our minds, but at least the story remains in tact. For those entering this film without the literary experience, very simply this is a story of a young man whose parents decide to sell their zoo and emigrate to give him and his brother a better life. En route they are shipwrecked and Pi (Suraj Sharma) finds himself adrift in the vast ocean in a lifeboat in the company of a tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan.<br/><br/>But far, far more than being a simple film about man and beast hoping for a miraculous rescue, Life of Pi is about a lad's search for depth, meaning and a divine influence on his life free from the prejudices and constraints that govern others. At one point he prays, ""Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ."" My principal complaint is not with the film but the presentation, which so badly affected it. Yet another huge black mark for Cineworld Bristol. Whilst the staff is generally top banana, the ineptitude of their projectionist reflects very, very badly on the cinema. Exactly how difficult is it to ensure the film is projected in the correct aspect ratio so as not to scalp characters and entirely lose the subtitles; that the screen's masking panels are set so as not to further reduce the image size; to ensure the speakers along the right hand side of screen seven, as mentioned in at least three previous reviews, are working correctly; and that we don't endure repeated blackouts over the first twenty minutes as s/he attempts and fails repeatedly to rectify the issues? Cinemas have little control and no interest in preventing customers from talking and using mobile phones throughout performances and so it is left to us, the paying customers, to intervene (and, yes, I did!) but they emphatically are responsible for the presentation of both video and audio of the film we have paid to see! <br/><br/>Consider yourselves chastised (again!), Cineworld! <br/><br/>But, not even an inept projectionist can alter the impact of a fine film. You may not understand every reference or see reason behind every beautiful, fantastical image in Life of Pi but that matters not a jot. I'll give the final word to the beguiling hero, Pi: ""If it happened, it happened. Why does it have to mean anything?"" <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk <br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"
"cadurocha2","8","1","8","26 December 2012"," Should be inspiring, but falls into boringness and confusing narrative
","It is an interesting film. However, it's somewhat confusing. The story path leaves us with many doubts, as a kind of self-help guide to illumination. At the same time that it starts with a good idea, in the sequence the movie becomes not so obviously understandable. The movie is very boring for dozens of minutes although from time to time you get scared by some noisy actions... Well, comparing with ""Cast Away"" (with Tom Hanks), it is more magical and inspiring, but yet tiresome and with an unnecessary non-linear narrative. Special notes and five stars should be given to the animals in CG: just perfect, and also to Suraj Sharma, who played the main character (a very difficult role). And...five stars also to the very beginning of ""Life of Pi"": very poetical and splendidly filmed and the sea sequences - technically very well done."
"DesiBaba","6","1","9","5 December 2012"," Decent movie, but very poorly paced.
","Perhaps this is not for those who are not big fans of the book, it may be thrilling to see the characters from book come to life in this movie. But for those unfamiliar with the book, the movie was somewhat tedious at times due to poor pacing. The movie starts out really well, all the way through Pi ending up by himself in the boat (with 3 other animals/people). The remainder of the movie just drags on. If you like glitzy CGI work, it may keep you enticed. But otherwise there is no reason for their journey to be that long in the movie, it could have been cut by 25-30% without any meaningful impact on what it was trying to convey. Debut by Suraj Sharma is impressive, especially considering that he has no prior acting background at all. Direction by Ang Lee is masterful but editing could have shortened the movie a bit more. Acting by Irfan Khan is okay, not his best, not even close. Tabu and Gerard Depardieu were wasted. This may be a good movie for those between 11-17 YO who are not sure about religion and its meaning/purpose in life. As a grown-up, I personally found the meaning to be trivial. Only go if you're taking kids with you."

","It's a good film, thanks to the fx and some aspects of the story. Other reviewers have written about what they didn't like: the religious angle (if his survival makes you believe in God, wouldn't the wiping out of everyone else make you disbelieve?), the framing device, and the alternate story. To be a great film, here's what they should have included:<br/><br/>1. A scene with a zookeeper feeding the tiger, and his father telling Pi, ""Tigers don't love the person who feeds them."" Absent this, the movie kept holding out the hope that the big cat would bond with Pi because of getting food. 2. A visit to the circus! This would have shown the proper training of big cats, knowledge Pi could have used on the boat.<br/><br/>btw, if I'm ever shipwrecked, I hope it's off a Japanese freighter, because, man, are their lifeboats well-equipped."

","the trailer looked great the reviews were glowing, was this going to be one of the films of the year. sadly no, the structure did not work, by knowing he survives, because he is telling his story takes away any tension. the interview he gives is more like a bad voice over, and is not needed. it would have been better just to tell the story straight. as with all of Lee's films it looked great, but was empty again like most of his films. this does not have anything to say, and the terrible ending,was it true or not, spoils and takes away and potential deepness in the story. now onto to the again wasted use of 3d, when will directors learn if you are going to shoot in 3d then make it 3d not just a tiny bit, i would rather see dramatic films like this in 2d, even when there was opportunity to dazzle us in some of the action scenes, it all seemed flat.<br/><br/>3d gives one the chance to be in the frame if used to its full extent,which very few people apart from Cameron have done."
"mtbgtown","6","1","12","4 March 2013"," Long, sentimental, and laundered for the western palate.
","We'll start with the good: Ang's underwater scene of the boy watching the ship sink is better than the whole movie Titanic. I always thought that for all the money spent, James Cameron could have shown the massive ship below the waterline, with lights still on, just to give the sense of the horrible silent peacefulness of the underwater world. But that question answers itself.<br/><br/>It's best to read the book first, because you will get a lot of information that Ang omits. There are things the book omits, too, but Ang even more so. It is a western-told version of India without the ickiness of poverty caused by the Hindu caste system. It also steps around the atrocities of Islam, but (surprise!) portrays Christianity fairly close to the way the Modern West sees it, as a confusing, zealous faith not offering anything nearly as ""beautiful"" as Islam and anything else in the ""beautiful"" world.<br/><br/>In addition, early in the book zookeeping is parsed from a non-Western point of view, and it makes sense. Much evidence is given that zoo animals are quite happy, especially at Pi's zoo, and it sets the stage for him spending months at sea stuck with a tiger. Too bad groups who make no sense and offer only anecdotal evidence keep this point of view from Ang's film.<br/><br/>Some of what was kept puzzles me. An island, covered in meerkats, that bleeds acid and eats humans, saving only their teeth? I only partly blame Ang for this indulgence of thirty minutes of film. Was it a dream the author entertained? I can't find any example of this online.<br/><br/>Some scenes were overly sentimental, overwrought, and the big surprise at the end didn't require the ridiculous ""writer"" character bawling his liberal face off over the beauty of the Big Truth he had the privilege to see. I know audiences need all the help they can get, and many even walked out not getting it still. It reminds me of these high definition youtube videos where hipsters are interviewed about whittling or kale growing, as if they were the first to discover it. <br/><br/>The swimming Uncle Mamaji was the most interesting, authentic character. He was hilarious and so proud in his Speedo. Frankly, I wished the whole movie was about him and his adventures hitting all the famous pools in Paris. They need to make that movie."
"Thomasdinnegan75","4","1","12","4 March 2013"," ""A masterpiece"" ? - No, no, no, no, no !
","The Life of Pi, applauded for it's visual effects and labelled a ""masterpiece"" by many, yes I expected a lot. However, I have to admit, never have I struggled so much to understand the hype surrounding a film than I have with this. Okay, its not awful or the worse film I've ever seen but in no way is it a masterpiece, in fact its so far from a masterpiece that I found myself wishing I was at sea in a boat with a tiger rather than being in a cinema theater watching it! <br/><br/>Some parts of the movie is watchable, others will bore you to sleep and then others are completely enchanting. I found myself really interested in the movie when Irrfan Khan, an adult Pi was speaking, especially in the final scene where his storytelling truly captures everyone's attention. However, this is one of the only times I found myself enjoying the movie, throughout the other scenes I was only thinking about when the film would end. <br/><br/>The Life of Pi is like a really beautiful person who has no personality and when you look closer you see that the person isn't all that beautiful at all, covered in make up, fake! I relate this to the Life of Pi as everyone claims its a beautiful movie and that the visual effects are ""breath taking"" when really they're not! Yes, some scenes are beautiful, but others are absolutely awful! An example- the storm scene, its so dark, I found myself squinting and straining just to see the bloody thing! A scene that is suppose to be beautiful is when a whale jumps out of the water! Firstly, it didn't look real at all and secondly was completely pointless and irrelevant to the film, although in truth the film was exactly that also! Its almost like Ang Lee said to himself, due to how crap the plot of this movie is, I'll throw in a few jellyfish and a whale, lovely, that'll win me an Oscar! Yes it did, however, in my opinion it was totally undeserved! <br/><br/>Life of Pi lacks everything really! never once did I find myself liking the main character, a younger Pi, in fact I was praying that he would just drown already! The whole film consists of him on a raft and a tiger on a boat, ahh kill me now! Also the first hour of the film is just about Religion, which again, would bore you to death. In fact you feel like you're still in the opening scene in the final scene :Z I found the actor Suraj Sharma a complete bore,then again considering the part he had to play I probably would have found Cheryl Cole in her nude boring playing the part also! I commented on his acting and how I found him dull to a friend and he replied ""you have to give him credit, he was acting the whole film in a water tank with a tennis ball"" and when I said he was awful at crying and emotional scenes he said ""oh come on, he was crying to a tennis ball, could you cry to a tennis ball""- well the answer is probably not but I'm not a professional actor and I didn't get millions to cry! <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say don't bother watching this movie and definitely don't buy the DVD, I can only imagine that would be 10 times worse. Often in movies like this, there is such an emphasis put on visual effects that the plot gets left behind and this was very much the case with The Life of Pi! Yes, beautiful scenes and CGI tigers are good, they're a bonus but for god sake, please focus on the actually movie first, make me enjoy it, make me like the character, keep me focused! When I go to see a movie I expect to enjoy it and to relate to its characters Mr Lee, not just see ""beautiful"" visual effects that in truth weren't all that beautiful. If i wanted to watch beautiful animals and landscape, I'd have watched the national geographic channel, not gone to see a movie. Please don't waste your time with this movie, its 2 hours of your life that you will never get back!"

","I wanted to write a review of this film soon after I watched it in theaters as I doubted if I would remember it in the future. Walking into the theater the poster outside read ""THE NEXT AVATAR, LIFE OF PI"". Not being a fan of Avatar I wasn't sure why the makers of this film would want to compare their work to it. The movie began with a long, dragging opening sequence containing various animals and sights in India and it really set the pace for the rest of the movie. The acting was excellent but I really never ""beleived"" the movie. From the cheesy flashback sequences, awkward moments between the writer and the main characters older self and the entire middle of the movie stranded at sea sequence which seemed to last hours on end. A mash up of Titanic, Cast Away, The Jungle Book and Avatar made me think more of those movies that the actual one I was watching. Fantastic special effects unfortunately turned a movie that I found believable in the beginning to one that I felt was straight out of a children's picture book by the end."
"frankenbenz","5","1","14","7 March 2013"," A Pi In The Sky Story
","www.eattheblinds.com<br/><br/>With the exception of Oliver Stone's ten-part mini-series The Untold History of the United States, no two films from 2012 do a better job at depicting what's wrong with the world today, than Craig Zobel's Compliance and Ang Lee's Life of Pi. Like the perfect wine pairing, these films should be watched back-to-back to bring out each one's full spectrum of flavor and insight. Don't make the mistake I did of watching Compliance first, better yet, save it for the second course -- a dish that will cool your palate after choking down Lee's turd-warm appetizer.<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is a story achingly familiar, not for the subject matter itself, but in the way it is presented to us -- this is a cozy narrative formula audiences have gobbled up for decades, and based on Pi's critical reception it seems to be a taste no one is tiring of. Like Forrest Gump and countless other epic Hollywood yarns, Pi takes you on a magical, moral journey, a fiction tethered to the present in wholly unnecessary bouts of present-day exposition (presumably for those in the audience not paying strict attention). We are witness to the exotic and fantastic voyage of yesteryear by our humble narrator, told in CG-rich flashbacks, all in the name of getting the empty vessel of the aspiring writer (aka the audience) to a point where God is accepted. Unfortunately, this leap of faith comes after a Shaggy Dog twist reveals to us that the primrose path we've been led down, was in fact tended with manure. But fear not, since our heroic narrator has taken the initiative of convincing us the true story is so horrible, we will blithely prefer the flowery fiction he himself has succumbed to, so long ago. The last few times I remember a Hollywood film attempting to convince me fiction was preferable to reality was Tim Burton's Big Fish and Jeremy Leven's Don Juan De Marco. Perhaps I can forgive these two films for selling me on love and compassion, but Pi is selling us God...an entirely different can of worms.<br/><br/>If after being misled for two plus hours you're still not sold on ""God"" then you might be asking yourself: why exactly would the story of a tiger on a boat really be better than the gritty realist drama of four desperate humans on a lifeboat? I suppose the answer to why so many would prefer fiction over fact is perfectly presented in the hard to watch ""Inspired by True Events"" Compliance. When a complete stranger calls and tells you he's a police officer, then you'd probably do whatever you were told to do, right? Even if this cop was pushing you to commit sexual assault, rape, etc.? I can't remember being more frustrated by poor decisions made by movie characters since I revisited the Friday the 13th franchise last summer, yet, Compliance's characters are purportedly based on real people who made real life stupid/criminal decisions. How could these people be so bloody stupid, you ask? After watching Life of Pi, you should have the answer you were looking for. It might also explain why so many of us bought the ""They hate us for our freedom"" line."

"w-93757","9","0","1","16 January 2019"," Life of Pi is cooler than pi
","Life of Pi is a magnificent film incorporating beautiful scenes in tragic and hard times. It is a movie about the aftermath of a shipwreck where everyone but one person dies. In the beginning of this movie they say how this story will make you believe in God and this is a perfect description of it as a whole. The most beautiful scenes that I have seen in movies comes from this movie and the filmmakers play around with the idea of loneliness to create a certain kind of atmosphere.
They start the movie off as most older movies do, with a long intro with no words, but somehow still conveys the upcoming theme of the movie. Although, five minutes may be too long for this, I think they should have made it two minutes instead because I felt the need to skip through this whole beginning part. However, unlike most movies they do something similar in the middle of the movie to show how he feels like everything that once was is now gone, which is a smart idea on their part. About ten minutes in Pi, the narrator, starts his story that started many years before, he talks about his dad and how his name came about. Also how he had to change it to Pi from the french for pool, Piscine, because he got made fun of for it. He explains how his father named him this because he swam in a very very clear pool in France that changed his life, the movie replicates this moment, when they shoot the scene from underneath, multiple times throughout the film. A main theme throughout this film is how religion isn't completely a set fact or thing to believe.
This movie is the king of transitions. It uses the sky, clouds, stars, fade-in and outs, and more. All of these show the connections between what is happening and what is going to happen. For example, one can tell Pi starts to act weird and is bored through having strange scenes like the filmmakers cut him out(only to him) and put that over a film of him cutting up a fish with his voice over and they keep on fading in and out certain parts of the picture. The filmmakers also use this movie to show the how different their culture is from ours but also how the older Pi has kept a lot of his past traditions or cultures of India, like how and what he eats.
Then they finally show the elegant orange and slack tiger that is very important in the story and the filmmakers introduce him slowly coming from a shadow to show how mysterious he is. Also, they use music to intensify the slowly moving tiger toward the hunk of meat shaking in the young boy's hand. His dad later proves that the tiger could have lunged at him but he didn't, despite this the dad still conditioned the boy to believe tigers don't feel the same emotions as humans.
The makers of this movie used the use of stunning scenes to their advantage, they show them right after something bad happens or to add the effect of God's beauty in the face of hardships. Most of the time these scenes are accompanied by peaceful music to symbolize hope. At first when the ship is sinking they show how most people's first thought wouldn't be that the ship was going down but that it is cool, so he laughs having fun in the rain for sometime until he someone die on the deck, then realizing the severity of it all. This movie uses animals in this time to exemplify the craziness of this moment, perhaps they were trying to get at the fact that everyone was running around like wild animals. Also, they use the underwater view to symbolize calmness, they also use calm waters to show this same sense. Another thing they filmmakers do many times throughout this film is use low and high angle shots to show dominance. For example, when it is just the tiger and Pi in the scenes at first they show the tiger with more dominance using high angle shots on him and low angle shots on Pi, but as the movie progresses the roles flip. But they also use high angle shots when he is speaking to God asking why. Lastly, the filmmakers show hope coming and going by showing how small he feels through zooming out to show him looking how he feels.
The one big thing Life of Pi does really well is make you question what you would do in that situation, would you lose hope, would you go crazy, it is impossible to know but still so tempting to wonder."

","Tone, Script & Story: A family in India is an owner of zoo. The family has decided to relocate. They have decided to sell their animals in a foreign country as they are getting a better price there. To relocate they choose sea to travel. Pi is one of the members in the family. The movie highlights why he got that name. Further it is described how while travelling an accident occurs and pi is stranded on a boat along with a tiger, zebra and a hyena. Later in a story only pi and tiger are left. They survive. It is the story mostly on what happened on that boat.<br/><br/>I myself being an Indian find sense of satisfaction when movie 'Life of pi' is concerned. The movie has won four Oscars. The area where I find it most justified is Cinematography and visual effects. As far as the story is concerned I can't go along with it. I mean a tiger leaving it's pray. It is further described they waited on an island which turned acidic. I ask how the trees and animals there survived. It's not easy to swallow.<br/><br/>Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Winning Oscar's in cinematography and visual effects has restored my faith in Oscars to some extent. Music: It's traditional, I can't judge as I am not an Expert. Acting: Justified.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The movie is visually stunning but story is little difficult to swallow!

","The film opens with a lengthy character build-up of Pi. It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.<br/><br/>His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.<br/><br/>Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the ""P"" word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, ""Which do you prefer?"" as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.<br/><br/>While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent. Beginning of film frequently refers to pi**ing."

","Watching the life of Pi reminded of movies like Big Fish and The Legend of Bagger Vance, it had the feeling of a story within a story like these other movies offer. It was sad, bizarre, and strange and it had all these feelings.<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is told from Pi's adult perspective, he tells his story to an author interested in writing his life story. Pi tells of his childhood, his early life growing up in India, the zoo his father and family ran, his first love, and how his parents died. These are the parts that reminded me of Big Fish. The part where is parents die was very sad and it touched me. The rest of the story seems pretty cool but kind of weird and bizarre just like Big Fish. What I like about this movie is the story has morals to it, like growing up, letting things go, and learning from your mistakes, it also shows how one deals with the death of a loved one. But what really confused me is the fact Pi comes up with two versions of his survival story, and the audience has to decide which one is true, I prefer the animal story. <br/><br/>The reason I give The Life of Pi an eight is because it's a confusing story, it is a good story that teaches life lessons, but it doesn't make any sense. I like how the author lets us get to choose the two different stories.<br/><br/>8/10 for The Life of Pi"

"classicsoncall","10","0","1","6 October 2017"," ""Faith is a house with many rooms.""
","What amazes me about director Ang Lee is the totally disparate types of films that he puts together. One wonders how ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and this movie all come from the same creative mind. I just find it fascinating.<br/><br/>Of those other films mentioned, this is one that comes closest to resembling a spiritual journey for the principal character. Told at first as an allegory, and later contrasted with the 'true' story of what happened when the young Pi (Suraj Sharma) survived a shipwreck ordeal, this appears to be Lee's take on a search for God and for the meaning of existence. I didn't find the adult Pi's (Irrfan Khan) challenge to the writer (Rafe Spall) about the proof of God's existence as being definitive, and I don't think that's what one's take on the picture ought to be.<br/><br/>I think what the story should reaffirm in anyone watching it is that one has to meet life's challenges as they occur with a sole reliance on one's ability to think things through, form a plan, and execute it to the best of one's ability. What Pi had to endure on the open ocean was nothing short of an impossible situation, yet he made the most of it by using his own wits and the available resources he had. That he had to overcome the challenge of a vicious adversary in the tiger, forced Pi to consider his options, none of which included the easy way out of simply giving up.<br/><br/>The CGI and special effects in the picture are extraordinary, as evidenced by awards won for Cinematography and Visual Effects at the 2013 Oscars. For his effort, Ang Lee also took home a Best Director. It's on the strength of this and other films by Lee that I seek out his work whenever a new picture comes out that he's directed. Whether you like them or not, he always delivers a compelling movie that makes you think when it's over, and that for me is always a good thing."

","When the movie first came out, I had never heard about it before, so it just seemed like a boring story about relationship between man and animal. However, after I read the original book that the movie is based on, I could't wait to watch the movie. I actually didn't expect the movie to be so well-made, but it portrayed the original story pretty well and the cinematography was beautiful. One thing I was worried about was how the movie will not be able to tell all the stories that Pi tells in the book, about his childhood, and just his thoughts throughout the journey. Nevertheless, the expressions on the actor's face that cannot be seen by reading the book brought out a new feeling and meaning to the movie. In this sense, the casting of the actor was very good. This movie might seem boring because there is literally just one character who can talk for most part of the movie and a few animals, but the visuals, music, and the expressiveness of the movie fills it up and makes the scale of the movie grand. I found some of the effects a little awkward, but it was great overall.

","This is a survival drama film narrated by Pi, an Indian man in his forties who lives in Canada. He tells the story of his early life. Most of it is about when he was 16 and travelled across the Pacific Ocean towards Canada in a ship with his family and a load of animals. Part way across, the ship sinks, killing the protagonist's family and many of the animals. He escapes on a lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena and tiger. The hyena kills the zebra and orangutan. The tiger kills the hyena. Pi and the tiger eventually reach Mexico. Later, he says that the animals were actually people. <br/><br/>This film is ridiculous and can't be taken seriously as a survival film. It's too far-fetched. The tiger would have killed Pi and eaten him. Even without the tiger, Pi would not have survived and reached Mexico in the lifeboat. Even if you believe the second story that the animals were actually people, he still couldn't have survived for that long. The boat would have sunk, or Pi would have died of thirst, starvation, hypothermia/hyperthermia (depending on the temperature) - or a combination of them. <br/><br/>The only reason that I haven't given this 1 is that the special effects are good."

The story was emotional and dramatic, very interesting to watch and kept the audience's attention throughout the movie. Most of the people who have issues with this movie on this website have an issue with the 'religious message' of the movie, or 'lack thereof'. The main point of the 'religious message', I believe, was that the coexistence between a human and a vicious, human-eating tiger is proof of a supernatural force balancing everything. I watched this movie for entertainment, not religious or spiritual purposes, which a movie can never obtain. Those who are lacking in any sense of spirituality may find this movie an issue, as they cannot see the message or understand it. But other than the spiritual component, the movie, as a MOVIE, is very well-done and interesting.<br/><br/>There is one part in the book that should have been included in the movie.

","Life of Pi follows a young man who becomes the lone survivor of a major shipwreck and gets stranded on a small lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. <br/><br/>It's a really interesting idea right from the get-go, but you wonder how it would actually work. It sounds like maybe it'd be really short-lived or just simply impossible, but there's actually a lot to this movie. There's quite a bit of symbolism involving religion in particular, and it's really interesting to see how it all plays out, whether that be in the symbolic aspect or simply the plot itself. Not only that, but the movie is excellently paced. For a movie that takes place almost entirely in one small area you'd think it drag at least a bit, but it didn't. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie the development of the relationship between Pi and the tiger is actually pretty great, which I really didn't expect. Again, you wouldn't think a movie with this premise would be able to make you care this much about a carnivorous animal, yet it did. <br/><br/>And of course there's the aspect that everyone notices first: the special effects. Most of the time they were pretty fantastic. Not just in the fact that the tiger looked real (sometimes it was), but that it was just a very pretty movie to look at. At times I felt like it was pretty obvious that something was fake or on a green screen, but for the most part everything looked pretty stellar. <br/><br/>Overall Life of Pi is a really great movie. The characters and their relationship is great, the plot is presented in a way that never gets old, and of course the special effects are fantastic nine out of ten times.

"nmholland","8","0","2","11 May 2016"," Better Than Expected, With Mind Blowing Cinematography
","Life of Pi is directed by Ang Lee and is the story of a young man who, after surviving a sinking freight ship, is stranded in the Pacific Ocean with nothing but a single life boat and a tiger named Richard Parker. As older Pi is explaining the story to an author, the film goes very in depth upon the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, and the psychological and physical journey that young Pi goes on.<br/><br/>What I got from Life of Pi was much more than I expected. Due to the trailers and its Oscar for visual effects, I expected a color orgy with no heart to it, made purely as Oscar bait. However, Life of Pi was a lot more than that. This film was deep, and was all around a great story. There were some poor aspects of the movie, but overall it was pretty good. I really enjoyed myself when watching Life of Pi, and thought it was a great movie.<br/><br/>As far as cinematography and special effects go, Life of Pi is a masterpiece. Few films have ever looked better than this. Almost the entire film is complete CGI, and it works on incredible levels of expertise. Besides Pi himself, and the small boat, everything was completely CG, and I was blown away. The detail on the ocean, and fish, and especially the tiger, Richard Parker, was amazing. I would honestly compare the cinematography in Life of Pi to that of Avatar (2009).<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic as well. Suraj Sharma, who portrayed young Pi, did great. His kindness, with a burst of ferocity, was displayed on screen very well. Through most of the run time, Pi was a calm and collective young man, with a large amount of both patience and faith. However, he occasionally would have outbursts of rage, due to his situation, and Sharma pulled this off very well. Irrfan Khan, who played older Pi, also did very well. This man is already a highly respectable actor, with great capabilities, but he brought a lot to this film. His character was very wise and experienced, and this was shown greatly by Khan.<br/><br/>Ang Lee's direction was astounding, to say the least. Each and every shot was fantastically filmed, with easily believable CGI mixed in with a real environment. During suspenseful sequences, the film lacked any shaky cam or quick cuts. Many shots were underwater, and they, especially, looked great. One particular shot which involved a sinking ship already halfway underwater looked so amazingly real my jaw literally dropped. Most of these shots were great, and added a scary depth to the oceanic aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Another really good thing about Life of Pi that is worth mentioning is the realness to the tiger, Richard Parker. Although his character is an animal, and is completely CGI, the film gives so many personality traits to the tiger just through his actions and relationship with Pi. Richard Parker is given more depth than most animals in film, and really grew on the audience quickly. His relationship with Pi was also very deep, which felt nice to see in the movie.<br/><br/>Now, the main thing I disliked about Life of Pi was the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film, in which Pi's childhood is displayed. Not all of his childhood was slow, but the beginning of it was very bland, slow, and all around just not entertaining. There were a few things in Pi's childhood that actually mattered later on in the film, but there were a couple unnecessary subplots that just felt like failed attempts to flesh out both Pi and his family, and they just didn't work that well. However, once the story picks up, it really starts going, and going fast.<br/><br/>Another thing that I felt was somewhat disappointing was a certain part in the film in which Pi finds temporary shelter. However, the film later tries to explain the shelter, and ruins the effect it had on Pi. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but it felt as if the film had just stopped, and the movie later on blows the idea out of the water, no pun intended, and makes it slightly irrelevant. Other than that, however, I didn't find any other issues with Life of Pi.<br/><br/>Overall, Life of Pi was a really good movie. It had mind blowing visuals, great direction, and some really good acting too. I enjoyed Life of Pi, and I would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy an adventure, as long as you don't get seasick easily."
"Mobithailand","10","0","2","18 April 2016"," Funny, exciting, frightening and inspiring - all in equal measure.
","I heard about this novel by Yann Martel some years back when it won the Booker prize, but I confess that the subject matter did not inspire me to sit down and read it. However all the hoo-ha surrounding the release of this movie in 3D, which was directed by one of my 'must see' film directors, Ang Lee, encouraged me to go and see when it opened in 3D here in Pattaya.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. It was a visual feast, it was funny, exciting, frightening and inspiring, all in equal measures. It is a magical adventure story about an Indian youth who finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orang-utan and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker - all of them fighting for survival. One might imagine that boredom would soon set in such a film in such a setting, (as it did for me in Castaway), but not a bit of it. Indeed, Tom Hanks would probably have benefited from having a dangerous animal or two on his castaway island. The story races along, and there is never a dull moment as the young man struggles to survive and come to terms with the presence of a tiger sharing his space. It is riveting stuff.<br/><br/>I have yet to be convinced by the use of 3D in movies and still believe that it will eventually turn out to be a passing fad. But in The Life of Pi, the use of 3D is absolutely stunning and is an incredible feast for the eyes. There is no question that when it is used in particular situations, as it was in this movie, it certainly does enhance the viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma in the lead role as Pi is a treasure and is totally believable as a young, pubescent teenager coming to terms with his situation with humour, angst and not a small amount of courage and ingenuity. As the story drifts further and further from reality, there is an intriguing twist in the tale, which I will not recount and so spoil your viewing pleasure, but will simply say that for me it was the 'icing on the cake' of a highly entertaining and thought provoking film. Well done and thank you to Ang Lee and Yann Martel."

I did not know until I began investigating that the Bengal tiger was not real! It certainly seemed real enough to me!<br/><br/>Suraj Sharma did an outstanding job portraying Pi. I was sucked right in to every dramatic moment, and even the moments of lull. <br/><br/>The relationship between Pi and the tiger was interesting, not your typical Disneyesque type flick where everyone lives happily ever after. I wouldn't exactly say they became ""friends"", which may be what I found so intriguing. <br/><br/>How Pi figure out how to survive and coexist with the tiger was also interesting to watch as it unfolded. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie for younger children. Some scenes were a little overpowering, and too intense for young eyes. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie threw me for a loop, and has been keeping me thinking about it even into the next day. I'm still not exactly sure what happened, what was the truth or what was made up by Pi. <br/><br/>My husband has always loved the sea, and stories like Kon-Tiki.

It is interesting that it is consisted of partly real story because it is unbelievable story. The last part of the movie actually makes me surprised. Viewers must not have any boring time. The story is thrilling and attracting all the time. What attracts you the most is that interpretations of the story depend on the viewers. I have watched this movie with two friends of mine, and each has different opinions. I recommend you to watch with someone and exchange your opinions after you watch the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is about one young guy and a tiger which is partly true story and partly not.

","A piece of complete bullshit. This movie is bad. It thinks it says something profound. But it doesn't. It's a bunch of crap. The film purports itself to make you believe in God.

But there are far more beautiful movies that came out in 2013 like The Great Gatsby and films with better effects like The Lone Ranger and Man Of Steal. If you wanted to see a really well-directed film in 2013, You could just watch Iron Man 3. Oz the Great and Powerful came out the same year and it had a better script. And if you were not in a Blockbuster- mood. You could always see The Wolf of Wall Street which is a much better movie. That year also offered American Hustle. and Woody Allen had a new movie Blue Jasmine. So there was no good reason to see Life of Pi. In the end Life of Pi is a pretty but pointless movie.

"vishaal811","8","0","2","8 June 2015"," A Visual Spectacle
","Ang Lee is well-known for making movies that deal with human emotions like love, loss of life, and faith. Life of Pi is the story of a boy who survived a shipwreck with no company except that of a ferocious Bengal Tiger. The story is moving and it is told through flashbacks as Irrfan Khan narrates it to an author who is keen to turn this story into his next novel. The film features some of the best visuals and the use of 3D brings out the best of the surroundings. Suraj Sharma, who had no prior acting experience, is pretty decent in his debut and is able to convey the emotions of losing his family excellently. Even though a Tiger is a carnivorous animal that can kill humans, Pi and the tiger develop a sort of symbiotic relationship which enabled them to survive. The unlikely relationship is portrayed quite well by the director and it is truly like nothing you would have ever seen. The music is inspired by Traditional Indian Music and complements the movie well. It tends to get overly sentimental at times which is an element that could have been avoided. However, do watch the movie for its breathtaking visuals."

","How does one put to words the emotions that Life of Pi generates? It ain't easy.<br/><br/>At first I chose the movie on TV because there was nothing else on...literally! I caught it after it had started, when he was with his family on the ship (in the chow line no less). I thought, OK, just another half hearted attempt at making some money and went back to browsing on the ""pooter"", thinking ""ho hum, better than watching a million reality shows anyway. Then the increased volume of the shipwreck made me look up. Never went back to the computer until the movie ended. Talk about grabbing you!<br/><br/>The Life of Pi is decidedly slow moving, and necessarily so, in order to capture the fear, frustration and emotional roller coaster that being lost at sea can bring.

This may rely on it's special effects, but never stirs away from the human story/emotion it tries (and successfully) conveys.<br/><br/>It's also not too sugarcoated, showing animals like they are and not a cute version of them. Of course one could argue that maybe it's not the animals, but ... well if you've seen the movie, you know you can put a different layer on it and it works great.

"MimRajabi","8","0","2","14 February 2015"," What kind of story do you prefer?
","I think this movie is a master piece in storytelling. The opening is so calm and colorful and both idea of the film is shown: First, the animals are somehow like us; second, we the humans are somehow like them. Then the story goes and goes till the original story and the see trip. We have been told two stories. Two good stories, and both are unprovable. Then we should choose what story is better, and we see that this is an irony, because we find out that in the real life, we should choose between two stories too, and that is simply fascinating.<br/><br/>Also the role of the principle animal, tiger, is very important. In one story he (honestly I didn't know the tiger was either ""he"" or ""she"" but I say ""he"" because they called him Richard Parker) is the main reason to keep awake the conciseness of pi and therefor to keep alive him. In the other story, he is the pi himself, and what we see in first story is indeed the symbols of pi's actions. So the idea of animals are people and people are animals also narrated very well and cleverly in this movie. <br/><br/>I want say another two things. One is that the idea of interchanging used in everywhere of Life of Pi, like ""a Canadian who's come to French India in search of a story"" and ""l know an Indian in French Canada with the most incredible story to tell."" And the other thing is I saw ""All Is Lost"" before this movie and this two movies are so different with each other."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","11 February 2015"," A touch overrated, but not a bad film by any means
","I don't think this film would have gotten as much hype if it hadn't happened to hit the 3D wave at precisely the right time. Because, while it's a gorgeous movie, and one of the best 3D experiences to date, its story doesn't match its visual splendor.<br/><br/>The setting is definitely imaginative. A young man, survivor of a sunken ship, is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger of all things. Together they must face the horror, beauty and mystery of wide open sea to reach solid land once again. I just don't think they do everything they could have done with such a premise. It's outlandish enough that you can pretty much kiss any sense of realism goodbye. And to its credit, the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and the unreliable narrator the film utilizes only adds to this while neatly explaining all the weird aspects of the story. Yet most of the time is spent following the main character around on the boat as he tries to not get eaten alive by the tiger. That's interesting, sure, but not really Oscar-worthy, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Had they done something more out there, it would have kept me entertained far better. Now there are some things they encounter at the sea that are very cool to look and and also imaginative enough to arouse my interest. I say some, because more often than not it's one or the another. Either it's absolutely gorgeous or it's interesting on an idea level. It should be both more often than not.<br/><br/>In the end that means I think this is a good film. Not great, but good. It's definitely worth a watch and I can see why so many people enjoyed it as much as they did. Alas, without easy access to 3D experience, it doesn't have that rewatch potential a great movie needs to have."

","The movie introduced the audience to the amazingly introspective world of the Indian youth Pi by showing a picturesque colonial India and in a narrative interjected with the humour of that era. Spectators were drawn into the interesting and enchanting journey of the main protagonist as he went in search of faith, as he dealt with campus bullying and as he trod lightly on the path of love. All this but to set the scene for Pi's fight for survival as he embarked on the magical trip afloat on the treacherous seas after the tragic shipwreck. The sheer vastness and despair of this one youth combating the elements amidst endless waters was heartrending. Disregarding the intriguing symbolism of the tiger, Pi's efforts to turn foe to partner by following the survival guidebook were amusing. As always, one could expect astounding visual effects with Ang Lee's productions - his light plays, the flying fish ""stampede"", the whale's fluorescent dance, the Fantasia of night sea creatures, the carnivorous oasis, etc. - were filmed to impress, and impress they did. Some found the ""real-life"" version a disillusion and, like the writer, started interpreting all scenes anew (men the ultimate carnivores, the vegetarian's killing spree and cannibalism, learning to face one's inner demons, etc. ) - but that, to me, would be denuding this wonderful production of its enchanting quality.

","The movie has to be awed for its visual brilliance and spectacular 3D effects. Some fast movement of tiger are not well done and looks like a cheap and sloppy animation. Otherwise watching tiger on screen is just a fantastic and spiritual experience and feeling the majestic beast, like, so close.<br/><br/>At start of the movie there are some good 3D treat with great depth involved for some immersive experience especially with lots of animals. Some birds flying and a monitor lizard swiveling its head left and right gives a amazing close-up experience and tempts you to touch them. There is a scene in Piscine Molitor swimming pool of France, where camera is facing the clear blue sky. But suddenly a swimmer swims across and then we realize it is shot from inside the swimming pool. That scene is amazing. When Pi Patel is thrown off the lifeboat and he is inside the ocean drowning a bit he sees the sinking ship. Watching the sinking ship at far end with Pi watching in middle of the screen makes you believe as if you are watching the sinking ship along with him. There are still more amazing scenes which cannot be explained like the arrival of school of flying fishes, the poisonous pool at night on the mysterious floating island, etc.<br/><br/>The story starts with the boy searching for God through various religions. He survives the shipwreck and drifts lonely into the sea, albeit sharing lifeboat along with a zebra, orangutan, hyena and the fearsome Bengal tiger. This takes audience to a marvelous journey of boy's survival on the sea with the company of a tiger. But ends with boy revealing disturbing events that (really supposed to have)occurred on the lifeboat with no animals involved.<br/><br/>I assume that the theme of believing in God in the movie, is implied by saying that the boy must have miraculously survived against all odds in the huge Pacific ocean for 200+ days.<br/><br/>On the whole watching this movie is a magical experience and do not miss till you have chance to watch it in 3D format in theaters and better chose the middle seat on last row for some most enjoyable 3D experience."

","Ang Lee isn't thought of as an Asian auteur in the class of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Yimou or Lee Chang-dong. He's actually more of a commercial director than a personal artist, but what he does in this masterpiece is miraculous.<br/><br/>Perhaps no director has ever captured the beauty and fear of the power of life, and when you look deep into the eyes of the tiger ""Richard Parker"", you see what Marlowe saw in Kurtz's eyes in Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"": a power so vast it dwarfs you into an awareness of your mortality, showing you your own inescapable insignificance beside the powers of all life.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful, primarily Infan Khan, one of India's greatest actors who plays the adult Pi. Khan provides an entire acting course just in the way he uses his face, displaying a smile in the film's climax that rivals the Mona Lisa's in its ambiguity. You see the world of pain, guilt, joy and sadness in his delicate expression.<br/><br/>While the film is supremely spiritual in every frame, if one is paying attention, it winds up as somewhat of a Trojan Horse in what it ultimate reveals about religion. I'm not going to provide a spoiler here, but there are five words spoken by the adult Pi at the end of the film that viewers seem to miss that spell it out.<br/><br/>But moving away from its theme, no film I have ever seen in my life comes close to ""Life of Pi"" in relating the sheer force of nature (making you really experience first-hand the beauty and terror in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic splendor of our world, both inner and outer. Using 3-D more brilliantly (and essentially) than any film to date, this film burned into my mind incredible visual sights impossible to find anywhere else, showing me beauty I will remember the rest of my life. 10/10."
"aandrewhops","9","0","2","1 October 2014"," Great, Philosophical Film
","The entire film Life of Pi is told in a past tense perspective of the survivor Pi Piscine himself. However, although it seems as though it is just a tale about human survival, a plethora of deep themes are addressed along the way. One of these themes includes the supposed battle between the opposites of reality and inner thought. Most would agree that it would be extremely hard to stay sane throughout a near year long journey without any human interaction at all. Furthermore, because all that is around is open sea and the boat, it would be almost impossible to differentiate what is going on in real life, and what is just hallucination or dream. However, the nature of reality says that it is only one's own perception of the world around him or her, which means that if Pi believes some of the alleged hallucinations or made up stories about his trip, then they are in fact a reality to him. Because nobody else was there, nobody could tell him what was or was not what society calls 'reality'.<br/><br/>Later on in the fable, Pi wakes up only to find himself landed on a mysterious green island inhabited by meerkats. The island is prosperous; all of the trees and roots double as edible yams, and the water on the island is cool, sweet, and clear. Even Richard Parker finds nutrition by eating the wild meerkats that live there. However, as dusk coming, Pi observes that all the meerkats run from the center of the island where the water springs are located, to the edge of the island in the trees where there is no water at all. Confused at first, Pi follows the meerkats to the trees and sleeps there for the night, only to find in unraveling a bloom of flowers a human tooth buried within. This is where Pi cracks the mystery: the island is carnivorous. During the night time, the sweet pools of fresh water turn into acidic chemicals that quickly erode anything in them. In this scene, we see that carcasses of fish rise to the surface. Furthermore, the roots of the trees near the pools entangle anything on them, only to engulf the body of whoever or whatever is standing on them. In finding the tooth, Pi comes to the realization that this 'refuge' of unlimited nutrients is really just a taunting mind game, because the longer he stays, the more likely it is that he will be consumed by the island, never to be found again. In other words, ""It's an island that can consume you if you're not careful. Meaning, if you appease yourself with physical comfort – all the food and drink you want – it turns into a type of spiritual death"" (Shmoop 1). Although he spent so many days at sea already, Pi decides that even though he might be able to physically stay alive on the island for a long time, he would only be in a purgatory between life and his inevitable death. So, Pi calls Richard Parker to the boat, loads it with all the water and sweet potatoes he can, and sets sail.<br/><br/>When Pi finally gets back to the world, he is so overwhelmed by the experience that all he can do is lay with his face against the warm Mexican sand and weep. Though, Richard Parker sees it differently. When the boat hits land Richard Parker gets out, stretches a little bit, and then seamlessly walks into the jungle, without even a look to Pi to let him know he was there. This, to Pi, is by far the worst part of the journey. He had not been allowed the opportunity to any sort of closure with his companion that he had been at sea for 227 days with. Nevertheless, Pi is brought back to a hospital where he is cared for and looked over, and shortly after is questioned by the insurance company of the sunken freighter. They ruthlessly ask him what happened, but after Pi tells them, they do not believe it. No matter how many times Pi explains the entire story, and how he does not know how the ship sank, the insurance agents just do not buy it. So, when they ask for the 'real' story yet again, Pi tells them that there was no Bengal Tiger in the boat with him. Along with cutting out Richard Parker, he cuts out the mysterious island from the new story as well. The insurance agents seem pleased, but when the real life reporter interviewing Pi hears this, he draws a parallel. As a child, Pi's father said, ""Animals do not think like we do. People who forget that, get themselves killed. That tiger is not your friend. When you look into his eyes, you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you. Nothing else""(Lee). This brings about so many questions that are at the center of the film's essence, but one of the most important is this: Was Richard Parker actually real, or was he just Pi's perception of his own emotions staring back at him? Although one could rant for hours about the symbolism and meaning behind every single aspect of Life of Pi, I insist that this is the most important because it is by far the most relatable. Not only does it draw to surface the battle of reality versus imagination, but it shows to viewers that they can in fact be one in the same. Even though many skeptics will still ask which story is the 'real' one, the truth is that, ""Life of Pi is all real, second by second and minute by minute, and what it finally amounts to is left for every viewer to decide""(Ebert). Perhaps if everyone thought of life this way, there would not be such a difference between alleged opposites of life."

","The unique part in this movie is being friendly to dangerous Bengal tiger also surviving in the sea by eating some Biscuts, water and raw fish.It is entertaining because he makes lot of things by some amount of wood . The technical side of the movie is he learns many survival skills with some resources.The idea of the movie is Original because a ship could sink and it shows,what all happens in the sea which could happen in our daily life.The director of this movie tries to convey that how to manage in the situation like what was shown in the movie and also be friendly to every one like Pi'Patel to Richard Parker. the graphics are just epic and the story but sad part is he lost his mom and dad and his elder brother when a ship sunk...."

","Well, actually, despite going to church nearly every Sunday I don't know exactly how it is ""with God"", but it was a good line towards the end of the movie. I'm giving this a qualified ten, which doesn't make much sense, but I found a lot about this movie somewhat hard to follow. On the other hand I found much of this movie very haunting and that is often a good thing. I guess the best advice is to sit back and accept the somewhat different perspective of the movie and enjoy the mind-blowing cinematography as Pi and ""his"" tiger Richard Parker coexist on a lifeboat and attached raft at sea. I think it's great when something unusual (and slowly paced, in its own way) hits it big in the box office, so much of what is out now is just the same old rehashed junk from other ""popular"" stuff. The beginning of the movie is too harsh for me but once we get down to just Pi and Richard things are magical. I can't embrace the universal religious philosophy but what is presented is positive and upbeat and permeates the entire movie. Nice job on a good story."

","Life of Pi is a deep, exquisite film and of the most beautiful films of recent years. It's a complex, layered film, but it tells a story that does not complicate things and that is a rarity. The story is deep and has meaning to it and I feel this movie will strike with the religious crowd as well as the normal audience. That being said, this movie is gorgeous and features beautiful cinematography. I despise 3D, but even I must admit 3D is used wonderfully here which draws comparison to 2009's Avatar.<br/><br/>Ang Lee, the masterful director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, tells a tale about a guy named Pi. After a typhoon destroys his boat and kills his family, he is stranded at sea with nothing but a tiger to keep him company.<br/><br/>This film doesn't have any big names here, but I think the acting is sufficient. Irrfan Khan is good as adult Pi who is telling his story. Suraj Sharma is decent as young Pi, but sometimes he is a little annoying. But as a one-man show, one should accept his actions.<br/><br/>Overall, Life of Pi is a gorgeous, brilliant film that requires some thinking maybe even a religious background to feel the fullest effect. I was moved by this movie very much and it deserves all the accolades it can get. The CGI animals are well-done, especially the Bengal tiger. The score is hauntingly beautiful and the same can be said about Pi's lullaby. There are so many metaphors in this movie, so be prepared to be challenged. One of the best films of 2012. I rate this film 10/10."
"jonathan-vergucht","9","0","2","26 March 2014"," Amazing movie
","I enjoyed the film, it was easy to follow and there were several thrilling moments where you didn't know what was going to happen. And there is more than just the plot, the film has a deeper meaning.<br/><br/>They used a lot of music and the music and the story are fitting perfect together. They make sure that there is no space for any uncomfortable silents and that the music is used to reinforce your thoughts of what is going to happen. The music makes several scenes very mysterious, like the scene on the open ocean with the water that's glowing when Pi touched it. In other scenes the music makes you sit on the edge of your seat because something might happen. <br/><br/>For example when Richard, the tiger, is in the boat and Pi on his raft en Pi pulls the rope so his raft gets closer to the boat, the music makes you a little nervous and on the moment he looks under the sail he saw Richard lying on the bottom and Richard started growling at him. <br/><br/>The animations they used where beautiful, like when Pi looked down into the water after he saw that Richard was staring at the water he saw so many things, the universe, the drowned animals and finally on the bottom he saw the boat. That was a magical moment. <br/><br/>And don't let us forget the best animation of them all, Richard, the tiger, fully computer animated and barely noticeable that it isn't a real tiger. His movements, his eyes, just everything is perfect and if you can only imagine how difficult it is to combine human and animated for a full film.<br/><br/>They thought about even the smallest detail. Even the clothes of every character fit perfect to the situation and how it is and would be in reality. The actors did their job extremely well. The actors brought the emotions and mental state of Pi like if it would be happening for real.<br/><br/>Different than you would expect, the film isn't about friendship, but about faith. Like the reporter told Pi: ""They said you could tell me a story that will make me believe in God."" <br/><br/>It isn't about wrestling with a tiger till you win and become ""friends"", it is about finding your own way how hard it even might be to believe in God. The first thing you notice about that is that Pi when he was young and couldn't choose between the religions. But the whole story is a parable. Richard his original name is ""Thirsty"" and how can you be thirsty in the middle of the ocean. Knowing that in Hindu culture water symbolizes 'the ocean of life' and that Pi, short for Piscine which is French for swimming pool, can hold the water. And then the animals, they all represent someone and they each have their own meaning: the tiger actually is Pi, who doesn't know how to believe in God. The orangutan represents his mother, and a mother's love is eternal, so the orangutan stands for eternal love. The brutal hyena represents the characteristics of the brutal cook and the wounded zebra is the wounded young sailor and represents the innocence of youth and how fragile life can be. <br/><br/>But why Pi told two stories instead of just one, you will have to see the film yourself and I guarantee you it will be worth it."

The only explanation I could come up with is that the story - the one that has the tiger in it - was symbolic .. the novelist himself explained that by matching the characters .. the hyena is the cook , the zebra is the sailor , the orangutan is Pi's mother , and of course the tiger is Pi .<br/><br/>I thought it was very brilliant to show that humans could be sometimes animalistic in their actions if they were put in circumstances that stimulates their instincts , such as hunger , thirst , feeling unsafe , etc.<br/><br/>And as we've seen, maternal instinct overcomes other instincts , and the only character that faced its animalistic symbol was Pi ..<br/><br/>So , I think that the whole story was to show us the facing between 2 different pictures of man .. evil and good .<br/><br/>Also I've been impressed by directing , acting ..

","Life of Pi is not solely a visual masterpiece. Its heart is in an emotionally stirring tale of God's redemption and grace through strange means and persons, in this case a tiger named Richard Parker. The animation that brings the tiger to life is more spectacular than any other effects sequence in the movie and allows us to form an emotional bond with the tiger. The reckless courage that Pi embodies is perfectly portrayed by newcomer Suraj Sharma. He brings an emotional depth that does not leave the movie stranded in its ocean of visual amazement (yes, pun intended). Ang Lee has created a masterpiece that is both emotionally rewarding and visually perplexing at the same time--a feat that is often not even attempted by most current directors. This is the best kind of movie and the most impressive as well. Kudos to you, Mr. Lee. Please continue to amaze us."

You are getting sucked into the movie, it's so realistic as for the colours and audio. At the end there is an interesting line which I not going to say because of spoilers, but the setting just fits. There is one thing I found annoying about this movie: The stupidity of the kid. He makes one foolish act after each other, but does manage to make a fishing rod and some other stuff where you do have to have some brains to think that it out. It kind of does not really fit in, on the one hand he seems smart, but on the other hand he is really stupid. Seems like a contradiction, but I think you will just have to accept that.

Being on a rocking boat got on my nerves, because I have poor vision, and it took great effort to focus in on the action on-screen. The zebra didn't deserve to be 'hunted' as it was, and savaged so, even though it's done out of sight. The shipwreck itself was done well, though I'd have had a hair more human panic involved.

","Told in the style of a story-within-a-story (very Heart of Darkness, the original novel) a middle aged man tells two stories (to a visiting journalist) of how he - as a teenager - survived a shipwreck thanks to a lifeboat. But which does the listener believe? The standard version or a very bizarre version involving circus animals? <br/><br/>In the ""bizarre"" a boy (Suraj Sharma) is set adrift on a lifeboat with only a wild tiger for proper company. The tiger being part of a zoo being transported to Canada. The tale of how they get along and/or both survive takes over most of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>What an unlikely premise for a film this is! I came to it with an open mind and left it with a bit of an open mind too. Lots of thrills and spills and the usual special effects wham-bams which modern cinema has to offer (I didn't see it in 3D) but I am not sure what this was supposed to be about (other than basic survival) or why it needed to be structured the way it was.<br/><br/>The set-up is simply tedious and since the production seemed to want to shout its central novelty from the rooftops it became a bit of a wrist glancer as it worked its way towards this - inevitable - central novelty. Either we get to know the people well (think The Deer Hunter) or don't bother at all. I mean GÃ©rard Depardieu in a cameo role? For what purpose? <br/><br/>The central character is mad as a bat anyway. He goes out on deck in a storm with nothing on but a shirt. Do you know how cold it is in the middle of an ocean? He dances about as the cross waves crash over him. Oh what fun it is to have ice cold waves crash over you! Laugh a minute.<br/><br/>Given there is little else to see or talk about (and I don't want to start spoilers) how does a wild tiger (who only feeds on land anyway) catch anything from a boat. And how much fresh water does it need a day. Apart from lots? Not very realistic to nature is it? <br/><br/>Like War and Peace is something about Russia this is something about religion. I suppose people who escape disaster tend to believe in God more than those who don't. Might just be luck though.<br/><br/>The good thing is that I found it generally entertaining. And Shama is solid, although he doesn't have to do much other than be thrown around in front of a green screen. Would be very tedious to watch twice (apart from seeing in its intended 3D on a big screen) and that is the best acid test of a good movie."

","With a mouth of word publicity and the fact that the movie got 11 nominations in Oscars ""Life is Pi"" had gained an enormous attention during its release. The film is based on a Booker prize winning novel of a teenage Indian boy who gets adrift in a ship wreckage with a zebra, hyena, Orangutan, and a Bengal tiger competing for a fierce battle of survival. The film starts as a family drama on Indian culture, but within few reels the film delves into its main theme on survival. And on this aspect, the film somehow resembles ""Cast Away."" The difference is ""Cast Away"" projects the power of a star to hold your attention in the survival game whereas in 'Life of Pi"" the specialty is the camera work and the special effects that hold your attention. The shots with the animals like the sequence of the hyena, orangutan and zebra or the shots with the Richard Parker (the tiger) are just mesmerizing.

The intro with images from the zoo is a lovely herald to that.<br/><br/>The religious aspect, quite dominantly present in the book, is toned down and charming, even though it is inevitably a simplification.

Also, it's simply very good filmmaking and the entire time on the life raft is surprisingly captivating.

","This is one movie I was looking forward to watching so much, I plunked down full price for the 3D blu-ray version expecting my mind to be blown.<br/><br/>I really should have researched what the movie was about, though. I'd assumed that the marketing was accurate - that the movie would be about a boy and a tiger that survive together at sea but have fantastic adventures. Judging by the adverts, I wrongly assumed that this was more of an action/fantasy kind of movie. It is rated PG, after all.<br/><br/>I was not prepared for many things about this movie. I was not prepared for the case of doldrums this movie gave me. The way it ended was absolutely depressing. I was not prepared for the theological exposure, either. I don't think movie makers realize that not everyone finds religious dialog meaningful or necessary. But most of all, I'm a fan of family movies where adventures take you AWAY from all the pointless arguments of religion. As a PG-rated movie, I was expecting something more kid-friendly.<br/><br/>This goes to show that you should do your homework before buying a permanent copy of a movie. Had I taken ten minutes and googled and read what the book was about, I probably would have made the better decision to watch the 2D version digitally and been done with it.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie three stars, and here is why:<br/><br/>One star for superb acting - there's not a character in this movie that didn't seem real. They picked a great star for the movie. He kept me watching until the end, so that counts for something.<br/><br/>One star for visuals - the visuals are pretty good. I wouldn't say stunning, though. I'm beginning to learn that when a movie is marketed as a ""visual masterpiece"" it usually means they pull out all the stops for camera tricks and CGI to make up for other things it might lack.<br/><br/>And one more star for substance - yes this movie has a lot of substance. Most movies lack substance but this one has enough for at least five movies. <br/><br/>So I'm not giving this movie three stars because it's a bad movie. It's not completely a bad movie - but it misses the mark for entertainment. ""Life of Pi"" is disenchanting and depressing. It's one thing to have a movie facilitate raw human emotion, it's another to be a buzzkill."
"csengide","8","0","2","29 November 2013"," Beautiful allegory..
","This movie is truly a stunning work of art and the novel that inspired it goes into depths that many of us rarely explore. It draws emotions throughout and the beautiful cinematography and special effects make fantasy come to life. The story bursts with hidden meanings and metaphors designed to evoke memories and feelings from your subconscious that you may have buried long ago, and parts of it - symbolically - will almost certainly overlap distinct times in anyone's lives.<br/><br/>However I was left feeling unsatisfied.. I found the author and creator, the man who gave birth to all this wonder a lonely man - and I feel it deeply throughout his story. From a psychological perspective, perhaps a man who wants unconditional love but can't give it, someone who would choose the blue pill instead of digging deeper and finding answers to the complex questions he asks himself. He desperately seeks to find the soul and the divinity in the world - yet when a roadblock shows itself he gives up and feels he has to choose between rationality & spirituality, reality & divinity. Therein lies his struggle. <br/><br/>Once we are able to step away and see the big picture, understand that cause has effect - and that there is no evil in that - we will find release. The adult Pi suggests that God is a choice of self delusion to make the harsh realities of life easier to digest. Consider the possibility that our search for harmony in all its reality, through actions, holy books, and everything else that exists out there is part of what we call ""God"" - and we form an active part of it. The concept of the divine is not out there to satisfy a need we have, it is there to inspire us to be it and to make the world more like it. If the tiger is seen as having the main purpose of keeping us alive and not a creature we truly love and wish to give comfort to, it is not going to look back and give a thanking roar before it walks away, and it will not give us peace. This is a metaphor of my own.<br/><br/>I find it ironic that one of the main pillars of the movie is faith and hope, yet they seem to be portrayed as simply a means for survival and self delusion, and true faith is exactly what is renounced in the final metaphor and ending phrase. <br/><br/>I'm sure the author was able to use this beautiful and complex story as a way of expressing his internal struggle - but I'm afraid he was not able to find piece by the end of it. I'd love to read something from him later in his life, where Pi allows himself to cry, to mourn, to be honest - and still find divinity in all the world's mess and reality, and in a tiger's hunger.."

","An amazing visual spectacle. A film made to see in 3D. A gripping tale of boy stranded in the sea with a tiger for 277 days, and how his belief in god becomes either stronger or whether's away. My personal most favorite film of the year, a must watch film, just do not miss it!!!!<br/><br/>Films main plot: Pi is raised a Hindu who practices vegetarianism. As a fourteen-year-old he investigates Christianity and Islam and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, saying he ""just wants to love God.""[10][11] He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion and comes to recognize benefits in each one. Shifting government policies lead to a decision by Pi's father to sell the zoo and emigrate with his wife and two sons to Canada. The second part of the novel begins with Pi's family aboard the Tsimtsum, the Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America. A few days out of port from Manila, the ship encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat, only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan. To Pi's distress, the hyena soon kills the zebra and then the orangutan. At this point Pi learns that a 450-pound Bengal tiger has been hiding under the boat's tarpaulin: Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself. The tiger kills and eats the hyena. Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the stern of the boat and retreats to it. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer and seasickness as a punishment mechanism while using a whistle for signals. Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal and is eventually able to share the boat with Richard Parker. Pi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean. At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind, feeble and unable to catch fish. In a state of delirium he talks with a marine ""echo"" that he eventually identifies as Richard Parker finally speaking up, then identifies as another survivor on another lifeboat who is also blinded by exposure and dying. They share dreams of food. The other voice speaks with a French accent and prefers meat to the vegetarian fare Pi longs for. Pi welcomes this ""brother"" aboard his boat. The other person moves to attack and eat Pi but is instead devoured by Richard Parker, who springs out at him from under the tarpaulin. Later, his sight restored, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae and inhabited by meerkats. Pi gains strength but his discovery that the island's plant life is carnivorous forces him to return to the boat. Two hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico. Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without a glance back. The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as fishing bait, then kills the sailor and Pi's mother for food. Pi then kills the cook and dines on him. The officials note parallels between the two stories and conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proved and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck. He asks the officials which story they prefer. They choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says ""And so it goes with God."""

","Visually stunning I will admit. Irrfan Khan is fantastic in his part. These are the only highlights as the story is in my opinion overrated and very boring. I could not help that the film's overall message was that if you are not a person of faith in a higher being then you are bad person . I dislike people with attitudes like this. Whether or not you have faith in a particular religion or a higher power a person should not be judged by this characteristic which is what this film does. This is how I have interpreted this film and for all I know that may not be the overall message of the film but that is the way that it comes across to me. With that aside I could not help but find many similarities with Tim Burton's magnificent film Big Fish. This film (and I am assuming the novel that it is based on) feels like one big rip off of Big Fish. I like Ang Lee's films but this is by far his worst and in my opinion stole the Oscar nomination for best director from Ben Affleck (who definitely should have won). Do yourself a favour and watch Big Fish, it's a much better film."
"avik-kumar-si","7","0","1","14 October 2013"," Ang Lee's Masterpiece, in 3D
","Life of Pi is the latest offering from Oscar-winning director Ang Lee. The film is based on the novel with an identical title by Yann Martel.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is one terrific example of being a meaningful film which does not get immersed in its indulgence of visual splendor despite being amazing in its abundant offerings of stunning cinematic tricks replete with the latest that technology can offer. This was the first movie in 3D that I watched, having held back till now waiting for something which met the above criteria, and I am happy I did! The story is about how a teen-aged boy, nicknamed Pi, survives 227 days at sea on a lifeboat with scarce supplies of food following a shipwreck. This remarkable story is rendered fantastic by the fact that for the major part of this period, this boy had an adult Bengal tiger as his only company on the boat.<br/><br/>The film brings this story to life into a glorious adventure film mid-ocean and 3D does add another dimension to the portrayal, literally as well as figuratively. Especially noteworthy are two sequences of a school of flying fish storming the boat, and a nocturnal sighting of a whale, gigantic in its size and beauty.<br/><br/>The cast includes Irrfan Khan and Tabu, two notable actors from India, who bring all their skills to the table. The newcomer in the lead role is excellent too. To conclude, Life of Pi is an entertaining and remarkable depiction of an imagined pie from the life of an otherwise ordinary man with an interesting tale to tell.<br/><br/>Warning: Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>Of course, the story has more to it than the parable-like surface. The boy and the tiger can remind one of Calvin and Hobbes, but this was far more grim, far more intense, though the interactions had their fun at times as the unusual bond gradually grew in adversarial circumstances forcing a semi-symbiotic existence. The pinnacle of the tale surely lies in the revelation of an alternate version, which clearly seems far more credible but also difficult to digest at the same time. Interestingly, Ang Lee chooses to have only a verbal narration of this version rather than a visual representation of this second string of events, perhaps playing to the theme of this being too unpalatable to qualify for a full-fledged normal viewing."

","It is 2012 when I first watched this movie. Actually ""Life of Pi"" brings another sub-genre of adventure movie, when survival meets the moral value of life. Yes, it is one of the best survival film I've ever watched. But, what is the point is, I think Ang Lee failed to give moral value in every single survival scene.<br/><br/>The audiences are little bit confused, when Pi started to cast away. Like me, I was confused, what was the point of being cast away in the ocean with a Bengal tiger. I mean, it is the fear I should get from that scene or the implicit message of that scene. At last, I only got the fear and excitement from it.<br/><br/>Another part that makes this movie still amazing is the visual effects. For a cast away movie, this work of visual effects is a great work. I expect for a next generation of ""Life of Pi""."

","This movie is very famous around the world, because of getting an Academy Award in 2010. I do not know which is true this story is a fantasy or an unadorned fact. Which story do you want to believe? A fantastic and unbelievable story is that a main character is called ""pi"" and the other character are a lion, king of beasts, a chimpanzee, a zebra and a hyena. They are in a wrecked ship long time. They kill each other, but only Pi and the lion narrowly survive. They drift for day after day. They meet a fish school and get food, and they arrive the strange island by a miraculous. The other story is that this is a very realistic story, so you can believe easily. In this story, the animals replaced by people who are his mother, cook, and a injuring leg person. And Pi do not go to the wonderful island. He drifts all days that's all. I can not bring myself to believe such a thing, but Pi says that believe it or not, but it is true. So I believe an incredible and adventuresome story. Many people do not take his words. Which story do you believe is personal liberty. He believes in three religions in same time, this is out of the ordinary. ""Usually, people believe only one religion."" and also ""glorify heathen god does not means a religionists but an unbeliever"" his father says. I think so too, however he believes in Chiristianity, Islam and Hinduism. So, he is a vegetarian but one day he must kill fish by himself and eat it during drifting, his face reveals the depth of his anguish. The story explains his life about that why he is attracted each religions, and how does he think about believing three heathen gods. How about watching this movie at it from a different angle of the religion?"

","As cinema this works. It didn't appeal to me when it first came out and so I just now watched it and I couldn't stop watching it because I wanted to see how the story ended. That must mean that as a film it works, does its job of holding an audience. I normally hate CGI but here it is used to excellent effect to create a magical world. Most of the sets must be CGI. The animal animation is amazing - very life-like though obviously and thankfully not.<br/><br/>I think I agree with the criticisms that it says very little, nothing new at all but makes you think you are watching something spiritual. I suppose that is also because the main character is experiencing heart felt emotions so we go along with that and empathise. It didn't get me nearer to God that's just the film ""trick"" to get you interested. On the other hand there is something mystical going on and most obviously with his relationship with the Tiger. He idealistically thought a wild animal had a soul like his but does eventually realise that a tiger cannot be tamed, only trained. And the ending does not sentimentalise that fact so that was a plus.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching."
"kgprophet","7","0","1","30 July 2013"," A Fantasy the may become a Classic
","The word was this book was unfilmable. After finally watching this movie, having not read the book, I can certainly see why. Most of the cast members are animals, who must look and for the most part act like animals. Although you can train some animals, to get them to act on cue is not easy. While watching this movie the pacing was impeccable, meaning the actions of the animals were not reasonable for actual live animals. There are scenes where a human and 2 animals are interacting on a boat. There is no hesitation, the animals appear to hit their marks perfectly, and the three characters create drama nonetheless.<br/><br/>To accomplish this feat, you cannot possibly work with live animals. That meant the animals I was watching on the screen I know were CGI. But save for a couple places, perhaps mostly with the hyena, the effects were undetectable. I have never seen any existing animals (dinosaurs and fictional Avatar beasts not included) rendered by CGI that looked real. I think of the digital wolves in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", or the beings in ""I am Legend"". Then I realised that Ang Lee went through great efforts many years ago for ""Hulk"" to get more natural movements from the CGI models. Even though that film was a flop, his expertise in working with these effects benefited the making of ""Life of Pi"". With so much at stake at these effects being believable, I am utterly amazed that this film was greenlit. It is such an achievement, there is no doubt that it deserved Academy Awards for effects, cinematography, and direction. The look throughout the film (except for a couple shots near the end) when the tale is being told, has a vivid other-world look to it. Most notable are the effects with water. Although the splashes and waves come off as real (which is probably one of the most difficult effects to produce), the photogenic quality of animals water was surreal in the clarity. And the variety of animals - whales, sharks, flying fish, along with the magnificent looking tiger, were impressive.<br/><br/>Aside from the technical achievement, the story is a fresh entry in the big budget film world. With no stars, and offbeat story of a boy whose father owns a zoo, plays as a series of anecdotes. Only after we are on a ship with the boy and the animals, does the main story of being stranded on a lifeboat play it's way through. Another aspect to the story, perhaps thought unfilmable for the sake of extended interest, were the many days that pass on the lifeboat adrift at sea.<br/><br/>Ang Lee solved this by making the look and feel of every scene seem magical. Such as the boy learning to fish. The camera travels underwater, overhead, and everywhere else. There never is a dull shot. There were some obvious 3D motivated shots, and I believe the film could have benefited from a 3D showing, although I did not see it in the theatre.<br/><br/>This is Ang Lee's best film, and I predict that this film will be considered a classic in the years to come."
"sagghoffnung","7","0","1","26 July 2013"," VISUAL EFFECT good, acting OK
","here are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).<br/><br/>LEE DIREcts the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. <br/><br/>Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. <br/><br/>The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it."

","First of all, I must say I believe in God and I came across the book when I was in India on a spiritual journey. I watched the film afterward, after coming home, to see if the movie had do any justice to the spiritual theme. It did not, I think...<br/><br/>I must admit that the visuals are spectacular as many reviewers have already pointed out, and I also found the acting all right, but I truly believe this story lacks the core, or rather it MISSES the point it has claimed it wanted to convey!<br/><br/>So I give only 3/10 because come on, spirit is missing from this story! How can they claim anyone will believe in God after seeing this?! Mentioning His name some times in the film won't cause any miracles! This whole conclusion of story is only about a mental trick to cope with a traumatic incident! It may be symbolic and the end may be heart-wrenching (in a bad, sad way, I think), but it is just a pseudo-spiritual, inconsistent, dark story which confuses but never uplifts!<br/><br/>I must admit, in the beginning the story really dealt with the religious theme more, but as soon as Pi got shipwrecked, it all was like switching to a completely another story... Oh, and it felt even too slow and uneventful... Both during the book and the film. And I still don't really understand what they wanted to symbolize by that strange island. It was so out-of-place.<br/><br/>I think it is unfair to advertise this as spiritual, uplifting, finding-God-by-watching-it... It's a mistaken, over-rated hype. I'm glad if it added anything valuable to anyone who has watched it, but all I felt was that the writer wasn't really sure what he wanted to write about..."

","Certainly a spectacle of jaw dropping visuals however this film offers so much more than that. Life of Pi is a great example of how skillful direction can allow a film to include many larger than life themes and yet stay focused on the story its telling. The film never once goes over board on its use of CGI, in fact it only demonstrates that when a director actually understands visual effects they can actually become another storytelling tool, like when a bunch of Iron Man suits are hitting each other. Having never seen a HFR (high frame rate) 3D feature I am still not a believer in the format, having said that, this film uses the tool very interestingly but I still don't think it adds anything to any of the emotional elements of the film. Life of Pi has a lot of soul and immediately gets personal with its audience and with the exception of an ever so slightly rushed ending, the film never lets you down. <br/><br/>I highly recommend that you see Life of Pi. I also feel that this film should have won best picture over Argo, as good as that movie was, in my opinion there is no comparison."
"gregjudy-1","8","0","3","3 June 2013"," A Christian Perspective of Life of Pi
","It is not uncommon for a Hollywood produced movie to question spirituality, the existence of God, and supremacy of religion, but rarely are these doubts projected in such a powerful way as they are in Ang Lee's Life of Pi. The Oscar winning film is based on Yann Martel's 2001 novel of the same name. The movie centers around a 17-year old Indian boy named Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel, the son of a zoo keeper, who survives a shipwreck aboard a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Prior to the shipwreck, Pi, who was raised Hindu by his mother, had experimented with both Christianity and Islam. Pi discovers Christianity and Islam and incorporates the philosophies of these faiths into his Hindu lifestyle, culture, and spiritual pursuit. For example, in his prayers, Pi thanks Krishna for the salvation and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Pi's father, who has thoroughly rejected any religion, thinks that Pi is ridiculous and actually says something that seems to make the most sense of anything in the movie. Pi's father tells him, ""Believing in everything at the same time is the same as believing in nothing at all."" However, throughout the film, Pi's father is cast in a negative light. Pi's father decides to move his family, and his animals, by ship from India to Canada to start a new life. But a savage storm ensues and the ship sinks, killing all its passengers, save for a few animals and Pi.<br/><br/>After the shipwreck, Pi shares a lifeboat with a zebra, who suffered a broken leg, a female orangutan, who lost all her children in the wreck, and a cackling hyena. Before long, the hyena gets scared and hungry and begins to attack the defenseless zebra. The hyena kills the zebra and then begins to attack and kill the orangutan. While the hyena is in the process of killing the orangutan, Richard Parker jumps out from underneath a tarp and kills the hyena, while also trying to kill Pi as well. Pi then builds an inflatable life raft and attaches it by rope to the side of the lifeboat in order to distance himself from the tiger. But he knows that tigers are very good swimmers, so he catches fish in order to keep Richard Parker fed and to prevent the tiger from eating him.<br/><br/>Amazingly, Pi and Richard Parker are able to both stay alive as their lifeboat washes up to shore in Mexico. While recovering in a hospital bed, Pi must tell his story to two of the ship's insurance adjusters who have come to question him about the incident in which no one survived but himself. Pi tells them his fantastic tale of how he survived 227 days in the Pacific Ocean with a hungry Bengal tiger. The insurance adjusters don't believe Pi. They ask him to give them ""the truth"". Pi then gives them a similar story, but changes the animal characters to humans, casting the tiger as himself. The insurance company chooses the more fantastic story with the animals, to which Pi responds, ""And so it goes with God"".<br/><br/>This movie is the embodiment of post-modern philosophy and thought. The prevailing sentiment of post-modernity is that there is no ultimate truth. Everyone must choose their own truth and must not infringe their truth on others. All religions lead to the same truth. Pi seems to emphasize that we are to choose the story that we like the best and believe that one, although it will ultimately lead you on the same path as the other stories and religions. Everyone's spiritual path leads to the same outcome. Everyone worships the same God.<br/><br/>This same type of thought is expressed by Pilate in John 18:38. Christ had just said, ""For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world--to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."" Pilate then condescendingly retorts, ""What is truth?"" Pilate responds in a very post-modern relativistic manner. Pilate proves that he is not a believer because Christ had just said that those who hear His voice will recognize the truth. Such is the case today. Only the elect of Christ will be able distinguish truth from falsity. The reality is that there is only one truth. Christ says in John 14:6, ""I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" There is no other way to experience truth and salvation except through Jesus Christ. All other religions offer false hope.<br/><br/>Life of Pi, while visually stunning and entertaining, is an allegory of a young man trying to find spiritual truth in this world. Truth is very real and literal. It is not an allegory or a metaphor, but is presented in very clear and precise statements in the Word of God."

","For me 'Life of Pi' was all about anticipation. I had read Yann Martel's novel and loved it! I had listened to all the critical acclaim, watched all the awards shows and today I sat down for the first time and was ready to see for myself just how amazing the movie was.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is absolutely stunning. Ang Lee and his effects team can't be praised enough for the incredible work they have done on this movie. There are some truly unbelievable sequences my favourites being the scenes with the flying fish, the meerkats, and the whale. The fact that they were able to create a CGI tiger that is so realistic, beautiful and terrifying is enough on its own to hand that Best Director Oscar to Ang Lee. He shows how he had the ability to handle the project. He brings a seemingly impossible concept to the big screen, and emphasises that he is definitely one of the leaders and innovators in his field.<br/><br/>Although the overall experience of the film is awe-inspiring, I'm not sure why but something didn't quite 'pop' for me. I'm a huge fan of the story, and I don't think Lee's interpretation even strayed very far from Martel's text, but the movie didn't fully have that 'knockout punch' effect on me. <br/><br/>The story is fantastic, Martel clearly possesses an incredible imagination, and Lee a highly commendable talent for transferring the premise to cinema. The movie follows Pi as he retells his astounding story of survival on a lifeboat with a tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. He loses everything and the movie is a wonderful tale of friendship, faith and the will to live. Also handled well is the story's ambiguous ending but I won't spoil that here for you.<br/><br/>The movie is also well-cast with newcomer Suraj Sharma not being intimidated by the sheer weight of his role, and showing that although relatively inexperienced, he is capable of carrying a blockbuster epic all on his own shoulders. Rafe Spall also does well as the writer recording Pi's tale.<br/><br/>'Life of Pi' is not a bad, or even an average movie by any stretch of the imagination. I would recommend it to anyone, but for some reason the movie just didn't click for me. Perhaps all the anticipation surrounding it had built up my expectations a little too high, or maybe it was because I didn't view the film in the cinema and thus missed out on the proper experience but for me the movie just lacked that key ingredient.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is an exceptional cinematic feat that is worth a watch purely for the effects, and I'm looking forward to what other projects Ang Lee has lined up for the future."

","This film is a miracle. It really is. The fact that a film ten years ago that was deemed impossible by the author who wrote the book, and how far our technology has advanced is a miracle. In my opinion it blows every other film's special effects out of the water, this is the best special effects ever put on film. Another marvel is Suraj Sharma's performance. This kid had to make us believe that this huge tiger was on the boat, had to have some sort of weight to it, and most importantly, to fear it, to fear it's every move. This kid has great things ahead of him. What makes book to movie adaptations work is the story, if the story is adaptable, and the project is in steady hands, everything will be okay. That's what happened with this film. Ang Lee is a visionary, there is nothing this man can't do in regards to effects mixed with story telling to make this phenomenally crafted film. However, like the novel before it, the film has a few slow parts to it, but when it kicks into gear, it kicks into gear. That's why Life of Pi works. Which is why if you haven't- go see it."

The boy learned a lot from the tiger as well as the vicious animal from the boy. I also thought it was really sad when Pi lost his entire family in the shipwreck and the only thing that kept him going on strong was his true faith in God and the friendship of the Tiger Paco.

Now, for the story line...did i miss something when it comes to logic for this story? If he was afraid of the Tiger, why didn't he let him drown when he was trying to get back on the boat and having a hell of time doing so, until he got help. In one scene you see the Zebra,and the next its gone. All of a sudden, one by one a creature comes out from below the tarpin, the tiger, a rat, the hyena..were they all nestling together until they saw the young man? The actor was fine, but I have problems with accents ..no offense..but it is what it is.

"popandcrackcorn","9","0","2","24 April 2013"," Life of pi, more like Life of Pie....that's too obvious
","Ang Lee's Life of Pi is one of the most entertaining and uplifting movies of 2012. The amount of hope that this film exudes throughout its 127 minutes equals that of a unicorn dancing on a rainbow bridge made out of skittles and Care Bears, all of whom are covered in bacon and pictures of Jessica Alba pre-pregnancy. Life of Pi is so massively inspiring that I truly believe the human population will reach planetary maximum by 2015,because who can't love a mashup between Slumdog Millionaire and The Lion King, besides that fat kid in North Korea and hyenas.<br/><br/>At its core, Life of Pi is about a young man stuck in the middle of the ocean with a violent creature sharing his survival boat. Soon the two come to grips with each other through mutual understanding for survival and theoretically a unicorn that dances on skittles. However as Mickey Mouse as that plot sounds,Pi really is an engaging film that lacks a single cheesy Elton John song or Calvin and Hobbes type sleepy time snuggling between the lead characters,understanding that I love Calvin and Hobbes. Thankfully Life of Pi is a leap in cinematic storytelling, and possesses one of the few believable surprises ever in film.<br/><br/>But it wouldn't be an Ang Lee movie without detailed sound and visuals that control the scene by helping the viewer understand the mood. Lee is on par with Wes Anderson in terms of structuring the feel of a film, and Life of Pi doesn't disappoint from the incredible talent behind Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, though he did make that version of the Hulk that was worse than the one TV show episode where Lou Ferrigno was too drunk to appear on screen.<br/><br/>Still the props really go to lead actor Suraj Sharma who starred as the young Pi Patel. Sharma maintains your concern and interest for his safety, despite being almost the sole character of the film, a feat few have been able to pull off before (Tom Hanks in Castaway and Sam Rockwell in Moon). There were other strong actors that had relative parts, but I really don't want to give away a lot of the plot as it is extremely careful in its unveiling of the tale of Patel.<br/><br/>I can't rave enough about Life of Pi, despite being someone that holds resentment for everyone that drives between the hours of 11 am-4 pm. Still by watching the film, I came to grips with my own self-loathing and walked away feeling as optimistic as though I found a crème horn tucked away in my otherwise empty fridge after midnight. Life of Pi is an extremely entertaining movie as long as you remember that it's based off the massively popular novel by Yann Martel, and also that real tigers will eat you. Watch Ang Lee's Life of PI, and never trust your cat while you sleep again."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","0","2","21 April 2013"," ""So which story do you prefer?""
","Ang Lee has taken this popular novel (whether plagiarized or inspired is up to you) and created a mystical adventure that defies logic yet inspires a suspension of disbelief that I hadn't experience in quite a while. While the CGI visuals prove that forces of nature are truly characters, it is the survival thoughts that we attach ourselves to. This is film that can be experienced and evaluated on your own as its message is a personal one. That's not to say that there won' be plenty of provoked discussion by many afterward. I will admit that my second viewing, while wonderful to fully understand certain items clearer, confirmed one fault that I see. Sometimes a film experience is like a long intricate joke whose punchline is the grand finale. Pi seemed like too long of an intricate joke to end with its simplicity. Make no mistake, I loved the finale, just found it unbalanced from the set up."

","What is the best thing about a foggy Sunday morning in L.A.? Watching ""Life of Pi"" on BluRay. After seeing the film in 3D last year, I personally felt as a film it deserved ""Best Picture"" from the Motion Picture Academy. Ang Lee won his second Oscar for ""Achievement in Directing"" for ""Pi"" but this Oscar nominated film lost to ""Argo"" (another great film). Ang also won for Best Director on ""Brokeback Mountain"" which lost it's best picture nom to ""Crash"". That year I attended the Oscars and half the audience got up and applauded for ""Crash"" while the other half (myself included) sat in protest that ""Brokeback"" lost. The feeling that night was the overriding evidence that homophobia was alive and well in Hollywood. But I digress. ""Life of Pi"" is an amazing film. The special effects with the animals is incredible (I could not tell what was real and what wasn't), and performances were amazing, especially by young Suraj Sharma as PI; he at least deserved an Oscar nomination. But again I digress. Rarely do literary books translate to the visual craft of storytelling in film but this is that wonderful exception to the rule. It's officially on my list and part of the my DVD library. Possibly Ang's best film yet."

But every now and then I am moved. They are just moments, even sparks, of emotion. Such as when a girl says she loves me, or when one of my pets dies, or when something absolutely beautiful catches my eye and I seem to be the only one around noticing it, as if the that event was just for me. Otherwise I feel nothing. I very rarely laugh, or am angry, or happy, sad, lonely, excited, etc. This movie almost kept me in a state of emotion for 1 whole hour!

"Ryan_MYeah","6","0","1","12 April 2013"," A mess of a narrative, but a beauty of visual art.
","Often considered a book to be ultimately unfilmable, Ang Lee faced a struggle in adapting Life of Pi. Was he successful? Well, anyway, the movie follows young Pi Patel, the lone survivor of a ship sinking, trapped for a long time on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger as his companion. The film highlights some weighty and thought provoking issues of faith and religion, taking a bold road rarely seen in family films. It does sound like something that would work well in the script's favor, but then I have to back up and remind myself that the narrative is uneven, diminishing the emotional impact that should be felt, and the narration and present day sequences overstay their welcome.<br/><br/>To be fair, for a movie that spends half the time on a boat with only a young boy and tiger on screen, Life of Pi is still a decent movie to watch. No one can accuse Ang Lee of not knowing what he wanted this film to be, for his direction is the movie's strongest point. Lee is the proper example of a director fully confidant and in control of his own vision, so I do respect the film more than I actually liked it. If nothing else, we can all marvel at the visual aspects, which are quite enchanting, if at times a wee bit too obvious.<br/><br/>*** / *****"

All of the characters were shallow. It sends a very clear message that India has a lot of book sense people who are clouded and suppressed by an overdose of religion.

"fahycolm","6","0","2","10 April 2013"," Life of Pity
","Life of Pi (PIE not PEE) directed by Ang Lee and starring Suraj Sharma is based on the novel of the same name by Yann Martel, who joins Lees as co- writer on the film's screenplay, in what is probably one of the most surprising features of the film version of a truly great novel. Lee, a master of cinema on the theme of fractured relationships, who also brought to us unforgettable screen versions of the likes of Annie Proulx's classic short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" and Rick Moody's ""The Ice Storm"", here takes on what to most readers of Martel's gripping debut must have seemed like a virtually impossible task, filming the unfilmable. At the heart of Martel's tale is the story of a young Indian boy, Pi, and a Bengal Tiger adrift in the middle of the Pacific ocean after Pi's family are lost in a shipwreck on route from India to a new life in Canada, leaving only Pi and one of the family circus animals to fight the odds and each other as they cling to the hope of reaching dry lands across thousands of miles of open ocean. Yet in what might have initially been tenuously achievable in the form of a Pixar or Walt Disney animation, Lee, in characteristic ground breaking style, opts to tackle in a live action version. Perhaps, Lee felt emboldened in his mission by having the original novel writer on hand to adapt the novel for the screen. In this regard there are both winners and losers - most of all the story itself and in particular its denouement. It has to be said, however, that Lee excels in turning the imagery of Martel's novel into a visual feast. There is no doubt in High Definition 2D, Lee has created a magnificent palette for the eyes (I have heard the 3D version is breathtaking (I cannot believe I would agree, I find 3D visually distracting). Not alone that, but with his usual flair, Lee somehow manages to makes a seemingly restricted scenario unfold with a tension worthy of Hitchcock. This is one of the aspects that, in addition to the imagery, Lee has translated faithfully to the screen since, for much of the novel itself, the reader is kept adrift with the protagonist in gripping prose on the open sea, suffering the mindless boredom, the cracked lips, stinging with salt, the chapped fingers, the scorching sun and the ever present danger of fading hope. The cinematography is seamlessly intertwined with the fate of the boy the and the tiger so that the viewer is not left in the virtual doldrums, but pulled along on a tide of rising anxiety for the fate of the rafts occupants. Then something goes uncharacteristically wrong. The closing acts of the film suddenly seem like the work of an altogether different director. The final ten minutes are stuffed with explanation after explanation. The script itself becomes noticeably lazy and flat, the characters utterly functional in a way which hits the viewer like a stupid stick and drains away the essential novelty and searing brilliance which made the novel a rightfully acclaimed work. It is almost as though, the film-makers of indeed editors had decided the visual spectacle of the film was sufficient for the audience and the story itself, even the horrifying truth at its core, was somehow dispensable as a narrative. Martel's novel is a profound multi-layered polemic on hope, belief, imagination, survival and trial. In his book the strands of several stories are intricately interwoven and so brilliantly so that the explosive finish unfolds in a matter of sentences casting the reader back through the entire experience of the novel. All this of course is lost in the film. What does this say about Lee or Martel? Lee was awarded with best director for his efforts and clearly due to the visual translation of the novel which is simply stunning. But, it is hard to imagine anyone being inspired to read Martel's novel on the basis of this version of his story. It falls apart quite possibly because, after all, it just might be an unfilmable novel - even by Ang Lee and even with the novelist at his side."

","I looked at quite a number of reviews before writing this. Some I agreed with almost entirely. I watched this in 3D at home on a large screen with my wife - no external distractions but the ability to make comments when necessary. I absolutely loved the opening of the film, how Pi got his name, his search for religious meaning and love. The shipwreck was wonderful. Unfortunately, then came the meat of the film. Twenty minutes of the tiger was more than enough. We both were getting bored. I kept wondering why, after so much time with his feet in the water, the kid wasn't eaten by a shark. In fact, I almost wished it just to get the story over with. The whole magic island bit was completely absurd. Of course, that may have been the final put-on of an absurd story. But if so, a good hint that this was a fantasy should have been put forward earlier. As my wife said, the moment the kid walked among the merecats he would have been stripped to the bone. Now, at the end we find that the story may have been made up and we are offered a second story that is much more realistic. A complete waste of time. If asked, my decision would be for the second story the first time I saw it: Hitchcock's Lifeboat. My verdict is that the film should have been 90 minutes long, trimming the ocean and cutting the second story. With that I would have given it a 9. I loved the CGI but even that got tiresome. If you've seen one of the IMAX 3D undersea travelogues you know that CGI can't beat nature. So for the story I give it a 6 but the CGI bumps it up to 7."
"DKosty123","7","0","1","21 March 2013"," Gorgeous CGI Into Fantasy
","I think this movie might be more appreciated if I had read the book, which I have not. Still, I find appreciation here because the film uses a fantasy novel to create a fantasy on screen. Most often when you view a film based on a fantasy, you appreciate it more with knowledge of the source. Still, this movie rises above the typical conversion.<br/><br/>It starts off with a story the viewer can follow and interests the viewer and this film does it with the journey theme.Ang Lee does manage to get that feeling over. The scenery is the strong point. There are a couple of things wrong. There is one scene where it gets extremely obvious that the light in the scene is from a spot light. Since this is not a stage play, it is an obvious error.<br/><br/>The other thing is that the entire sequence on the life boat gets a little far fetched. To match some of the comparison's - this is better than Avatar because the love story in this one is more realistic and much less hokey. The second advantage is that this one is a lot shorter than the bloated Avatar.<br/><br/>There is another fantasy tie in this movie with the excellent ""Finding Neverland"", a Johnny Depp vehicle early in Depps career. This movie falls short to the Depp film which is just plain excellent. Granted it has better special effects, but the imagination of Neverland is just at such a high level, that the fantasy here falls short.<br/><br/>There is some parallels to the Old Man and the Sea. This is a fish story or is it? The viewer is left to wonder if there is any reality in where Pi is story telling versus where the book fantasy is at.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film because it made me think at points about the predicament of the main character. What make him keep going when he has lost almost everything there is in the world. That is why this is a fantasy, as it stretches the reality into fiction rather than having severe depression which would be the normal.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the effort and the thoughts going into this ambitious project. There is some excellent work here. It is better than Avatar."

The CGI effects were just OK in my book; the story certainly did not move me emotionally; and while pretty to watch it held no great moments that were believable. Whale sharks are spectacular but this one just didn't fit; it was just one more ""effect"" thrown in to an effect filled movie. The best director award was a joke. Steven Spielberg, Kathryn Bigelow or Ben Affleck were far more deserving. Don't bother paying for tickets just watch at home for free. The ""Academy"" seems to have something against Spielberg and I think that snubbing Affleck for even getting nominated, in spite of winning all other director awards, shows a lack of respect for his work. All in all ""Life of Pi"" was just boring and and exercise in fancy CGI effects. The continuity of PI's hair length did not jive with time spent in a boat. At one point the boat is completely full of water and next scene the water is gone. When a viewer starts to notice little things like that the director has a problem."

","I wanted to see this movie; many people enjoyed it, said it was very well done, but I just did not see it. When I walked out of the theater, I struggled to see the point of the film. It was not about the friendship between a boy and a tiger, and it was not a survival story either. It was actually a film about religion, but I just could not bare to stomach the fact that a person would choose to follow three religions at the same time, and even more so, I could not see someone believing each three religions while such a young age.<br/><br/>The special effects are often overdone, and too perfect. Someone said that you can hardly notice that the tiger is CG (computer generated) but I could. It was just too perfect in the way that it walked, its movements too different than the real thing, but I must admit that it was very close. I thought that the special effects were amazing, but overall, I think that they could have had a better story to tell with less special effects–-it would have made a more believable story, and would have made it easier to take in. The story overall, is lackluster. Not very well thought out, and there is hardly a point to it.<br/><br/>The film is long, and I could not help but as myself how much more there was. By the end, I was entirely burnt out, and ready to go home. The story's climax is a huge let down, and it will leave you disappointed. Overall, I think that this is a film that people will go to see only if they wish to kill time. It's not a journey, its not really even that great of an adventure, and it will leave you wishing that there had been more. I am not exactly sure what more there could be, but it did feel as though there was indeed something more that it needed in order to get an emotional response from the audience. I feel as though this movie could have been better if there had been more emotions conveyed through the film that would have given you a better emotional response, a more realistic one, but there was nothing. I felt no sadness. No happiness. Just disappointment.<br/><br/>This is a movie that needed to be something more than just an adventure, something more about self-explortaion about religion. It needed to be a drama, but ultimately, it wasn't sad enough, or suspenseful enough. If you want great visuals, and a somewhat generic storyline, then I think you would enjoy it. But if your like me and want more than just great visuals and an actual story that will make your heart break with emotion, then don't expect to get it from this movie."

Though not outlined so much in the movie, the book does effectively, that at the end of the story the reader says: ""ah"".<br/><br/>The movie is only an above average story that leaves the viewer the questions & partially lost. There is the main plot, but those other elements from the book, not effectively projected to the movie, leave a lot more questions than answers.<br/><br/>The viewer only has to follow the main plot & write off the other elements to open interpretation."

","Life of Pi might not be one of my favorite movies this year, but it is one i would recommend to anyone. I wish i saw it in 3d, but its also looks great in 2d. The movie is about Pi who spends a long time on a boat with a tiger. Its a great premise, but it does take a long time before that happens. We spend a long time learning about Pi's live, which was fun to watch, but still I wanted to get to the part with the tiger. The second half of the film is were it really starts. Pi's adventure with Richard parker is funny, scary, intense, sad and has some of the best visuals i have seen in any movie. However it is not the perfect film. The actor for young Pi is not really that good and the CGI is not always convincing. Still it's one of the best movies I saw this year and I can't wait to see what Ang lee will film next."

","Life of Pi, it turns out, isn't about that tasty dessert or a boring series of numberseven though they do list them out in one fairly decent scene.<br/><br/>Actually, this movie has multiples of great scenes. Namely the enormously gorgeous cinematography. Ang Lee is known for that, or at least, used to be in such excellent films: Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Wedding Banquet and yeah, even Hulk – but that was the only real attribute to that film.<br/><br/>The dialogue was great, the acting too. The originality was refreshing and I loved all performances. You would never know in an Ang Lee film (well, skipping Hulk) if actors are trained prior and are amateurs, or professionals. Not only does he have a great eye, he knows how to lead.<br/><br/>Boy Pi recounts his life journeys to a novelist and it's an amazing adventure, mostly on a lifeboat following a ship wreck to a new land from India. On said boat, he shares the ride with a hungry tiger and incredibly survives (I did say he's telling his back story in present time, so no, that's not a spoiler.)<br/><br/>That's the basic premise, even though there's a lot more to the story.<br/><br/>To me, the real beauty was in the filmmaking, the breathtaking out-to-sea scenes and the actor's, Suraj Sharma (Pi,) excellent ability to carry the majority of the movie on rough seas. I'd probably die within days, or kill the so wonderfully named tiger: Richard Parker, for food. Sorry, (big) cat lovers out there.<br/><br/>The movie did not have great marketing, and maybe that's because they didn't know how to show this adventure in a few quick minutes of screen time. Nevertheless, it's highly recommended, and if you get a chance to see it on the big screen, you better.<br/><br/>Side Note: Richard Parker, the furious tiger, actually made me take a second look at the house cat at my residence. ""Don't get any ideas, hungry one,"" I would say through my eyes the very next time I saw the house cat following watching this."

","I had not read the book and so came to this movie without preconceptions. We saw it in 3D and there are many visually stunning moments that really work in this format. One marvels at the technical ingenuity of the film-makers and the imagination of the story's author. Superb acting from Suraj Sharma, as the adult Pi, who must have spent an awful lot of his time during the making of this film soaking wet!<br/><br/>The movie would have attracted a higher rating from me but for a few failings. It was too long and could have been shortened to good effect; the plot is not as tightly constructed as it could have been; and the ending is something of an anti-climax. After all the drama and visual fireworks that precede them, the closing scenes verge on the dull, which is a great shame as there is much that is brilliant here.<br/><br/>It must have been a great challenge translating this tale from the book page to the cinema screen. The result has certainly produced a unique and very enjoyable viewing experience.<br/><br/>(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK, 13.01.13)"

","Mesmerized! This left me speechless. There are few movies that got the power of leaving a lasting impression on you; Life of Pi is most certainly one of those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is told so beautifully that you never get to realize that the script is so simple! At time it jogged my memory of cast away, at times of avatar to some extent. Saying again, story-wise it wasn't outstanding, but if you talk about Cinematography, Sound Mixing & Editing, Visual Effects and Directing, all of these were pretty much unbelievable. No wonder it got 11 nominations!<br/><br/>And the boy suraj sharma, honestly he did a 'tom hanks' in this film<br/><br/>This movie is definitely an Academy Awards runner for Special Effects, Cinematography and Director of the year."
"Blooner","8","0","2","21 January 2013"," A wonderful visual feast with an excellent, somewhat thought-provoking story
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Life of Pi is an intriguing movie. One of wondrous and unbelievable stories, with equally wondrous and unbelievable visuals.<br/><br/>Life of Pi introduces us to Pi Patel, a Christian-Hindi-Muslim Indian man with an amazing story to tell. Pi was the son of a zoo keeper and when his family decides to move to Canada, he finds himself on a freighter ship with a whole host of wild animals. During a horrible storm the freighter sinks, and Pi ends up adrift in a lifeboat in the company of a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger. This is a story of survival, of finding strength, of discovering oneself, and of having faith.<br/><br/>Obviously such a fantastical and magical story must be told with similarly fantastical visuals. Life of Pi certainly succeeds in that regard, with truly breathtaking images throughout the movie. The dreamlike sequences in the lifeboat are beautifully rendered, as are the remaining scenes that play out in both India and Canada. Although it is sometimes visible that most of what is on the screen is computer generated (especially the animals and the water (and its reflections)) this in no way distracts from the film. Due to the fantastical atmosphere of the story the somewhat 'fake' or 'too perfect' CGI fits right in.<br/><br/>The movie is shown in Real3D. I'm am not a fan of 3D. My brain does not enjoy the technique. I usually end up with a headache, and extremely strained eyes. But aside from this, I feel like the added blurriness of the images and the dimmer light of the screen is an unfair tradeoff for such a gimmicky addition to the medium.<br/><br/>I have to hand it to Life of Pi though, it is one of the least crappy incorporations of 3D that I have seen. Again here the 3D is used to add to the sense of wonder and magic that transpires within the movie. With the exception of one 'flying fish'-scene, there is no blatant over-use of the 3D gimmick.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the deeper messages within Life of Pi, something that was not at all conveyed in the trailers for the movie. Without spoiling anything, I like how themes such as personal strength, and especially religion were given plenty of screen-time. Mostly in the first quarter of the film, religion plays a large role in the story. I really liked what was said, but the message seems somewhat forgotten throughout the last part of the script. I can imagine how this is better meshed in the book, on which the movie is based.<br/><br/>Something what somewhat put me off of the movie at first, judging only by the trailers, was the blatant unrealistic nature of the story. A boy and a bunch of wild animals, some of which carnivorous, surviving together in a tiny dingy? Ridiculous! Some friends and family-members convinced me to go see the movie despite of these doubts, and I am so happy they did. First of all, the whole script wasn't as unrealistic as the trailer made it out to be. There are some developments that add to the sense that; ""Perhaps this could've happened."" But moreover, in the end the question of whether the story is unrealistic or not is wonderfully ambiguously called upon within the movie through a final twist. I won't spoil it for you, but just urge you to not let the unrealism deter you from seeing this movie. To conclude, Life of Pi is a wonderful visual feast with an excellent, somewhat thought-provoking story. This combination creates such a great movie, that even the addition of 3D can't ruin a good product. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"

","Taiwanese-born Ang Lee is one of the world's most most celebrated filmmakers – and one of its most innovative and influential ones. He is also the creator of an oeuvre as various and multi-faceted as that of no other filmmaker alive. Lee revolutionized martial arts film with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he pushed the doors wide open for gay topics in Hollywood with Brokeback Mountain, he did blockbuster action cinema (Hulk) and atmospherically dense family drama (The Ice Storm). Lee is a filmmaker who can create imagery that sticks with everyone who has seen and experienced it. He creates worlds as unique as they are credible and true. If cinema is a place for the imagination to roam, Lee is the master guide. Who else could take on the seemingly hopeless task of turning Yann Martel's world bestseller Life of Pi, about an Indian boy who survives a shipwreck in a lifeboat with a tiger, into a film? Ang Lee could and he did and again he created something that will have a lasting effect on film.<br/><br/>Life of Pi was shot in state-of-the art 3D technology but even for those who view it in 2D, it will open their eyes, showing things never seen before. Life of Pi is a miracle, a film in which the majority of its story happens on a drifting boat in the middle of the ocean with only a teenage boy and a Bengal tiger present. The film is at its heart a very intimate story confined to the narrowest of settings. Yet again Ang Lee proves to be a master of story-telling who narrates in the language he speaks best: that of film. Lee speaks of joy and grief, of hope and desperation and, not unimportantly, of the search for a truth larger than the individual.<br/><br/>This Pi is a seeker of spiritual truths. As a child, he is a Hindu, a Christian and a Muslim, all at the same time. When the storm hits the ship he is travelling on, he embraces it as a message from God. He will again and again call God and keep believing that there is a higher power watching him. For him, it might well have been this power that sent him a tiger as travelling companion, the tiger he will credit with saving his life for if he did not have to be constantly alert he might never have made it. His God, no doubt, moves in mysterious ways and isn't this what wise men say about life?<br/><br/>19-year-old first-time actor Suraj Sharma plays Pi and he does so with a truly unforgettable mixture of wide-eyed wonder, relentless will of survival and this questioning look in his eyes that wants to know what make this world continue. His is a hopeful story of one who has lost everything but his sense of wonder at this world.<br/><br/>And yet, there is so much more to this visually stunning masterpiece. Because Pi, hungry for life and knowledge, is no match for the viewer who cannot keep their eyes off for even a second, who stare wide-eyed at this world which they never have seen this way. At times the limits between sky and sea seem to disappear, the boat to float on thin air, water, land, sea all become one. we look at the sky from under water or see the sunken ship and all the ocean looking in. When Pi, diving, watches the brightly lighted ship sink, he seems suspended in a vacuum- like state, time stops, past, present, future become one.<br/><br/>It is a sense of time we know from fairy-tales – and from dreams. And after all, aren't we all dreaming, isn't Pi? For what is real? The tiger in the boat next to his makeshift raft? The fluorescent whale who almost turns the boat over? The carnivorous floating island full of meerkats? Like Alice in Wonderland we follow Pi from one miracle to the next, floating along as if in a dream. Suspending belief and time and logic.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is so many things at once: a growing-up story and a tale of perseverance, a survivor's story with an unlikely hero whose will to live paired with a natural resourcefulness of the imagination makes him continue. And it is the story of the unlikeliest of friendships which, of course, is nothing more (or less) than the bond of two creatures understanding that they need the other for survival. It is a quest for truth, a truth which resides in the human heart as well as in his brain, which requires reason and the ability to believe. But Life of Pi is also a film about the power of images – to educate, to amaze, to scare but also to question. For what is real, what is a dream and is there even a difference?<br/><br/>And perhaps above all, it is about the power of story-telling. In the end, we will be asked to doubt what we have been told and seen and be left with the option to just believe. When we are young, we first encounter the world and its ways through fairy-tales, incredible stories which we believe and don't believe at the same time but which make us grow and learn and wonder. Life of Pi is such a story and, at the same time, it shows us how such stories work. It is, in one word, nothing but a miracle.<br/><br/>http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/"
"siderite","8","0","1","20 January 2013"," Is the beauty of a story in the telling or in the experience itself?
","I feel conflicted about this movie because, even if it is a visually beautiful film and has a plot of many layers, even if the acting is great and the direction clearly good, at the end I just felt cheated.<br/><br/>First, there were the ""ministories"", of the origin of his name, the swimmer adoptive uncle and so on. They were mere anecdotes as related to the rest of the plot; they had no point other than to prolong the telling of the story. I am sure all of this would have been clearer in the book, but from the film I just felt like being baited from a story to the other, waiting for the ""real"" one to begin.<br/><br/>And maybe that was the whole point. The end quote regarding stories and God was relevant. Maybe it doesn't matter if you relate to a story, only that you listen to it told. However, I could not really relate to any character in the film except with the poor tiger. Yeah, I am a cat person.<br/><br/>Bottom line: different people will have wildly differing opinions on the film, and that is good, but in the end I feel I can't recommend or not recommend the movie because I am not really clear if I liked it or not. Perhaps reading the book before watching the film would be indicated."

","A tale of survival at sea is handled with beautiful imagery through the eye of Ang Lee. Pi is a young man raised in a family who own a zoo in India. They are forced to sell it and head for Canada and a new life. The ship encounters a vicious storm and sinks. Pi manages to crawl on to a lifeboat and is followed by a Bengal tiger. The story is a bit far fetched but it makes for a roller coaster ride of a movie. The scenery is spectacular and Suraj Sharma is up to the task as Pi, mostly playing opposite the majestic tiger. It flashes back and forth between Pi as the adult telling the story to a writer and the teenager on the boat and I was not thrilled with the ending but overall, even though a bit overlong at two hours and seven minutes, it is one of the better films of 2012 and worthy of an 8/10."

","Life of Pi is one of the few visually stunning depictions from the entertainment industry that may just move you. If you are one with faith/a faith, it will center and inspire you, leading you to introspect on the attainable possibilities for one's own life. If you do not have a faith, or do not believe in a higher power and grand design, well - this movie may make you just stop and reconsider to expand your views. It doesn't preach to you directly, but there are hidden messages which you will pick up on, if you are interested in enlightenment and understanding. <br/><br/>This movie, and the compelling characters in it almost reach off the screen, even without a 3D format.<br/><br/>While one with age and life experience develops a shell of pragmatism, over time, something like Life of Pi has to potential to give you some release and hope. While the flair of Hollywood producers, cinematographers, etc. are added, you come away with a feeling that it was worth your your time and monetary investment. While I could nick-pick some small parts, it is worthy of the 10/10 that I choose to give it."

","I've just reviewed the movie ""The Impossible"" and that would have been quite an appropriate way to describe ""Life of Pi"".

It focuses on the survival efforts of Pi Patel and a host of animals with a Bengal tiger Richard Parker being his main company. Suraj Sharma is brilliant as the lead character and obviously the vision of Ang Lee in bringing this to the screen is amazing.

"shexmus","7","0","2","15 January 2013"," Wildly over-rated religious claptrap
","This film is a must-watch only for its 3D imagery which is quite extraordinary. If you are a religious type you may enjoy it for more than that because the film-makers' target audience is the emotional believers. If you are a rational atheist kind there is little for you to connect except perhaps briefly in the beginning, when Pi gets to learn about the nature of the beast, and towards the end, when he has to recount the story to the wrecked ship's insurers. Indeed, I could not help but conclude that we just took a journey through the delusional mind of a hungry and thirsty castaway. Did someone just say that the origins of all gods, spirits and other affiliated ethereal 'entities' is in the hallucinating minds of our wandering hungry and thirsty ancestors? I believe Ang Lee just did, though I can't be sure whether this is one of the interpretations that he deliberately set out to convey. 7/10."
"julian-mumford","10","0","1","13 January 2013"," Parable, shaggy dog (or tiger) story - unquestionably one of the best films of the year.
","A film about a shipwrecked Indian boy, lost at sea in a lifeboat with only a Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker"" for company.<br/><br/>Many assumed that adapting Yan Martel's bestselling novel into a two hour film would be impossible, step forward Oscar winning director Ang Lee. Lee has managed to make this project appear effortless, almost as if the story was just waiting to be filmed.<br/><br/>We start our story in Pondicherry, a small French influenced Indian port town. Santosh Patel (Hussain) sets up a small Zoo with his wife Gita (Tabu), together with their two sons Ravi and Piscine, named after a swimming pool.<br/><br/>Apart from being ribbed mercilessly at school for the misspelling of his name, the boys have an idyllic life, albeit learning hard lessons at the zoo, courtesy of their stern but loving father.<br/><br/>Piscine, now self renamed ""Pi"", chooses religion almost as his hobby. Already a Hindu, he adopts Christianity and latterly Islam, much to his fathers consternation. ""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing"", his father simply states. These early scenes are played well, are grounded in reality and set out the underlying spiritual themes of the story. The film gently deflates any religious pomposity, which should also satisfy a modern secular audience.<br/><br/>The story is bookended by the older Pi recounting his story to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall), Pi himself being played by four actors, an excellent Irrfan Khan as an adult, Young Pi by Gautum Belur, early teens by Ayosh Tandon but for most of the story as an older teen, by the quite superb first time actor Suraj Sharma.<br/><br/>Falling in love, Pi is promptly torn from everything he loves as the family emigrates to Canada aboard a freighter, with many of the Zoo animals in the hold. Mid voyage, disaster strikes and the rest of the story revolves around Pi and his companions adventure, as they attempt to survive.<br/><br/>Pi struggles with the elements, his place in the world, the meaning of life and most notably death, yet the story does not appear weighed down with these concerns but manages to relay them in a serious but manageable form. Religion is part of the story and yet is unlikely to offend anyone with or without faith, although perhaps believing in something, is the underlying message.<br/><br/>if you thought that special effects could get no better then be prepared to be surprised. The biggest technical achievement is that one might assume that very few effects were used. Never work with animals, water or children is the directors mantra, here Lee manages all three. It is easy to accept that the tiger is real and the threat to Pi is tangible, as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Not only has the film managed to portray a difficult story it has handled the delicate concepts beautifully. Certain scenes will make you jump, gaze in wonder or consider much later as to the possible deeper meanings. Visually the film is beautiful to look at, notably Pi backlit underwater against a sinking ship or adrift amongst a sea of bio luminescence. This is a film about everything and nothing and as foretold by Pi's old friend, may make you believe in god. If nothing else, it certainly will restore your faith in intelligent visually appealing film making.<br/><br/>The acting by Suraj Sharma is superb, portraying every emotion in a believable and accessible way. The fact that he would have acted in trying circumstances, mostly against ""nothing"" as the tiger is mostly supplied by CGI, makes the achievement even more impressive.<br/><br/>Irrfan Khan has a quiet relaxed presence, suited to the story he relays and together with Sharma provides an emotional end to the story. Spall also does doing well in a difficult and mostly thankless albeit necessary role.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a magical yet grounded film, that some may love, some will enjoy and yet may frustrate some. If you are prepared to suspend disbelief to some degree and be swept along with the story, you may not find god but you will have a cinematic experience that you may remember for some time.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A film that is about whatever you decide the film is about, a mirror perhaps to your own life experiences.<br/><br/>Parable, shaggy dog (or tiger) story, whatever it represents, this is unquestionably one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","6","0","5","12 January 2013"," Have to admit I was a little bored
","When I saw the trailer for Life of Pi, it really sparked no interest in me. I have never really been a fan of Robinson Crusoe stories and I didn't think the presence of a tiger would make much of a difference. But then the movie received 11 Oscar nominations, and I thought maybe I had shortchanged this film. I'm glad that I saw it, but my initial instinct was correct: Life of Pi just isn't for me. <br/><br/>I will start with what I liked about the movie: the visuals. Just about everybody agrees that Life of Pi is the visual masterpiece of the year, arguably a greater contribution to 3d than Avatar. The digital creation of the tiger, named Richard Parker, is one of the most realistic examples of CGI in recent memory. The way the clouds are reflected in the water and the psychedelic images that Pi sees on his journey are the most amazing things you'll see this year. <br/><br/>For anyone who might not know, Life of Pi is about an Indian teenager's (Gandhi, not Sitting Bull) harrowing spiritual journey as he is stranded on a boat for over two hundred days with only a Bengal Tiger for a companion. This story is partially narrated by Pi as an adult, who is visited by an author with writer's block. The author was told that Pi's story can make him believe in God. The problem is the author is the most boring character you'll ever meet and the constant transitions back to the older Pi are intrusive. <br/><br/>Overall though, Life of Pi gets off promising start despite the poor framing device. Pi is raised by an atheistic father who owns a zoo, so understandably he becomes enamored with animals and religion. Pi is raised Hindu, but he soon becomes interested in Christianity and Islam and converts to both faiths. I thought this was an interesting point in the film- why couldn't somebody follow all three religions? When Pi's family comes upon rough economic times they are forced to move their zoo to Canada. Their freighter encounters a vicious storm in what is the most visually impressive experience in the movie. Pi evacuates on a life boat with a wounded zebra, but after the storm passes he discovers an orangutan and a hyena. Somehow, the tiger hides under a canvas on the boat for two days, but whatever. Pi must learn how to hold the tiger at bay while surviving at sea. <br/><br/>This is where Life of Pi started to lose me. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to focus on survivor stories. There might be something more than my bias against these types of stories though. There is something about Ang Lee's directing style that reminds me of still water- it just doesn't excite me. I admit it's not fair to categorize this film just as a survivor story because it deals with the testing of faith during a crisis. But the religious themes just felt pedestrian to me. For me, this film's saving grace was the 3d, which is unusual because I usually think that 3d is a waste of time.<br/><br/>The most controversial aspect of the film was the ending. Without giving away too much, Pi reveals an entirely different version of his survival story and the audience is forced to choose which one to believe. I like the idea of being able to interpret the events of this movie in more than one way, but I didn't like the way it was executed in the story. It would have been much more effective to hint at the alternate survival story during the movie rather than just lay it all out at the end. I find myself strangely indifferent to the plot twist. I don't think it's particularly clever or ""deep.""<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film has a real chance at winning the Oscar for Best Director because they snubbed Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain. It will certainly win a lot of technical awards, and deservedly so. Overall, Life of Pi is not a bad movie, but it never really excited me as much as it should have, nor did I find it particularly thought provoking."

I was even a bit put off. But the movie stayed with me, and as it sunk in I gradually began to understand and appreciate what it was all about.

"markdroulston","7","0","1","2 January 2013"," Ang Lee continues to surprise
","I think it might be time to put to bed the idea of an 'unfilmable novel'. Particularly in recent cinema history, as Hollywood has increasingly relied on existing material for its output, so-called unfilmable books have yielded movies of varying quality. It's true that some (such as 2012's two-part adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, by all accounts a catastrophic failure) only bolster arguments favouring the concept, but let us not forget that Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness was long considered unfilmable before Francis Ford Coppola gave us Apocalypse Now, not to mention the certainly difficult but successful job Peter Jackson did with JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Life of Pi, based on Yann Martel's introspective 2002 Man Booker Prize winning novel. A challenging story to bring to the screen to be sure, but under the expert hand of Ang Lee the film is yet one more example of how difficult material can be adapted given the right amount of time and care.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is at its core a tale of survival against insurmountable odds, following the titular teenager's (Suraj Sharma) months spent adrift on a lifeboat after the sinking of a cargo ship transporting his family from India to Canada. A dwindling menagerie of animals from the family zoo are also along for the ride, including the fearsome Bengal tiger Richard Parker, representing those who managed to escape the ship and cling to Pi's tiny craft.<br/><br/>Perhaps the difficulty of adapting the novel lay in keeping audience interest during long sequences involving little more than a boy and a tiger, and it's likely the film would have dragged were it not for the astonishing visual spectacle Lee brings to the screen. He takes full advantage of all technical wizardry available, balancing the ocean's serene beauty and unapologetic violence in just the right measure. Even the 3-D, something I personally am usually resistant to, never intrudes or calls attention to itself, but rather complements the oppressively flat horizon so much of the film plays out in front of. Life of Pi will undoubtedly be in the best visual effects conversation come awards season, with Richard Parker in particular standing out as one of the most impressive digital characters yet created.<br/><br/>Exploring Life of Pi a little deeper, Lee develops strong thematic currents relating to storytelling and faith, and how the two are entwined. As a story about storytelling, the film works very well from the beginning, as the older Pi (played wonderfully by Irrfan Khan) relates his tale to a visiting writer (Rafe Spall). Yet it is also a story about faith, and here the waters get a little murkier. What Lee is trying to say about faith and religion is open to interpretation (and that's likely the point), but the film's one major shortcoming is a lack of satisfying answers regarding what is the most clearly defined aspect of Pi himself.<br/><br/>The narrative seems to promote the importance of faith as a general concept, not tied to any specific religion, but more akin to a sharing of humanistic beliefs. It's not the specifics of faith's origins or even ultimate goals that matter, but rather how the beliefs are shared, adapted and passed on. Not the most conclusive analysis I know, but the links between faith and storytelling are there, and perhaps repeat viewings will offer up more answers.<br/><br/>Despite the elusive nature of some of Life of Pi's subtext, it really is a film that deserves praise and attention. Never one to pigeonhole himself, Lee has crafted a thoughtful and moving fantasy that is beautiful to behold yet also offers much intellectual nourishment.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"

","Strangely enough, this adventure about a young man from India who survives a shipwreck, and is then stranded on a lifeboat with a ferocious tiger, is more interesting on land. The first twenty minutes has an older Pi telling a backstory of a rather unique childhood.<br/><br/>Named after a swimming pool that sounds like the word ""Piss,"" and then changing it to the mathematical equation to escape taunts of fellow students, Pi has an intense father who runs a zoo with a tiger that becomes, for a cerebral awe-struck child, something tangible to marvel at. Director Ang Lee smoothly glides us from the zoo to the schoolyard to the city streets to our inevitable destination: the family on a Japanese Ship bound for Canada with the zoo animals along.<br/><br/>A formidable storm causes the ship to go down, stranding our young hero on a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra and a Bengal tiger, resembling Alfred Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT if produced by National Geographic.<br/><br/>We quickly dwindle to boy and tiger, making the other animals – important in the book and covering many pages – not only a buffet for the tiger to snack on under the canopy-half of the boat, but somewhat unnecessary to the storyline.<br/><br/>In the film's best scenes, Pi builds a smaller makeshift raft, and like THE BLACK STALLION but with the stakes raised – a horse is easy compared to a man eating predator – there's a progressively budding relationship between young man and beast: from an attempted taming to an ultimate ""kinship,"" nothing else should matter but this very odd couple lost (and battling elements) at sea.<br/><br/>But there's plenty of downtime where Pi contemplates life and, like he did back home, philosophizes God and existence – during these moments of dead calm you'll wish for a rejuvenated tiger or another grand scale shipwreck.<br/><br/>Young actor Suraj Sharma does a great job as a boy surviving on his own instincts, becoming an Indian version of MacGyver in the process figuring out ways to keep himself, and the tiger, alive with the sparse means available but the story doesn't always equal the intensity or determination of the character.<br/><br/>While a neon-colored whale in ultraviolet water, a mob of flying fish or an island of meercats are neat to look at, the handsome aesthetics often turn a story worthy of Melville and London into navel-gazing art-house fare.<br/><br/>Yet despite the flaws, LIFE OF PI is a beautiful movie that will keep you intrigued in the outcome: if not for the survival aspect alone. Therein lies the real adventure...<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","I recently went to see a film that I had waited to see for a long time and was desperately disappointed. That film was The Hobbit. The 3D effects and 48 FPS rate were dreadful, and deflected from the film. The life of Pi on the other hand was a triumph. As an avid film goer, I have found 3D to be one of the biggest letdowns of my age. With the exception of Avatar I have found it to be a big distractor when watching a film. The Life of Pi takes you back to the initial success of Avatar. Never gimmicky, only highlighting the sheer beauty of the film. The depth of background was always there. The film itself was what I consider Cinema to be all about, that feeling when you walk out, knowing you had witnessed something magical. Try to go to see this film, you will not be disappointed if, like me,you believe in that magic."

","Taking my 12 year old granddaughter along to see this film was a very rewarding experience for the both of us. She could not stop talking about it after we left the theatre. I was pleased that she asked lots of questions about it and it made her think. She now wants to read the book. I read the book myself few years ago and I think this film does the book justice. The actor who played Pi on the life raft was excellent. The 3D effects were unbelievable and wonderful and it amazes me that there are people out there who are so talented. They should be congratulated on their marvellous work. Some people have rubbished the story, saying story 1 was fake, and story 2 was even more bizarre. I say overlook the obvious trickery and enjoy a film."
"RainDogJr","8","0","1","31 December 2012"," Maybe not an instant favorite, but it sure is gorgeous
","I didn't pay a ticket to see this film just because Ang Lee directed it. This was, in fact, only my second experience with his work – I'm still not interested at all in his HULK or in ""Brokeback"", and I'm waiting to get the Criterion version of THE ICE STORM. Anyway, I went for this since it looked great in the trailer and well, it's just one of those that gets literally universal acclaim – not just the likes of Roger Ebert are praising it, and even the good people of FANGORIA magazine called it ""gorgeous"" (""I urge anyone who loves the magic of pure cinema to see it in 3D"" – Chris Alexander, Fangoria editor). <br/><br/>LIFE OF PI is one of those movies where the story is not only being told to us (the audience) – the protagonist Pi (played by four different Indian actors, each one for a different stage of his life) is actually telling his story to a writer for the potential writing of a book. Pi's life story must be, therefore, an amazing one, or else what the hell is doing a writer in Pi's house in Canada, right? <br/><br/>There's a moment in the film when Pi says to the writer something like ""you must be wondering when we finally get to the incredible part of my story, the part about survival""; certainly we can think that Pi is saying that to us too – in specific to the part of the audience that got to see the trailer with the tiger and the boat and the incredible visuals. <br/><br/>LIFE OF PI is, basically, two different films in one; very different from each other I must add. In the first part the 3D format is ultimately useless, but don't get me wrong, waiting for the main show isn't something painful. The writer might be bored or just not completely amazed with the first part of Pi's story, but I'm sure you'll be totally entertained, laugh and find some truly memorable things. Irrfan Khan plays adult Pi; this actor had also a part in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (Danny Boyle, 2008), which is the film that I think shares the most with the first part (and well ""Slumdog"" also has that ""protagonist telling his story to someone else"" element). <br/><br/>Certainly this part take us to India (the French India to be exact), and is as simple as this: if you enjoyed the childhood memories of the protagonist of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and I'm sure you did, I can't think in a reason why you wouldn't like seeing, for instance, the origin of Pi's name (which is just too funny to reveal here) and some other of his childhood and teenage experiences (dealing with issues like religion and the first love). <br/><br/>The main question dealing with this film you might have is the following: ""how did a young man ended in the middle of the sea, in a lifeboat together with a tiger?"" The second part of the film opens with the kind of spectacular-full-of-CGI sequence that Steven Spielberg or James Cameron could have directed, if that makes sense. But soon, and as you know, everything will get minimalistic. <br/><br/>It's, indeed, quite a show, a gorgeous one. Some shots are definitely among the most beautiful ones captured on camera this year. The CGI work done with the animals is simply perfect (talking about animals, don't miss the nice title sequence!). Simply put: when you create a whole lot of emotions with only a young man and a tiger, you're definitely doing some great things. When this part was over I felt everything else that followed to be unimportant. LIFE OF PI tries to create an interesting take on how stories are told; it tries to make you doubt and think again in everything. Nevertheless nothing is as soulful or interesting as Pi's final encounter with the tiger that stayed with him for more than 200 days in a lifeboat. <br/><br/>I watched on the big screen ""Slumdog"", really liked it, but until this day I haven't felt the need to revisit it. I think this same thing will happen with LIFE OF PI; but certainly you should check it out. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 29 December, 2012"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","2","31 December 2012"," Don't doubt God: he is in you because you're human
","This film is a marvellous adventure that is not done for little children who will get frightened but for children closer to 77 than to 7 years of age. But it is such a beautiful story that adults might like it too.<br/><br/>Frightening like hell not on earth but on the Pacific Ocean. A shipwreck that sinks a cargo boat with only one survivor, a teenager hardly able to use a razor to shave and three animals from his father's zoo, animals that were being taken away to Canada to be sold: a Bengali tiger, a zebra and a hyena. The hyena is ignominious and it attacks the zebra on the lifeboat without even hesitating. The tiger is another story and the teenager is still another novel all by himself.<br/><br/>But when you want to survive and you have in you the god that supports you, not a god with a trunk as long as a nose, or vice versa, not a god that dies on the cross for others, not a god that is hermaphrodite according to your capricious desires. Not at all. A god that is powerful in your soul, inspiring in your spirit, supportive in your mind and absolutely logical in your brain. Then you have the force with you and you can stand up against a Bengali tiger and tame it, and you can stamp your feet against the elements and organize your survival and that of ""your"" tiger.<br/><br/>Then you have the mysterious island of Doctor Moreau, a carnivorous island that is also slightly cannibalistic. It is all sweet and nice in the day time but it turns flesh voracious at night. Can you imagine a tender teenager with no hairs on his face and a Bengali tiger: that's what I would call a meat ravenous predator's delicatessen treat.<br/><br/>What is surprising but not so much if you know animals slightly is the tiger's taming. A wild animal will accept in some extreme conditions to be tamed when it feels you are the one who is going to help it survive if it lets you survive. Animals are intelligent and in extreme conditions they know their interest. I was told that many times in Sri Lanka where I used to walk in the jungle. I was told that if on your way a lion, a wild cat or an elephant comes to cross it towards its own destination, don't run, don't scream, don't make any brusque movement. The animal knew you were coming a long time before you ever knew it was there. If you don't block its way, if you do not produce the mammal hormone of fear that stinks like hell, if you look at the animal straight in the eyes and at the most slowly step back without getting your eyes away from its nor turning you back onto it, the animal will not attack you, and in fact most of the time the animal will avoid you and you will never see it though you might walk a few yards away from it.<br/><br/>Animals are intelligent and they are not necessarily man's predators, even Bengali tigers.<br/><br/>But when the animal will no longer need Pi it will just walk away back into its own animal life without even looking back. A wild animal can be tamed but it will never be the pet of a human being.<br/><br/>The second lesson is that the insurance company of the ship does not accept that strange story with a tamed tiger and a carnivorous island, but it accepts quite well the story of four survivors with the odious cook who eats a rat, cuts up a sailor to catch fish, kills the mother of the hero and is killed by the hero himself. That sounds absurd in a way but human beings prefer a gross and totally inhuman story to a marvellous story about a wild animal that accepts to be tamed to survive and then walks away.<br/><br/>The last idea or rather warning is that if some of you are secular minded to the point of negating any possible divinity or superior being or even superior force, don't go. This film is not about the gods we know in any religion but about the god that lives in your skull and animates you so strongly that it makes you able to survive in numerous situations without being a monster and using your fellow traveller as bait for sharks. Even if that fellow traveller is a wild Bengali tiger you have to tame it first. In fact if that god, like Jesus, you have him in your mind, brain, soul, spirit or whatever, dying on the cross becomes like an easy mission that you will not even try to evade or suspend or escape from.<br/><br/>Too bad for those who consider any religious or mystic belief is an alienation and a fairy tale for dummies, because I know so many people who are beautiful for others and empathetic for any suffering just because in them they have the gem of that transcendence.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAI"
"power120","8","0","1","30 December 2012"," Movie that engages you from beginning to end
","This movie shows the journey of a young Indian boy who moved with his family and all the animals from their zoo to Canada on a large Japanese ship. The ship sinks during a big storm. He survives on a rescue vessel along with a zebra, hyena, orangutan and a Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker. Eventually he is left only with the tiger. The movie mainly focuses on the way he builds a relation ship with the tiger along with the dangers of trying to do that. The story is told as he is talking to an American friend who will write a book about his adventure. You really get into the skin of his boy, like you feel the frustration of being on a vessel for months with a tiger and surviving on crackers and no food for the tiger, which forces the boy to be creative and catch fish to keep the tiger alive and away from him. Eventually he is able to train the tiger and enables him to be around the tiger without being eaten. The end of the movie is awesome when the story becomes a metaphor for the loss of his family. The movie has some very touching moments where you can just imagine being in the precarious position the boy is in. I didn't see it in 3D but still found the effects amazing. It's not really a movie for smaller children < 12, because of the deepness of certain parts of the movie. Definitely a movie I could see again sometimes."

","Thought I'd write this down while it's still fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>What struck me during the movie was how relevant it was to my own life, especially with regards to my relationship with my husband, Beat seen through the eyes of everything I have learnt through Buddhism.<br/><br/>We come face to face with our deepest fears when we are forced to live with a being as dangerous as the tiger with the soul in its eyes being only a reflection of our emotions. Or is it? The tiger is merely a manifestation or projection of what is within ourselves. This same tiger could symbolize a person, situation or thing.<br/><br/>The tiger is our teacher however and we should thank it for teaching us greater understanding and compassion once we can open up and accept it for what it truly is and its nature hence also accept that part inherent in ourselves which we fear and fight. The tiger keeps us alert, tending to its needs gives us purpose and ultimately keeps us alive within a seemingly helpless situation.<br/><br/>We are all teachers in even just what we do silently and the boy is as much a teacher to the tiger as the tiger is to him. Actions transcends language as evident in the relationship between man and animal. Being forced to live together on a lifeboat and a makeshift floating platform at sea taught them both the greatest virtue of patience. The roles of the predator/prey or hunter/hunted becomes reversed at some point in the story. Compassion prevailed instead<br/><br/>We can also learn to appreciate the impermanence and transience of life in that this too will pass which is a proverb indicating that all material conditions, positive or negative, are temporary in the greater scheme of things.<br/><br/>Perhaps when we finally reach shore to safety, the tiger would walk right out of our lives and leave us unceremoniously once and for all without even 'looking back' hence help us acknowledge the truth of what's happened, that a final separation from that person has occurred. And in that acceptance we come to peace. The departure of the tiger could also just signify the change of quality within a relationship.<br/><br/>In the same way, life doesn't go according to plan anyways and we could lose our loved ones suddenly in an unexpected turn of events in a shipwreck. We will all grow old and die someday. Our whole lives is a grand orchestration of letting go.<br/><br/>But we are not the same boy as we were when we unwittingly started out on the greatest journey of our lives that would change our lives forever.<br/><br/>Does God exist? Who knows for sure? Perhaps our individual journey is to discover the mind; with the realization of the ultimate reality or enlightenment being the closest quality of experience in proximity hence intimacy to a God we could experience as stated in the Hindu scriptures.<br/><br/>Now I can honestly say that I can appreciate all the above-mentioned in the movie; Life of Pi."

Are we morons?? Why do we need them to spell out the morals and spiritual points? This is really condescending, obnoxious, and pretty much ruins everything.<br/><br/>Why do we need the gay writer guy with his cute little shirt and beard? He was a bad actor and was totally trying to hide being gay (which is always far more obnoxious than being a flamboyant gay).<br/><br/>Old Pi looked NOTHING like young Pi.<br/><br/>The ""connection"" between Pi and the tiger was not explored enough.<br/><br/>The film hit few poignant emotional cords.

"ghost_dog86","7","0","2","10 December 2012"," Visual Orgasm
","As aesthetically stunning as its trailers suggests, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" (or, as I call it, ""Indian Castaway"") is no doubt the work of the most impressive cinematography/director duo of the year. In saying that, while visually Lee makes the meat of this adaptation sing, like many critics have stated before me, not every great novel (which Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi"" is) can be translated into a fully entertaining piece of cinema; no matter how talented the director, or how faithful Lee's vision of ""Life of Pi"" actually is.<br/><br/>The Plot: If you haven't read the book, ""Life of Pi"" tells the story of a young man that goes by the nickname Pi, whose family owns a zoo in India. Events (concerning taxes or something) cause his family, including all of the animals, to relocate to Canada, via huge freighter. But when they run into a storm, that leaves Pi stranded on a lifeboat, in the middle of the ocean, with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger named RICHARD PARKER, his chances of survival look grim at best. But wait, Pi is narrating the film, so he had to have made itright? OK, to tell you the truth, I was rather bored for the initial 30 minutes, which consisted of 100% conversational exposition. But when the storm happens, everything changes. It isn't until the story moves out onto the water that it begins to take on the visual form that audiences paid for. And during this massive section, Lee doesn't disappoint, creating nearly an hour and a half of mind-blowing, million dollar visuals (at times it is hard to tell what is real and what is computer generated) with an understated suspenseful atmosphere throughout, that will have audiences on the edge of their seats for most of it.<br/><br/>And now for the bad stuff (when pertaining to the adaptation aspect): When I initially read the novel back in high school, the religiously curious, philosophical and man vs. man aspects that the character of Pi is infatuated with in the first part of the novel, reads much better than anything David Magee's screenplay or Lee could combine to manifest on screen; through no fault of their own. But maybe the most standout issue with adapting a book like ""Life of Pi"" arises when sitting down and actually watching this film's resolution. This final ten minutes, taken from (in my opinion) the most intriguing portion of the novel, will come across to a viewing audience as less morbidly engaging, and more lackluster and kid friendly than those who read the book might expect. But then again, I am not reviewing the book, am I? Side Note: I should also make it a point to say that, because a majority of ""Life of Pi"" is a one man show, Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, should get tons of credit for pulling off a rather impressive performance. A performance that will surely be taken for granted because of what Lee pulls off behind the camera.<br/><br/>Final Thought: I can't state enough how the monumentally impressive visuals here have laid down the gauntlet for all future CGI based films. So, if the CGI is the only reason you came to see ""Life of Pi"", you won't be disappointed, as this is clearly the most visually gratifying film of the year, with visuals that will undoubtedly lead to an Oscar nomination for best picture. Yes, some of the sequences come off as slow, the ending, while faithful to the source material, seems more like a cop-out than anything, and at times Lee asks audiences for a suspension of belief that they may not be willing to give, but with a movie that holds its award worthy visuals paramount, ""Life of Pi"" is (for the most part) an entertaining success and worth seeing.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","It's Oscar season now and I am missing out. So, I felt it was time to gather up a group of people and go see one. I desperately want to see Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, because you really can't get much better than Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, and Tommy Lee Jones. But I thought that the group would kill me if I made them sit through two and a half hours of it. I also want to see David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook, but it isn't playing anywhere close to me. So, I settled for Ang Lee's Life of Pi.<br/><br/>Based off of the novel by Yann Martel, this movie has been in development for quite some time. Deemed impossible to make, eventually Lee stepped in. A wise choice I might say, considering this is the man who brought us Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. The movie sounded a little off-putting. But it looked very gorgeous, and I felt like this was something that needed to be experienced in a theater. Oh was I right.<br/><br/>Life of Pi is the story of a boy named Piscine, also known as Pi (older version is played by Irfhan Kahn, who is telling the story to a reporter) whose family owns a zoo. On their way to Canada, their ship crashes, leaving Pi alone on a rowboat, stranded at sea, with a few animals. One of which is a tiger named Richard Parker.<br/><br/>Midway through this movie, I realized what it reminded me of: 127 Hours, that great 2010 Danny Boyle movie with James Franco. This is similar to that movie in the way that the two heroes struggle to survive. Even though Pi never has to cut his arm off, Aron Ralston wasn't stranded for a year. This movie is much prettier than that one, and is the most visually breathtaking film made since last year's Hugo. The cinematography is gorgeous, so gorgeous in fact that I sort of wanted to jump into the screen with Pi. Also, the boat sinking sequence is up there with Titanic. I'd be shocked if it didn't win technical awards.<br/><br/>Life of Pi has some wonderful moments, and some sad moments, and some moving messages. But yet I was a little more intrigued with 127 Hours. That movie was about 87 minutes long. This movie is about two hours long, and though I was fascinated by the entire thing and some of it was pretty exciting, there were some stretches that felt a little slow. Even so, this is a movie that deserves admiration, and even though I don't think it's the best movie of the year, it's one of them. I'll see you at the Oscar starting line, Mr. Lee.<br/><br/>A-<br/><br/>Note: After giving it some thought, I realized that I wasn't really affected by it, so I bring my rating down to an 8 and a B+."

","Castaway meets Planet Earth with a few pointed spiritual overtones thrown in for good measure. As the plot slowly develops, it takes the slant of a classical fantasy adventure, akin to the serial novels and comic strips of the early 20th century, granting the screen an entrancing, otherworldly sensibility. As is, that would've been a perfectly acceptable stylistic decision - after all, director Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made no apologies for its less-grounded moments - but such stylish exaggerations actually become an essential part of the telling when an admission in the final act changes everything we'd just seen. Magnificently composed and spectacularly beautiful, it would be worth watching for the eye candy alone. Lee's restraint in this regard is especially impressive; he knows precisely when his audience will want to linger in a moment and indulges them with one breath-catching vista after another. Kudos to the enormous team of effects artists; their combined efforts have produced a cinematic masterpiece. A bit sluggish at times, with a few moments that tease the boundaries of plausibility, its visuals are a revelation and I'm still considering some of the story's underlying meanings a day later. Worth experiencing."

A great movie to watch with kids and family.The movie has a good start with a narration on the character - PI. The charm gradually fades till the visual and animation come into picture.Felt a bit weird to listen the conversations happening in the Indian style(No offense, I am Indian too).I feel normal English accent could have been more gripping.None of the characters are gripping enough except the character - Richard Parker.I wont tell who Richard Parker is, portrayal of this character is excellent. Ang Lee has focused more on visual effects and has digressed from the characterization of roles.Its worth watching once,its not a movie that you will remember for a long time.The movie will be in no picture when movies emphasizing on visual effects start to come(which is a trend happening now).
