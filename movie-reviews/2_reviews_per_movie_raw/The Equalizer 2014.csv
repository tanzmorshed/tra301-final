","Really great action sequences, with some nice violent ends, and a very interesting story that almost feels like it starts in the middle, leaving you guessing about his past. It kind of has a very John Wick feel to it, but maybe slightly less over-the-top crazy."

","Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is great stuff - if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence."

","In the inventory of almost normal heroes like Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Frank Castle, Bryan Mills, John Wick, ... here is a brand new one: Robert McCall a.k.a. The Equalizer. He gives a chance to the unlucky ones against the villains, by 'equaliz'-ing the forces. In this first opus, he meets by chance a prostitute as young as lost and ... hop! hop !! hop !!! ... he annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston. Wooooow!. Sounds easy!! The result is rather successful. I loved it."
"CalRhys","Null","247","338","3 October 2014"," A Stylish And Daring Action Thriller
","Antoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip- roaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department."
"TopDawgCritic","8","42","53","27 July 2018"," Denzel Washington made this film better than it was
","So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.<br/><br/>It's too bad both films had the same director and writers, as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes. Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either. <br/><br/>Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues. Nevertheless still enjoyable. I hope if they come out with a EQ3, they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing."
"mjacksongta","8","48","62","4 November 2015"," Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side
","In terms of an action movie I gave the equalizer a 7 but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an 8. Why? We'll it's an action movie but yet there's no crazy car chases, there's no bombs or heavy big explosions every where. Really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they don't come that often. But when they do come they deliver. Denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie. The main character Robert McCall in an ex specialist of some sort, you don't know what at first but know that he's highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at Home Depot or home Mart as it is in the movie. He looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon. And he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character. A man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard. <br/><br/>As always I don't want to give spoilers but I do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie."
"missgriffin","10","371","559","10 September 2014"," If you love Denzel, and you loved Training Day, and your only wish was that that bad-ass could have been a good guy, then this is the movie for you!!!!!
","The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washington's Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights, special effects and fantastic explosions, The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative, who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained, but with ever-building intensity, Washington turns in another stellar performance. <br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz, as the teenage prostitute, is a force...<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua, the directer who brought us Training Day, which earned Denzel his Best Actor Oscar, helms this movie with a steady hand. His direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly, drawing us into the complexity of this character-driven piece. <br/><br/>Robert McCall keeps to himself, content to live his ordinary life; he is every man's man. But, his steady moral compass, and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray. This character is not infallible, and he is not looking for trouble. He just wants what's right. <br/><br/>This film is a superbly acted, exciting and violent ride! In the pursuit of justice, there will be blood. But this time, you'll be rooting for the good guy, and I, a fifty years young woman, loved every minute of it!"
"LloydBayer","7","164","240","24 September 2014"," Gruesome at times, The Equalizer is a rewarding action film for every single Denzel Washington fan out there.
","Rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching Denzel Washington dish out some brutal punishment. This is exactly what you get in The Equalizer, an action thriller based on the late 80's TV series of the same name, but amped up with ultra-violent realism.<br/><br/>Reunited after their collaboration in Training Day, Washington (received his first Academy Award in a leading role) and director Antoine Fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film. Using a Mark Twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life, Washington plays Robert McCall, a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past. On the surface, he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself, indulging in conversations only when spoken too, and slave to some sort of OCD while remaining invisible to people around him. After befriending a Russian teen escort called Alina, (Chloe Grace Moretz all grownup), and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse, McCall's nice-guy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity. There's a tightly restrained compassion in McCall's eyes, fighting a father-figure compulsion to do what he must, while Alina's is a muted plea for deliverance. This scene takes place in a diner they frequent in Boston, and it's the first of two powerful moments in the film. What follows is the film's first action sequence in a Tarantino-styled dialogue first, and blood splatter later, McCall dispatches Alina's Russian pimp and his goons. When news reaches Moscow, mob kingpin Pushkin sends Teddy (Marton Csokas), to clean up the mess. Covered with satanic tattoos, Teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the Boston PD on his payroll, it's just a matter of when and where McCall is eliminated. Or so they think.<br/><br/>Having previously scripted The Expendables 2, Richard Wenk's story here is nothing new when considering McCall's proverbial 'set of skills', a comparison if you must, to certain characters Liam Neeson has played. On the other hand, there is a mechanism in place, partly due to the aforementioned OCD, allowing McCall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy. While that sounds like a knock-off version of combat tactics employed by Guy Ritchie's titular hero in Sherlock Homes (2009), the payoff is watching McCall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry. It gets a bit hokey towards the end, with McCall using all manner of booby traps to slice, dice and blow up Teddy's dumber-by-the-minute henchmen. Having said that, it is still rewarding to watch Washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to Csokas' terrific portrayal of Teddy's loathsome nature. To that effect, the best scenes in the film are when Teddy and McCall are face-to-face and denting each other's armour with nothing but well written dialogues. One such scene is a powerful dinner table battering-of-wits, a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in Heat (1995).<br/><br/>While humour and drama throw some light on Boston's mob controlled dirty cops, McCall's relationships with his colleagues, and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer, The Equalizer really shines with Fuqua's deft handling of action scenes. But topping it off is Washington in a vigilante role that is the best we've seen in years. Fans of Man on Fire (Washington opposite Dakota Fanning) and LÃ©on: The Professional (Jean Reno opposite Natalie Portman), both films about male heroism influenced by female protÃ©gÃ©s, are in for a visual treat. Heck, who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average Joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume? Although compelled to use the N-word, I'll just say â Ma man Denzel. . .doesn't disappoint and neither does The Equalizer."
"cap96","10","274","426","17 September 2014"," McCall...NOT McClane!! Dark, edgy violence, as well as fantastic performances separate this action movie from the pack!!
","Some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical, run-of-the-mill, action movie, nothing you haven't seen before....nothing could be farther from the truth!! <br/><br/>This movie is based off the television series called ""The Equalizer"". It is about an ex-CIA operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse. This movie version of The Equalizer is more reminiscent of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick. In fact, in Mr. Damon's own words, The Equalizer ""...reminded me of the Bourne Identity, in that both are sophisticated adult, thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of high-action exploits, but aren't running around in spandex."" Directed by the great Antoine Fuqua, the man who brought us Training Day, The Equalizer is a gritty and violent, suspenseful and superb action film. This movie is very character-driven, and Denzel Washington, who plays protagonist Robert McCall, gives another stellar performance. His character lives alone, keeps to himself, and seems to suffer from some form of OCD. Most importantly, McCall is not McClane! He is not a wise-cracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time, but rather a quiet and complex character, whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten. <br/><br/>This movie gives you everything you would want from an action film: guns, explosions and great effects. However, the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of it's R- rating, and create this film's authentic feel. The excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie. Team Washington/Fuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times, and one you will cheer on every step of the way!!!"
"ToddWebb","6","179","282","5 October 2014"," Mostly atmosphere, zero story
","At the end of it all, I found this movie very boring. The story is old as dirt. The plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify, ""He'll be killed,"" ""She'll be kidnapped and used as bait,"" ""Something bad's gonna happen to him,"" and my all-time favorite, ""He's the innocent, likable guy introduced early then ignored for 90 minutes (so we'll forget about him), only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown."" And every prediction is spot-on.<br/><br/>Example of bad writing: Two thugs walking up to a door. The last thing Thug 2 says to Thug 1 as they approach the door, ""Whatever you do, don't call him Little John."" Very next shot, inside the door, Thug 1 starts talking smack... and guess what he does? When the setup is literally 5 seconds earlier, we all see it coming. Give us the setup in a different location, maybe? Or at least disguise the setup amidst a longer, funny/entertaining conversation? Nope, just lay out that one line setup, then walk on in. We the viewers will just deal with it.<br/><br/>Denzel's character is likable. I mean, insanely likable. Beyond the depth of my willful suspension of disbelief likable. He's always friendly, always in a good mood, always smiling. He's ecstatic just to be alive. Everyone loves being near him. He's never ""just a guy."" He's more helpful than a college professor, more inspirational than a priest, more motivational that a fitness instructor. Every scene in his workplace (which is visited repeatedly throughout the movie) includes no less than 2 background guys smiling giddily when Denzel arrives to work, and laughing loud at every word Denzel speaks. Going to work at Home Depot - sorry, ""Home Mart"" - surely isn't like that in real life.<br/><br/>But there's more to Denzel, isn't there? Who is this guy? Where'd he come from? Who knows? We'll never know. But clearly he's bad-ass. More moves than Shakira and deadlier than Seal Team Six. He seems to know how to handle any situation and any number of attackers - just because. No reason; he's just awesome. If you ever saw the classic comedy PLANET TERROR, just think of the scene, ""Give him the gun. Give him all the guns."" Because, ya know, he's just so bad-ass for no logical reason.<br/><br/>The bad guy was awesome. While Denzel's fight scenes were a lot of super-close blurry shots, the few scenes where the Bad Guy establishes his badness were rather good, very tense, very violent and cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>THE EQUALIZER has all latest bells and whistles with music, atmosphere, and build-up. The one female lead is developed nicely (especially compared to every other innocent victim who may as well have stepped out of Little House On The Prairie). Much of the movie is very tense, and keeps you hanging on to each scene, waiting to see what happens next. But ultimately, we all know Denzel will kick ass, so it's all just a waiting game. It felt very long. The wait is made so much worse when the viewer knows exactly what's coming. There's just no surprises here. You've seen this movie 500 times, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and Denzel knows everything. He appears magically inside buildings and rooms where one shouldn't be able to sneak in. He has cell phone numbers one shouldn't have access to - the characters even comment on it, ""How the hell did you get that number?!"" No answer. Doesn't matter. It's a movie. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the tension building. How does Denzel know when the bad guys will appear at a time and place, so he can intercept them in the night? Don't know, doesn't matter, I guess. How does Denzel sneak into a closet-sized room without the occupant noticing? How does Denzel have time to set up his trap, rig wires, etc, without anyone seeing this work being done? Who cares, the resulting deaths are cool.<br/><br/>Go to sleep. Tune out. Enjoy. But don't expect to take this movie with you. You'll have forgotten it by the time you leave the parking lot."
"MediaPanther","8","126","199","26 September 2014"," Washington nails it
","Antoine Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the 80â²s TV series The Equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window, and into the orderly and near empty apartment, belonging to Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). McCall lives a Spartan existence; for the first twenty minutes of the picture, he hardly says a word. Fuqua (Training Day) gives a lengthy shot as you watch McCall fold something delicately into a napkin. When you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner, and place the teabag into a cup of hot water, you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit, firmly set in his ways. Every night he's there, reading a book. He's such a regular, that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute, Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz)), which eventually grows into something of a friendship. There is something undeniably hidden within him, however. When he realizes the danger Teri is in thanks to her nefarious Russian pimps, he forgoes his cautious life, and willingly brings on the pain.<br/><br/>Director Fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences. His relative quiet touches give way to mayhem. Before every murder McCall commits, the camera slows down, taking on a golden hue, and you literally see McCall breaking down every element of his victims: tattoos, facial expressions. And then he lets loose: even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch Mafiosi in 30 seconds or less.<br/><br/>And The Equalizer is undeniably fun. It's one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric, and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers; and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that McCall decides to take down the entire East Coast hub of the Russian mafia, simply over one teenage prostitute. But with Fuqua this stylistically assured, and Washington equally game, does it really matter?<br/><br/>As Teri, Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Carrie) forgoes the sarcastic strategy Jodie Foster used as a teenage hooker in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers, and is less given to false bravado as result. And even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away, she is a great deal of fun to watch, and she holds her own more than capably against Denzel Washington (The Book Of Eli). The habit of extended cameos in The Equalizer is even more extreme in the case of Melissa Leo as Robert's former CIA contact, who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster, and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife, while offering a small measure of comfort. The bit part parade reaches ""blink-and-you-miss him"" cameo status, by casting a reputable star like Bill Pullman as Leo's husband, and giving him no more than four lines (though of course it's possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room).<br/><br/>If anything, a weakness of The Equalizer is that McCall's troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous. Who can blame it really? The opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity, and it succeeds, but isn't really interested in following through. For all its thin characterization, there is something just as nice in watching Denzel Washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance.<br/><br/><ul><li>See more at: www.mediumraretv.org</li></ul>"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","36","55","1 October 2014"," Denzel Washington in ""The Toolbox Murders""
","In its introductory scenes The Equalizer is not a bad movie. However, once the plot gets underway it becomes one. Here is yet another movie about a one-man arsenal hell-bent on mopping the floor with grimy hoodlums who are turning the world into a cesspool of inhuman cruelty while wallowing in blood and gore. You've seen this movie before â an ordinary guy walks into a room full of gun-toting thugs and, in 40 seconds of jump cuts, dispatches everybody in the room and then struts out the door accompanied by a rock soundtrack.<br/><br/>ClichÃ©s like this can be avoided. I was impressed last week by the skill with which Scott Frank rethought the elements of this genre in A Walk Among the Tombstones, so it stands to reason that I had hope that Antoine Fuqua could have that kind of restraint with this movie. After all, this is his re-teaming with Denzel Washington after directing him to a Best Actor Oscar twelve years ago in Training Day. He can't. This is a routine bloodbath that steals elements from Taxi Driver, Walking Tall, Taken, Dirty Harry, and every other man-against-the-machine movie of the last 40 years.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is based very loosely on a CBS television series starring the late Edward Woodward that ran from 1985 to 1989. It was a good show, featuring the adventures of a retired intelligence agent-turned-private eye named Robert McCall who specialized in helping out the little guy. The movie has a little of that, it has Denzel Washington as a guy who lives a fastidious lifestyle, barren of all clutter, who spends his days and nights in a course of routine. He works in a home supply store by day and spends his evenings at his regular table at the corner coffee shop reading Hemingway.<br/><br/>We don't know much about him but his obsessive compulsive nature fascinates us â he notices things. He's interested in those around him. At work, he takes pity on a co-worker named Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who is trying to lose weight to become a security guard. At the restaurant, he has friendly conversations with a young girl named Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) whose choice of outfits leave no mystery about what she does for a living.<br/><br/>One night Teri is picked up by her pimp and later ends up in the ICU. McCall follows up on her and finds out that the pimp is working for the Russian mob. What follows is the kind of movie that Charles Bronson use to make in his later years when he was just repeating the formula of Death Wish. McCall single-handedly sparks a one-man war against the Russian Mafia, not satisfied to take out the guy who roughed up Teri, he has to rub out the entire foundation of the city's criminal elite. Over and over he walks into a room and wipes out every guy in the room with whatever happens to be available at the moment, mainly power tools. No points for guessing that his job at the home supply store will come back in the film's action climax.<br/><br/>The movie is one long bore. It starts off with some interest before it gets tedious, then it gets frustrating, then it gets boring, then it gets repetitive, then it becomes a parody of itself. The villains all look the same. The story repeats the same stuff over and over. And Denzel's character is such a good fighter that there is no dramatic tension in the fight scenes. By the time we see Denzel walking in slow-mo toward the camera while the building behind him blows up real good, you get the feeling that the writer and the director just didn't care."
"dwhite42-66-658994","10","134","229","4 October 2014"," Love Denzel In Any Movie But This Was Awesome
","The movie was action packed and I love when the good guy always win. The character don't talk much but you can only pull that off if you are a good actor. The young actress I hear she is 17 did an amazing job to play that part.Denzel no words you still got the box office power. My husband ex marine he would not stop hollering when one scene came up he gets a kick out of that stuff. Never seen the Equalizer series at all so my opinion is from the movie only. Sequel is wide open lets have more next year. Hope to see more. Love It. Hope the DVD be out for a Christmas Present for the husband I will be buying it. All I can say is go see this movie because it is very good don't listen to the haters."
"bbickley13-921-58664","8","113","192","26 September 2014"," Denzel Washington is dope
","Action, drama, humor, Denzel can due it all. Based on the TV show, Denzel Washington is yet another old man, similar to Pierce Bronson in the November Man, trying to prove he's still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a Megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the Russian Mafia, then becomes a target for the main boss.<br/><br/>The movie had a quiet tone similar to Denzel and Director Antoine Fuqua's last flick, Training Day, but Denzel's performance in this is far more Oscar worthy. Denzel still brings passion to movies in an age were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check, and basically that's what makes the movie. Watching Denzel on screen.<br/><br/>In all fairness, The Equalizer's main antagonist, A man the mob sends to take care of their problems, was no slouch either. It was so entertaining watching these two hunt each other down.<br/><br/>Possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough ChloÃ« Grace Moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo.<br/><br/>Overall Mr. Fuqua directed the great Denzel in another amazing role."
"hopsinglinglao","2","261","476","31 October 2014"," A Script Written By A 5-Year-Old Aspiring Hollywood Screenwriter
","Sorry Denzel, not even your amazing talent could save this laughably insultingly lame, simple-minded, patronizing movie straight from the mind of a toddler trapped in a 38 year old Hollywood screenwriter fantasizing about saving abused hookers from fat Russian mobsters. But 2 good things about this movie: 1) Denzel AND 2) Mustache twirling, bootleg Kenneth Branagh main villain.<br/><br/>And from this point on my review will simply be titled ""Hollywood Thinks....""<br/><br/>1) Hollywood thinks that Russians speaking to each other randomly pepper-in English for some odd reason & then go back to their native language to say important info like ""Yes""<br/><br/>2) Hollywood thinks every man only gets mad about injustice when it's a young attractive female who is being abused and beaten by rich, fat, ultra violent, mustache twirling foreigner/weirdos.<br/><br/>3) Hollywood thinks ex-CIA members go around wiping out entire crime families not because they want to stop crime or injustice to the general public, but because one white woman was abused by Russian pimp-mobsters who very obviously had done that type of thing to countless men/women before. But it is okay for the hero to murder people because, hey, they hit a woman & they are one-dimensional evildoers who don't deserve even a trial or gas chamber for their crimes, they deserve a vigilante death.<br/><br/>4) Hollywood thinks the Russian mafia and the Boston PD are both incompetent fools: These rocket scientists run around saying things like ""no witnesses"" but brashly brandish guns in broad daylight and shoot at things all the time out in public while doing faux-military hand- gestures thought up by the 5 year old screenwriter while playing Contra. And apparently half of the corrupt cops in this universe are making gobs of money with the oh-so-dangerous yet generic ""mafia"" groups while the other half is shaking down Mexican Jack Black's mom for pocket change at a taco stand because that's such a booming industry in the Southy Projects. Feed me to thah POOR by dah way.<br/><br/>5) Hollywood thinks an ex-CIA member can lecture mobsters about lying, killing, and insulting a government agency for corruption...as if they have such a squeaky clean record. And they also think we the idiot simpleton audience is supposed to shake in our boots at these tired, played out tropes revolving around the ""RUSSIANS"" and ""CIA"" and ""CORRUPT COPS"" who talk like caricatures from an unreleased Sopranos sub-plot. <br/><br/>6) Hollywood thinks that every vigilante murder, destruction of property, torture, etc. can be written off as legitimate because said vigilante was an ex-CIA/FBI/Law enforcement officer with some current tie to an operational government contact (in this case a female instead of a male because that is just so out of the box & unexpected) So progressive this film.<br/><br/>7) Hollywood thinks they need to shoot everything in slow motion because MATRIX.<br/><br/>8) Hollywood thinks people with guns often give vigilantes 20 minutes of slow motion time to plan out killing them with random blunt or sharp objects just after adjusting skull-shaped items to foreshadow their doom.<br/><br/>9) Hollywood thinks the audience is stupid (and they may have a point) so constantly have characters yell out things like ""OH THIS IS THE RING I LOST"" and ""OH MY GOD YOU DID IT!"" because we idiots could not done figure that out oh golly geez and a wippdee doo!<br/><br/>10) Hollywood thinks by shooting people talking that are famous and telegraphing what is good and evil, over and over again with the same idiotic tropes, that it counts as great cinema. F**K Hollywood and F**K this movie."
"billygoat1071","6","60","100","1 October 2014"," Colder Opportunities
","The Equalizer is loosely based on an 80s television series with the same name. This reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent, but the film's ambition is basically turning its star, Denzel Washington, into a grittier action hero. It somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood, and it's amazing how he could still carry the character's humanity along the way. The film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context. If you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality, you can still tell that it's a pretty entertaining piece of action, but in general it's just difficult to not notice its mess of tones, even with that amount of fun.<br/><br/>There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice.<br/><br/>The cool slow-mos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension, but put that aside, each action scene is watchable enough, we don't usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this. This is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces. Denzel Washington shifts his character to two personalities: one is the likable ordinary man himself and the anti-hero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world. The performance does sum up the overall movie, from gravitas to smugness, and what's great is they're both effective anyway. However, the villains (and their tattoos) have blatantly shown that they're evil: the main antagonist seems like he's written to be over-the-top, almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso, but Marton Csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it.<br/><br/>The Equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent, but I could guarantee that it still entertains, it does have the appeal through its action and acting. Though, there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller. The film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements, but it just keeps shifting back and forth, like we're not getting to the actual big picture. Well, if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience. For now, it can be endlessly watchable, but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it."

You have seen this type before, so many times, sometimes with Neeson in it, some time with Bruce Willis etc., but the difference was the villain in this movie, Mr. Csokas, whom I find another brilliant actor as well, but the problem is, I believe, his character is extremely underwhelmed, regardless of some fancy show off Fuqua tried to pull. Just like 'Flight', Washington drives the movie, and this movie means Washington, which is sad, because we have seen how much great of a role a villain can play a lot of times, some exclusive examples would be Dark Knight Rises, Skyfall etc. in latest times.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Denzel was great as usual, but as I said, I expected a lot from Csokas' role too, but I left extremely disappointed. Another negative of the movie is how it ended, I mean I don't really remember an abrupt ending like this on a movie for a long time. It just finished, and in an awful fashion (you can't stop the inevitable but really they could have at least made it a lot tastier), just like someone was running out of time.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it was another propaganda type movie, but I knew that, it was very entertaining nevertheless, with usual brilliance of Washington, and Csokas too, I mean to whatever extent he was given the chance to show off his. You will certainly enjoy this, like I did, but if you wanted a complete package, well you will miss it.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, Regards, Saurav."

","Fairly solid action scenes, characters and overall execution. Somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable. This is definitely a sensationalistic film(The most sensationalistic of Washington's career without a doubt.), and it's mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well, but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time. Even though it has a running time of over two hours, the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes, but nonetheless it's still worth a look if you're into these kinds of films. The movie didn't remind me much at all of the old T.V. series of the same name. The film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that Charles Broson use to do. All that said, this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you don't want to think much, and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence. It's that kind of guilty pleasure. 6.5/10"
"MUFCOK","6","8","11","3 March 2015"," A film with many faults but having Denzel as the lead saved it from failure.
","Denzel Washington is one of my favourite actors of all time, if he's in a film that will one of the deciding factors to whether I go and see it or not. I think the Equalizer was made with this in mind, it is far from great, it feels lazy and lacks any real depth but they know that a film with Denzel as the lead will draw in the audiences.<br/><br/>The script, pacing, storyline & character development all let this movie down in my opinion and when you add all of those to clichÃ©d, predictable scenarios; it really doesn't make for a very good movie. The story is so over done that there is no way it can offer the viewer any surprises, we have seen this so many times before, from the plot to the characters to the scenarios, it all feels very repetitive. Denzel gives a good solid performance but he is hindered by the awful, basic, mind numbing script. He really wasn't given much to work with and the scenes where he was given large amounts of dialogue it just felt clichÃ©d and predictable. I think it was trying to be one of those thinly plotted, action movies where you can switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is. I think it does a good job at being this apart from one major fault: The pacing. The poor script and lack of depth to the plot make it drag somewhat. It is simply too long for what it is; with a run time of over 2 hours it really drags in the middle. The first 30-40 minutes are good and intriguing and the final 30 minutes offer good action and some good scenes, the middle 45-50 minutes simply doesn't have enough about it to keep your attention.<br/><br/>The Equalizer isn't without its positives though; Denzel Washington shows us another great, convincing performance, he really is a joy to watch. He plays a very likable character with ease; you always feel like you can connect with him as an actor, that is probably one of his greatest traits. The film looks brilliant; the settings are all faultless and expose a real gritty, atmosphere. Some of the scenes are very well done; the scenes at the start and the end scene in particular are well made and tense. The cinematography was given a lot of attention, the action scenes are very immersing, different approaches are used with slow motion shots and great music.<br/><br/>Overall, The Equalizer has plenty of issues but also has many things which I like. It is easy watching, but that is about all. It isn't going to be remembered as a classic and it certainly isn't one of Denzel Washington's better films but it is entertaining enough. Just don't expect too much.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Fitzbob","3","102","203","20 September 2014"," Long, Dumb and not so Fun
","In 2003 while Denzel Washington was promoting his dumb but fun thriller Out of Time he gave an interview stating how it was nice to star in a film that didn't require him to do too much. Coming off the back of his 2002 Oscar win for Training Day, Washington didn't exactly sugar coat the idea that Out of Time was a pay check gig pure and simple. Since then Denzel's film choices have seemed littered with these quick cash movies. For every Man on Fire or Inside Man we get a Safe House or last year's forgettable 2 Guns. The Equalizer sees Washington re-team for the first time since 2002 with Training day Director Antoine Fuqua. Audience's hoping to see a return to form from the Training day duo maybe disappointed. The Equalizer feels like another pay check gig, it certainly is dumb it lacks any of the fun of Out of Time...And that movie stared Dean Cain.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is a remake in name only of the 80's television series of the same name. The show starred Edward Woodard as a retired government agent turned private detective. He spends each episode helping people similar to the A-team or Highway to Heaven. It was never a show I was practically aware of but it seemed to be stable Television for my parents growing up. The 2014 version sees Washington play Robert McCall, a mysterious quiet man who gets sucked back into his old violent ways while trying to help out a number of people in his life. These people include a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She is under the control of the Russian Mafia who doesn't take to kindly to their business being interrupted. If the plot synopsis sounds familiar it's because it's the basic premise for most Steven Segal movies or any action movie in the 80's. Don't get me wrong The Equalizer is far better than any Half Past Dead or Exit Wounds (maybe not Under Siege) but it is the first sign that this long awaited big screen Equalizer lacks any sort of Originality. Antoine Fuqua with the exception of Training Day has never really dazzled on the big screen. Films like Shooter and Tears of the Sun look the part but never really excite as action films. The Equalizer is no different. Long when it should be tight and loud when it should be quiet. The Equalizer is a bit like a spinning plate. It starts off straight before quickly wobbling then completely crashing to the ground. Fuqua and writer Richard Wenk should take the full brunt of this. The script feels like it should have undergone another re-write, you can feel every minute of the films 131 min running time. In an effort to include elements of the show Denzel finds himself helping multiple characters during the movies 2nd act. Great for them but this puts the main plot on hold killing all momentum. At one stage Washington leaves the film altogether to meet with old work friends (sorely underused Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman) for a scene that does not add to the story in any way. Elements are brought up but never go anywhere. It is eluded that his Character has OCD but this is never established and appears and re-appears at random. All this makes the film disjointed and adds to the already bloated running time.<br/><br/>At this point you could forgive all this because it is an action film and you paid to see Denzel kick ass and take names. Unfortunately Fuqua drops the ball in this department also. An initial confrontation with Russian heavies is well shot for maxim tension but quickly unravels once the action starts. The film feels like it's edited in an attempt to cut around some of the violence and this makes the fight scenes seem clunky. It doesn't help that it is so poorly let, a similar compliant that was leveled against Fuqua last film Olympus has fallen.<br/><br/>Denzel is always a watchable presence no matter what he is in and here it is no different. Unfortunately the screen play doesn't give him much of a character to work with. The story goes out of its way to keep his character a mystery, we learn next to nothing about him which makes it difficult to root for him. He just comes across as bored or uninterested. He does get some moments to shine and he is a warm presence in the his scenes with Chloe Grace Moretz. Moretz here is excellent in the role bringing a real vulnerability as a young Russian Call girl and the late night conversations they share about books (although very on the nose) are engaging. She brings a real heart to the film which is sadly lost when she is sidelined for the bulk of the running time. Without her Washington's character has no one to bounce off. He just becomes a bore. <br/><br/>It would be easy to compare this film to Tony Scott's excellent Man on Fire and the marketing has gone to some length to draw a similarity between the two. Man on fire succeeded because Tony Scott was wise enough to spend an hour of the running time building a relationship between the two leads. Denzel's anger and revenge seems justified. In the Equalizer it feels like Fuqua skips through this stuff to get to the money shots. It's interesting that both films contain a shot of the lead character walking away from an Explosion, In Man on Fire it's a moment which signifies the storm that is to come and the level of violence he is willing to go to. In the Equalizer it's a hollow eye rolling moment thrown in just because it looks cool. It kind of sums up the whole film. (D)"

"Wizard-8","Null","9","13","10 June 2015"," Predictable but watchable
","I am not sure why the makers of this movie bothered to get the rights to do a movie version of a television series when the movie has very little of the elements that were found in the television series. I guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series, the movie would have instant ""branding"" and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters. Anyway, the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you haven't seen before either on television or in other movies. You'll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does. On the other hand, these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner. Washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game, the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting, and the movie as a whole looks very nice. So I'm giving this movie a cautionary recommendation. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. But if you don't mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again, you'll find this movie a well crafted retread."

The Russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome (you know, in an evil bad guy way). Of course Denzel is incredibly engaging, but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world.<br/><br/>From the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading, and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be clichÃ©, but I found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes.<br/><br/>If violence bothers you, don't go see this movie.

","Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) has a mysterious past and is trying to live the quiet life working at a Boston home improvement box store. He helps his co-worker Ralphie lose weight to get the security guard job. He's friendly with street walker Teri/Alina (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) whom he often meets as he reads at a local diner. She ends up in the hospital after getting severely beaten up by her pimp Slavi. He tries to buy her freedom but ends up killing everybody. Violent Russian gangsters come looking for payback.<br/><br/>This starts well even with the clichÃ©-filled script. Denzel can pull it off. Chloe is the innocent and he's the knight in shining armor. The problem starts when Chloe disappears after the first act. I expected her to be the second star and she deserves to be. She's good in this movie but it is strictly a solo act. The great brutal violence in Slavi's office is the highlight. The action slowly turns more and more cartoonish. Director Antoine Fuqua has made some great gritty action. I wish he brought a bit more 'Training Day'. Unfortunately, the last battle in the Home Mart reminds me too much of 'Home Alone'. There is something compelling about not showing what happened with the hammer. That's a great scene. It's a little more silly to see all the improvised traps in the store."

","Call it something else, anything else. If Matt Damon thinks it inspired the Jason Bourne stories, then he clearly never watched the original series.<br/><br/>For Edward Woodward's The Equalizer, violence was always the last resort... he tried first, to do everything possible to expose the miscreant to lawful prosecution or forced retreat through intimidation. One classic line from the original series referred to killing a man as denying him the last opportunity to change. The Equalizer was a man who had seen too much violence, and only sought to protect, not to cause further bloodshed. Yes, it was sometimes necessary, but there were entire episodes where he found a solution that didn't result in gun play and violence.<br/><br/>This is simply, one more cheap Hollywood violence fest that undercuts any attempt at moral authority that Hollywood likes to pretend to on violence in our society. I'm glad that Edward Woodward is no longer alive to see the travesty they have made of one of his most memorable screen characters. I like and respect the ability of Denzel Washington, but I will NOT watch one moment of this cheap knockoff of a series that I very much enjoyed."

","Like so many big budget action flicks lately, The Equalizer just can't deliver.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping this movie above cheap action flicks is Denzel Washington. His suave confident self, Denzel moves through the hordes much like his also aging colleague Liam Neeson, crunching bones and slicing throats with satisfying style and skill. It could make a TV cook jealous.<br/><br/>The story, though stuffed with the obligatory clichÃ©s that we expect from a self-respecting action flick, lacks a believable plot. What really stood out, IMHO, was a number of atmosphere spoilers. One that comes to mind is building up a pretty decent bad guy and then letting him leave almost unnoticed through the back door.<br/><br/>The main flaw, and a very regrettable one, is that the movie fails to develop Washington's full potential. The guy is pictured as a true killing machine, but just when we're nailed to our chairs, the whole thing falls flat. The book scene being extremely impressive, many of the other scenes missing out either through the lack of direction or by a lack of scripting.<br/><br/>There are many cheaper Jason Statham movies that deliver more satisfactory action. Looking at those and at the first Taken movie, the answer must be simplicity. The Equalizer has too much excess luggage and ends up losing the fight."

"geobyr25","6","18","35","15 October 2014"," Too long, too violent, no plot...
","I'll start with the positives.<br/><br/>Great acting overall; Denzel, Chloe and I really liked Marton Csokas (who reminded me of a young Kevin Spacey.) The chemistry between Denzel and Marton was great and there were some really comic bits with Denzel dancing, handing out the money etc etc. I like Chloe Moretz and she really has grown up and grown into her roles.<br/><br/>However, I didn't like her in this role she didn't suit the character of Russian abused prostitute. She was very, healthy looking, if you know what I mean. Just because she wears a few different wigs doesn't make me care about her. Even after she got hospitalised I didn't care for the character as there as noooo development. A flashback of how she got sent to America and wound up where she did would have been helpful. But, no we just see her at a Cafe, she swears and wears a pair of slutty shoes and BAM we are expected to know who she is.<br/><br/>Another thing that annoyed me was the complete lack of motive. Denzel didn't have a real reason to do ANYTHING he did in the whole film. I understand he cared about this random prostitute (who's name he learned 10 minutes before defending her honor) but to brutally, and i mean BRUTALLY murder about 30 people because she got beaten up?! I mean fair play, beat up the 1 guy who did it because she's about 16 but going all the way to Moscow to kill some guy who doesn't even know your name? While he's showering?! Didn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>Once again, the general lack of character development bothered me. They tried to make Denzel mysterious and it just seemed lazy and straight up boring. Who were the random couple he visited? Their names weren't even mentioned and they served no purpose other than to give a bit of random re-con on Marton's character. That then went on to serve no purpose...<br/><br/>There was a glimpse of a revelation, random woman divulged into Denzel having previously faked his death or something along those lines but it was never discussed again. And there was a mention of another wife that had died that he promised to never do 'what he does' again for? And if he loved this wife so much why would he go all nail gun, sledgehammer, mirror shard, corkscrew CRAZY to BRUTALLY kill so many people to avenge some random girl getting beaten up? Surely the promise made to a dead wife is more important than some girl who isn't really your problem? It was far too violent. As an example, Liam Neeson's 'Taken' has just the right amount of violence, you know the people he comes across are dead without having to show a zoomed shot of a corkscrew lodged into their throat. Or nail guns piercing flesh, throats being slit open, barbed wire ripping through someone's neck, a drill into someone's spine. It was like a SAW movie?! I expected violence, I enjoy horror films but it was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>The finale reminded me of Home Alone! Using all the home depot gadgets to beat the baddies! When I saw him heating up the doorknob I laughed at how much it reminded me of the Christmas hit. And then the violence x10000 started and it got boring QUICK.<br/><br/>And then it went ON for another 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Disappointed in you Denzel."

A mixture of Rambo and MacGyver. Sorry but that was far too much especially the fact that he consequently refused to use the heavy weaponry of the killed bad asses but preferred to use garden equipment or a nail gun powered by a war air pressure patron.

It's easy enough to argue that The Equalizer is a perfectly good action movie, but for the intelligent viewer, it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions.<br/><br/>The script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped. It's always nice to see Washington as a top tier bad ass, who is as untouchable as the younger Steven Seagal, but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation. And then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all; a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore. Here we start to border on satire as Washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise. these images will put a smile on your face, but they go on too long.<br/><br/>The Equalizer, like Taken, is an action movie that doesn't rise above the sum of it's parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it..

And OCD is not time dilation.<br/><br/>I kept thinking of the tagline from the Taken movies: I have a very specific set of skills. If CIA agents were like this we wouldn't need the US Army.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable.<br/><br/>I thought McCall had a completely unexplained no-guns policy, despite the TV character's highly visible pistol, because he keeps ignoring guns in favor of cutting up his own hands, but at the end he shoots a whole bunch of people. And why do the bad guys fire silenced assault rifles without a target?"
"spikenard222","2","23","47","15 February 2015"," Bad, really bad (spoiler alert)
","Wow...this was bad, just bad.<br/><br/>McCall has zero character development. I mean literally none. By the end of the film, we know nothing more about him than we do at the start. He's trying to read a hundred books, and obsessively keeps time of things (why?), and... The garbled explanation about his wife was so confusing that I have no idea what was said. I thought at least Nicolai would give an interesting story about McCall in the same way that McCall did about him, but no, we get nothing. So, how am I supposed to care about this robotic assassin? <br/><br/>And the action violence...sigh. Hollywood just needs to stop. The scenarios are so ludicrous anymore as to be embarrassingly laughable. I mean, we see McCall in a room with four or five Russian gangsters, and we just *know* what's gonna happen. The scenes are either so predictable that they're boring beyond belief, or so far-fetched as to be unbelievable. How many times are we gonna see bad guys with guns feeling the need to get within two feet of the hero so that they are vulnerable to Hollywood kung fu? Or how about minions just bringing the protagonist right to the key leader? I just can't suspend my disbelief anymore. In the real world, assassinating a mafia don would be extremely difficult, requiring a lot of planning and luck. McCall just waltzes in and does it in an hour. That's not believable!<br/><br/>And the villains! You know, you need your villain to be credible and effective, or there's no urgency to the threat. Unfortunately, these Russians, despite how tough they look, are powderpuff buffoons! Seriously, McCall dispatches them so easily that they can't be taken seriously. The only one who actually threatens McCall in any way is the bald guy with the tweaked mustache - that was the only point in the whole film when it felt like McCall was in any danger. Other than that, the bad guys just fall for one obvious trick after another.<br/><br/>This truly was a paint-by-numbers, ludicrous, boring waste of time. What did it have to do with the original Equalizer anyway?"

","I've been trying to figure out the difference between action heroes like Denzel Washington here or Matt Damon in the Bourne franchise and Superman -- I mean Clark Kent's Superman. It's not always easy. They're always ""mild mannered"" until their latent identity is triggered. None of them ever seems to lose a battle or be seriously wounded. And they may not have X-ray vision but here the camera takes us inside Washington's eyeball and quick cuts show us the details of his surroundings that he's noticing.<br/><br/>Washington is another lightning-fast killer with a hidden identity. Just trying to get along in a huge Home Depot warehouse. But these damned Russian pimps and mobsters keep getting in his way, clobbering his friends, investigating him, and generally making nuisances of themselves. And, man, are they UGLY -- hawk-nosed, covered in inscrutable, tattoos, and with complexions like a relief map of Afghanistan. Always sneering. Washington begins to push back, wiping out six alert armed men in twenty seconds, as if he'd choreographed the dance.<br/><br/>The Russians in turn call in their expert hit man, Marton Csokas, who may be the best performer in the movie in that he's able to segue between his two expressions -- a smile and a sneer. He kills and maims brutally.<br/><br/>No matter that he's the best there is. Washington kills him too, blows up some of the Russian mafia's oil tankers because -- well, just because -- and then tracks down the capo de tutti capi in Moscow and eliminates him. End of Russian mobsters in America, and freedom for all the young girls they've been running. Americans can breathe free again.<br/><br/>If you like the Bourne franchise you'll like this move because it's a close imitation. I thought that -- for what it was -- it was almost ruined by directorial excess. The camera doesn't wobble too much, thank God, but Fuqua seems intent on calling attention to himself as director. Some of the shots are plain pointless. If Washington prepares a cup of tea, we must follow the teabag and watch it dip into the steaming water. If a kitchen faucet is leaking slightly, the camera is position in the basin of the sink, looking UPWARD at the spout, as a drop of water forms and drips down. The explosive fireballs are in slow motion because they cost a lot of money.<br/><br/>It could have been better. The opening scenes in a kind of New York ""Nighthawks"" cafe are engaging but we don't have to wait long before Clark Kent sheds his drab civilian clothes and emerges in all his majesty to kill the bad guys."

The story is so flawed it reeks of 'somebody didn't attend the read thru' of this screen play...without spoiling.... just watch for the huge disconnects in time-line AND locations once the so called 'action' begins.(And THAT to take forever given the vapidness of this over-used dialogue). The music simply drowns this film in some supposed 'dark power vibe' that never matches the scene or the transitions particularly. The 'drone' even over rides some key Denzel dialogue (and our new theater is DHL certified so was not the sound system). It didn't 'fit'... didn't add and certainly was annoying at best. Denzel has a few charming moments.... but as a menace??/ never.... neither the scenes nor dialogue supported that.

While this is not by far Denzel's best action film, it is entertaining for the most part and I found the best scene not actually one of the fight scenes but the verbal confrontation of both He and Teddy (Marton Csokas).

"Drive-in_Zeppelin","6","16","32","6 October 2014"," No it's not a sequel to Man on Fire - though Denzel Washington IS dope
","Directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter), The Equalizer is a story of vigilante justice and badassery done right. Anywho, Washington plays the seemingly ordinary Robert McCall who works at something like a Home Depot and is generally liked. He helps his coworker get in shape for some physical, he builds rapport with his customers, and he makes small talk with a 17 year old call-girl named Teri played by ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. Wait what? Miss Moretz plays a lady of the evening? Surely you're pulling my leg! No dear reader, she's being pushed around by those sneaky Russian mobsters that occupy the noble city of Boston, so she has no choice! <br/><br/>Carrying onÂTeri (also known as Alina) is one of the regulars at a local diner, similar to something out of Edward Hoppers Nighthawks, that Robert also frequents in his insomnia. He's always reading books such as The Old Man and The Sea and Don Quixote, so they ultimately form an informal bond as she feels a peculiar trust and feeling of safety in his presence. Long story short, Robert finds out that the Russians messed Alina up pretty bad, so he takes it upon himself to try and buy her freedom from the gangsters. This is when the movie turns into The Bourne films as Denzel Washington suddenly channels his inner assassin and kills the 5 gangsters in the most methodical and efficient way possible (because they turned down his petty cash). <br/><br/>Having awoken the inner killer that he apparently was trying to hide, Robert McCall then proceeds to begin a series of vigilante acts to maintain his peaceful, yet seemingly lonely lifestyle. Who is he to have all this advanced killing ability? Well you'll just have to watch the movie! Meanwhile, Marton Csokas is sent in as the archetypal Russian hit-man (despite the actor being from New Zealand) to find out who killed the other Russians. Turns out the gangsters McCall thought were just pimps were actually the local figureheads for a massive criminal syndicate. Go figure.<br/><br/>That's about all I can say for this film. It's extremely well- polished and has decent performances all around. Despite being a bit part, I do want to highlight ChloÃ« Grace Moretz as being an actress I'm extremely excited to watch in the future, though it was a bit unsettling to see the young actress playing a prostitute. Initially I thought she was annoying as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass (2010) but I think that was just her character. I think she's an extremely talented actress and personally cannot wait to see what she delivers in the future. <br/><br/>Additionally, all the technical stuff in this film like set-design, cinematography, action sequences â this movie is basically the ideal standard for how all of those should work in a modern action flick. Anything less is just sloppy film-making in my opinion if this is the type of movie you want to make. Antoine Fuqua delivers a solid film like he did with Training Day (2001) and Shooter (2007) and that's all she wrote.<br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website"

","A highly trained, retired field operative resorts to violence as the only way to free a Russian prostitute from brutal Russian men who are part of an international crime organization. The many years of retirement didn't show any sign of rust on Robert McCall (Washington) as he ran through his adversaries, dismantling one after another, without batting an eye. He made it look too easy. These bad Russian men had nothing for him, which is probably the biggest problem with this film. There is nothing interesting about a Good vs Evil film with weak bad guys. The filmmakers did work hard at trying to make Teddy, played by Marton Csokas, look ruthless and deadly. But I was never convinced, and I doubt whether the many who saw this film with me at the Toronto International Film Festival were convinced as well.<br/><br/>I found the film rather boring for the most part, with a setup unusually longer than anything Hollywood released in decades. The dialogue was heavy handed. The supporting roles didn't provide nothing more than their vulnerability to the scum of society, which beckoned on a hero like McCall to teach them a lesson or two.<br/><br/>And as I stated in my summary, you have already seen this film a thousand times already: the bad guys shooting big, scary guns and rarely grazing the hero, the hero walking away in slow motion from an explosion he caused, bad guys tracking hero down in this sort of cat-and-mouse thing, damsels in distress, high octane martial arts. Wait, the filmmakers did try to make the film unique by excluding a car chase and having McCall kill each and every bad guy in the most unique way every time. A bullet to the cranium wasn't good enough. No. He had to use methods like overflowing bathroom sinks to electrocute someone. He seemed like he was trying to one-up himself every time. The hero doesn't make any mistakes in the process, even taking the time to catch a fly ball to win the company baseball game. The way he swooped in, in slow motion, and snatched that ball from the joker character who thought he had it was roll-your-eyes worthy and completely laughable.<br/><br/>However, when the film got going it started to be exactly what I expected; an entertaining, highly stylized, popcorn film. At the same time, being Fuqua's weakest directorial effort since his first film, I cannot recommend it. 5/10"

","Denzel Washington has been in a lot of good movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Having appreciated the mid 1980's series upon which this movie is loosely based; and liking Denzel Washington as an actor, I went to this movie feeling that the movie had a better than fair chance of being a good action thriller.<br/><br/>The movie starts promisingly as we see Robert McCall's (Denzel's) efforts to positively impact those with whom he works and socializes. Unfortunately, the movie goes downhill from there. While Good guys killing bunches of villains and being unrealistically lucky is standard fare for mindless action films, the initial 20 minutes plus of this film tried so hard to convince us that this was not going to be such a film that the transition to being a mindless action flick is jarring and disappointing. <br/><br/>Sadly, once Robert McCall begins his killing spree it truly does become a mindless action film that is largely without suspense or fun. The lack of fun comes from Washington's character who despite very token almost meaningless efforts to give the bad guys a chance to do the right thing, clearly enjoys figuring out all sorts of ways to kill them. <br/><br/>Of course only bad guys use guns, but highly trained ex CIA operatives/assassins like Robert McCall eschew guns. So ex CIA operative Robert McCall does the competent professional thing by leaving guns on the ground throughout movie, instead choosing to kill the villains using a wide variety of methods that in real life would have put himself and the people he is supposed to be protecting at far greater risk. <br/><br/>As described above, the situations Robert puts himself and the risky way in which he engages the bad guys completely contradicts the idea that he truly is this methodical experienced professional. That he manages to come out ahead could only have been accomplished by script writers with no regard for realism or the viewer's sense of credulity.<br/><br/>The situations were so stupid that even I watched the film I found myself angry with the scriptwriters for being so obviously lazy.<br/><br/>Frustratingly, Washington's character does not even do a good job protecting the innocent, putting them at risk even after being directly warned they will be put at risk by his actions.<br/><br/>In the end this was a poorly made film not because it featured the hero doing ridiculously unrealistic things, but because the movie worked hard at the beginning to tell us this was not going to be mindless action flick, but than went on to deliver a mindless action flick that really was no fun at all."

","The movie started pretty good. That's why it's getting the extra star. But I swear I was laughing when it finished. The best part was when Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) killed the Russian mob with that nailing machine and turned around and left, when Ralfie was shot twice and scared to death in the control room, 20 meters away. hahahaha. Awesome Robert!<br/><br/>I can not even say until what point I was enjoying the movie. It gradually went down until I was not taking it seriously any more. I liked his skills. In this kind of action movies, we usually like when the guy knows what is he doing; like Liam Neeson, in Taken, or Matt Damon, as Jason Bourne. May be Denzel was actually too good; kinda analytical. Almost a superhero. He could be one of the Avengers. If he would have Batman gadgets, he would beat Batman.<br/><br/>I definitely didn't like how overloaded he was of all the stuff. A guy who has been living a peaceful life for years and suddenly the girl and the Russian mafia, Ralfie's mom and the corrupt cops and the robber in the mall, who he had to find somehow. This is like when a random guy gets bit by a spider and becomes Spiderman, and suddenly all around is crime. Come on...The girl and the Russian mafia was totally enough to make a story...<br/><br/>Now, the Russian mafia. When you watch a documentary about them, they look like more scary and more smart. So, to go to see one of the mobs you have to go through a room where Chinese people are counting tones of Russian corrupt money? Are you serious? And this guy gets in there and walk seeing all of this with no problem? Thanks director for not making him go there with a Go Pro Hero camera with a selfie stick.<br/><br/>Then this mall situation. You know when someone gets trapped in the cleaning room and makes a bomb with the cleaning products? And remember when Rambo prepares all this traps and things in the jungle? This two things mixed in one, in a mall, where he has got everything he needs. Such a stupid idea. First of all I don't understand why would he go there without a gun. But OK. But why wouldn't he take any of the guns of all this people he kills? Instead, he gets this nailing machine. And you see Denzel in slow motion cocking a nailing machine. The only thing missing was the name ""BOSCH"" on the side of the it. Ridiculous!<br/><br/>To sum up in two words. Bad movie."

Same Denzel: how many times do we have to see him squint his eyes and look with serious hatred, then suck on his bottom lip. It was great in Glory, but come on man, learn some new facial and vocal expressions already. He is the same in every movie.

He seems to be lost in a giant hardware store like the ones we all go to. Of course what a better place than there to have action scenes like chasing people. It was sort of Superman without the cape and tights. Basically, Mr. Washington is predictable and although remotely interesting, you know exactly what is going to happen. He wins every fight (just like Superman) and no one is even close to beating him. The writers do show a few levels of creativity with how to kill the bad guys. They seem to neglect the obvious of using identity theft which seems to be the biggest scare we all have when using our credit card in a store like that. Robert Stack"

Washington was great as usual.. another movie to join his smart choices list.<br/><br/>Aside from being a good theater watch experience, a lot of the events did not make a lot of sense and I feel I have to point out that I just used euphemism here. I find that the peculiar killing methods and dexterity were being excessively used as a tool to distract the spectator from the nonsensical part of the scene. For instance, the protagonist receives a threat call and is told to come to the home market and surrender before his coworkers are killed, and the next thing you know is a place perfectly set up for slaughtering his opponents one after another. Wire systems, hanging apparatuses and many other flawlessly prepared traps, not to mention the part where the other men and their chief Teddy who was unduly being referred to as the sharp and undeceivable psychopathic criminal were unable to determine where the drilling, fight groans and broken glass noises are coming from.<br/><br/>This is one of the movies you would definitely recommend to any mind-blowing action/thriller movies enthusiast. On the other hand, for diligent movie viewers or those who pay good attention to the plot and its technical aspects, it's just one of those movies on the shelf with a ""Don't Bother Watch"" label."

","Seriously, it was that bad. Normally, a movie featuring so many guns and spilling so much blood would get my attention, but the action sequences were just dumb. From beginning to the end, the whole thing felt like a mindless grind. And you could tell from the sticky performances of the actors that they thought the project was stupid too. But with a $50 million budget, it must have been a nice payday for everyone involved and so they went through the motion to get the movie done.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington shows his age and is unconvincing as a super assassin. He is too rotund around the waist for people to believe that he has the quick moves needed to get the kills. Washington is best suited for a movie like ""Flight"" where he played a bitter and washed up alcoholic. For his own sake, he should either get in shape or turn down these action roles.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" should never have been made. There is no need to insult the audience with this kind of trash. Unfortunately, it is rumored that they are making a sequel. Save your money and give this one a pass."

","Oh THE EQUALIZER , where a limey who used to work for the CIA has now branched out in to freelance work where if you have a problem with criminals you can hire him and he'll sort out the problem while taking a large fee while giving you long lectures about why it's a bad idea to get involved in crime on any level , including being a victim of crime . If I remember correctly the show started forgetting to include the criminal angle and just became a social conscious show that went as far as equating a child who got HIV through blood products as being the same as an adult alcoholic . The adult in this episode was conducting a violent lynch mob campaign against the child and his mother and you've got this type of moral equivalence being brought in to a show it's time to bail out . It's probably a forgotten show in this day and age and if it's remembered at all it will be remembered for a slightly misleading title sequence which gave the show a hook it didn't deserve and a great and funky theme tune by Stewart Copeland <br/><br/>This is a film version of the 1980s series but isn't really . The lead character is called Robert McCall and that's the only real connection between this and the TV show . McCall now works in a warehouse and gets involved with a prostitute involved with the Russian mafia and this posse of Russian bad guys are coming to America in order to have a monopoly on the American criminal dream . In other words it's a completely generic thriller where if you changed the name of the central character you would not for a moment fall out of your seat and gasp "" Hey wait a minute this is just like that show from the nineteen eighties starring Edward Woodward . I do hope for this film company's sake there aren't any lawyers watching"" .

If you've seen Armageddon and the other thousands of movies about revenge. Do not sit down, do pass go and find something else to do. The only good part of the movie when my wife suggested to watch a trailer for another movie. Nothing says awesome movie like trolling through other movies while you are watching another one. If that isn't a single sign about how placid this movie is? <br/><br/>Towards the end when the Good Samaritan, security cop (who was crying for some reason when Denzel saved him) and this is where ""Batman"" comes into scene. Prior to that he was a cross between Lion-o from the Thundercats, ""sight beyond sight"" or ""A Perfect Weapon"". Shame on us for even considering this a 7 star movie! The scene where the old secret service lady was so intuitive.....meant so much to really put the movie all together. He's ex-CIA and needs approval from Mr Spaceball himself, Bill Pullman. After getting slammed in the face with clichÃ© after clichÃ©, I asked my wife ""What is he doing? I mean, here is nice guy Denzel eating his sandwich, working for the man, and what a week gone by, and he's All the sudden 30 Russian balls deep in an international catch me if you can suspense?

","I'm sorry to say but this movie is borderline pathetic. It tries to be a combination between Taken and 80s action movies and fails at both. Why?<br/><br/>For a single reason. I didn't sympathized with the main character, the hero. In movies like Taken, I could understand his motivations and drive because honestly, we would all do the same.<br/><br/>But in this movie, the motivation itself is a clichÃ©. I liked the villain more than the hero, at least the villain was sophisticated.<br/><br/>Plus, this isn't Call of Duty. This guy can run, jump, fight, get shot three times and still be alright, fix his wounds with honey, defeat a team of special forces, kill a dozen people in the city and nobody saw anything or took his fingerprints and I could go on like this until tomorrow.<br/><br/>The plot defies logic (in the final act, it would have been simpler to simply bomb the entire complex where the hostages were and they would be done with it), the hero is made to look very smart and resourceful compared to everyone else and generally, the movie is a bore.<br/><br/>Look, Hollywood, this is 2014. Our Iqs increased a bit since 1990. Enough with the one man army plot. Enough with the ""good guy kills 100 bad guys"" type of story. It is not realistic. Even the Matrix was more realistic than this movie. A similar movie was The November Man but at least that was a bit more realistic. By the end of this movie, I despised the hero, felt like I've lost two hours of my time and wished I saw something else instead.<br/><br/>If you want to see something good, see Training Day instead. That is his BEST movie. Or watch Taken 1, 2 and 3. Or any other movie that isn't designed following the 1980 ""Commando / Rambo"" formula."

So far so good as Denzel appears to have slipped back into the acting mode which has been sadly missing for so many years. A brooding and thoughtful performance some might say. I'm really beginning to enjoy myself at this stage. BANG!!!! I really cannot begin to explain my disappointment as Denzel suddenly descends into killing mode.

"shawneofthedead","4","18","38","24 September 2014"," A bottom-shelf action thriller barely salvaged by its top-drawer leading man.
","It's a tantalising thought: Denzel Washington reunites with director Antoine Fuqua for a pulse-racing thriller about a man who seeks to right ('equalise') wrongs done to innocent people. Perhaps they can once again hit upon that thrilling blend of action and drama they cooked up in Training Day, which won Washington his second Oscar. Unfortunately, Washington is pretty much the only good thing about The Equalizer, which is really little more than a pulpy straight-to-DVD film rescued by the efforts and charisma of its leading man.<br/><br/>Robert McCall (Washington) keeps his head down and his profile low at his new job in a hardware store - clearly hoping that the ghosts of his past will eventually disappear. When he befriends Teri (Chloe Moretz), a desperate waif forced by the Russian mafia into prostitution, he finally decides to help people with the death-dealing skills he's been trying to keep hidden. After Robert's bruisingly bloody confrontation with Teri's pimp, the terrifyingly efficient Terry (Marton Csokas) is dispatched by his Russian gang-lord to get to the bottom of things.<br/><br/>This is the kind of thriller in which the bad guy - portrayed as enormously smart and powerful - lets the good guy slip out of his grasp for reasons of prolonging the film's running time. There's even an extended sequence at the end of the film in which Terry just stalks through a gigantic warehouse for something like twenty whole minutes, never finding Robert until their climactic show-off. Fuqua's film is almost unapologetically pulpy too, setting Robert up as an ultra-violent vigilante who gives his antagonists the ""choice"" to clean up their acts before he does it for them.<br/><br/>It'd have been great if The Equalizer had dared to be a little more introspective, delving into the moral greys and difficulties Robert encounters in hunting down Terry and his gang. But, in the bloodshed that explodes all around Robert (most of it caused by him in almost chillingly cold blood), it actually becomes harder and harder to tell whether we're supposed to be rooting for Robert in the first place - even as the film practically yells at us that he's the most heroic person in this entire godforsaken mess.<br/><br/>Truthfully, The Equalizer is the kind of film you'd imagine with Jason Statham in the lead - a disposable action-thriller with murky morals that exists solely for car-chase sequences and bullet-play. The fact that it stars Washington is both to its credit and its disgrace. He makes the film worth a watch, actually finding something a little human within a character who wasn't really all that well-rounded on the page. But Fuqua also wastes him, failing to find and colour in the layers and depth Washington could so easily have given Robert. For what it's worth, Csokas is a worthy adversary, stone-cold and utterly brutal, who stands up quite well against Washington.<br/><br/>To be fair, Fuqua directs the film with his trademark ferocity, and many scenes drip gore, menace and tension in equal measure. There's even a little welcome comedy courtesy of Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), the wannabe security guard who becomes the film's accidental hero. But it's not really enough to save The Equalizer from itself - the film practically begs to be allowed to build a new franchise around its butt-kicking protagonist, but fails to prove why anyone but the most die-hard of action aficionados would really want to see much more of Mr. McCall."

If you have seen any film in the genre you have already seen this which offers nothing original. Seems like Denzil had a spare couple of months and million (also producer credit) and thought his name could carry this predictable rehash of Edward Woodward's original, much more believable brand. As expected, DW is a great actor but he should be ashamed of this carbon copy as should those who voted to bring this to an IMDb 7. I am losing faith in this scoring.

His reflections, his responses to sudden eruption of violence in close combat would never have been improved and kept in the same conditions as any regular man who could maintain such level. A guy just like everybody else on the planet, luckily got a steady job, worked in the fictitious Home Mart(?), stayed at his apartment after work, then ritually had something in the nearby local diner or cafÃ©, reading Hemingway, a regular middle aged guy would be luckily not to have high cholesterol albeit hemorrhoid, yet he could kill 5 people in 28 seconds, even faster and quicker than the X-man. Yeah, right.... Are you kidding me?! After he killed those 5 Russian thugs on the upstairs of the Russian restaurant, a smart killer would have clean up in situ, instead, he went home and washed his bloody hands in his bathroom? Killing 5 people in close combat, no blood on his clothes and with bloody hands openly walking back on the streets? Give me a break! The whole storyline is overly one directional predictable and heavily clichÃ©d and worst of all, the soundtrack, so monotonously annoying with fixed tempo, a horrible trendy but stupid chore did by a lousy brain-dead soundtrack guy or group, so boring and so annoying that made the clichÃ©d scenario even more boring. Why the Russian dispatcher would have to kill the young prostitute's co-worker? another pretty Russian young woman, who could continuously generate at least one million US dollars before she became too old for whoring? She was one of the ATM machines that Russian pimping enterprise would like to keep, yet this moron from Russia chose to choke her to death; for what? And furthermore, why she used English instead of her Russian mother language in the last moment before choked to death. Human nature was again ignored by the stupid screenplay writer(s) and the careless director. There are so many flaws and loopholes in this movie that I just don't want to waste my time to point out one by one, in case it might turn into the similar stupid soundtrack like what we have to suffer in this movie. You could praise Danzel Washington, but definitely not this one-way clichÃ©d movie."

Here you have two intelligent people couldn't they find something more interesting to do with Nikolai and Robert but this. Again Hollywood suffers from really terrible storytelling.

It is nothing more than a generic shoot em up.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is poor, and it is a considerable time before anything happens.<br/><br/>There are a number of action scenes in the latter half of the film, but they are shot in a typical modern Hollywood style, which removes the excitement by distancing the audience because of bad camera-work and editing.

It of course allows our hero to lay waste to all the baddies and stay standing at the end. Dumb in my opinion. Yeah Roberts character was not the standard opponent that Teddies group was used to coming up against as was spelled out in the movie, so they wanted to take Robert alive to see if they could find out who he was working for but still just thought it made little sense that the baddies would not attempt eliminate such a dangerous threat asap."
"dr-ross-taylor","2","7","12","17 November 2016"," Such a waste of good material and acting
","This movie was such a disappointment I felt compelled to write my first review. Denzel Washington usually does a good job of selecting movies to star in that are good for what they are. Some are deeper than others but that is OK because whether the movie is mindless action, deeply inspirational, comedy, of some other genre it is still entertaining if it is done well. This is the first movie I have seen of Washington's where I felt the movie was well below average.<br/><br/>The acting was fine but the storyline was stupid. It alternated between trying to be deep and thought provoking only to then have the characters do things that would be incredibly stupid in real life. The writers and directors were just being lazy and having characters do things to make a point they wanted to make or to advance the plot with no regard for whether or not it made sense for that character to take that action.<br/><br/>I loved the Equalizer series. Part of the charm was that Edward Woodward was a secret agent who was past his prime. He was still very competent, but he had to rely more on planning and getting help from others. I knew that would be difficult to do in a movie format instead of a series but I had hoped that with Denzel in the movie it would at least be good. Instead, the movie starts interesting enough, then gets stupid spoiling the more thoughtful storyline, has a brief intense action scene, and then for the rest of the movie I had lost respect for the credibility of the plot and was alternatively bored at the attempts for depth, the laziness of contrived plot points, and the over the top action.<br/><br/>This movie was such a waste of talented actors. The actors did a good job with the well written plot line and if the movie would have stuck to trying to be a story driven drama it would have been very good. The action scenes were good but getting to them seemed contrived. It was like they wrote the action scenes then had to figure out how to work them into the movie. If the movie wanted to just be an action movie with very little meaningful plot the scenes would have been very good but there needed to be more action.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you are in the mood for action, there is not enough. If you want a compelling storyline, they do not tell it well and insert dumb scenes into the movie to either preach at the audience or to give an excuse for the action scenes. It seemed to me like the people making the movie had a good story but then were worried that the general viewing public would be to stupid to get the point if they did not include lots of talking about the evils of (no spoilers) and then throw in some action scenes for the masses.<br/><br/>I still plan on watching any movie with Denzel Washington in it, this rubbish was not his fault unless he had creative input. But I continue to be disappointed at the large number of movies being produced that seem to cobbled together to reach an audience but lack focus on being entertaining."

At times,i felt he didn't really need to get involved in the story at all-it was very impersonal. The violence is good and stylish and deserves credit,but the action was without point-the hero seemed to be fighting without a cause,as if fighting for the benefit of the human kind for its own sake and because of that,the movie seemed to keep dragging on.

Everything on the other hand was pretty mediocre, the action scenes were a bit boring, the plot was tiresome, and there wasn't much excitement until the last twenty minutes. Chloe-Grace Moretz did an okay job but she doesn't offer much screen time as I was hoping. There were many scenes throughout that simply didn't make much sense which took away the film's entertainment.<br/><br/>The action scenes were not terrible but I believe they could have been done much better. The main character (Denzel Washington) fights off some of the Russian gangsters near the beginning and the fight looked rather unrealistic, especially when he drives that corkscrew through the guy's jaw.

This is a step up in craft from director Antoine Fuqua's previous film, the sloppy Olympus Has Fallen, but despite being competently made, The Equalizer feels like lazy paycheck work. There's nothing that you haven't seen a million times before here and the generic story unfolds without so much as a single surprise - this is by the numbers stuff. It's not a chore to sit through, which is about the highest compliment I can give it, but the second any character is introduced, you know exactly how they will be used in the plot and their fate - they are either simply good or bad, no development beyond that. Add to that a horribly miscast ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. Despite an ending you can see 10 minutes into its bloated 132 minute running time, a tacked on set up for a future franchise of more vigilantism feels forced and undeserving. Can't wait for his next adventure against a group of ethnic clichÃ©s, who wronged a hapless girl, while he's trying to make good at a dead end job."
"imabean","3","7","12","13 December 2014"," Disappointingly sterile, emotionless, Chuck Norris style acting.
","Robert McCall is a humble big box hardware store employee with an extensive background in the CIA. He has a few coworkers with whom he's superficially friendly, but they know nothing of his secret life until the latter half of the movie.<br/><br/>He befriends a young woman working as a prostitute for the Russian mob, and upon seeing their brutality against her he goes to bat on her behalf and goes to the Russian's HQ to offer them $9,800 to leave her alone. The Russian pimp and his associates don't care for the offer and the first mÃªlÃ©e of the movie ensues, and of course Denzel's character emerges, victorious and unscathed, stopping his stopwatch once the carnage has concluded.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie, the Robert McCall character is, literally, a stone-faced killer. Whereas the original British character from The Equalizer TV series (played admirably by the late Edward Woodward) is a vigilante, helping all sorts of underdogs with his trade craft and connections, this Robert McCall focuses primarily on just the one woman who needs a hand. The original expressed emotion, had a much richer tapestry of a background, whereas this one is pretty bland. The character is as two-dimensional and stark as his rather Spartan apartment. I don't recall seeing an actor as lacking in emotions and facial expressions since Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>Some of the confrontations McCall has with the Russians seems to hearken back to Denzel Washington's exemplary role as former CIA operative John Creasy in the remake of Man On Fire, directed by the late Tony Scott, but are far less visceral. Whereas Creasy exacts furious vengeance upon one corrupt official after another, whether by cutting one's fingers off one by one or annihilating them with rectally-inserted C4 explosive, McCall uses hands-on martial arts to dispatch his foes. Creasy's acts are fired by emotion, but McCall's don't seem fired up all that much at all. I thought for a bit I was watching a black Terminator. Even when McCall has a corrupt cop trapped in his own car at his own home, exhaust pumping in and the cop's life in his hands, he is passionless and methodical. I felt no compelling reason to cheer McCall on, no reason to root for him as I did John Creasy.<br/><br/>In the final confrontation with the Russian hit squad, the action is sterile and uninspired. McCall is in his element in a way, finding propane tanks and nail guns and other stuff like a black MacGyver in his workplace to take out the bad guys, but this is not at all what I'd expect from Antoine Fuqua after seeing the kind of bad-ass action his characters dealt in Training Day.<br/><br/>Some odd trivia, in the first half of the movie (specifically, when McCall is wearing ear protection and sawing plywood) you might recognize a few bits of the score from Man On Fire, just briefly. In the final scene, they've recycled Moby's hit song ""New Dawn Fades"" used in the movie Heat by Michael Mann in the 90s.<br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't pay to see this."

","Well I am a very harsh movie critic I knew what to expect from this movie, and my expectations were met which is not a good thing. I think Denzel is a great actor, but this role does not fit him in my opinion. The movie does not have much of a story basically one man goes out and seeks revenge for a wrongdoing that he witnesses. Logic was clearly not applied in this movie the fact that he eliminates targets in a matter of seconds no one can apparently touch this man as well so no suspense is built in that sense. Also many of the characters are very dull not much emotion is evoked by them, and the audience knows very little about them. I think the biggest problem with this film and many other films that follow the same trajectory is that they are bent on the clichÃ© that the protagonist must always be victorious, but that mold should be broken. Towards the end of this film a Nikolai which in my opinion the actor played this role very well was eliminated in such a fashion that made this movie a dud for me Denzel and this individual were like chess players they knew each other's moves why not end it in a more competitive fashion. There are a multitude of issues I personally have with this movie others may not see it in the same fashion."

The appalling evolution of the characters, portrayed by the moral: ""do what you feel like"", is surpassed only by their poor definition. The script is trivial and contains elements never elucidated, i.e., the role of starting and stopping (when the character remembers) the wrist watch. When it comes to the camera-work, I have to, in all fairness, say that it's the best aspect of this movie I rated with 3.

","I rented this title based solely on Denzel Washington's presence. He's a great actor and I have loved almost every role he's played from Training Day to the Pelican Brief. This movie was a turd almost from the beginning: the killing of five Russian mobsters over a girl he barely knows. Not saying they might not have deserved it but this disconnect runs through the movie. Wanton killing without ever developing a believable motivation. The ending is so over the top, I had to run home and watch the last Die Hard installment to wash the awfulness of this movie out of my mouth. The final killings in Russia were sheer crap. So ridiculous, so over the top, I was left wondering how Denzel ever agreed to a role in this slag heap. 4/10 is WAY generous."
"curtisisasian","5","6","10","20 January 2015"," unimpressive
","This movie is a somewhat overly clichÃ©d attempt to return Denzel Washington to his previous state of ""badassery"". It's filled with relatively weak symbolism, mediocre dialogue, although Denzel does have a few pretty badass lines. The action is really just okay, half of the killing happens off-screen and the rest is just not very entertaining, the best fight scene is probably the first one. A load of slow-mo scenes that just don't cut it nowadays. If you've heard the lonely island song ""Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions"" this is the where that idea came from. Even the villain is weak,they even say he's an intelligent person, but the entire movie is Denzel's character, Robert, outsmarting him. Sure there are a few close calls(which let's face it, you can guess the outcome), but none of them were due to a clever ruse concocted by the enemy. There is little semblance of ""intelligence"" in this movie. <br/><br/>There's nothing really special about The Equalizer, it's not complex, there's really no plot to be foiled, and overall it's just not really that entertaining. If you're looking for a much more badass,no-brainer modern action flick I'd suggest John Wick, even though they have a somewhat similar storyline."

","I watched this movie not in a theater but on a plane, and I am glad that I did. If I had watched it in a theater, I would've had been depressed for a long time.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is extremely predictable--a former special agent meets a helpless girl, and he uses his superhuman ability to kill any bad guy who stands between him and the girl. Because this story has been used in so many movies, it seems making another movie based on the story is completely redundant. Yet, they decided to make another one, and this movie follows exactly the same clichÃ©. The plot is as predictable as it can be.<br/><br/>The character development is also extremely poor. Our hero (Denzel Washington) risks his life and breaks vow to his beloved deceased wife for a girl whom he barely knows. There is no chemistry between them nor any rational for his behavior. The movie is also filled with clichÃ© characters--cold-blooded hit-man, dirty cops, underachiever who needs a mentor to name a few. <br/><br/>The director tried to make up for the lack of an interesting story and memorable characters with gruesome action scenes that are directly imported from B-level Asian action flicks. Although Denzel could've simply picked up an automatic assault rifle dropped by a bad guy and shot down the rest of them, he chose to use construction equipment to do the job. He was even able to kill a highly-trained former Russian special force hit-man wielding a MP5 submachine gun with a Black and Decker nail gun in a cowboy style shoot out. This might entertain 12-year old boy whose brain is filled with nothing but testosterone, but it makes the movie extremely ridiculous. The action scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't take this movie seriously.<br/><br/>In sum, this is a movie that does not have much reason to exist. You will feel that you've seen at least a dozen of similar movies in the past. Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie."

"leonblackwood","5","9","17","8 February 2015"," Expected Better! 5/10
","Review: I had high expectations for this movie because I used to watch the series and Denzel usually makes some good movies, but I was quite disappointed with the outcome. It takes ages to get going and I'm getting a bit fed up with these directors casting Eastern Europeans as gangsters. On top of that, I found the movie predictable and the characters weren't that interesting. I did stick with the 2 hour film because I wanted to see the big showdown at the end, which was average, and I still was hoping for something amazing to happen, which it didn't. Denzel Washington just seemed to be in a mood all the way through the movie, except for when he was doing his Pips shuffle, and the action scenes were average. The girl that caused Denzel to switch to a murdering assassin goes missing for most of the movie, which was a bit weird, and you don't really find out much about his past which would have drawn you to his character. Anyway, its a watchable movie, just because of Washington's performance, but it wasn't that great. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This is no way like the TV series because you really don't expect Edward Woodward to be a assassin. The director did try to use the same concept with Washington by making him a humble shop manager but after seeing him kick ass in movies like Training Day, Man On Fire and 2 Guns, it's really not that surprising that he can take out a lot of gangsters, by hand, after working out his moves strategically, in a Sherlock Holmes type of way. I did get fed up with the slow motion shots, like when he blows up the building and appears through smoke and the whole killing loads of baddies by hand concept seemed a bit unrealistic, but you can't help rooting for the Denzel, because he's fighting for justice!Â <br/><br/>Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $192million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/thrillers about a everyday man who turns vigilante after his friend gets beaten up. 5/10"

"Leofwine_draca","8","5","8","8 September 2015"," Denzel nails it
","An intense and towering performance from Denzel Washington as one of cinema's best-acted action heroes is what makes THE EQUALIZER stand out from the crowd, although as a film it's also a very decent thriller. It's supposedly a big screen version of the '80s TV series with Edward Woodward, although think of it as your usual vigilante movie and you'll be closer.<br/><br/>Let's be honest here: the plotting in THE EQUALIZER is nothing special, and the Russian mob make for clichÃ©d villains. It's the execution where this film excels. It's not an action filled movie, but when the action hits it's hard and heavy, not shying away from crowd-pleasing violence meted out to the villains. The extended set-piece ending might be described as 'DIE HARD in B&Q' and loses the realism a little but, but until that point this is tough and gritty film-making.<br/><br/>Aside from the excellent Washington, we get a fine bad guy performance from Martin Csokas, equally intense and the finest I've seen from him, and Chloe Grace Moretz is wisely kept off-screen for most of the running time, which I was fine with. The final shout-out goes to director Antoine Fuqua, whose effortless style makes this a graceful and thoroughly entertaining viewing experience."
"eddie_baggins","5","5","8","8 April 2015"," A boring Denzel actioner that takes itself to seriously
","While Denzel Washington can be watchable even when he is playing a role in his sleep (like he does here) there is little doubt the shtick that has served him so well in films such as Man on Fire, Safe House, Two Guns, The Book of Eli, DÃ©jÃ  Vu and arguably others is starting to wear a little thin and when the re-teaming of himself and Training Day director Antoine Fuqua (who needs to show more of what he did with that film) produces such a mundane and predictable action thriller you know it's about time to try something a little different.<br/><br/>A revitalisation of the somewhat forgotten TV series of the same name, The Equalizer sadly feels like a million similar movies before it despite Fuqua seemingly trying to difference itself from other such action/thrillers by ramping up the violence to 11 and bombarding your eardrums with Harry Gregson-Williams increasingly intrusive score. Another thing that Fuqua seemed to feel was necessary was to edit the film to an at times boredom inducing 2 hours plus and when the story is so cookie cutter as what the Equalizer entails there is no justifiable reason behind this. What Washington's bad guy dispatching anti-hero Robert McCall has to do is rescue poor street working girl Teri played by the annoying Moretz and then kill some bad guy Russians and this storyline is not deserving of the airplay it gets even though it's saved by the sleepwalking through Washington.<br/><br/>Although his getting on in years now there is still no doubt Washington cuts a commanding and often mean presence on screen that allows him to make us believe his characters even when they're so thinly drawn and over the top as Robert is here. From his timing of the time taken to dispatch bad guys through to his ability to craft Home Alone quality traps in mere minutes, Robert is some form of retired Jason Bourne who really enjoys reading, not sleeping and killing copious amounts of bad Ruskies. Robert's history is only hinted at but his a man you don't want to mess with and Washington is the reason to watch this forgettable fair as everyone else around him hams it up and fails with particular mention needing to be made of Marton Csokas cringe worthy big bad Teddy.<br/><br/>Some neat if over the top action scenes, another good yet worryingly similar Washington performance and the chance to see Washington dance in a hardware store are the reasons to catch this wholly unoriginal and often dull slice of action. It's about time we see Washington challenge himself once more but with his next project being the remake of the Magnificent Seven it looks like this tough man act is here to stay.<br/><br/>2 and a half late night book readings out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","The Equalizer is just another generic and stylized Hollywood action thriller powered by its lead man Denzel Washington. The story is nothing new and blandly predictable. Only a person who has never watched a Hollywood action film in his entire life would like this screenplay. Denzel Washinton plays a mysterious man in his 40s named Robert who seems to possess highly professional skill sets of CIA agents type. He is seen settling with a peaceful normal life till he crosses path with a young girl Alina (Chloe Grace-Moretz). Alina is a prostitute and is need of serious help when she is badly beaten by some arrogant client and faces threats from her mobster Russian bosses. Steps in our Superhero ""The Equalizer!"" cleaning up the bad guys in matter of seconds. The mob kingpin in Russia Pushkin sends his best skilled man Teddy (Marton Csokas) to get rid of our hero and the battle begins. Honestly I felt the pacing was slow and boring whenever there was no action involved. Talking of the action our hero seems to have solution to any situation just like Liam Neeson in Taken and at the end of the we all know what is the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>Despite many of its shortcomings I must admit both Denzel Washington's acting and character were both kick-ass and very much likable. Robert, a man who is willing to help anyone in trouble and lives a simple selfless life. Who wouldn't like such a person. The action scenes were cool (ignoring the clichÃ©d slow-motion shots), the way Robert examines the situation before he strikes was awesome. The bad guy Teddy was nothing more than typical Russian bad guy in Hollywood films. Chloe's role felt more like a guest appearance rather than supporting. The background score was bit too melodramatic. Overall I felt the film was quite boring. I would suggest this film only for action lovers who want the protagonist to come out unscathed magically from any situation and beat the hell out dozens of bad guys single handed and also for fans of Denzel Washington. Others should not bother.<br/><br/>RATING: [2/5]"
"magnuslhad","5","5","8","1 March 2015"," humdrum
","Denzel Washington makes this film watchable, but even he can't make it soar. A former military man works in a home depot, but has to fall back on his 'special skill set' in order to help those around him. The guy is less Good Samaritan and closer to goody-two shoes. He wants to launch the singing career of a prostitute, and help a tubby colleague slim down to take a test. It is all a bit saccharine and twee, till an intriguing Russian villain shows up carrying real menace. From there the film becomes more action oriented, but still doesn't out-do the Taken or Bourne franchises. Our man goes back to his bosses to ask not for help, but ""permission,"" an especially sleek piece of dialogue. The film is tonally inconsistent, and seems too obviously an attempt to re-boot the TV show. Denzel is as charismatic as ever, but his range is barely tested in this role. A decent B-movie action flick, but not much more."

I mean, does that really add anything we hadn't already figured out for ourselves? OK, we do learn he once loved somebody-or-other (I think they may even have mentioned a name), that she somehow died & that he for some reason faked his own death.

Hell, it's been done better elsewhere by Denzel Washington. Watching him in this is like watching Muhammed Ali getting knocked senseless by nobodies at the end of his career, or seeing Rubens Barrichello lapping Michael Schumacher. Fortunately, there wasn't too much of that ""I'm too old for this"" rubbish. It's bad enough when aging action starts try to re-live their youth, but worse when they have to constantly make excuses for why they suck. Chloe Moretz is pretty lame in this, too. All the promise she showed as a little kid has come to nothing, since her acting is no better now than then, only now there is no excuse. It happens.

","There's a slightly sadistic edge to a lot of the violence in 'The Equalizer (2014)', even to that perpetrated by our hero. It doesn't help that he's presented as a cold-blooded killer who often stares into the eyes of his struggling foes as the life slowly drains from them, someone who murders a number of people entirely of his own volition and not even in self-defence or in direct defence of others (though he does deal out death in order to 'help' people). The violence is so key to the plot, being used in all but one of the 'solutions' to the problems our protagonist aims to 'solve', and even the movie's overall arcs and messages, with our hero actively encouraged to go back to his violent ways and with those methods actually being somewhat endorsed as the only real way to 'win' even in a situation that could've perhaps been circumvented entirely, that the bloodshed feels highlighted almost to the point of glamorisation, as opposed to being shown in a graphic manner (perhaps more realistic than most) to emphasise its consequences - both physical and psychological - or its last-resort nature. These problems are emphasised because the flick clearly thinks it's incredibly 'cool' - with several moments utilising overt slow motion and an over-the-top score to try to convince you of its apparent 'coolness' and, in the process, completely reducing any effect the moment could've once had, instead of letting an inherently impressive moment naturally impress (at one point, even making a scene literally laughable). Despite the fact that it shoots itself in the foot, so to speak, and reduces its own impact through the very techniques it uses in an attempt to enhance it, the initial intention still shines through and actually makes for an experience that starts to, perhaps strangely, feel a little uncomfortable at times. It usually fails to provide enjoyment on either a serious or silly level, despite its occasionally successful character-work and some entertaining sequences. In reality, the first twenty minutes are actually the most successful. It's probably no coincidence that these occur before any of the killing kicks off, with the focus placed on likeable characters trying to help one another simply by being there and doing what they can. The best moments are the ones most akin to a quiet drama - and this is coming from someone who loves action cinema, by the way. This proves problematic, then, given that the whole point of the piece is that its protagonist is a vigilante. There's a key difference between hero and vigilante, though, and the film doesn't seem to understand that. There's no comment on his brutal methods or flawed morals. Most importantly, there's no real entertainment. 5/10"

","Okay, maybe I'm missing something, or I've become simply too cynical to appreciate 'The Equaliser.' If you check out the reviews you'll notice that they're overwhelmingly positive. I'm not going to slate the film, but I certainly wouldn't say that it's as good as the majority of people seem to think.<br/><br/>In fact, I can't really think of anything negative to say about it, but then I also can't think of anything positive to say about it either. We have Denzil Washington as the star. Naturally, he's a great performer and puts in a decent enough show as a man with a dark past who has lethal ways of getting revenge on those who set out to harm the innocent. The film is shot nicely stylish. Every now and again you'll get a fast paced montage of images with highlight the director's flare. The action scenes are nice (if violent, naturally) and everyone gets what's coming to them. And there's a decent enough amount of other stars, ala Chloe Grace Moretz and Bill Pullman to make this a little more than just a mindless B-movie action flick.<br/><br/>Yes, for all the plus points, I found the film pretty average. Bad guys hurt the innocent. Once man stands up to them. Despite everything that's good about it, I just felt that I've seen it all before and, no matter how flashy and violent the action scenes were, I still found it was one of those films where you could do the ironing while you were watching it, or nip out for a drink and you wouldn't have missed that much.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most average thing about the film is the bad-guy. How often have we seen Russian gangs bullying their way around America? The lead bad-guy is just a bad-guy. He's completely generic. Yes, he's evil and will kill anyone who gets in his way, but aren't all villains? Seriously, he could have been replaced by any actor and the film wouldn't have changed much.<br/><br/>So, I'll end by saying that most people seem to like it. So maybe you should take their word over mine. I'm clearly in the minority here. But I didn't hate it. I just didn't see anything that I hadn't already seen a hundred times before."

In simple retirement, he is drawn by his sheer goodness into massive, efficient elimination of the bad guys. There isn't much else to this.<br/><br/>What's interesting here are three stereotypes that have enough currency that nothing has to be explained.<br/><br/>Â Despite what we know of decades of incompetence, if someone is hinted at having field experience, we assume he (or she) is essentially invincible. Is this just from James Bond? Is it a tacit pride in having our guys be badasses? Do some American viewers feel empowered by this?<br/><br/>Â What we know of the Russians is that their gangsters are distributed in small groups and that oligarchs aren't involved. They make their money by state-granted monopolies and the graft, while prevalent is notably non-violent. Yet the mere mention or Russian gangsters with profoundly loyal minions (why?) is enough to assure us that they are worse than any other organized violent group we have. <br/><br/>Â Tattoos. Now this is fascinating. Most of what we know of the Russians is that they are heavily tattooed. 25 years ago, tattoos and motorcycle gangs were conflated and in films we knew the Japanese gangsters by their tattoos. <br/><br/>But today, every kid with $50 has tattoos, and many of them try to project toughness. Is it just that these bad guys have thicker lines and cover more skin?<br/><br/>Here, all we have to see is a holdup man with tattoos (and a skull keychain) and we know all we need to."

","The best moment in The Equalizer is roughly one third into the movie where one of the main villains receives a phone call. The camera follows him as he leans back into the armchair and we see his tattoos. As someone has pointed out to me in a conversation, this is where we understand he is a demon against which our hero fights.<br/><br/>However, if you know that the hero is Denzel Washington going after Vladimir Pushkin, it all dissolves into a thinly veiled propaganda in which Obama would eventually defeat Putin.<br/><br/>I think we don't need to discuss any depth after this point and focus on the fun factor. But even there we're confronted with questionable contents. For example, the aforementioned gentleman wears massive prison tattoos although he spent major part of his life in the military. Also, our hero has a soft spot for girls in trouble. Although trained as an assassin, he prefers everyday objects to execute his opponents.<br/><br/>And the most interesting thing is that roughly at the same time a movie with Keanu Reeves came out called John Wick, in which the main character goes after Russian mob.

Given the TV series had a measure of sense, they seemed to have gone OTT with this as while letting their lead do his brooding act at the start to then his arrogant can't touch me smart alec style. Denzel Washington does his usual self-righteous peacock acting and at no stage is there any suspense as this leads to a predictable ending without even anything that goes anyway off cue. This is very disappointing as with a better script and a better actor (he seems to have one style and that's it), this could have been done better.

"siderite","6","4","6","30 December 2014"," Home Depot Alone
","I guess this was exactly the kind of movie that it wanted to be: retired nice guy with amazing violence skills gets upset and starts killing people to satisfy his own sense of justice and self importance. Few people remember the Equalizer series, from 1985, starring Edward Woodward and even fewer would recognize similarities with this film, except the name. My guess is that Sony wanted this film to be a kind of pilot for a new TV series.<br/><br/>What really *annoyed* me off was that everything was completely blown out of proportion. Denzel's character goes to help a girl (what else) and kills some Russian mobster in the most ridiculous way possible. But this was just an employee of a bigger mobster, so he sends an uber psychopath to solve the problem. And so this guy has to be killed, hostages enter the fray, captured in some Home Depot thingy, they play 15 minutes of Counter Strike inside, only with household appliances, and so on and so on. They replaced Woodward's brain with Washington's brawn and some ridiculous semblance of planning, since he always wears a stopwatch and measures time for some reason that is never explained.<br/><br/>What can we learn from this film? First of all that if you are an ex-CIA killer you can just assume there is no justice in the world but your own. Also, the other people that could help, like the police, are just hired help for mobsters. And if you are a helpless normal citizen that has to work hard for the slightest pay raise, you will be beaten, sold as a slave, blackmailed when you make a little bit of money, perhaps by corrupt cops, and your only hope is some homicidal maniac who really enjoys killing people in creative ways after bullying them into taking the first shot (he calls this ""giving them a chance"").<br/><br/>Bottom line: a clichÃ© from top to bottom, this is like A History of Violence on steroids and making little to no sense. A feeler for a TV series that I hope will never be made, it just offends just about everything involved in the plot: the police, the Russian mobsters, any military organization that is not the CIA, democracy, the justice system in its entirety, laptop makers that are not Sony, Home Depot, Ernest Hemingway, Mexicans, fat people... Just say it's a completely average action movie and don't watch it."
"jake-lamotta-batman","5","4","6","15 December 2014"," Semi-stylish, weak script, good acting.
","The biggest issue with ""The Equalizer"" has to be that it is an adaptation of an old TV show, the script is full of the basic clichÃ© which have been seen in numerous action films, from the protagonist showing a character a picture and the facial expression gives it away that they know the character (in a bad way of course) or the ""let me tell you a story"" where the protagonist sits the antagonist down to tell him about someone, the protagonist getting beaten down struggling in the final fight against the big henchman, the reason why this film isn't ruined completely is the very well done performances by Denzel Washington and Marton Csokas. Antoine Fuqua is a very poor mans David Fincher, at least in terms of this film, this is one of his best film since Training Day but it is nothing special especially during a year like this which is filled with great films and performances. It's certainly tolerable as an action film, with this film a lack of humour didn't hurt it too much whereas I found Olympus Has Fallen suffered tremendously from it's lack of humour. I also find Mr. Fuqua's use of CGI a bit alarming in regards to how it looks, I've noticed this in a few of his films where the CGI just looks bad and really sticks out. The ending is immensely weak, and although Chloe Grace Moretz does a good job with what little she's given, it really feels cheap the way they bring her in right at the end after being absent for so long, showing Denzel emailing her would have made more sense and wouldn't have looked as forced. <br/><br/>This shouldn't be a spoiler but if it is, you'll probably love this movie, The finale occurs in the Home Hardware place where Denzel's character works. Now I didn't like the department store fight of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, this one is a little bit better but not much. I personally found it underwhelming as the first trailer I saw I figured, you know what would be convenient for the screenwriters, if they end up having a big shootout in the end inside that store. These screenwriters obviously work in conveniences, and Fuqua would have a decent style, if David Fincher didn't exist (I'd say this film is almost like Fuqua mimicking Fincher, however all of David Fincher's films are comparatively better, outside of Alien 3)."
"Semisonic","6","4","6","13 December 2014"," Washington vs Russians, 2014 edition
","It's hard to invent anything new in the genre of the action movies. The Equalizer is no exception. This time, we have Denzel Washington as a nice and hard-working employee of a big hardware store, who comes to a nearby diner at nights to read. But when a young Slavic hooker named Alina, who he occasionally talks to, gets into trouble, this old man, 'dedushka' as the Russian mobsters call him, decides to put some people-killing skills he tries so hard to forget about to work.<br/><br/>The movies where a small and quiet man is revealed to be some sort of retired John Rambo who gets back to business for the sake of justice are always a guilty pleasure. You can predict almost all the plot turns, and it's not like it turns all that much, but still you end up rooting for the good guy, simply because all of us sometimes wish that such people really existed in this world. The whole idea of a one-man-army doing the impossible so that the weak and exploited of this world could finally have some peace in their lives will never die as long as we live in a society ridden with criminals and ruled by corruption.<br/><br/>Too bad that a likable protagonist doesn't automatically make a movie excellent. And that is why the filmmakers use all the tricks up their sleeves to persuade us to turn off the brain and judge by emotions only. Cruel and dumb mobsters, poor young girls who need protection, ruthless boss villains who seem to have no single positive trait about them, and all that is financed with the Russian oil. Awesome sauce.<br/><br/>I do admit, with the way my country behaves lately in terms of the international matters, the return of the old-school image of a Russian evil is very well timed. And i personally have nothing against it, after all, we do deserve to be treated as a threat. I just wish it was done in a fresher way. Denzel Washington is without a doubt a great action movie actor, but it looks like he'll hardly top what he did almost a decade ago in Training Day. Now that was really intense, there he really had to break a sweat to get the job done. On the other hand, in The Equalizer things simply happen the way he needs, so this action thriller inevitably loses the thrills it tried to hold. And while the villain guy was moderately believable as a worthy opponent, and the final scene in the hardware store was really impressive, those were probably the only things in which this movie actually tries to stand out.<br/><br/>On the other hand, with a little imagination this average action movie may turn into a very dead on political satire. Evil Russians are exploiting and brutalizing a girl with a rather Ukrainian name 'Alina', and a black man with a profile resembling Barack Obama's and a last name 'Washington' that speaks for itself, manages to singlehandedly deal with all the bad guys and tops it with killing the mob kingpin, whose last name starts with 'Pu' and ends with 'in', in his Moscow mansion. Since we all know that the real mobsters prefer London to Moscow, it makes the allusion even clearer. And the fact that the movie was obviously filmed before the recent political turmoil makes it almost prophetic.<br/><br/>But even if that interpretation is just a pipe dream, this movie is not that bad. Especially since for an eye candy it has Chloe-Grace Moretz who's obviously trying to do more various roles but still can't help ending up in the same cute, a little clumsy and somewhat childish image. Not that we don't love her for that, do we? ;)<br/><br/>The bottom line is: if you want to see a decent action movie where the good guys win and the bad guys die, or if you like to find the hidden meaning where there probably is none - then The Equalizer's your game. But don't expect anything close to Training Day from it, this way you'll save yourself from unnecessarily high expectations and disappointment that usually follows."

But the McCall (Denzel Washington) is here no dapper English gentleman, but he is a genial quiet employee of a Home Depot-type warehouse store who kept pretty much to himself. <br/><br/>One day, he meets and befriends a teenage prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) at his usual dining place. When she had been beaten up by the Russian mobsters who handled her, McCall gets shaken out of his neat little routines, and an unparalleled killer of immeasurable means gets unleashed to champion the cause of the helpless masses.<br/><br/>This is another oft-told tale in Hollywood these days, an ex-CIA agent with superhuman abilities saving the day for some damsel in distress. This year alone, we have seen it in ""A Walk Among the Gravestones"" with Liam Neeson, and ""November Man"" with Pierce Brosnan. With ""The Equalizer"" though, we are given Denzel Washington in the lead role, by the same man who directed him to his Best Actor Oscar, Antonio Fuqua.<br/><br/>The action sequences are well-planned and orchestrated, but I can't really say they are all that original. They are of extraordinary violence and gore, I'd give them that, hence the local R-16 rating. The whole ""seeing small details around him while planning an attack"" routine has been done before, and with much more logic, in the Sherlock Holmes films. The whole climactic ""walking away from a series of big fiery explosions behind the hero"" gimmick is practically a staple in countless A, B or C level action films before this one.<br/><br/>The best scene in the whole film was probably the one where McCall talks face-to-face with the vicious Russian gang leader, Teddy (Marton Csokas). That scene was one big mind game where McCall exposes the weaknesses of his enemy using mere words. That was an exciting psy battle of wits at its best, better than all the shootouts and explosions in the film. <br/><br/>For me, Denzel Washington did not look like he had the right physical look to realistically convince me that he could do the stunts McCall was doing. However, in these intense face-to-face confrontation scenes, you know he is the type who could psych you out crazy even with his penetrating stare alone. This is what gives ""The Equalizer"" an edge over all the other run-of-the-mill action thrillers with the same basic story. 6/10."

This is just a solo, unbeatable army on an excessive rampage with no compunction and no consequences whatsoever. There is no hint of cops or government agencies intervening in his reign of terror and no consideration for the time and planning it would take for McCall to lay such deadly booby traps and organize his DIY store war.<br/><br/>Essentially, The Equalizer is just one man shooting, killing, fighting and blowing sh*t up. McCall doesn't hide in the shadows, as the previous incarnation did, he lets it all hang out with the arrogance of a gangster and, plot spoiler alert, remains perfectly anonymous despite leaving rubble, corpses and explosions in his wake.<br/><br/>Forget reality, forget plot, forget any hope of reason or logic. Just put on your hardhat, buckle up, hide behind a riot shield and get on with the business of being thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>Astoundingly, The Equalizer is rated just 15 meaning that parents can sneak older children/recent teenagers into this.

Direction of this movie was discussed for a long time. Indeed it had been told that Nicolas Winding Refn was first approach; which I can perfectly understand as there are some Refn' violent scenes brand throughout the film. I love Denzel Washington, he could make a movie about a man sitting on a toilet for the entire movie ant it would be a good thing to watch. However this film is a little bit more violent than just a man sitting on a toilet (more exciting as well) and Denzel Washington is the one thing that carries this movie along from the beginning to the end; and gives it the credibility it deserves. I really enjoyed the movie on the one hand because Denzel Washington sells every scenes he's in, he makes the over the top violent nature of this movie fun and more acceptable; and on the other hand thanks to Marton Csokas playing a pretty strong villain. Seeing them both interact is one of my favourite part of this movie. My favourite scene is in fact both of them having a pretty deep and serious conversation in a restaurant. This movie is violent, which can turn off some people. I have to admit that some violence may be over the top and unnecessary sometimes, as well as some side plots. For instance, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz' character bring him back into this world and totally disappear for the whole movie. As an older bad ass character Denzel Washington is extremely compelling and endlessly watchable. But I was expecting to learn a little bit more about him though. I like roles like this, played by actors like him or Liam Neeson as well; they are good and smart, nothing about those guys is uncool. Finally, The Equalizer is totally aware of itself, there is no deeper meaning, no Oscars nomination pretending. This movie knows what it is, it knows what it wants to do and does it that's all.<br/><br/>Overall The Equalizer is really entertaining. I loved it.

","First and foremost, I've never heard of The Equalizer television series until I heard that Hollywood was going to make a film based on it. Also, I've never seen an episode of The Equalizer and I probably never will.<br/><br/>To kick things off... let's talk about Mr. Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington is fantastic in this movie. Denzel has such a huge star presence every time he's on screen<br/><br/>Marton Csokas... I've never heard of this guy before but, wow! Marton Csokas (I believe) carried his on weight in this movie. Marton Csokas's character was menacing, frightening, and eccentric.<br/><br/>ChloÃ« Grace Moretz... I've never seen her like this before. Chloe's performance was good and different, but she really didn't have anything to do. This movie sure did waste ChloÃ«'s talent.<br/><br/>Now on to the story. The story is simple and easy to follow. However, it's not the story I'm paying attention to, I'm paying attention to Denzel Washington. When you first see Denzel's character... he plays it straight. We don't know who this guy is or what he has done in the past. When we first meet Denzel's character, he's kind, helpful, sad, and wants to help everybody. But one day things change for Denzel's character. There is one scene were we see Denzel snap and it's a very bloody and shocking moment. However, from there on in (I feel) the movie becomes repetitive, boring, and clichÃ©d.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog (I feel) is a bit cringe worthy, however, when Denzel says some of these completely foreshadowing lines, I let it go because it's Denzel (freaking) Washington.<br/><br/>The movie starts off good. I didn't know what to expect. When the violence starts I'm game, but then it just carries on and it seems like Denzel's character is having to much fun with no real consequences."

","Washington plays McCall, a guy who works at a home improvement store. At night he goes to a diner and ritualistically drinks tea while reading a book. Also at the diner every night is a young Russian prostitute who waits there to be picked up by her rich clients. They occasionally chat about the books he's reading. His wife started a project to read a list of 100 books but she died before she could complete it. Now he's repeating the project. One night, the girl is bruised. They walk together and her pimp shows up and slaps her around some more. Another night the girl doesn't show up at the diner. McCall finds out she got a beating and is hospitalized. He goes to the hospital and talks to one of the girl's colleagues who tells him how the girls are treated and that they are risking their lives.<br/><br/>McCall decides to visit the pimp and after a whole lot of nothing finally explodes and kills all the mobsters there, pretty much single-handedly, that is, often with just one hand. That gets the attention of the main Russian mobster who sends a cleaner named Teddy to take care of things. Teddy is well-mannered, well-dressed, soft-spoken but vicious. After much investigation he finds out that McCall was behind the killings and starts tracking him and even pays him a visit.<br/><br/>McCall, still living his slow life, thinks about things, he visits a woman who's some higher up in government. She tells him it's OK if he does what he has to do. Now McCall decides to act. He goes after corrupt cops on the mobster's payroll, destroys their entire operation, and meets Terry leading to the eventual final confrontation in the dark and with water sprinklers on of course, when Teddy decides to take McCalls's coworkers hostage.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the TV series but this movie is a fairly average and formulaic action movie. You have the reluctant hero with near superpowers, who is forced to make justice when put in a corner. Personally, I don't think Washington makes that convincing of an action hero. He's empathetic enough so I see him taking on the standard Morgan Freeman role at some point. The story is very good though, even though things go pretty much as expected. The movie is about 30-40 minutes too long. For a movie that focuses so much on its lead, we learn next to nothing about McCall. And as much as this director, and others, do their best to glorify Washington--one just has to count the number of slow-motion shots of Washington--it's Marton Csokas who steals the show as the calm and brutal Teddy. The movie also ends on a laughable and improbable situation as McCall travels to Moscow. But I'm in favor of movies who advocate the reading of books, so I'll give it one more point for that."

"Troy_Campbell","6","6","13","26 September 2014"," Slow and clichÃ©d, but with some fantastic action sequences.
","Reteaming 13 years after their Oscar-winning Training Day, director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington deliver another guilty pleasure with this murky revenge flick. Washington plays Robert McCall, a man with a dark past trying to eke out a quiet life until he feels compelled to help a young prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz â truly horrible) who is beaten to a pulp by her Russian pimp. Trouble is this particular pimp is part of the Russian Mafia's American contingent, so a simple chat over coffee and cake won't do the trick. So after an excruciatingly slow opening 30 minutes, Washington is unleashed in a tense and ultimately bloody confrontation that results in the Russian mob sending over more minions (led by Marton Csokas' sinister sociopath) to be slaughtered in slow motion awesomeness. If the plot sounds a bit clichÃ©d â hooker with a heart of gold, evil Ruskis, one last job, ridiculously inept and indispensable henchmen â that's because it is. Fuqua attempts to imbue his film with dramatic heft, yet he shouldn't have bothered. When delving into character motives, moral choices and grand, thought-provoking themes, the movie stutters and splutters; thankfully the numerous action sequences are of an extremely high calibre. The finale is especially epic, with Mauro Fiore's cinematography and Harry Gregson-Williams' score combining with Fuqua's flair behind the camera to dish out an appropriately hard core climax. More of a rainy-Sunday-arvo-on-the-couch type of film, but if you're a die-hard Denzel fan then you'll likely appreciate this on the big screen."

","Growing up I was a big fan of the old Edward Woodward TV series. Honestly, this is nothing like that. I'm not even sure why they gave it the same title. The only similarity, aside from the name Robert McCall, is that both stories are about former secret agents (although Denzel's previous occupation is never made clear) who use their abilities to help people in trouble. In the TV series, he placed ads in the paper and people came to him for help. Here he just helps his friends. I was mildly disappointed because I would like to see Denzel play a character a little outside his wheelhouse. What you see here is pure Denzel like we've seen in many movies by now. Still, despite the fact that it's very different from the series I loved, I had no real problems with the movie. It's very entertaining, as you might expect from Denzel Washington. He's one of the most consistent actors out there that puts out good movies for the masses, not just for the film snob crowd. It's slow-going for an action film (note the runtime) but it's never boring. There's no 'reinventing the genre' here but everything is done in such a way that should please the majority of action movie fans. For those wondering, ChloÃ« Moretz plays a small but important part to the story. She isn't in the whole movie, just the first half-hour or so and the final scene."

","Some films are a triumph of style over content. This isn't exactly a triumph but Antoine Fuqua directs with a panache that the ludicrous plot and risible dialogue don't merit. There's a highly enjoyable showdown in the US equivalent of Homebase, with nail guns, electric drills, strimmers and a variety of power tools being used to murderous effect. The heavies are a mix of corrupt Boston cops and assorted Russian mafia, the latter sporting villainous facial hair and scary tattoos. They're no match for Denzel Washington, however, even though he's looking a little on the paunchy side. In a finale that manages to be more unlikely than what's gone before, he takes a short trip to Moscow to finish off the main heavy, one Vladimir Pushkin, no less. Daft but highly watchable."

","I had the chance to watch this this movie today on its opening night here in Dubai and I intended not to check out either its ratings on IMDb nor watch the trailer or even get to know the plot summary!! I just went in there with no prejudice hoping that Denzel Washington will deliver a decent movie as he usually does and make up my mind on it without any influence by rating or user reviews and to my amazement and amusement I got much more than what I bargained for!! In fact I was in front one of Denzel Washington best and most memorable movies of his entire illustrious career especially on the action side this movie easily compete with some of his finest including Training Day and Man on Fire and to me it was better than both. You see! if you tell the story line to anyone he would easily say been there done that yet a great film doesn't necessarily have a unique story line even the simplest of stories can create a blockbuster depending on how good the story is and how it was made!! Here the story deliver the ultimate fight between Good and pure dark evil and again it is almost a mission impossible with one guy fighting an entire special forces army!! so throughout the movie you are guessing what will happen next yet as any good memorable movie this one is not all about fight scenes which are extra ordinarily done by the way and more real and dark than any of your average action movies nowadays yet the good about this movie is the drama and act part are simply exquisite with some really memorable scenes and lines by Danzel and the crew that's why may be some people felt it slow at times as they may be came in only for the action yet if it was all action then may be you aught to watch a Bruce Willis action flick instead!! For if it was just a continuous shallow fight scenes it will easily loose it's depth and turn into a comic show rather than a good movie. <br/><br/>This movie is an epic action movie that I believe in a few years from now shall be more appreciated than it is today!! Because people sometimes don't acknowledge how good a movie is until they hear more about it and probably watch more times to sink in!! This movie puts Denzel Washington character in the ultimate test with him taking on an entire ruthless Russian Mafia Mob with all their power and influence and with a super bad guy adversary played by the dark and sinister looking Marton Cokas who was Excellent in his rule and provided that ultimate adversary atmosphere that is one of the most vital elements of a good action movie just like it was the case in James Bond movie Casino Royale here again we get the same level bad guy if not more dark and sinister. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone out there want to see an epic action movie that delivers to every sense of the word and I'm not who could be easily convinced with good action no matter how big and famous the cast were so here my evaluation has nothing to do with Danzel Washington being in the lead role yet he fits it perfect and deliver one of his best movies to date!!"
"TheBrewBuzz","10","9","23","2 October 2014"," Another Hit By the Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua Dynamic Duo
","The Equalizer is the latest film by acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua. Now, I feel a little embarrassed not knowing this director's name by heart because he has quite a few very respectable films under his belt. If you also do not recognize the name of this extremely talented director let me shed a little light. This guy is responsible for Training Day, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, and of course the movie in discussion. The Equalizer satisfies in all the ways his other great films do but the directing talent is just one factor that makes this movie so great.<br/><br/>A movie can have a superb story, amazing cinematography, and mesmerizing writing as well as directing, but without the talent to deliver it all, it finds itself lacking. This is where the gifted cast comes in, notably the star of this film, Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington is so talented he just makes almost every film he touches a hit. His performance in The Equalizer is no exception. I often think about these great veteran actors and actresses who just refuse to pass their prime. A lot of these performers are getting a little seasoned and makes me wonder if they can still pull off a great movie, especially an action one. Actors like Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bruce Willis are some to name a few. However, they refuse to be outperformed by some of these younger actors and far surpass them in authentic entertainment. Denzel Washington is one such talent.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is about a man with a mysterious past named Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). Robert McCall is a kind man who is extremely tidy and lives according to schedule. He works at a hardware store and is respected in his workplace. He gives a helping hand to those in need and encourages them. The buildup of this character makes the audience automatically like him. He is a person everyone wants to know and a friend everyone wants to have. As I said, he is extremely likable. However, as with most interesting characters, he has an unknown and mysterious past. I am not going to spoil anything but let's just say this guy can hold his own almost any situation. Robert McCall finds himself unable to sleep most nights and befriends a young prostitute named Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) whom he meets at a late night diner. Basically, the plot unfolds when Teri finds herself in distress and Robert McCall finds himself reluctantly resurfacing a former skill he vowed to never perform again to help her. This causes a chain reaction of hostile events to unfold forcing McCall back into a life he thought was behind him. The villain in this film is Teddy (Marton Csokas). I have to say, I was pretty impressed with this character. He just made a great villain. Marton Csokas has come a long way since his role as Yorgi in xXx. I was very impressed with the progression in his acting abilities. His performance was another key factor in the success of this film.<br/><br/>So my verdict for The Equalizer is definitely two thumbs way up. This is all around a very entertaining film. The story is great and builds a strong foundation for the characters, the action and fight scenes are choreographed nicely, the acting talent really draws the audience in, and the directing is very commendable. In short, The Equalizer leaves the audience fully satisfied and wanting for nothing. I encourage everyone to see this movie. I really enjoyed it and know most of you will also. Until next Wednesday, I wish you all great cinematic experiences.<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at TheBrewBuzz.com"
"bob-the-movie-man","7","8","20","2 October 2014"," Good film but unnecessarily violent
","Is it ever right for a regular citizen with the 'appropriate' skills to go vigilante and stand up to wrong-doing and a corrupt justice system? In the TV show of the 60's, ""The Equalizer"", Edward Woodward would! In many ways the new film version of ""The Equalizer"" is a story of a superhero, but instead of the cape and the glory of the front page of the Daily Planet, this 'hero' melts off anonymously into the Boston suburbs until it is appropriate to act again. It is a more sinister sort of superhero.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Bob (or Robert, when he's reading), a mild-mannered worker in a Boston Do-It-Yourself megastore but a man with a secretive past. Needing only, it seems, about 2 hours sleep a night, Bob frequents an all-night diner where he befriends prostitute Teri played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She ends up in the hospital thanks to some pimp heavies, and Bob exacts bloody justice on the guys. Unfortunately, these are the henchmen of a huge Russian mafia operation in the US, and Bob's fight becomes a full-scale war against the leader Pushkin (Vladamir Kulich) and his bad-guy-in-chief, the curiously named Teddy (played with menacing glee by Marton Csokas, Celeborn in ""Lord of the Rings"" but seen most recently in ""Sin City 2â³).<br/><br/>This movie is a cut above the normal mafia crime drama story. Washington's Bob is portrayed as an intelligent, thoughtful but deeply wounded man, and the audience can empathise with his burning desire to give back to society and for people in general to just (as Woody in Toy Story would say) ""play nice"". Chloe Grace Moretz is (again) outstanding as the equally wounded Teri trying desperately to find a way out of the deep pit she finds her life to be in. Moretz looks set to continue her trajectory to become a Hollywood Great.<br/><br/>And Csokas as the steely and cold Mafia killing machine makes for an extremely menacing villain.<br/><br/>Also excellent in extended cameos are Melissa Leo (""Are you still and effective team?"" from ""Oblivion"") and Bill Pullman (""Independance Day"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"").<br/><br/>Production values are high, with some glorious cinematography (Mauro Fiore -""Avatar"", ""Training Day"") of the ever-photogenic Boston and the mood lighting (David Lazan/Chris Culliton) of the night scenes and the diner is top rate.<br/><br/>After a necessarily slow start to build character and back story, the screenplay (by Richard Wenk) fair zips along, and this longish running time of 130 minutes speeds by relatively unnoticed by the bladder! In particular, the final climatic showdown between the main characters is suitably dramatic, and set in a novel location for such a scene â full of potential for ""Home Alone"" style activity. (In fact, as my son pointed out, there is another â presumably unintended â nod at the end of the film to the ""Wet Bandits"" closure to ""Home Alone"" also).<br/><br/>However, what lets the film down for me is the gratuitous violence graphically shoved in the viewer's face (and in one case twice via flashback). The director (Antoine Fuqua, ""Training Day"") should learn that 'less is more' in such scenes, and the imagination is a much more powerful tool: Hitchcock achieved as much by what he didn't show as what he did. The film actually works best in its middle reel, where some of the acts of vengeance are not shown at all: Washington calmly wiping down a lump hammer and putting it back on the store shelves.<br/><br/>I am also truly staggered that this film was released with a UK '15' certificate. The British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) seem to have become desensitised to this as an issue. Perhaps they are just reflecting that society itself, with Youtube depictions of gruesome murders and beheadings, has become desensitised to such scenes. (Whilst I appreciate not everyone would share this view) I have no problem with sex on the screen, or swearing (which most kids will hear, and worse, every day in the playground) but this level of uncut violence in my view should automatically be given an '18' certificate. If a director wants a lower certificate, then let them trim the shots. <br/><br/>The certificate should be a guidance as to what society things is acceptable for different age groups to see, and for me the BBFC keep getting this wrong with respect to the violence part of their remit, with inconsistent ratings: they give the cartoonish violence of Sin City 2 an '18' but the Joker's 'pencil scene' in ""The Dark Knight"" a '12' â â really? With graphic scenes involving a corkscrew and a power drill in this film, and in an increasingly violent world I would personally not want my 15 year old kid seeing this stuff. <br/><br/>Vigilante films have always tended to stir up controversy, no more so than when Michael Winner's ""Death Wish"" came out in 1974 which created quite a storm particularly in the US. Again it is perhaps a sign of our desensitisation that there hasn't been more controversy over this film.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a good and entertaining film that I would have given eight stars to with a recommendation to see, but I'm knocking a star off for the unnecessarily graphic violence: if gory violence is not your bag, then this is one you should best avoid.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please check out my other reviews on bob-the-movie-man.com, and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

","One of the most exceptional movies in the last few years - Denzel Washington provides a compelling - if not totally believable character. Working off of the 1980s television show with Edward Woodward - the story cuts a remarkably good plot - but do not expect too much from it or you will be disappointed. The biggest critiques I have heard from people are that there are elements of the movie that make no sense - and this is primarily because the scriptwriter has seen the original series and assumed a lot of the character into evidence - but there are notable points in the movie that occur once never to be seen again that make you wonder exactly why the heck they left it in.<br/><br/>My biggest complaints are that there precious too few action scenes - Martin Csokas owns the bad guy role to the Nth degree - but with a sinister malevolence rather than a ""kick your ass"" approach. Washington is pretty damn hardcore in this - but his ""kick-ass-omoter"" barely reaches a three on the ""frequency of scenes"" scale. Chloe Grace Moritz plays an outstanding supporting role - but again, there is not enough of a back story to merit the movie - I would have liked them to have drawn out her situation in significantly more detail.<br/><br/>Testosterone moment came from scene stealer Haley Bennett and her apparently endless legs. <br/><br/>Certain elements of the film are just entirely too stupid to handle with one particular interrogation scene that will have you screaming at the screen ""why doesn't he just press the damn button??"" other than those complaints. The acting with what is a great plot - but a relatively poor quantity of action is utterly superb - and it gives a fine start to what could be a fantastic series of movies."

","Guess which movie I'm describing:
A retired hitman/ agent is pulled back into butt-kicking mode because the Russian mafia messed with something he cared about.<br/><br/>John Wick? The Equalizer?<br/><br/>Answer: Yes.<br/><br/>The difference is The Equalizer really just towers over Wick as a film.
Full disclosure: I appreciaed the cinematography of Wick and saw what it was going for but felt the whole film was flat and gimmicky more than the cool and flashy film it was going for.
Not all would agree with me.<br/><br/>Where The Equalizer beats John Wick is that Equalizer weaves a story and plotline that is actually engaging, featuring characters that you care about.
There's the human element to The Equalizer that Wick just missed.
Denzel Washington is about the best at his craft and he shines at translating human emotions through his character onto the screen. Further, there was a redeeming aspect to the story with a guiding ""noble cause"" that excused this film from being just another action-thrilller filled with ""senseless violence.""<br/><br/>
The action sequences, while not as flashy as Wick, were delivered with more meaning.
Wick suffered from losing impact through running a continuous loop of action sequences that all started to blend together.
The Equalizer took care to mind the pacing and rhythm of the story, interweaving action and downtime for plot and character development.<br/><br/>The story telling was direct enough to not be confusing, but left enough up to the imagination to avoid being boring. For example, it was never spelled-out what Washington's character did for a living prior to working at the hardware store.<br/><br/>There were some interesting McGuyver-esque ""being resourceful with your environment"" elements to the action that was refreshing in comparison to the heaps of cliche action films where gunplay/ Martial arts are the only vehicles for kills.<br/><br/>The cinematography was flawless and ventured into some creative shots and techniques. The big climactic ending entailed some dazzling filming involving some artful use of lighting and rain. That film-work alone is worth the watch.<br/><br/>The main antagonist did seem to be going for a very Kevin Spacey vibe in looks and persona. The casting almost was a doppleganger for Spacey. I have to wonder if they missed an attempt at getting Spacey for the role. I felt on that front, it felt that character a bit forced
and cliche.<br/><br/>My apologies if this review came off as more a comparison, but the two films are just so similar on the surface and (in my opinion) The Equalizer was a superior film in almost every way.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"adwaidhrupendra","9","2","3","26 November 2018"," One of the best action movies ever made. Period.
","I love smart movie-making, where the film doesn't spoon feed you everything, and instead respects its audience/viewers to fill in the missing blanks (another great example is Mad Max Fury Road). This movie starts slow with an intentionally boring life of an ordinary man, then ramps it up to true badassery when the time comes; the optimal use of theme music, and external tracks makes me get goosebumps every single time. Oh, and I've only seen 2 guys who can ""act"" incredibly without ""acting""/ with a poker face - one is Bill Murray, the other one is Denzel Washington.

","I'm not a particularly big fan of movies like this, where action drives the story over characters or plot itself. However, I heard this one was good, and the ratings were good enough, so I watched it. As you can see by my rating, that didn't go down well. <br/><br/>The Equalizer is nothing special. It's got a lame plot that's probably been used hundreds of times (I wouldn't know because I don't typically watch these kinds of movies), and it's just overall not interesting. <br/><br/>Now with a title like 'The Equalizer' and a cover like the one it has, how could I expect a good story, right? I mean, I'm being unreasonable, aren't I? In that sense, yes, but I didn't go into this movie expecting an Oscar winner. I expected an overdone action movie, and dang, this movie did not deliver. The action was slow and excruciatingly boring. There was absolutely nothing special or unique about it. Now I understand it's hard to have unique violence these days, considering how many action movies there are, but it felt like they didn't even try. It was all just very dull and boring to watch, despite the punches and resourcefulness that Washington's character displayed. <br/><br/>The characters themselves...well, there's really only one, and he's probably the most lame action hero I've ever seen. The Terminator was at least entertaining to watch, and John Wick at least had a significant focus on his past. The Equalizer himself just felt unoriginal. He's the most stereotypical hero ever, and nothing about him is interesting. The supporting characters are underdeveloped and I really felt like I couldn't care less about what happened to them in the end. <br/><br/>Overall, The Equalizer is just a big waste of time. Like I said, I haven't seen a heck of a lot of action movies like this, but I've seen enough to know that there is absolutely nothing special about this one. There wasn't even an attempt at originality, and Washington's character felt like a total idiot throughout the entire thing, and that fact was probably the most development he ever got. In the end, The Equalizer was, like I said, a waste of time. I don't know how else to describe it. If you want to watch a good, or at least enjoyable, action movie, watch Kill Bill or The Terminator (Judgement Day), both of which are infinitely better. I would not recommend this movie to you, but if you really want to watch it, then go right ahead. I won't say it was awful, but it just failed to deliver on so many levels, all of which totaled up to just a bad movie."

In fairness the actors do a good job considering the dreck they had to work with. Marton Csokas and Chloe Moretz especially do nice work. Denzell, who is now on the wrong side of sixty, is miscast in the Perfect Killing Machine role. But the actors cannot redeem this movie from it's preposterous story line.<br/><br/>How this managed a 7.2 on IMDb is mind-blowing. I guess there's a lot of people out there who'd watch a film of Denzell reading names from the phone book and call it art."

","Saw this on DVD and to be fair it starts off well but the plot line is paper thin and predicable down to the script. It has plenty of action and is a good film for Denzel as i like most of his past work. Near to the end of the film it seems the writers were asked to take a hike and a producer took over as it turns from a nice, action movie to a mushy ""gee ma can we be American too?"" type situation, which is not required, wanted or enjoyed. More mush and gush than Tom Cruise talking about himself, ugh. For me this ruined what was an enjoyable experience and the last action sequences are stupidly ridiculous which also ruins then film. Only watch if there is nothing better on."
"tcasavecchia","7","2","3","19 February 2015"," Why the Equalizer?
","I guess the real reason why is the studio still thinks the name ""The Equalizer"" still is a draw. While I thought this film was OK. A fairly mediocre action film my real problem with it is its title. As a fan of the show in the 80's I was eagerly looking forward to seeing this. It bares very little resemblance to the show on which it is based. Not that I don't like Denzel, but I personally was hoping for someone that audiences have seen in a role similar to the TV show. In that respect I was hoping for Timothy Dalton. Regardless this film is as I said neither great nor horrible. If you like action films it is worth seeing, but as a fan of the show I just wish they had called it something else rather than getting my expectations up there with what was a fine show for its time period."
"trublu215","6","2","3","20 December 2014"," Washington is great even if the film itself sometimes falters
","The Equalizer teams Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington again for the first time since Training Day. While this outing is far less memorable than their first, both rise to the occasion to deliver an enjoyable action film. While the film translates the television source material with brutal and violent force, it does spend a lot of time developing Washington's Robert McCall to be a meticulous and ruthless killer with a heart and a high standard of morals. This could have been great but for the first forty minutes of the film, we're seeing a routine and as routines go, it is simple to conclude that it gets boring after the first 15 minutes. McCall meets a young prostitute named Alina, played by Chloe Grace Moretz and discovers she is beaten to a pulp and then decides to kill her employers setting off a wicked chain of gangland violence, all falling on McCall to ""equalize"" the situation. As McCall is tracked by a Russian mob boss, you begin to start feeling the story drag out. This is the point where the film should really take off but it actually slows down. It tries to be suspenseful but it actually creates for a pacing mess. It jumps from following McCall to following a city of crooked cops and brutal gangsters. This would have made for an interesting dynamic for the film but the villains are so wooden and clichÃ¨ that you can't really sink into the scenes as easily as you could if Washington was on the screen. Despite this, the scenes of action really make up for the pacing problems. The action scenes are quick, brutal and never glorifies the violence. It shows it as a reality and as Fuqua's previous works show, he has a clear understanding of violence and he makes sure he shows it as a frightening event. My only problem with these scenes are not the scenes themselves, its everything leading up to it. The scenes of McCall ""analyzing"" the situation he's in are cheesy and done in slow motion, it just took me right out of it. Overall, The Equalizer is a decent film that has its issues but it remains enjoyable due to Fuqua's competent direction and Washington's performance."
"digdog-785-717538","5","2","3","12 December 2014"," Watch it and learn
","Generally speaking, Denzel Washington tends to be excellent in everything he is ever in.<br/><br/>So maybe The Equalizer has him being excellent but, you would have a hard time placing his acting coherently in this over-simplified, excruciatingly phoned-in script with repetitive stock characters.<br/><br/>You see, a good director will use the actor's expressions to punctuate important sections of the script. But the script in this film is so dull, so lifeless and predictable, the main entertainment comes with finding out *how accurately* you, the audience, can predict what will happen word-for-word, rather than being left in wide gaping amazement at the twists in the story.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>Denzel whatsisname is a CIA man. he is THE, most brutal, death personified CIA man who is living a quiet life, without explanation because who needs plot. He takes under his wing a random prostitute because who needs character development. <br/><br/>He then proceeds to butcher a ton of Russian Mafia guys through the clichÃ©' ""you think the bad guys are badass, but our hero is so much badasser"", with a healthy escalation of badassery throughout.<br/><br/>the end.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is a perfect example of how to NOT make a film. This is by far, the most obvious, blatant, predictable, unspoilable film i have ever seen. <br/><br/>Sure Denzel is a pleasure to watch, and i am sure his performance could have been used to great effect if cut out and placed in a proper film, but as it stands now, i cannot give this film anything more than<br/><br/>my final vote: 5/10 - watch it and learn what to avoid in filmmaking."

","Denzel Washington is a great actor but gets saddled with sub par material half the time. He's again teamed with director Antoine Fuqua who is also hit and miss with his movies. The trailer looked promising so I bought my ticket expecting awesome entertainment and this did not disappoint. This is Denzel's take on the retired assassin genre kick started by Liam Neeson's Taken. It's not as action packed or intense as Taken but it's not too bad. Rote story but pretty good action and fight choreography. What really elevates this movie is the depth of characterization given to the baddies especially his chief nemesis who he battles at the end. Without that characterization it's just mindless mowing down of bad guys which gets boring like in the Magnificent 7, again same director.

"Bruce722","6","1","1","24 October 2015"," Decent but failed to live up to its potential.
","I had high hopes for this movie and, while it largely lived up to them, I felt there were some glaring flaws that could've easily been avoided, which would've resulted in a superior film. For one, Antoine Fuqua did a mediocre job with the directing role. It almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life, found a list of all the cool camera tricks, angles, and cinematic effects, and felt compelled to include each and every one of them. How did this impact the movie? It made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever. Secondly, there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make. That, combined with the plot getting a little out of hand, made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow. It wasn't all bad, however, as the rating should reflect. The acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well. The build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too. Unfortunately this film suffered from having a director who wanted to do everything instead of making a great movie."
"Tehmeh","6","1","1","14 August 2015"," If you're ready to forgive some stupidities, you're good to go.
","First things first: ""The Equalizer"" has nothing to do with the TV series. The main character's name (McCall) is the same, but that's it. If you're looking for some nostalgia, you won't find it here.<br/><br/>This is a simple action thriller along the lines of most revenge movies, with very traditional strengths and weaknesses. I'll keep it short this time.<br/><br/>Strengths: Denzel Washington has presence. He doesn't even have to act, it's enough that he's just there. The movie is R-rated, which is always a plus. The main bad guy (Marton Csokas) has plenty of charisma. This film as well as the action is well shot, there is a lot of ""cool factor"" and director Antoine Fuqua knows the beats of this genre. This movie is straightforward, well enough paced and easy to follow.<br/><br/>Weaknesses: While there are plenty of cool shots, effects and sound, it's often used just for the hell of it. Even the music seems to serve the coolness and individual scene composition, not the movie itself. All of this takes you out of the movie a couple of times. ""Equalizer"" has more style than substance, and while the script does what it's supposed to do, a lot of subtleties are wasted in the execution. Much of some well-created suspense (as well as any impact of Csokas' character) is gone when it becomes clear that Denzel Washington's McCall can handle any situation with ease. Sometimes when McCall is fighting one enemy out of ten, the whole world stops around him until enemy number one is dealt with. These are the kinds of clichÃ©s you will have to deal with.<br/><br/>Summary: This is not an intelligent movie, I'd say even Taken is more believable. Much of the buildup is eventually wasted, as the promising thriller-aspect of the movie decides to just go away and make room for consequence-free action. Suspension of disbelief is a must, but for the fans of some oldschool, simple action movies that aren't PG13-pussified, I'd give a recommendation. I enjoyed it for what it was to some extent. I listed far more negatives than positives, but the good moments were good enough to tip the scale more to my liking. I was never bored, and Denzel Washington killing bad guys can be a nice form of movie therapy. <br/><br/>In the sequel, I hope they manage to make a tighter movie that knows what it is, and hold the suspense to the very end. At least make McCall less of a superman."

","The third Taken film is not expected to be released until early 2015, but it seems as though it came early, this time, however, starring Denzel Washington. Consider the many many eerie similarities The Equalizer shares with the first film of the soon to be trilogy. Both films involve foreign villains, ex government agents played by two badass actors (Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington), and a young, vulnerable girl. The negative side of all of this is that I wanted something much different. The Taken producers are already out their minds for making a third film. Unlike Equalizer, however, Taken has an actual story. In Taken, the audience gets to experience more of a thrill ride because there were more variables to get our panties moist. For example, Bryan Mills (Neeson) has no idea where his daughter is, so he must start with minimal evidence to begin his search, and the entire search process becomes gripping. Robert McCall (Washington) on the other hand, knows exactly where his nemeses are located, so it eliminates a very entertaining component. It also never comes full circle. Now, I am not saying I need a movie to be this whole heart dropping experience, but it needs to have a point. And OCD, a photographic memory, and an internet forum that allows people to reach out to him for help is not having a point. So, unfortunately, The Equalizer turns out to simply be a film about a man trapping and killing evil men."

McCall is a man leading an ordinary life and getting away from the extraordinary talents from his earlier life.

"zer-unleashed","10","6","16","30 September 2014"," Denzel Washington is the man!
","This is my first review..<br/><br/>I really loved Denzel Washington in this movie..I think he did an outstanding job, couldn't think of a better actor than him. The way he plays out the roll of this mysterious man who was in his past life a man who eliminated whatever the people above pointed their fingers at is just incredible...You can actually feel his emotions during the movie as he stares down his enemies..that grim face indicating he has nothing to loose and intends to finish whatever promise he made to himself...So overall a fantastic set of actors and acting<br/><br/>About the movie... It's a slow-paced action movie...nothing wrong with that.. But what it does unlike other slow paced action movies is the way it tells the story-everything is well connected and flows well...and the scene's are just off this world...people will say for a one man army he killed his enemies with little to no effort...Well i'll tell you this... the bad guys were shown as really scary no mercy intimidating type of killers...their presence demanded respect...on the other hand Robert McCall (Denzel Washington)was shown as equally intimidating man skilled to perfection and it really makes you think hard what kind of things he had to do in his past to overcome this new threat...<br/><br/>Overall... Really a work of art movie, slow paced BUT with memorable action scenes Definitely a MUST watch movie, Denzel is the man and kudos to his amazing portrayment of a one man army"

","Denzel Washington always grabs the chance to play an amazing character or to simply be in an amazing film. It's the Denzel guarantee that if he is starring in it then in no way you are about to watch a bad film.<br/><br/>Frankly I have to say how surprised I was at the level of violence in this film. Meaning it is quite violent, I didn't expect that at all.I expected the usual P3-13 routine but this film is R-rated so you enjoy all the blood you want.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is the reason to see this film, he never disappoints. Chloe Grace Moretz is amazing as always but she has a very limited screen time. Marton Csokas as the Russian fixer stands out as the most surprising actor in the bunch. He is intimidating, scary and well, Russian. His character poses a great threat to our hero.<br/><br/>As violent this film is, it also has quite inventive action. In the finale McCall uses any tool that can come in handy and he does so in quite a few unexpected ways.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington made great in Training Day. This time it is even better, more perfect film. These roles of quiet men, who decided to right the wrong in the world suit Washington the best. If you want believable characters, attention-grabbing story then this is the film to go."
"blackmamba99971","10","6","17","6 October 2014"," Brand new Denzel
","A man with a mysterious past as a government agent from a three letter system works in a hardware store only to be confronted by an incident of an acquaintance who had been beaten to near death. Denzel as always performs with such audacity that you forget he is Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>Since his days as an operative Robert (Denzel Washington) has vied to become a recluse from his days as a killer. A single man once married brought back into the dim and gritty underground of prostitution, money laundering, and weaponry where he must hunt down those who wish to do harm against his fellow man.<br/><br/>With resources from his old agent friends he manages to create a scenario where he can find and observe his targets before making his move. From what I can see this film has every element of what is known as the death of humanity. To see the Russian mobs grow so cold and merciless that they can corrupt even the most decorated police in an instant.<br/><br/>Robert however sees the mob as something the world can do without and he does just that. Without so much as a bat of an eye lid he takes out single cells or even a central hub just with his hands and what ever is available including a corkscrew. From his perspective to see his friends hurt is what gives him the necessary push to get the job done before someone else gets killed.<br/><br/>In recent years and with certain films to his credit Denzel has in a way transformed an ordinary man to becoming a silent hero. The Equalizer fits the genre. A man who has nothing to lose but to gain a bit more freedom to those who desperately need it or want it. I like the fact at the end of the movie he is at his computer as he answers an ad about another case who needs help.<br/><br/>It's kind of like the 'A' team yet with one person only. Robert's skills go way beyond the norm because of his highly trained past. So it would befit his nature to becoming that which lends a hand to stop the evil in its tracks. I give it ten out ten stars for the action, the plot, and the music which was sheer genius. It was a nice fresh approach without all of the added Hip-hop rap crap other movies contain.<br/><br/>For good reason the equalizer creation has given us a glimpse into what is the underground and why those who need help cry out in the face of their own terror. Denzel has given a great performance again. I hope that there is another sequel to this genre. What we need now is another hero who doesn't sit too long until it is too late. With his obvious talents we can see more of Denzel's character in the future. I hope."

","We went to see the new Denzel Washington movie The Equalizer. I really think he is such a nice man. He has fame, fortune, and looks, but he didn't let it turn him into a jerk. Instead he tries to be a good influence on kids. He doesn't curse in his movies. In this newest movie he asked some guys who were cursing, 'why do you curse so much?' They didn't know how to respond to that. This movie is about him helping some kids get a better life. I like how only the bad guys curse in his movies and you don't see them very much, but he is setting an example to kids who like his movies cursing makes you look like a bad guy. He also encouraged kids to read in this movie. I like the movies he chooses to do. I also like DÃ©jÃ  Vi and Much Ado About Nothing. I'm sure he has others that have just slipped my mind right now, but these three are really nice."

I took my parents to see this and we were all very happy with this movie. I love this movie so much I will go see at least two more times before it is out of the theaters.

","I popped along to this amazing movie. I was slightly hesitant at first, after all, I had heard quite disheartening things. At the end of the day, you have to experience it for yourself. YOU are the reviewer. The plot was quite interesting but at the same time understanding. McCall(Washington), is a lonely man, sitting in a flat in what I thought was San Fran BUT as it happens its actually in Boston, MA. During one of his frequent visits to a local diner, he encounters Alien/Teri(Moretz). They become friends. He gives her plenny of words of advice. One of being ""You can be anything you want to be"". She's working as a Pip. She unfortunately gets beaten up and lands in a hospital. He witnesses all this from the diner window. When he's not alone, he works in a building suppliers company. One of the days he's working, Jenny(Mousis) is mugged of her Mother's ring and the company cash. So as they did wrong to Jenny, McCall beats the robber up etc., It was a pity thou, that they kept that scene out of the film. You were promised plenny of action, and action is what you got. hahaah. So to continue, Raphie(Skourtis) who is a colleague to McCall. Raphie's house is burnt down. So McCall is told when he show's up for work, that Raphie quit. McCall finds out eventually that corrupt cops have been doing the rounds for Mexicans. So he blackmails them and beats them up. This continues throughout the film. There is a pattern you know. Someone does wrong to a person. He mightened know that person, but he goes out of his way to CORRECT the wrong. The crowd who beat up Teri, McCall runs after Slavi(Meunier) and his crew. Pushikin(Kulich) sends another guy Teddy(Csokas) and his crew. With McCall around he makes sure he dimensehses the lot. ""Body by body"" he eradicates em all. After a fantastic finished and eradication, I was saying to myself, perhaps McCall will run after Pushkin in the next Sequel, be another Taken series. Except with Taken it was dealing with kidnapping. However it wasn't to be. They finished the film by McCall getting an email requesting help from him. So that's prob the sequel alrite. One thing I have to mention thou, was the MUSIC score. It was fantastic. I have mentioned in the past, that my love of Music is a must. This film, lived to its MUSICAL expectations. Every time, there was action accoming, we were accompanied with Music. It was unreal. Or as I said AMAZEBALLS."

Enough, to go out to serve and protect the disadvantaged ones. I do hope the ""tyrants"" around the globe would watch this movie. I cannot imagine something worse, that the mighty one breaking the spirit of those less fortunate. If someone has power, then this power should be used only in service to the others, nothing else.

"JontheLobsterLover","8","3","7","11 November 2015"," A feel good action movie
","I really, really, really, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. <br/><br/>This movie has many things going for it in my opinion. The main character is not a typical action ""hero"". He has heart; he's selfless; He is probably what a lot of people wish they could be. A hero to others. The fact that he takes the time to know everyone; help everyone; it just makes you feel good and root for him that much more.<br/><br/>Even though Chloe Grace Moretz is only in the movie for a brief period, she effectively makes you feel for her character. She is an amazing actress, and this movie just further proves that fact.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing, and highly adds to the movies mood. <br/><br/>Finally the kills IMO are highly creative. Sure there are a few ""stab stab stab, shoot shoot shoot"" scenes in the movie. But the whole post ending scene in the warehouse I was on the edge of my seat, with a grin plastered on my face, just waiting for what he was going to do next. Think Hank Hill pushed too far. <br/><br/>One thing I actually disliked about the movie are the shots where the scene would slow down, then speed up. Then slow back down, and speed back up again. I understand that's the directors style, but for me it pulled me out just a tad. <br/><br/>This movie in an odd way made me feel good about myself. It's hard to describe but this movie just had that effect on me that makes me think ""Man, I wish I could be like Robert."", but in the best way possible."
"kosie42","5","3","7","7 October 2014"," basically a reboot of a classic, with bad-ass attitude
","I Went to watch the movie tonight. Most of my expectations were met. From the trailer of the movie it was clear the movie was out to exploit the theme of Man on Fire with the same actor... Off course the masses must be attracted to go watch the movie to make money, and not rather entertain the audience??!!<br/><br/>This is not a classic Equalizer as we remember, rather a reboot of the original TV Series, a more R-rated bad-ass theme which basically do not justice to the original character.<br/><br/>However, the little interaction between Denzil & Chloe is definitely stand-out scenes, funnily with way toned down violence. The theme of redemption rather than revenge do help the film. As well as a little pathos and empathy between the the 2 main characters hardly hurt the film. The movie is brutal, some might say realistic, but the normal expected action with gory violence and some cleverness infused from the main character. Action, thriller fans will like the movie, which might rather have been called another title.<br/><br/>A Bad-ass reboot of a classic, yeah, but not for the intellectual. It could have been refined more, with the same storyline but with much more intellect to the viewers. Go watch it if you'd like to leave your senses at the door."
"jboothmillard","5","3","7","5 October 2014"," The Equalizer
","This film is based on the television series that starred Edward Woodward, the trailer for it certainly made it look entertaining, so I went to see it and hoped for the best, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, King Arthur, Shooter, Olympus Has Fallen). Basically in Boston, Massachusetts lives Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), an obsessive compulsive Home Mart hardware store, he has befriended many of his co-workers, including Mexican security trainee Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who he is helping pass his exam, in fact Robert is a former black ops government operative who promised his recently deceased wife to leave his old life behind. Late at night he has befriended young prostitute Teri, real name Alina (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), when he sees her mistreated by her pimp Slavi (David Meunier) he is compelled to act and help her, her life has been destroyed since age five or six as a victim of sex trafficking by Russian Mafia and is now a sex slave and prostitute because of it, he takes real action when Alina is hospitalised after a severe beating. McCall enters the Russian mob territory and attempts to get the pimp to release Alina for a $9,8000 payment, he refuses taking insult, McCall pretends to start walking out, but then takes Slavi and his men down with their weapons, timing himself in half a minute, Slavi drowns in his blood as McCall tells him he should have taken the money, and he leaves, taking security camera footage with him. Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) retaliates and sends enforcer Teddy (The Lord of the Rings' Marton Csokas) from Moscow to find and eliminate the culprit, meanwhile Ralphie gives up his security guard application after his mother's family restaurant was set fire by corrupt cops as an act of extortion, McCall forces the policemen to pay back the money they have extorted or face humiliation, following this Ralphie passes his qualification and becomes Home Mart security guard. Teddy pinpoints the culprit as McCall, but tries to capture him for his skills rather than kill him, while continuing vigilantism he is able to evade the Teddy, captors and assassins, McCall visits fellow retired operatives Brian Plummers (Bill Pullman) and Susan Plummer in Virginia who give him intelligence about the activities of Pushkin and Teddy, real name Nikolai, after leaving Susan remarks he did not want help, he wanted permission. Corrupt Bostonian policeman Frank Masters (Quantum of Solace's David Harbour) is then captured by McCall and placed in a car to suffer threatened suffocation by carbon monoxide flooded, Masters relents and helps him destroy Pushkin's money laundering operations in Boston, and slowly his empire. After being threatened by Pushkin, who is unsatisfied by his progress, Teddy now wants to kill McCall, who meanwhile destroys one of Pushkin's container ships meant for smuggling, Teddy and his men attack Home Mart, taking Ralphie and other workers hostage, threatening to kill them if McCall does not surrender, but he manages to disable the lights and takes out the henchmen one by one with a series of booby traps. The last of the men are killed after Ralphie helps activate a microwave activate explosion, and Teddy is defeated being shot several times with a nail gun and a shot in the throat, finally McCall travels to Moscow, Russia and kills Pushkin with combined water and electricity, in the end McCall returns to Boston, where Alina has recovered, McCall decides to set up an online ad for his services, calling himself ""The Equalizer"". Washington is a good choice to play the retired skilled agent and silently aggressive good Samaritan, you could argue the similarities to Death Wish and Taken, there is not much originality in it, but with the title character using his ""particular set of skills"" you can't complain too much, the action and violence used, including an interesting use for DIY tools, is fun to watch, so it is a slick enough thriller drama. Worth watching!"

His character unfolds as the story does and pulls the viewer along. He plays the part of ex-CIA Special Operator with realism to the point where he is a Poster Boy to link up with the members of Seal Team 6 to fight ISIS. Such a force would defeat ISIS quickly.<br/><br/>Not all Russians are ""bad guys"" and tough, but this movie sure convinces you that they are up to no good.<br/><br/>As you would expect, good overcomes evil.<br/><br/>Kudos Denzel !!!!!!"

","Some may say this is a usual Denzel movie. I agree in part but that doesn't take away that this was an awesome movie. Yes it's predictable, but the plot and action makes it OK. The movie does a good you in not fully explaining 'Roberts, background. It was fun trying to guess his background. It added to the suspense because just like the bad guys in the movie, I wanted to know 'who was he'. The action was great, not boring at all. Denzel does a great job playing these type of roles. The movie kept me engaged. The soundtrack was great. The robinhood/ninja character was interesting and kept you guessing. The special effects were not over the top. The last scene when Denzel is walking in water coming down and he has that cool, killer look as he slowly goes towards the bad guy while shooting him with the nail gun was priceless."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","11","9 October 2014"," Odds against You? Need Help? Look for the Equalizer. Denzel Washington + Antonio Fuqua = box office success.
","What do you see when you look at me? Quotes the tag line of this movie directed by Antonio Fuqua. I have to say, when I look at this movie; it's really good, but so formulaic. It has a lot of tiresome clichÃ©s and tropes that you see in a lot in a Denzel Washington movie. The movie isn't anything new to Denzel Washington. This film has almost the same similar plot-line of 2004's Man on Fire. It has the outsmart skills and tactics that you would see in a movie like 2012's Safe House. The movie is also a bit one-dimensional black and white as it comes with characters. Bad guys are just really bad. The victims are just victims, and not playing mind games or twisting the truth to get their way. Don't expend any twist and turns in this film. It's just a generic action film. I really don't know, how accurate it was to the 1980s TV show with the same name, but by the looks of it, it really doesn't match, well. Where was 'Control' during all this? Where was the Jaguar XJ? It's look nearly nothing like the show. In this version of the Equalizer, a mysterious man named Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is trying to live a normal quiet life. But when he meets a young prostitute name Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) in the need of help. He can't stand idly by, and take control by taking on the whole ultra-violent Russian mob. Denzel Washington's character must had the God-like superman codes, because it seem really, it always seem like he was one step further than the bad boys. The bad boys never had a chance. The movie really borderline unrealistic, when McCall rarely shows any weakness. It seems that he always have the unlimited resources to combat, everything that the Russian mob can dish on him. Not once, could I see his character honestly dying. It's really felt one-sided. The movie is full of violent imagery and clever way to kill people. I do like slow-motion sequences meant to imitate Robert's timed-precision combat style. It does remind me so much of 2009 Sherlock Holmes. Too bad, half of the ending action sequence is in pitch dark, making it hard to see. It's also go way too long. This movie is really long, despite clocking in 2 Hrs & 11 minutes. There are tons of dead shots pacing where nothing is going on. It doesn't use the time, wisely. A lot of the Robert McCall's backstory is vague, thin, and poorly developed over the course of the movie. The movie doesn't even show if McCall suffer from OCD or not. Mad Props for Denzel Washington for adding some depth in the character. Anyways, crimes come and go in the film in an oddly forced simultaneously way. It felt more like a series of TV episodes oddly put together than a movie. The whole robbery in the Home Mart should had been in the beginning, than in the middle of the film. Chloe Grace Moretz, while getting third billing is barely in the film. She is in the majority of the first half, and doesn't appear back until the end. Instead, McCall is supported by sub-plots like Ralph (Johnny Skourtis), a fellow employee at the Home Mart, where McCall works at, trying to become a security guard. Characters like Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman) & Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) particular showing up has with little to do besides exposition. It felt like those scenes would had been cut. The villain despite being over the top, monotone speaking evil Russians stereotypes were alright. Marton Csokas as Teddy, the Russian mob enforcer is fittingly nightmarish. With a combination of meticulous control and savage brutality, he is wildly unpredictable and totally compelling. For the most part, all the acting in this film were alright. The movie has a lot of metaphor storytelling that really don't match with the story within the story. Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway tells the story of honor in struggle, defeat and death. The old man Santiago is characterized as someone struggling against defeat. Santiago, though destroyed at the end of the novella that his fish is eaten by the sharks, is never truly defeated. The film would be more powerful, if characters that McCall care for, were killed. Not once, did McCall lost any of his close-friends, or felt like he got close to being defeated. The movie lose a bit of that. I do hope, they make the film sequels, a little bit more challenging, so it can stand out, more. The movie does have a pretty good soundtrack that was great to listen throughout the film. Overall: It's not a bad movie. It's pretty damn good. I just wish, for more."
"zkonedog","7","2","4","28 February 2017"," Denzel Is Back!
","Over the past couple of years, Denzel Washington went from Hollywood A-lister to serious disappointment. ""Safe House"" was a disaster, ""Flight"" was okay at best, and movies like ""Pelham 123"", ""Unstoppable"" and ""2 Guns"" are a dime a dozen. Where was the Denzel from the mid- 2000s, where films like ""Deja Vu"" and ""Man on Fire"" showcased him at his best? I almost didn't even go see ""The Equalizer"" because I was so afraid of another disappointment. Luckily, while not perfect by any means, this film shows that Denzel does still have greatness in him.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Equalizer"" tells the story of Robert McCall (Washington), a genial man who works at a home repair retail store. While warm, genial, and helpful at work, Robert's home life paints a different picture. He lives alone, a slave to routine and very little joy, and frequents a late-night dinner due to insomnia. At that diner, Robert strikes up some casual conversations with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young prostitute, and gets to know her on a more personal level. One night, Teri shows up with bruises covering her face. The next night, she doesn't show up at all. This leads Robert (who obviously has a very violent past) to do what needs to be down to find her abusers.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" could almost be a sequel to ""Man on Fire"" in terms of acting and intensity. Denzel plays a very similar role (very much based on vengeance) and shows with ease that he can still be ""the tough guy"" when needed. What truly makes the movie great, though, is that director Antoine Fuqua (who also directed Denzel's breakout hit ""Training Day"") knows how to utilize the great actor to his furthest potential. The first half of the film is set up so well that even a paint-by-numbers second half is forgivable because viewers are already snagged hook, line, and sinker.<br/><br/>That being said, this isn't a five-star, all-time effort for a couple of different reasons. It becomes a bit predictable and over-the-top in the second half. Whereas ""Man on Fire"" was able to sustain both the intensity and emotional energy for the entire runtime, this film drops the emotional stuff in favor of sheer brutality at times. Remember those scenes from ""First Blood"", where Sly Stallone's John Rambo sets forest traps for the police officers hunting him? Well, a similar scenario plays out in this one...only involving home-improvement equipment in a retail store! I would have preferred a bit more emotion and character development (specifically more about McCall himself) in the movie's second act, but it doesn't fall completely flat because the ""bad guys"" are such scum-bags that you don't mind the gruesome violence.<br/><br/>Thus, despite its obvious flaws, ""The Equalizer"" is more than good enough to vault Denzel back into the spotlight that an A-list career like his deserves. A quote from the film has McCall telling another character ""you got to be who you are in this world...no matter what"". After a number of misfires, Denzel gets back to ""who he is"" with this exciting, bombastic film. Not his best, but puts him on the right track again."
"mubeen710","8","2","4","17 August 2015"," The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.
","Denzel Washington gives a solid performance as always, but the Equalizer is of the same quality as many other Denzel led thrillers: without him it would not be meaningful, with him it's watchable & special. There's definitely a pleasure in watching Denzel taking down tough- talking baddies, and that's what the film delivers, no more, no less. The conflicts are generally well written and ratchet pressure nicely, especially when Denzel has some chilly conversations with his soon-to-be-victims before they inevitably make their bad decisions. The tense sit-downs were equally entertaining for me just as the bloody violence. Director Antoine Fuqua goes about his business in a more than competent manner; the technical qualities are above average, though the film has moments where it seems too infatuated with its slick sense of style. The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller."

In a way, this film was reminding me of ""Man on Fire"", just on a more blue collar level because of the kind of work his character did in the movie.<br/><br/>Robert McCall(Denzel Washington) is a good man who lives a quiet life but has a secret past, with Teri(Chloe Grace Moretz) being involved, it does make for a typical action movie, but a good one! The fact that Robert McCall is a good man who helps anyone around him is part of what I think makes this a good film.<br/><br/>With an actor like Denzel Washington you could never go wrong even if it is a typical action flick. His acting is always going to be on point no matter what kind of film it is, not leaving out the other actors in this film, the entire cast excellently performed. You won't be disappointed if you rent or buy this movie. It's a good one."

It might be still very good... and I honestly hope so... Let's go!<br/><br/>25 minutes - nothing really worth mentioning, nice cityscapes, the story doesn't really bore you and you still wait for a big boom to happen any minute.

"KineticSeoul","6","2","4","7 January 2015"," It has Denzel, but still a forgettable film.
","So the main thing going for this movie is Denzel Washington. Yeah, I could say that about some of his other movies as well. But he is basically the only thing that really stands out in this generic film. Sure, it has some cool scenes with Denzel playing this badass. But it's nothing really knew in this type of genre. The plot is about a man with a past that is seeking redemption and retribution. He is a vigilante that puts the law into his own hands and handles things like ""The Punisher"". But probably not as cruel when it comes to handling the bad guys. Mainly because he at least gives some of them chances before he gets his hands dirty. I was able to sit through this, but it isn't something I would watch again. Mainly because it's just not that entertaining in my opinion and the character development is poorly constructed. And that includes the plot as well. It just didn't seem to flow that well. Marton Csokas was good as the villain Teddy, but his character was poorly written and his character didn't seem to bring out his full potential as the villain. Decent job sort of building him up and nothing. The only scene that actually stood out for me is when Denzel's character is sitting in front of the villain in the restaurant. And they exchange words with one another. Sort of reminded me of a scene from ""Heat"". Overall though it's a forgettable film.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

What a poor and lonely soul you are. Such a great actor and such a bad movie clearly need some more supporting words and some more power to think about other parallel worlds in which Denzel still plays in very goods movies. Infinite possibilities, but, nevertheless, you are in a world in which the bad thing has happened.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start from. So much physical and mental power in a single man that can make Superman envious. At least, Superman had extraterrestrial overpower and a ridiculous costume.

","This is coherent and stylized which is more than can be said about many films. Middle-aged Bob working the Home Depot decides on a whim to help the tormented girl who shares the same diner and happens to be a call- girl for the mob, only of course he's no ordinary man. Zatoichi-like powers of perception and just as deadly. The film in fact recalls Jarmusch's riff on Zatoichi, complete with kindly taciturn hero who lives monk-like in the midst of a comic-book violence.<br/><br/>This is the American cool that comes from what we infer the lone hero has had chiseled away from him by sacrifice, it's not the Italian cool of Leone or the Japanese cool of Kurosawa. So there is a heavyhandedness about doing the right thing, a churchlike piousness, which when coupled with suavely evil Russians to whom gory justice is served in a myriad ways suggests just the opposite of introspectiveness. <br/><br/>The last third is a complete bust, nondescript shootout, and then just like that show up in Moscow and back home again for the girl to pop up from around a corner and announce that she has ""changed her world"". Denzel smiles understandingly. Denzel by the looks of it has got a new franchise to toy around with for the next several years that lets him inhabit the same avenger persona as always."

","Denzel Washington is the only reason this movie is not failing. In many cases this movie may seem simple and quite boring. Any other action movie could have been made like that, simple story and plot, no surprises nor twists. I've seen many of those kinds of movies before but ""The Equalizer"" is beyond all that. It is intriguing and deadly. Denzel Washington delivers a fantastic performance and has most of the best lines in the movie. The fact that his character suffers from OCD is important cause the audience can identify with his character, see for themselves how he deals with his rivals and threats and how he finds a way to get out of every bad situation. One memorable sequence in the film is the one near the ending, the ""home malt"" sequence where Denzel's character faces his enemies at the store and sets off traps, it is filmed so well that I had to appreciate every shot of that sequence, the water dropping from the sealing on his face. Every moment from that sequence was intriguing and awesome. ""The Equalizer"" is another good movie by Antoine Fuqua and I wish to see more of Denzel's character in the future."

The last twenty minutes are just ridiculous - he tackles and destroys a small army of baddies armed with sub machine guns using the contents of the DIY superstore where he works.

","Just viewed this movie tonight. Denzel fans should enjoy it. Similar to his role in Man of Fire. It is essentially a good action movie about a 'bad' good guy going after the bad bad guys (Russian mobsters) and the 'good' bad guys (corrupt cops) after an encounter with a young prostitute in a cafe.<br/><br/>I loved the original TV series. Edward Woodward was one of my all time favourite British actors from the immensely enjoyable spy series Callan, and the movies Wicker Man, and Breaker Morant. I was hesitant to watch this film, as I thought it was going to be an over the top American take on a classic British show. While it may be over the top, the film doesn't resemble the TV show except for his name.<br/><br/>This film is quite gruesome in its action scenes, and the over use of squelchy sound effects when Denzel dishes out his justice is annoying. There are some good performances from other cast members - Marton Csokas is excellent as the softly spoken, cold to the bone marrow Russian sent to 'sort things out'.<br/><br/>The fight out near the end of the film is dark (as in not enough light to see what's going on), but you knew when someone got slaughtered, as the loud, squelching sound effects kicked in. The scene with some constructive use of razor wire had me laughing. Denzel manages to quickly rig up a pully type arrangement with razor wire while being pursued by five baddies. Anyone who has ever tried to work with wire knows it is the most uncooperative stuff ever invented, and certainly wouldn't magically uncoil without a big fight.<br/><br/>Denzel is one step ahead of everyone in this film, and we get the idea that Denzel may have been a bad guy in his earlier life, but the ending was too quick which spoilt all the previous tension building retribution. And that is all I have to say about that."

","This was a rather nice surprise and one of the better action movies I've seen from past decade. It has a good balance of slower drama parts and rough action senes. But it all ties together, and the tension keeps building all the time. Denzel Washington is great as the lead guy. He's tough and cool but also has a subtle emotional quality behind his serious face. The supporting characters are also ok though they don't have very much to do. There's just enough something to make you care about the characters.<br/><br/>Now comes the (minor)spoiler section:<br/><br/>The main character's past is not explained very much which bothered me a bit. But in the end I also felt that it was a nice mystery to be left open. But the problem is that the movie starts in a rather serious and realistic way but then it's revealed that this ordinary guy has some secret super commando skills. Why is it that every time in movies when a main character runs into a criminal gang he just happens to be some war veteran, former cop or agent or something. Well, maybe that's because we're in an action movie. I just felt like the humble personality of the character didn't completely fit together with his overpowered combat skills.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good movie.

While this isn't one of Denzel's greatest acting jobs, he does way more with the role than you'd expect. The movie does a good job of showcasing how nice of a guy McCall is, which makes his violent outbursts way more interesting. The action scenes are well handled. I loved the way McCall would see things in slow motion before acting them out. They hold nothing back in terms of violence, making sure each scene looks as brutal as it needs to be.

I don't think ANYONE can compare with his abilities in the acting field-thus he is my new favorite and one of the two or three who can make any movie worth watching.

","I loved ""The Equaliser"" & i loved the legendary Denzel in his role as the extremely skilled & dangerous ""Robert McCall"" an ex-CIA Agent turned Urban Vigilante. Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as ""Training Day"" & ""Man on Fire"" & ""Deja Vu"" & ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" & ""The Bone Collector"" & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as ""Inside Man"" & ""The Book of Eli"" (terrible ending) & ""2 Guns"" but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.
Here Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here ""McCall"" helps out a young brutalized girl ""Teri"" played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called ""Teddy"" played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.
Director Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.
The fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.
McCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.
The Action is brutally fun when McCall starts using his ""Special Skills"" on the local thugs & corrupted cops, it's a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life!!!

Instead there is a deliberate and calculated almost methodical approach to a sort of moral physical justice that offers up one origination story for the original 1985 television series.

","The Equalizer (2014): Dir: Antoine Fuqua / Cast: Denzel Washington, Chloe Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, David Harbour, Haley Bennett: Title references not just the equality of justice verses injustice, it also references the elevation of character. What isn't elevated is a screenplay that rises above story conventions. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall who works at a hardware store. He also dines out in the evening where he reads. This is where he meets a young prostitute named Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. When he witnesses her being abused by her pimp, he attempts to buy her freedom. When this offer is turned down and mocked, he does the impossible and executes everyone in graphic fashion using whatever is available. This is where the film shows its true nature. Antoine Fuqua directed the underrated Brooklyn's Finest as well as Bait and Training Day. He can direct action but the screenplay is just one simplistic pointless action scene after another until arriving at a finale where a nail gun and other tools are used as methods of death. Washington holds his own as this mysterious good Samaritan who gives warnings to bad guys who pay a dear price if they refuse to heed. Moretz is too brief as the young hooker who ends up in the hospital. Marton Csokas plays the Russian villain cleanup guy whom Washington cleans up the floor with. David Harbour plays a corrupt cop whom Washington also cleans the floor up with. Haley Bennett plays Moretz's hooker friend whom Csokas chokes to death.

","We could call The Equalizer a thoughtful extreme action flick because of how much quiet time Denzel Washington explores while on screen. <br/><br/>Carefully arranging small household objects, ruminating over coffee and a newspaper, et cetera, before the butt-kicking action starts between Denzel and a local vodka-favored mob.<br/><br/>What is not thoughtful is a noticeable lack of exposition and character fleshing sequences that might explain precisely what the middle-age protagonist's life story is, and how precisely he can map a fight out in his mind in advance (just like Guy Ritchie's / Robert Downey, Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes) and then Auto-CAD his movements so that he can whip up on, well, let's not spoil it, a lot of people. <br/><br/>I mentally jumped with glee at the chance to follow a strong and quiet Denzel through this film. Once the fisticuffs started cuffing, I couldn't help but glory in each of his (undeveloped) character's triumphs in hand-to-hand combat, and in outfoxing the snarling, tattooed baddies the film sets him against. <br/><br/>But a movie has to be more than a storyboard sketch of a bully story with adults drawn in and a sequence of crunchy, gushing fight scenes. And this is a movie with Denzel Washington. Philadelphia. Glory. The Hurricane. Malcom X. Crimson Tide. <br/><br/>Oily studio types, leave Denzel out of this under-nourishing film- flam approach in the future. Leave the Deus-Ex-Punchina to Steven Segal and projects striving for general mediocrity. <br/><br/>We always complain about too much exposition, we groan, 'Dear God this is duller than George Lucas and his damn metichloriants,' but you know what? Too little exposition is just as frustrating."

I believe it was always going to star the impressive Denzel Washington, but a few directors have been in and out of the director's chair including Nicolas Winding Refn ('Drive'). He bowed out a while ago and the studio asked Antoine Fuqua to helm the project, which he accepted. Fuqua worked with Washington on the Oscar winning film 'Training Day', which also earned Washington an acting Oscar.<br/><br/>That movie was a raw and gritty film about a couple of police detectives working the mean streets of Los Angeles. It had many layers of depth and character development alongside it's violent action scenes. Well don't go into 'The Equalizer' expecting that. Instead, go in expecting a 90's Nic Cage type of action film complete with slow motion shots of Denzel walking away from big explosions. The only thing that was missing were John Woo's white doves flying out into the sky when Fuqua turned up the action beats. That's not to say this movie is bad in any way shape or form. It isn't. In fact, it's quite good and entertaining if you walk in expecting a fun action movie with Denzel kicking all sorts of ass.<br/><br/>We meet Denzel's character Robert McCall as he is heading to work at his job at a Home Depot type place as a general employee. He is a nice and fun guy around his co-workers, and even tries to help them out in life when he can. He spends his evenings at a local diner, reading novels, eating pie, and watching the local vagrants come in on their break. One of them is Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a prostitute who is constantly being beat by her johns and pimp/Russian mob underboss. Well, Robert won't stand for this aggression, and tries to make sure this doesn't happen again, but when Teri ends up in the hospital die to a severe beating, Robert heads over to the pimp who did this and we see Robert turn into a super soldier of sorts who brutally takes out five guys in under a minute.<br/><br/>Once the higher ups in the Russian mob hear about this, Robert is forced to start taking out all assassins that are trying to get to him. He even enlists the help of his former colleagues at one point with cameos from Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, which give a backstory to Robert's past and how important he was to the USA. Everything culminates back at Robert's workplace, the Home Depot, where all hell breaks loose as RObert sets these insane and violent traps around the store for his attackers.<br/><br/>This is a straightforward action film with all the genre beats that come with it, twists and all. Denzel is 59 years old, but man he kicks ass like a healthy 25 year old. It's brutal, raw, and unrelenting. And while this remake of 'The Equalizer' might not have the depth and symbolism that 'Training Day' did, it certainly is a fun action film that is thrilling and highly entertaining."

","Watching this movie makes you wish Luc Besson had given the makers of this movie some lessons about how to make an action movie. Director Antoine Fuqua turns things round with an invincible African American hero dealing with white criminals eg the Russian mob and crooked Boston Irish cops.<br/><br/>The problems are mainly in the pace and the action sequences. The pace is uneven, with some draggy staring scenes interspersed by some sudden excessively graphic violence. The violence is revolting, not funny - too much is shown during each killing.<br/><br/>Denzel as the invincible vigilante like ex agent does some fighting and action but it's a bit like Liam Neeson's fighting in the last few Taken movies - a bit suggested with camera work.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz as an abused Russian prostitute is a scene stealer and shows she can act any kind of role well.<br/><br/>Overall a not quite get your money's worth flawed action thriller."

","It is shiny. It has glitter. It had logic. It has Denzel appearing intelligent with reading 100 books. Its not what the opening leads you to believe. No, we are sucked in with 20 minutes of, we might have cool and suave mixed with some believable action. Fool me once... Instead I watch this highly trained, unbeatable assassin/hand to hand combat, best the CIA ever trained warrior, who from what the movie will have us believe, the who's who of who in society and military world over, would consider themselves privileged to get a decline to their respective RSPV's to their daughters wedding, blows up a ship, by remote control or timer, but is casually strolling away while shrapnel is penetrating shipping containers all around him! Not that strolling away while your explosives are about to probably kill you is dumb or anything...., cause he has great intuitiveness. Like with the whore. There are, lol, a few other moments I could waste my finger on, but why? If you defend this as a good film then you probably never knew why Pink Floyd were so great. And I cannot hold any credibility for something that holds so little taste for art. Getting back to our Denzel character.... if I didn't think this guy was a tool before, blowing up the shipping container so casually, he comes out of retirement for a white trash hooker! Some professional! Or maybe I got hookers wrong. Maybe Hollywood have an insight I have misconceived and most are really sweethearts who need to be nurtured into the butterflies they always were.... â² Top"

","I was hoping that having Denzel Washington and the director of ""Training Day"" onboard, ""The Equalizer"" would have been epic. Sadly, it's not but it still is a must watch, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought the story to this one was pretty messy and way too boring in way too many parts. Additionally, the characters are pretty lackluster and don't really have much depth to themâwell, most of them anyway. However, the acting is great and Denzel is just cold as ice in his role. But the true shining light in this film is the brutal and gritty action sequences. These parts break up the film's tedium and monotony extremely well and singlehandedly make the film something to watch.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" might not have ended up as intriguing and engrossing as I had hoped it would have been but watching a cold, calculating Denzel deal out justice with an icy stare makes the film something to take in."
"james_tabang","6","0","0","21 January 2015"," So here is another super hero in human form...
","There's no doubt Denzel was able to portray the stoic character of the protagonist. In fact, he did it perfectly, so as to appear that he was the real villain. One would, as usual, expect spectacular effects from such wealthy companies as Sony and Columbia. But the story was disappointing. Here we have an agent who assassinates adversaries perfectly in every situation, with minimal to no damage taken at all. The girl was even set aside in the mid-section of the film and, laughably, re-emerges in the final scene (maybe so as to remind viewers her significance in the film was not fully set aside). Plus, some would find the insertion of a meaningful quote at the beginning baffling. The movie doesn't even provoke pity or, at the very least, understanding of the main character's situation. With so many slow-motion and time-lapses in between scenes, one can vividly picture the aim of the movie; to impress viewers with force, which some people may see as arrogance. It is a commercial action movie though, so most who are satisfied with intense action and little drama would find this film worthy of taking their time."

","(spoilers) If you're in the mood for a Mindless action movie with a standard Denzyl Washington performance, the you might like director Antoine Fuqua's ""The Equalizer"". And notice Mindless with a capital ""M"". Here you have a lead character, conjured as part Macgyver, part, part Casey Rybeck and part Jason Bourne though infused with the eloquence of Washington. It makes for an interesting and CALM Bad@$$. The movie though is completely ridiculous making Equalizer character Robert McCall into a superhero, with super-reactions - devoid realism. In only one fight the whole movie is he actually physically challenged, and oh, what an unclimactic terrible final fight with the Martin Csokas, playing a menacing enough bad guy. The thugs are imbeciles or brainless, and the untouchability of Washington's character got stale quickly. 6/10 for Washington's effort and some fun action scenes."
"gradyharp","Null","0","0","2 January 2015"," 'When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.'
","Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter, Olympus has Fallen, etc) has rethought and adopted the television series by the same name (Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim) with a script by Richard Wenk into a movie that is so well made that it shows every actor in the film at his/her best. Yes, it is violent, but the violence is directed at those evil men who benefit from the misery of others, never being arrested and never submitting to punishment.<br/><br/>Robert McCall (Denzel Washington in one of his finest roles) believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life in Boston, Massachusetts. He is methodical and supportive and works at the Home Mart store, frequently helping his co-workers. Every night, McCall goes to a diner to read a book and drink tea, and he befriends the teenager Russian prostitute Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), the alias of Alina. One night, Alina's pimp Slavi (David Meunier) brutally beats her and she goes to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the local hospital. McCall goes to the Russian restaurant where Slavi is and offers US$ 9,800.00 for the freedom of Alina. However Slavi does not accept the offer and McCall kills him and his four bodyguards. The Russian mafia kingpin Vladimir Pushkin sends the cruel enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas â in an exceptionally fine performance) to find who killed his men. Soon he finds that McCall is the one who killed the mobster and Teddy begins a war against him. McCall may have a mysterious past but he has become a 'Robin Hood' hit man who destroys those people who prey on others and in doing so he changes the lives of those for whom he is the benefactor. <br/><br/>The plot is appropriately complex, involving bad cops, the FBI, the Russian gangs and their multiple crime influences of human and drug and oil trafficking. The excellent cast includes Johnny Skourtis as Ralphie â the obese lad Robert McCall guides to a better life, Melissa Leo in a very brief but poignant role, Bill Pullman, David Harbour, Haley Bennett, etc. After a fine and tense drama the film is all but ruined by the wholly unnecessary noisy Rap music that destroys the mood during the credits. Despite this, this is a very fine film, overlooked for some reason."
"somf","9","7","24","24 September 2014"," The best comic book movie of the year
","I never saw the television show and I have no doubt that Denzel's Robert McCall character is quite different than the TV show character, but he certainly is the best superhero of the year. And that is simply what he is. Antoine Fuqua uses close ups of Denzel's face as he assesses impossible situations and then comes out unscathed usually leaving behind a pile of baddies. I was reminded of Christian Bale's Batman character in those scenes.<br/><br/>Reviews of the film have been tepid so far mostly citing it as being clichÃ©d, and implausible, but looking at this like a superhero film elevates it considerably. The Russian mob characters are the heavily tattooed super villains led by the talented Marton Csokas. The violence is all comic book in its execution with a grand finale that takes place in a Home Depot type store. Let's just say Denzel gets creative with a host of the store's products. In fact, the only violence that did not seem comic book like was when the Csokas first exams photos of the bodies that were left in McCall's wake. <br/><br/>And the best news of all is that when the film ends we are left with the feeling that we will be seeing McCall in action again, hopefully soon."
"ty_lattimore2007","8","3","8","29 November 2014"," Solid Good Film
","Equalizer was a bit of an unexpected surprise. First, I would never bet against Denzel. I usually enjoy all his films. I was on skeptical since Antonio Fuqua has not really won me over as a director. Unlike the majority of people I did not like ""Training Day."" Therefore I was a bit skeptical of the re-teaming of Denzel with Antonio. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was really good. Denzel has been on a role lately with his foray into more action oriented films lately. He plays the character with such understated poise and humility. The hand to hand combat was great. The movie has a message but does not hit you over the head with it. Marton Csokas was stunningly evil. He is the kind of villain like Anthony Hopkins....quiet but lethal. Even when he is not doing anything he just makes your fearful of what he could do. I would love if Denzel finally gets his own franchise since this could easily have a sequel. Overall great movie and worth the price of admission. Perfect casting!!!"
"thomas-w15","7","3","8","20 November 2014"," Bloody Great Action film
","The Equalizer: I am gonna go on a limb and say most Denzel fans have seen his most famous role- Training Day. Denzel's role of the corrupted cop Alonzo Harris is known as one of the biggest badass roles of all time. Picture Denzel in Training Day, but as a good guy. That is his character in The Equalizer. To make it even better, the director from Training Day returned to direct this film. I cannot picture a better scenario. Despite some over the top Hollywood moments, The Equalizer delivers in strong lead acting, great music underscoring, and equally impressive action sequences to give one of the most entertaining action films this year. <br/><br/>What I mean by over the top Hollywood moments is things like walking away from a huge explosion without looking back. Training Day was very successful at staying away from those kind of moments which is why it was such a memorable action movie. Unfortunately, this film decided to use those moments which are entertaining, but put it closer into the general action film category. These select few times in the film were the only moments where I was just thinking to myself ""really?"" Fortunately, nothing else seemed to bother me about the film. <br/><br/>Now to the best part of the film, Denzel-freaking-Washington. He perfectly played this role, I firmly believe no one could have played it better. He wasn't just able to give you the great badass that the director asked from him, he gave more. He delivered great light comedy that really made the movie whole. Without it, the movie would have been too dark like The November Man. The action sequences in this film were very well done. What I mean is, they did not bring in a kung-fu master to have Denzel fight at the end or anything, it was just great street fighting. Denzel's character, Robert McCall, could slow down certain moments and see all of the angles he needed to defeat his opponent. The audience really just sat in awe at how impressive it was. The action sequences can get pretty bloody, so if you do not like those kind of things, I advise you not to see this film.<br/><br/>If you are the kind of person who just loves action movies, I highly recommend The Equalizer your first choice going into the theater. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"CharlieGreenCG","6","3","8","28 September 2014"," The Equalizer - Review
","Director Antoine Faqua and Denzel Washington have only made one film together, Training Day, which earned Denzel an Academy Award. Collaborating again, this time for The Equalizer, Denzel and Faqua have made another equally impressive film, but this time with DW as the good guy allowing us to get right behind the character.<br/><br/>Beginning with the ordinary life of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), we exaggeratingly see that is a routine man and secluded life to time perfection. But after befriending Terri (Chloe Grace-Moretz's singer come prostitute character) she is beaten by thugs. Not being able to standby and do nothing, McCall retaliates with the only way he knows going back into his mystery past.<br/><br/>Although top-billed, Chloe Grace-Moretz has only fifteen-minutes screen time of the over two-hour feature. That, with perhaps a little too much time focused on ordinary life routine leaves McCall with a rather flimsy excuse and minimal hesitation to go back to his former attacking and defending black ops-commando lifestyle. From then onwards DW's McCall tackles crooked cops and stereotypical vodka drinking Russia mobsters left, right and centre as well as bonkers explosions that even Michael Bay would be jealous of - cools guys don't look at explosions, indeed.<br/><br/>Presented very much as a superhero, McCall, before any killing sequences gets almost a spider-sense vision and everything slows down as he accesses possible weapons nearby before swiftly killing. At one point he clears a room of armed Russian mobsters in just 28 seconds - all with a bottle-opener! Impress yes, but it sadly verges on the fantasy rather than reality.<br/><br/>Washington, even though a bad-ass commando, has a quiet and malice role. So much so, that the humorous moments, whilst subtle and quirky often seem misplaced as if there should be slightly more, or slightly less to fit in with the films overall ethos. Is he taking it too serious or not?<br/><br/>Now aged fifty-nine, Washington seems to have found the action-hero mojo later in his career as Neeson did. And both, whilst Rambo-esqe killing professionals still lack the much needed catch-phrases after killing Â 'You have been equalized'- for example.<br/><br/>The finale of The Equalizer takes place B&Q style warehouse showdown. As the action galore highlight of the film, it fulfills any fantasies to kill someone with mere house-hold tools. But does a spectacular ending make up for the otherwise mediocre beginning and middle?<br/><br/>Based on the almost ninety episode series from the eighties, The Equalizer has already had a sequel confirmed before any general release - which whilst premature makes it Denzel's first-ever sequel to any of his films. With each of his latest movies racking in at least $20 million dollars on opening weekends alone, this is also a likely winner and quite possibly his first franchise?"

","Every minute of this action packed movie is amazing. This is the single best movie I have ever seen. All of the actors do great jobs at their roles from the villains to the side characters they all give convincing performances.

"dnolan714","10","5","17","3 October 2014"," Absolutely Denzel at his best !
","This movie takes you to a familiar area of the once Good Guy / Dark Past but kicks it up several notches. Denzel plays the part of an quiet gentleman, a little OCD but friendly. He has a heart, cares for people and really tries to encourage people around him while living a simple life. Then he gets "" P. O.'d "" when someone he cares about is harmed. The Dark Side comes out but with a hint of offering a peaceful resolution. The bad guys choose poorly and it's on. Now we see Denzel's capabilities which are similar to Jason Bourne, Aaron Cross, Taken, etc. You soon realize he is a former very well trained operator again, one with a heart. <br/><br/>The entire production, directing , acting , everything is top notch. Characters are developed very well and we see fine acting at it's best. Gore and violence, yes but definitely entertaining to the max.<br/><br/>It makes one wonder how many real people are out here that seem like just regular folks but have set aside a former life where they operated in dark places.

"IMDbommie","10","4","13","28 September 2014"," Fuqua's Best Work in Some Time
","I have an on-again/off-again relationship with Fuqua films. I've grown increasingly disenchanted with his post-""Training Day"" films, and I've been waiting for one to rekindle my interest. Despite really liking the TV spots/trailers for ""The Equalizer,"" I still had my reservations about seeing ""The Equalizer."" But I'm glad that I did, because it's the Fuqua film I've been waiting for.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS - Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, an ex- government/CIA agent (it's never explicitly specified what he did; only implied). Now living an ostensibly honest life in Boston, Massachusetts, he's been able to successfully distance himself from his past life all the while helping and assisting those who he is friends with. After getting to know a young aspiring singerâAlina (played by Moretz)âwho hangs out at a diner that McCall frequents, he realizes that she's involved with some shady people. McCall decides to help her next, but doing so not only makes him confront his past... it begins to unravel a thread that he may come to regret ever tugging in the first place.<br/><br/>REVIEW - Directing & Cinematography, 10/10: Surprisingly deft behind the camera, Fuqua shifts his directing style in ""The Equalizer,"" clearly taking inspiration from ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" director Zack Snyder at times. The film itself looks fantastic, each shot is crisp and sharp; Mauro Fiore worked with Fuqua on ""Training Day"" and ""Tears of the Sun,"" but also with Peter Berg on his film ""The Kingdom."" I may have had gripes with some of Fuqua's past few films, but I've always admired his cinematography, and this notion still holds with ""The Equalizer."" Fiore does a great job, as familiar Boston settings almost act as complimentary characters in each scene.<br/><br/>Writing, 9/10: I had watched this film a week after seeing Liam Neeson's kinda-sort-similar ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" which was a massive disappointment to me solely because the of the writing. I'm glad to say that ""The Equalizer"" doesn't suffer from this problem. Richard Wenk does a commendable job of introducing us to McCall and revealing his quirks to the audience. Every character in the film is flawedâeven McCallâyet Fuqua and Wenk are able to translate them to the screen with both delicacy and intrigue. I have only two gripes with the writing. First, as some other reviews have astutely noted, Moretz's character is unfortunately relegated to a massive supporting role. I found this to be an utter shame, as she portrayed Alina with such a tenderness and vulnerabilityâI was really disappointed that she had probably less than 10 minutes of screen time. My other writing- related issue stems from what I've dubbed ""End of Watch"" syndrome. For anyone who has seen David Ayer's film ""End of Watch,"" you'll know that, while a good movie, it's highly far-fetched simply because so much happens to the two protagonists in so little time. This happens a little bit in ""The Equalizer,"" as McCallâwho had apparently lived a 'normal' life since his retirement from the CIA up until the beginning of this filmâ suddenly has a string of nearly-unbelievable action-packed encounters in about a 48-hour span, none of which are actually related to each other! But I can suspend my disbelief; this is a film, after all, and that is the agreement we make as an audience. It was just a little TOO unbelievable, but hardly a deal-breaker. Although if extra- terrestrials some how wound up in the film, then that would be a different story!<br/><br/>Musical Score, 10/10: I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I contend that a fantastic soundtrack is one of the biggest assets any film can boast. Literally from the opening scene of ""The Equalizer,"" I knew that the film was in great hands musically. It wasn't until the credits that I realized why: they were able to nab the great Harry Gregson-Williams (the first two ""Narnia"" films and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" among many many others). Oddly enough, he's also scored a number of Denzel films: ""Man on Fire,"" ""Deja Vu,"" ""Pelham 123,"" ""Unstoppable."" For some films, the music is just 'there'; it's really nothing more than filler. But ""The Equalizer"" benefits greatly from Gregson-Williams' subtle touches: uplifting at times and dramatic when needed, the score for this film is one of the better ones I can remember for big Hollywood films this year, probably right behind Tyler Bates' work on ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS - Denzel is great as always, but I also want to give proper credit to Marton Csokas who plays the main antagonist. His chemistry with Denzel Washington is just a pleasure to witness. It's a shame he's always some twisted villain in the majority of his roles! <br/><br/>In the end, ""The Equalizer"" has something for everyone: attention- grabbing music, great characters, an aesthetically awesome look, fantastic acting, interesting story, and pulse-pounding action. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone, especially anyone who lives in the Boston area (it can be great fun to see landmarks and areas on film that you see every day). And another plus is that it's only in 2D so that you don't have to get suckered into the inflated 3D prices these days! To be honest, you don't really need to read a review about the film to know what it's about. It's Denzel being a badass. We've all seen this before, haven't we? Especially given that Denzel's done ""Man on Fire!"" But if you STILL have doubts, let me put it this way: I can think of a thousand things that would be a much bigger waste of $10, even if you end up not liking the film."

The plot has a few question marks, most of which are cleared up satisfactorily in the run of the film, but basically this flick has it all - action, action, action. I remember feeling just as excited when Bruce Willis and Danny Glover appeared in the first Die Hard. <br/><br/>The characters are well portrayed, the brutality is realistic and not utterly gratuitous, the empathy viewers feel is tangible.

"HelenMary","6","2","5","20 February 2017"," Denzel being brilliant - a very good film
","I remember seeing The Equaliser, the TV show, when I was young, staring Edward Woodward. This is the same, but totally different.<br/><br/>Denzel plays Robert ""Bob"" McCall, and we see him initially start his days in simplicity, in a mundane job, in a simple home, reading, not sleeping and enjoying quiet solitude and routine. The pace of the film can be described the same way. Quiet solitude and routine. Nothing happens loudly or quickly and you have to pay attention. Denzel is at his charming best. Think Training Day, think Safe House and Magnificent Seven with the charm of the Prince in Much Ado About Nothing.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua, Director, also working with Denzel on Training Day and Magnificent Seven, is flawless, seamless and deeply committed to a viewing experience that immerses the viewer. Often, more often than not, lighting is low in The Equalizer and little is said or explained. What happens in the dark, is salient but not narrated. This makes for a slow burning piece of great cinema; tension and pressure mount and you feel it. Like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as ""Baba Yaga"" - the bogeyman - Washington's dealings with Russian mob are equally devastating, accomplished and quiet.<br/><br/>Watching the film, you don't know who Robert McCall is, just the guy in the 24hour diner reading through the list of 100 books before you die (incidentally I'm shamefully only on 30), and making tentative friends with Alina or ""Teri,"" brilliantly played by Kick Ass star Chloe Grace Moretz, the young prostitute. You don't know who he is, but that is drip fed to you through the film. Unlike other heroes McCall doesn't do what he does for glory or recognition, he does it for justice and moral right. You don't hear Teri's story either, which is a blessing, but not having backstories and motivations narrated is a clever ploy for you to fill in your own blanks, or keep the pace quiet and slow. Moretz and Washington's friendship is lovely and believable. He is a trustworthy person, and like his unobtrusive violence, righting wrongs, you don't see sexual violence in this film either; the awful things Teri has to endure are not spelled out, which is a relief. Less is more. Martin Csokas, a good actor, but known for his hammy portrayal and terribly overdone Russian accent in XXX, was perfectly cast here. He too played it understated and deadly with the confidence or someone who has never been realistically challenged before, possibly drawing on his experience of playing Celeborn in LOTR ... quiet graceful and deadly! When I say unobtrusive violence, meaning you don't always see it, sometimes you do. This is not a film for under 15s by any stretch of the imagination. There's some very up close uses for common household items put to alternative use in the film. If you are a bit squeamish or sensitive, don't watch. That said, Fugua uses darkness and suggestion well even in these scenes. Everyone in the cast put in performances to be proud of, but Washington of course was the stand out. He truly is a phenomenal performer. Whatever he touches is golden, and I very much like seeing age and experience, and economy of violent movement, showing professionalism and realism over glamour and youth and showy unrealistic fight scenes any day. Especially with Denzel! Marton Csokas, known for his terrible Russian accent and hammy acting in XXX, is infinitely more formidable as a Russian mob fixer, here."

","Of course we have seen ""this film"" before. Except for a few unique film dramas, most of us like the familiar of new wine in old bottles. Recently Liam Neeson has turned the revenge flic into a minor cottage industry. And Charles Bronson did fine with Death Wish. Denzel Washington now gets a turn updating the old Edward Woodward TV series and he does a nice job. The bad guys are bad and unless you are a bad guy, you're going to cheer as this Robert McCall evens the score(s). No doubt we might like some additional back story, but I'm in no rush. I'm willing to wait for a second film for additional info. For this one, just sit back and watch this new Don Quixote tilt at Russian windmills. There are some nice performances here by Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, and for me newcomer Johnny Skourtis. And Marton Csokas plays the villain we use to hiss at during the Saturday Matinees. Let's hope we get at least a trilogy out of this run."

","You have to give it up for Denzel Washington. Liam Neeson has been the action hero of late (or so many will have you believe), but watching this, you know he isn't alone. I haven't seen John Wick yet, but apparently it's a fun ride too. There is drama in this too and it's still weird seeing Chloe Moritz in an adult role, but she's doing a good job with a small but important role.<br/><br/>Denzels characters might channel a bit of Charles Bronson, but he's making it with his own unique charisma and flavor. One thing is for sure, if you have a Death Wish, just get on the bad side of him and you are on. The action is more than decent, the flow of the movie is good (with time to take a breath or to, before the action/violence starts up again). A good example of an action movie with a heart ... and a punch"

","I am not a fan of violence in movies, especially when done to excess. This movie pushes past my normal limit for body count, but it is done is such a way, i.e., without much gore, that I did not find it gratuitous or off-putting. Additionally, Denzel Washington turns in another stellar performance as a man of violence (e.g., Training Day, among others) that the viewer does not mind the extreme willing suspension of disbelief that the director requires.<br/><br/>Mr. Washington's character has very little in the way of backstory although his motivation is readily apparent. I suspect that some explanatory scenes were cut from the final print since the movie runs long at over 2 hours. Also I find it difficult to believe that both Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, each leading actors in their own right, were cast as old friends of Mr. Washington's character with the original intention that they would have about 3 minutes of combined screen time. It seems that these characters would have been the time when the backstory would have been revealed.<br/><br/>While there is nothing really new in this movie that makes it a must-see, it is well-shot, action-packed, and, as stated above, well-acted thereby earning a viewing recommendation.<br/><br/>To see more of my other movie reviews, please visit:<br/><br/>https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com"
"pal05052003","8","2","5","3 February 2015"," A retired agent seeking to right the wrongs on the innocent has to face off with a ruthless henchman sent by the Russian mafia.
","Any action movie with Denzel Washington is good nowadays, but his one stands out. The tone and mood is grim and resembles that of the Bourne series. Even the background music reminds me of the Bourne series. However, it may hint of the Bourne series, it is definitely not a rip-off. Washington's McCall is a world-weary former agent who still hinted through the books he reads. Seeing a young girl (Chloe Moretz) brutalized by a crime boss, he ends up wreaking revenge and finally takes on the whole Russian mob. As a conflicted hero who has to choose between living a quiet life and accepting his roots as a killer, Washington is perfect for the role. His ruggedness, and charisma makes him believable as both a nice guy who can kill. Chloe Moretz, once again, reminds us how talented she is. In all her roles, she is a totally different personality. I even forgot that she used to be Hit Girl in Kick Ass, or Carrie White. Moretz's performance as a hooker with child-like innocence is enough to make anyone feel like wanting to help. Thus, it is easy to believe why Washington's character spurred to action. As for another great performance in the movie, Marton Csokas plays the henchman out to get Washington's McCall. Csokas is the perfect foil. He is intelligent, and charismatic, but is ruthless and amoral. He shines in this movie. In fact, he is much scarier than when he played a Treadstone assassin in the Bourne Supremacy, and that says a lot. Another great thing about the movie is the soundtrack. It fits the narrative and tone perfectly. All in all, a great action thriller to enjoy."

","The equalizer is a very violent film but surprisingly humorous at times for example: when densely asks to see the guy's gun and looks away then just takes it from him. In the warehouse when he sets all the traps, its like home alone and you expect one of the bad guys to get hit in the face with and iron, or a blowtorch but the bad guys didn't fall for that one. You see that the main character can heal himself temporarily but very quickly, and still appears to be helping people at the end of the film, which leaves it widely open for a sequel. I think it's very creative and well produced and look forward for and possible sequel. Good Film!!!!"

","Watching the end scene I thought how a man of color became a black Rambo and Denzel is just that in this movie. No hesitation accepting he had the skills much like the white Rambo in Taken. Men like Rambo movie no matter how they are the same picture painted with different colors. So what? This is a movie and nothing more. You have to suspend thought because it meets a visceral need to have power and control. It is as old as the day...to see justice in this lifetime.<br/><br/>This movie like many others portray evil and the wicked heart of man, and in this sense, the movie was factual and accurate. This evil really happens. There is gospel in here if you look closely. Justice must be forthcoming or life is absurd. No, worse, life also then is evil if evil wins.<br/><br/>In the end, it is instant gratification, and for men, these movies are essential because The Equalizer gets justice done so we don't have to in our own world. That's the gut or reptilian effect.<br/><br/>On a pure acting note, another example of how character actors are the best and the dude you might meet at Home Depot or Lowes shopping probably has more acting chops that most A-list personalities. Take note Mr Willis next time generosity is called for. Support your local theater! Better yet, to the 5% who make the 95% of the money, just buy the theater and let upcoming talent do their thing."

","Being a fan of Denzel Washington and action movies, I was very thrilled to see this movie but I was a bit disappointed after seeing the movie. It was no different than any other superhero movie except that our hero had no uniform this time. And without any special powers it seemed too far-fetched. Mr. McCall, here, is a one man army who managed to wipe out the entire Russian Mafia without using any hi-tech gadgets or weapons...Shame on you Batman, Ironman!!!! No doubt Denzel is a great actor and he and Antoine Fuqua worked pretty good in Training Day but I expected more from this one. Overall the action and fight sequences in the film are OK...McCall being a quiet person with great combat skill ...it sure does reminds you of Liam Neeson(Taken) and Jason Bourne(The Bourne series)...but they too cant hold a candle to him when it comes to taking out the entire mafia outfit... Who says you need a game plan to take out the mafia head....you just walk into his mansion, kill everyone and just walk out...What a joke... Taking him out was much easier than killing his best soldier... Disappointed..."

","Without Denzel Washington, the ""save the girl from the mob plot,"" frankly, would have been too much ""dejavu."" However, Denzel's charisma and ability to direct the viewers thoughts away from the plot & on to him saves the day!I thought it could of had a slice more of action in it. But, again, Denzel's knack for capturing your every thought on to what his next move is, keeps us in enough suspense to drown out the non-suspenseful foreknowledge of the plots next move. Director: Antoine Fuqua, does an excellent job of giving us just enough Denzel, to keep us wanting more...during the movie and after the movie is over. Besides, who can tire of Marton Csokas bad guy routine? He's always laid back & cool...creating the impression that he has more layers of ruthlessness then he really does. And last but not least, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz succeeds in making us all love hookers. I gave this movie a 6 for Denzel...the plot leaves more to be desired!"

Brilliant notes by Harry Gregson-Williams that wouldn't let you lose focus. The movie literally runs on Harry's brilliance. He uplifts even bleak scenes and makes them super rad. I was swaying even before the flick started.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua's direction is breathtaking. Every frame has a story to tell and he masters it superbly. Denzel is mesmerizing. The fact it was a Denzel movie itself was reason enough for me to watch this film. His face has this gravity that he pulls off so brilliantly, that only a few could nail. As Chloe puts it perfectly ""Your eyes are not sad. They are just lost.""<br/><br/>The movie breathes on gore. Super cool scenes of amazing kills, bullet time and Denzel's sixth sense perception are absolutely thrilling to watch. The screenplay simply trickles down with thoughtful words.<br/><br/>The most badass scene in the movie is when #Robert meets #Teddy. Time stops by when they have ""the conversation"". <br/><br/>If we want an agent or a merc, we want him to be like Robert McCall. Learn something John Wick!"

He plays this shrewd man called Robert McGall who stays away from what he does best until a day arrives when he comes across a situation which forces him to expose his ""other"" side. And then all hell breaks loose. And thereafter, the movie's entertainment quotient increases by leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington exudes this chic persona in almost every movie starring him. He does the same for this movie and the result is for you to see. And the bad guys are just as awesome. The man who plays their head seems to be the perfect fit for a heartless villain, ready to pounce on his adversary at the first given opportunity.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua is a lovely director. He had directed Denzel in the super-awesome "" Training Day "" and their second collaboration has done wonders again. The city of Boston has been shown in all its grandeur. Buy yourself a plate of nachos and sit back and enjoy watching Denzel wreak havoc. I'm sure you are gonna love this movie."
"AaronCooper-nh1","6","2","5","14 November 2014"," This was an action movie
","I went to the movies to see an action film and I got what I payed for, however I will say that the beginning of the movie was painfully slow, watching Denzel Washington read in his empty apartment is not my idea of a good time. However once the movie gets to Denzel Washington beating the crap out of Russians the quality of your experience goes up. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be subtle comedy or it's a Russian style, but the mustache on one of the goons in the movie was just ridiculous, so much that I laughed aloud. The movie definitely could have gone without it. Anyways I was not taken by Chloe- grace's performance as a Russian prostitute, it would have been better casted by someone who looked more mature, like scarlet johansson. I mean watching Chloe-grace in kick ass as a borderline kid and then watching her as a hooker, was too hard to believe. However if you are into action the second half of this movie is for you."
"misscalv","4","2","5","1 November 2014"," Way too much action
","The movie starts kinda slow, with Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) doing his daily routine. It is sort of essential for the movie to show how he lives now appose to how he lived before (and will live later), so I get it, but I still think they should have cut some of it but okay. And then the action starts when the store he works in gets robbed and Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) gets beaten up by the Russians. And the first fight sequence happens, and it's epic when he kills all the Russians and in that moment the movie is awesome.<br/><br/>But then it just goes downhill from there. You kinda get to know more about who he was before but not really, and you don't get to see Teri before the end of the movie again. So basically the rest of the movie is just him killing people to get revenge and stay alive, and it gets old, really fast. This movie just has too much action and are lacking a solid story, and that's why it really bored me and the only reason I give it a 4 and not a 2, is because I think the movie had some great actors. If the sequel does happen I really hope there is less action but i doubt it because of how this one ended, so I'll probably wont go see it."
"archiecm","7","2","5","26 October 2014"," Home Depot denouement not up to rest of scenes
","I never saw or even heard of the TV series upon which this film was based. I enjoy revenge pictures with super efficient warriors like Liam Neeson in Taken and also Man on Fire with Denzel Washington. And most of the killing of bad guys lives up to that level in this film. But when McCall finds his way to the Home Depot and the hostages he has all the advantages: he knows where the tools are, the lights, the best hiding places . . . everything. He should be able to surprise the bad guys easily one by one. In fact isn't it a little out of character for Teddy, the efficient Russian henchman, to continue his pursuit of McCall given that he's totally in enemy territory? A wise adversary would cut his losses I'm thinking. . . wait and fight another day. But McCall makes uncharacteristic blunders as well. Killing a guy with a drill bit is one of them. Even though he heated the bit ahead of time, the fact that it succeeds in the movie is pure fantasy. A drill bit isn't sharp enough to penetrate a skull at least not on the theory of it's effectiveness in drilling into wood. It is a slow cutting device that peels away in thin layers. To actually kill someone who isn't tied down you'd have to slam it into the back of the head with incredible force. Using it like that would be an iffy proposition because of balance and the amount of force needed. The fact that it isn't very sharp would work against you. (And anyway, that's not how it's used here. In the film the victim politely holds still while the drill slowly progresses into the brain, but we don't actually see that.) But a bigger blunder is to get into hand to hand combat with an enemy while other foes are within yards of your position. McCall does just this against the thug with all the mustache wax. They fight for a full minute. I don't remember what weapon McCall tried to use on Waxie but he had ample opportunity to pick up guns from earlier skirmishes and should have used one on him. (Even a sludge hammer would have worked.) Instead they tussle for a full minute or more which would have brought Teddy to the scene in time to win the day. But we're supposed to believe that the store is so big and the other thugs were so far off that they couldn't arrive in time. A full minute? Come on! Up until then I was enjoying the efficiency and coolness of McCall's successes. He was quick and always outsmarted them. And he seemed to be very studious in paying attention to detail and the laws of physics as he contemplated his moves. I liked the closeups of his eyes as they seemed to weigh just how quick he had to be and how accurate. Good stuff. I wish he'd kept that up all the way through."

","The premise to the story isn't anything new. Ex CIA military whatever operative trying to live a normal life but gets dragged back through the mud. Fortunately this movie has Denzel Washington. Super charismatic on screen, likable character, but at the same time looking like an average guy (no The Rock biceps). Unfortunately the premise to this movie isn't anything new. Protagonist is able to rig Home Alone style booby traps within minutes, survive situations that no real person would be able to survive, situations unfold in the exact way needed for maximum carnage. It's a movie to watch with friends on a Friday night when you can seriously suspend disbelief. It exists halfway between the all out action of a Bruce Willis Die Hard film and a Liam Neeson ""I will find you and I will kill you"" Taken.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Zack Hemsey - ""Vengeance"" is an absolute gem of a track that pops up in the climactic action sequence. Disappointed it wasn't played in the end credits. Instead we were given some gratuitous Eminem rap song."
"knights_01","7","2","5","13 October 2014"," Denzel delivers the goods
","Denzel Washington delivers as ex CIA operative Robert McCall who routinely goes about his business in downtown Boston - with a little OCD thrown in for good measure. Robert promised his recently deceased wife that he would move on from his former life and that was all going well until he befriends Teri/Alina (a very underused Chloe Moretz) who is on the receiving end of some harsh treatment from her Russian pimp. <br/><br/>Now this is an action movie - it isn't pretending to be anything else - so don't go in expecting some deep and meaningful character development scenarios. This is Denzel handing out justice in his own way, as Robert McCall decides to help Chloe out by taking out the local Russian Mafia (after trying to buy Alina's freedom). This doesn't sit well with the Russians and soon Teddy (Marton Csokas) arrives to try to figure out what went wrong.<br/><br/>From this point in your belief needs to be subdued a bit as Robert appears to always be one step ahead of Teddy and his band of local goons - including the clichÃ©d 'dirty cops'. Even though the movie has a number of action checkpoints we the viewer need to pass (show me an action movie that doesn't) I found myself buckled in for the ride.<br/><br/>What I think could hurt this movie is the fact that Denzel is teaming up with 'Training Day' director Antoine Fuqua - and we all know that was a successful partnership back in 2001. My advice - be prepared to suspend a little bit of belief and just sit back and enjoy the ride and who knows maybe Robert might be back to help someone else."

When you have 3 machine guns laying there for you to shoot the bad guys with, what would you do? Nope! He uses tools and supplies from the Home Depot shelves to do battle with.

","'THE EQUALIZER': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua team up again, for the first time since 'TRAINING DAY' (13 years ago), for this feature film adaptation of the popular 80s TV series (of the same name). Washington plays a former government agent, named Robert McCall (the role was originated by Edward Woodward), who comes out of retirement to help those in need of his special skills; in this film it's a young prostitute, who's been beaten by the Russian mobsters she works for. It costars Chloe Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, David Harbour, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo. It was written by Richard Wenk and based on the TV series created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. If you like 80s exploitation action flicks you'll love this movie! <br/><br/>Robert McCall (Washington) was a very lethal, and expertly skilled, black ops operative; who worked for an unnamed government agency. He's now retired and trying to live a peaceful life, while working at a hardware store, in Boston Massachusetts. When a young call girl he knows, named Teri (Moretz), gets into trouble with the Russian gangsters she works for, McCall feels compelled to come out of retirement and help her. He becomes a one-man killing machine once again! <br/><br/>The film is a lot more violent than I was anticipating. It's gratuitously violent; like the beloved 80s action flicks that used to glamorize excessive blood and gore (there's many scenes of Denzel using various tools, from his store, to brutally murder bad guys). If you don't have a problem with that, and enjoy movies full of it, you'll love this movie. I enjoyed it quite a bit but I used to like this type of movie, a lot. Denzel is great in the film and Fuqua does some awesome stylized directing; but it is all action and no substance.

","Denzel Washington has done pretty good quality movies before. This is definitely not one of those. It is a normal action movie with a weak story line. It has some good scenes, but the justifications for the story were missing. Denzel never failed to deliver 100% in any of the scenes. But that was not enough to make this movie great. Other characters in the movie didn't have much role to play as this was a 'one man show'. The bad guy's introduction was good and his role lost the pace later. Very little effort was made to make the viewers believe why someone would go to such an extent to play GOD. Could have used a little more humor to keep the audience entertained. Denzel's fans can watch it without getting bored, others watch in when the DVD comes :)"

","Denzel Washington films are starting to look like each other. I somehow could predict most of this film in advance. Plus it lasted a little bit too long. Since in the Cinema City they charge more for longer films I had to pay 1KM more for this one. That is not a kilometer or klick but rather konvertible mark, local currency.<br/><br/>Well, since it lasted a little bit longer then usual I focused on many neat details in the film. Like the book he was reading, I read it when I was a teenager. Old man and the sea. Other cool details prevail like drilling a brain with a driller or the tattoos of the bad guys.<br/><br/>All in all if you like D.W. (not Deutche Welle), and good action, this is a film for you.

","I may be just giddy about this movie because I just saw it and I'm already thinking about when I'll see it again. OK, so the mere fact that Denzel Washington was in the movie was enough to get me to see it. Is he a good actor? Yes, he's great. But it's not only that he's a great actor, he chooses excellent films. He has an uncanny knack to choose perfect roles OR he's just that good that he makes the movies better.<br/><br/>I went into this movie thinking ""Man on Fire"", another Denzel action movie that I loved. Well, if you want a true reference for this movie, think Man on Fire, Bourne Identity and R.E.D. but better.<br/><br/>The acting was great, both from the protagonist and the antagonist. Not that the acting had to be that great because this was an action movie after all, but it's always better when the actors give a good performance. The directing and cinematography was wonderful too. The director, Antoine Fuqua, who also directed Training Day, masterfully worked the action scenes with well timed slow motion and soundless shots. Even the musical score for the climax was enough to draw you in.<br/><br/>The entire movie boils down to Denzel Washington playing Robert McCall, a retired agent that has incredible skills. He played the quintessential hit man/assassin.<br/><br/>Intelligent. Check.<br/><br/>Creative. Check.<br/><br/>Skillful. Check.<br/><br/>Ruthless. Check.<br/><br/>Ice in his veins. Double Check.<br/><br/>Robert McCall was so sure of himself it bordered on arrogance. He was so ingenious it bordered on savant. He was so tactically cold and calculating it bordered on robotic. He was so altruistic it bordered on saintly. To be honest, he was a character that I'd abhor in another type of role just because of how pristine he was, but I admired him in this role. Everyone loves the helper to the oppressed and voiceless.<br/><br/>In summary: I loved the story; the build up, the climax and the ending. I loved the players, both the good and the bad. I just plain loved the movie. Throughout the movie I was demonstratively trying to hold back oohs, aahs, yips, yaps and claps. It's been a long time since I wanted to applaud after every action scene. My favorite Denzel action flick."

","This picture looks like it is a well-made over the top revenge film, but it is more in the line of a setting things right for the other characters type of story. It looks like this film was based on the TV show of the same name that was released in the '80s. According to IMDb the TV creator got a movie credit. The action and violence in this picture is highly realistic and often brutal. Robert McCall is not the type of guy to go in locked and loaded and blaze away. He is more like to pick up weapons off his targets and make do with what they have lying around like corkscrews or even a shot glass. He is pretty much deadly with anything. I was reminded of Man on Fire (2004) when I was watching this, another Denzel film with a pretty and young, white girl in trouble with the same determination from the protagonist. Still I recommend ""The Equalizer"". The story continually builds upon itself slowly revealing the larger scope of our hero's world and the director was very mindful of his spaces and was careful where objects were placed and shown. I was pleasantly surprised to keep finding things slide into place in front of the camera. But the love of battle was not neglected. The fight scenes used elaborate setups in editing where extreme close ups of the protagonist's eye would show a reflection of the room, mixed in with half a dozen of cutaway shots this was graphically brilliant in its imagination and ever so off-putting in its gory nature."

This movie will either lead to more sequels, and/or updated TV series.<br/><br/>If you're looking for great action with a rich flavoring of character interest, this movie is for you. However there is an element of this character that somewhat reminds me of Denzel's John Creasy in ""Man On Fire"" (lots of body bags needed here).<br/><br/>This was one of the very few films that I can say that I enjoyed every minute of. What I also really liked was the fact that McCall was involved in helping several people in this film in addition to Chloe Moretz's character. <br/><br/>Denzel was in stellar form, and I hope he can continue with this franchise should it remain on the big screen."

There were some other cameos from Chloe moretz however Denzel played his role with a sense of class and dictated authority on the screen, a truly magnificent performance from a stalwart of Hollywood . The only downside was that some of the action scenes were not dealt with thoroughly and some were skipped over.

It's a smart character that has a routine every day and throughout the movie you learn more about his back story and why he is the way that he is. It's a simple plot really as a young girl he becomes accustomed to gets beaten up pretty bad. He decides to make the people pay. Only problem is its the Russian mafia.<br/><br/>The final action scene in a very large hardware store is fantastic and clever. It's about 20 minutes long and the kills are brilliant and original. There is one last shot that is a bit clichÃ© but I'm OK with that. I had high expectation and I liked it enough to give it a solid 8/10."

","Denzel Washington nails the character, at least the character that was written in the screenplay, which is not the Equalizer from the TV series. He is more of a superhero in the movie franchise and you have no doubts that he will outlive all who oppose him. The suspense comes in to play, more with his friends and acquaintances and the viewer is led to worry about their survival, while expecting Denzel's character to kick a_s without fail. The cinematography is dark and the editing is tight, with little doubt as to what is going to happen, just uncertainty as to how it will happen. The Equalizer can use anything at hand as a deadly weapon. This is entertaining and if there is a sequel, it will make money. The depiction of the protagonist as a reluctant hero is ludicrous, considering his lame retirement job and the pleasure, almost joy, that he gets out of killing. Not for intellectuals but good entertainment for action fans."

","Robert McCall leads a solitary life. Apparently subject to OCD, and certainly subject to insomnia, he spends his days working at a hardware store and the early hours reading classics in his local diner, where he exchanges friendly but inconsequential banter with a young hooker. When she is hospitalised by her brutal pimp, McCall decides that he can't sit and do nothing, at which point it becomes clear that there is some juicy detail in his backstory which we are not privy to. And neither are the Russian mafia, into whose territory he has strayed.<br/><br/>This 2014 film revisitation of a TV series starring Edward Woodward is, perhaps, somewhat overdue, as the premise â a lonely vigilante fighting on behalf of the underdog â is always a favourite. And, like Liam Neeson's Bryan Mills in Taken, Robert McCall is that most satisfying of movie characters, someone fighting on the side of good who is both willing to, and very good at, using the non-gentlemanly tactics that the baddies use.<br/><br/>McCall is a character full of contradictions and illogicalities, but he is so well drawn and well played by Washington, that all the illogicalities make sense by the end of the film. Washington is aided by very good performances from the rest of the case. Chloe Moretz' underage hooker adds another worthwhile entry to her CV, and it is particularly good to see Marton Czokas, after years of first class but unremarkable support playing, getting to play a truly memorable primary character in the part of mob enforcer ""Teddy."" This film doesn't have much depth, but it is a solidly entertaining and well-made crowd-pleaser."
"invernessmovieclub","8","3","10","1 October 2014"," Righteous Vengeance!
","The Equalizer is a loose remake of a TV show from the 1980's that starred the late Edward Woodward. It ran for 88 episodes and the lead played Robert McCall, an ex-special forces agent, turned private detective who assisted those in peril. Following the success of films such as Taken, The Expendables amongst others, Hollywood has discovered a market for the ageing action hero and therefore it was only a matter of time before a big screen adaption of The Equalizer was greenlit. The result is a satisfying and often brutal revenge action thriller. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington likewise plays kind hearted widower Robert McCall, known as either Bob or Mr McCall to his colleagues who, by day works in a Home Depot type outlet and by night lives a quiet life reading books whilst sipping tea at a local diner into the early hours of the morning. He befriends a young prostitute Teri (Chloe Grace-Moretz), who also regularly frequents the diner, and witnesses her Russian pimp strike her after she arrives late to a client. Soon after she is hospitalised and McCall's conscience tells him that he must take the matter into his own hands. After swiftly taking out the pimp and his four colleagues in 28 brutal but gloriously choreographed seconds, McCall is advised that he has taken down the east hub of the Russian Mafia. <br/><br/>When word reaches Mob boss Pushkin of McCall's vigilantism, he sends highly trained 'Teddy' (played excellently by Kiwi actor Marton Csokas) to find and kill McCall and with half of the Boston police department on the payroll, it's just a matter of time before McCall is found. But, of course, McCall possesses a particular set of skills and the past that he has tried so hard to leave behind has trained him for such an occasion. <br/><br/>Although the plot is nothing new, the tension builds well and the action is handled superbly by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen). There is a number of loud and full on action set pieces but also several quieter scenes which are as equally as gripping. Denzel Washington is as cool as ice and as good as ever and is easily one of the most consistent and reliable actors working in Hollywood â can you believe he is almost 60? Age is definitely not a barrier here. <br/><br/>The Equalizer is one of more surprising films of 2014. The gritty tone and occasional splattering of blood set this apart from most of the ""toned down"" action films from the last few years. Whilst it's not perfect, it has everything a modern action film fan could ask for and if you like your movies with a bit of righteous vengeance then look no further."
"alindsay-al","8","3","10","1 October 2014"," A great action film that shows Denzel Washington can still be a huge action star
","With Denzel Washington getting older it could be argued that this would have been a problem for his action career but I must say he is in great condition and I want to see more films with Denzel in roles like this. This film sees Robert McCall a man who gave up a life of action to be a normal human being thrust into action when he feels he must help a young girl from Russian mobsters. Now this is a fantastic performance by Denzel as he totally owns this character, he is the nicest person in the world but he is great when having to turn it completely to that dark side of his character. This film is his and he owns it with his common man action star persona really working for this film. I do believe that the supporting cast is a bit light on detailed characters, this is evident by Chloe grace moretz performance. I think this is completely different to everything she has done and she does it really well, however, she isn't in the film a lot and I do believe that she was underutilised. One thing I did like in this film is that they had a clear villain who they put against McCall and the guy they got to play Teddy did a good job in the role. However, like a lot of action films these days it does lack some other detailed supporting characters which is a bit of a disappointment for this film as I believe it had the potential to have more in depth side characters. The story is a mixed bag, I like the character of McCall and his reasoning for doing certain things and the reasoning behind things seems realistic. But the slower scenes do drag a little bit and towards the end of the film you do wonder why he is still doing what he is doing. The script is great McCall is exactly as I would have wanted him to be and that is what really is the driving force for this film. The style of this film is also really cool there are some people who say it is to artistic but I don't buy that at all. The director Antoine Fuqua really did a good job of coming up with creative kills as well which is great for the audience. This film is going to get some comparisons to Taken, but I think this is a bit of a slower film and more of a realistic thriller and I do like both but I think comparing this film to Taken is a bit harsh. Overall this is a great film and one that if your a fan of thriller action films you should definitely see."
"zardoz-13","8","3","10","29 September 2014"," Denzel Delivers!!!
","Although he neither dons a mask nor fires silver bullets, Denzel Washington does virtually everything else that The Lone Ranger would in the Columbia Pictures' big-screen adaptation of the vintage television crime series ""The Equalizer."" For the record, CBS-TV aired 88 episodes of ""The Equalizer"" between 1985 and 1989. Acclaimed British actor Edward Woodward of ""Becket"" fame toplined this hour-long dramatic series as Robert McCall, a Good Samaritan vigilante who strode the mean streets of New York City. As a former operative with an enigmatic government espionage agency, McCall applied his skills both as a sleuth and a shadow to help desperate people who could turn to nobody else in their hour of hardship. Bespectacled, sophisticated, and erudite, McCall relied on his brains more often than his brawn. Nevertheless, he could surprise his adversaries with swift, physical action when required. Best of all, McCall never charged his woebegone clients a cent for his services. <br/><br/>Now, a quarter of a century later, ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua and ""Expendables 2"" scenarist Robert Wenk have appropriated only the character's name and the show's basic premise. Nevertheless, ""The Equalizer"" is a pretty exciting saga. Unlike Woodward's McCall, who was a widower with a son, Washington's McCall is a widower who works at a Home Depot sort of emporium. In adapting the series, Fuqua and Wenk have fashioned an above-average, suspenseful, but wholly outlandish crime thriller that takes McCall back to square one after he left 'the Agency' under mysterious circumstances, but before he established his altruistic private eye business. As much as I loved the television series, I think Fuqua and Wenk have done a splendid job of reshaping it to accommodate two-time Oscar winning actor Denzel Washington, who played reasonably similar characters in both ""Man on Fire"" and ""Safe House."" <br/><br/>After a car bomb nearly claimed his life while working for an inscrutable government outfit, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington ) has retired to the relative obscurity of Boston, Massachusetts. Everybody knows him now as a jovial, hard-working, mega Home Mart store employee. McCall prefers to immerse himself in a good novel at a nearby diner that artist Edward Hopper could easily have immortalized on canvas. Indeed, the quiet and unobtrusive McCall lives a simple life without anybody to clutter it up, until he befriends a naive, 16-year hooker, Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), who hangs out at the same diner when he reads. Teri is not a conventional hooker, but prostitute who works for the local Russian mafia. Eventually, she offends these brutal dastards that possess all the subtlety of grizzly bears, gets badly beaten up, and lands in the local hospital. McCall is swift to retaliate. He dispatches five tough guys as easily as if he were stomping cockroaches. Typically, before he goes into action, our hero sets the stop watch and then checks it afterward. When he isn't intervening on Terri's behalf, McCall helps an obese Hispanic coworker, Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), achieve his dream of becoming a security guard. Poor Ralphie eats all the wrong foods and lacks discipline until McCall coaches him and transforms the affable oaf. When Ralphie has to quit his Home Mart job to help out his mother (newcomer Luz Sanchez), who is being preyed on at her restaurant by corrupt Boston cops, McCall not only helps them clean up their store but also straightens out the dirty detectives who were extorting cash from her as well as other business owners. <br/><br/>Naturally, since Fuqua and Wenk want us to feel sympathetic toward McCall, they pit him against the most psychopathic mob enforcer on the planet. Teddy (Marton Csokas) appears to be a fastidious, dapper, and inoffensive fellow who utters each syllable of each word with hopelessly precise clarity. When he arrives in Boston, the local corrupt cops treat him as if he were a sissy. It doesn't take them long to learn that he is far from effeminate. Teddy behaves like an efficiency expert as he launches his investigation to see who had the audacity to kill five members of his mob. Boston detective Masters (David Harbour of ""The Green Hornet"") escorts him to a rendezvous with the local Irish mob boss, Little John Looney (Shawn Fitzgibbon of ""Mystic River""), who displays nothing but contempt for the Russians. By the time, Teddy has smashed Little John to a bloody pulp, Masters has had to gun down both of Looney's heavily-armed henchmen. Teddy scrutinizes anybody who entered the bar where the five Russian gangsters died and kills at least one person who lies to him about the people involved in the incident. Eventually, he figures out by studying surveillance camera footage that Robert McCall is the most likely suspect. As ruthlessly murderous as he is, Teddy isn't prepared to tangle with a man like McCall who is far more merciless.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to action thrillers. His credits include ""The Replacement Killers,"" ""Bait,"" ""Shooter,"" ""Tears of the Sun,"" ""Training Day,"" ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen."" He stages with style to spare each combat sequence, and he must have relished Guy Richie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies because he imitates the way that Sherlock inventoried his adversaries when McCall appraises the Russian mobsters. Some of McCall's weapons, including the power drill and the nail-gun, have been used before in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" and ""The Driller Killer."" Rated R for strong bloody violence and language, including some sexual references, ""The Equalizer"" isn't as gory as it could have been. Nevertheless, Fuqua delivers several memorable action scenes, and Washington is so charismatic you will stand up and cheer as he whittles down the villains. Marton Coskas qualifies as a truly creepy villain, too. Clocking in at 132 minutes, ""The Equalizer"" takes its time, leisurely building up to its bullet-riddled, Tarantino-style climax. By the time he has exacted vengeance on these homicidal fiends, McCall emerges as a larger-than-life power who could scare the Grim Reaper."

","Taking the 1980s' TV series of the same name as its inspiration, this vigilante thriller contains all the excitement, action and grittiness that audiences would naturally expect but also adds top-class cinematography, a terrific performance by Denzel Washington and a higher level of character development than is generally seen in movies of this type. The end-result is a thoroughly entertaining story of revenge that's well-paced and features an interesting action hero who's highly-skilled, haunted by his past and more intelligent than average.<br/><br/>Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a quiet, unassuming man who works at a home improvement warehouse where he carries out his duties conscientiously and is well-liked by his colleagues who appreciate his politeness, good humour and caring nature. He's meticulous in everything he does and adheres strictly to an unchanging daily routine that always ends with a visit to his local all-night diner where he likes to snack and read books.<br/><br/>It's at this diner that he meets and befriends Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young prostitute who works (under the name of Teri) for a Russian pimp called Slavi (David Meunier) and has ambitions to be a singer. When she ends up in hospital one night, so brutally beaten that it's uncertain whether or not she'll survive, McCall takes matters into his own hands and visits the pimp at his restaurant and offers to pay $9,800 to buy Alina's freedom. Slavi treats this offer with absolute contempt and McCall, displaying exceptional close combat skills, responds by killing the pimp and his four associates with remarkable speed and efficiency. Russian mob boss Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) presumes that his men have been attacked by rival gangsters and so sends his top enforcer, Teddy Rensen (Marton Csokas) to investigate and deal with the problem.<br/><br/>Rensen's efficiency is immediately apparent and after he identifies McCall as being responsible for the killings, the two men become involved in a cat-and-mouse game that ends in a violent confrontation at the warehouse where McCall works and where he also shows considerable ingenuity in dealing with Rensen and the other gang-members who'd come there to kill him. McCall then goes on to deal with the threat that he knows Pushkin will continue to provide unless he's dealt with promptly.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington brings immense dignity and presence to his portrayal of a man whose disciplined routine and personal qualities immediately hint at someone who may have had a military background, even before his skill in dealing with Slavi and his gang is seen. It transpires that he'd actually been a CIA operative who, after experiencing some traumatic event, had escaped from the job by faking his own death and keeping a low profile by living in his current modest lifestyle. His insomnia is a legacy of the trauma he'd experienced and the emptiness that, as a widower, is constantly with him.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" is a movie that looks absolutely marvellous with most of the action taking place in dark locations that accentuate the downbeat mood of the piece as well as providing the opportunity to create some striking images such as those in which lights are reflected on rainy surfaces or where exquisitely-lit drops of water are seen running down McCall's head in slow motion. Fans of Edward Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" (1942) will also immediately recognise the inspiration for the design of McCall's favourite diner. This is also a movie that's very well-made, efficiently directed and cleverly paced to accommodate its considerable amount of character development without ever detracting from the impact of its action sequences."

"davideo-2","10","2","6","19 July 2015"," The greatest action film in a very long time
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was an ex CIA operative with a lethal set of skills, who quietly left the agency and settled in to a quiet life working for a Home Department store. But when he strikes up a friendship with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young girl aspiring to be a musician, but entrapped to some vicious gangsters, he finds himself forced to employ the skills from his past life once again, setting him on a collision course with Teddy (Marton Csokas), the gangster's brutally efficient enforcer.<br/><br/>Adapting an old TV show from the '60s seems to be the norm these days, which on the surface doesn't offer much in the way of surprise or even excitement in The Equalizer's way. But left in the right hands for a change, everything's come off a treat, and the result is a solid, effective action adventure, that evokes great memories from the good old days when action was at it's height.<br/><br/>Over ten years after Training Day, Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua have re-united and re-created that hard-hitting, superb magic once again, only this time with Washington in the hero role. And how finely he fits it, too, perfectly fitting the character and suiting his physical requirements down to a tee. He is matched by Csokas as the bad guy, the best in a long while, eerily menacing, methodical and suddenly shocking with his unassuming moments of enraged violence. Unlike many modern directors, Fuqua is not brash, and allows his story to take it's time and progress at it's own pace, with a proper beginning, middle and end, stretching at over two hours, but never weary or dull, and culminating with one of the best action sequences in a long while, with a Home Department store being turned in to a battleground, with a selection of DIY equipment not really being used for their intended purpose.<br/><br/>The names involved should have got my senses buzzing more than they already did, but thankfully I was not disappointed. This is just the best action film in years, brutally violent, intelligently written, well directed and polished with a slick veneer. It's good that it's taken so long to getting round to writing the review, as it's given me more time to rave about it as much as I should, and give it the justice it deserves. *****"
"jtindahouse","9","2","6","24 December 2014"," One of the best vigilante movies I've seen
","How could anyone not like a vigilante movie? It's surprising to me Hollywood doesn't make more of them considering they always seem to be well liked and successful. Plus the formula is simple enough to create. Then you simply find the right actor and boom! Box office success. The first vigilante movie that comes to mind for most people I'd imagine would be 'Die Hard'. Then for the younger generation I'd imagine it to be 'Taken' (and possibly a few of the older generation because it was pretty good. And now I'm telling you once enough people have seen 'The Equalizer' it'll be right up there amongst the other big guns because it is very very good.<br/><br/>The most important ingredient of all to the vigilante genre has to be the star. Bruce Willis was perfect in his role, Liam Neeson was even better in his role and now here we have Denzel Washington, one of the coolest actors in Hollywood. For an old man (he's 60) he absolutely nailed it. First of all you'd never guess he was 60, I believe he worked out very hard for the role. Secondly it's his demeanor throughout that defines the character. He's so in control, so calm and collected that never once do we feel he could be in the slightest bit of danger from these ragtag Russian gangsters.<br/><br/>And unfortunately therein lies probably the only downfall in 'The Equalizer'. Perhaps he's simply too in the control the entire time. It makes for a lot of fun no doubt about it, but somewhere in those 2 hours and 10 minutes you have to have your hero in a precarious position where it seems all is lost only for him to miraculously escape. There's a scene where you could argue that was the case but I don't think it was enough. That's the only criticism though I could find in this very fine film."
"professorofsandseology","9","2","6","4 November 2014"," He's coming out of retirement
","Fast paced action, sweet close-up slow motion shots, and a terrific story make The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington a must see for any action or drama movie lover. Unlike some action movies that tend to lean on long intense gun fights or action sequences to make up for a lack in story, The Equalizer has an amazing story to accompany the awesome action sequences viewers will undoubtedly take away from this movie. Another thing this film does well in is taking its time to explain the plot and each character. It doesn't skimp on any part of the story, especially the characters. The Equalizer explains in detail each main character and some of the sub-main characters and how they fit into the movie. By the end of the movie, if you pay attention, you can pick out each character and tell what their role is in the movie, even if the names are a little hard to pronounce. The story flows throughout the whole movie and never leaves you bored and looking for the exit of the theater. It will make you feel connected to the characters, even some of the minor ones. The Equalizer is great at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Camera work is a big part of why I gave this movie a 9/10. The camera will get close-up during certain scenes and gives a perfect sense of symbolism. It makes great use of ""power shots"" when the camera is facing upwards at a character giving the sense of superior power. It also makes amazing use of dramatic shots, especially with Washington's character. You will see my favorite shot in the entire movie near the end (Don't worry, no spoilers) When it zooms close-up on Washington's face and slows down the role to show the water falling on and off of his face and head. That shot gave me chills. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that you never really find out what Washington's character did before this movie took place. You find out what kind of connections he has but nothing more. But at the same time, I did like that sense of mystery around his character. It worked perfectly for the movie. The Equalizer is a must see even if you don't particularly like action movies. There is a terrific enough story to keep anyone interested in this movie. Denzel Washington never seems to disappoint. Definitely earns 9/10."

","the equalizer <br/><br/>Wow. Just finished watchin this and it was great. first I gotta say, I'm no big fan of Denzel. the movies I've seen by him that has been enjoyable have been few, and far between. For a role like this I would actually have chosen Jason Statham, but I guess Denzel's name draws more people to the movies. But Denzel did a superb job. I was truly and toughly entertained, and that is a long time since I've been. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz Plays extremely well for her young age, and I think she will go far. I really liked her performance. She handled the act of playing a prostitute really well for her young age. The only thing that draws the movie slightly down, is the whole cat and mouse game, that goes on all through the movie. They need to come up with a new way, to make these type of movies, without the cat and mouse game . It's been used through and through ,and its get tire some an stupid after while. I mean, why mess around with the lower level goons and minions, when you all the time have the means and opportunity, to go direct to the top and cut of the head of the snake? But its and excellent action packed movie, I truly recommend it"
"Blazs91","9","2","6","28 October 2014"," Denzel is great, as always!
","Now is the time for us to get a chance of judging a notable actor's performance in a brand new production, which will became at lea, t as classic as the actor in the leading role after a few years, and its name will definitely not sink into oblivion.<br/><br/>Although, I haven't got any little thoughts about the plot, and I haven't seen the trailer either, I'd been feeling myself really excited about movie, because Denzel Washington as one of my favorite actors, who hasn't made any disappointing movie so far in his carrier. And this was the same in the case of The Equalizer. The acting performance is simply phenomenal! Denzel is visualizing the usual figure who probably has been an outstanding but now already retired spec ops agent, what we cannot be bored of. The Oscar-winning actor brings life a character of the same style on the canvas almost every time, but somehow he's still able to show the audience something new. If it's needed, than ha could be funny and humorous, he could be sympathetic and patient, but he could also be very tough and serious if the situation required that. This is the character which is well- known by the wide audience, but sometime he could always produce some new attributes and different nature.<br/><br/>The other actors also performed a flawless job. This is Chloe Grace Morez's first performance when she appeared on the big screen like character seemed to be really natural to me, so that I couldn't have noticed the slightest spark of acting. But I mean this in the good sense. The character's really come to life on the screen.<br/><br/>The storyline is simply brilliant! The very beginning felt a bit sluggish, during the first 10-15 minutes, I would have been thinking that we would get a fairly towed movie. But later the plot will have the ability of catching the audience's attention so hard, that you won't feeling of Âwhen will it end"" or Âthis movie is so tardy"" for a minute of the 130 minutes runtime. Around the 40th minute of the whole movie it pushes a so brutally epic scene into your face, what your brain can hardly accept and process. It's a so well choreographed and perfectly executed scene, that usually could be seen only seen at the end of the movie as the finale of the whole production. I've also had the feeling of the movie's ended, because the scene was immediately followed by 5-10 minutes of peaceful atmosphere, but fortunately it's darkened really soon, and the tension kept going on.<br/><br/>The villains are popping up right after each other in the film, and we constantly have the opportunity of getting know the bad guys taking their place higher and higher on the hierarchy of the underworld. Marton Csokas has the ability of representing the irritatingly arrogant and disgusting right hand of the mafia, who's dealing with all the dirty affairs of his boss. But almost everybody will like his character despite of his repulsive nature, but because of the excellent acting performance.<br/><br/>I also bow down before the writer, because the dialogues are so funky and fast-paced, what I think I haven't experienced for years before. Danzel's usual humorous style against the good guys could prevail as effectively just as the usual condescending, and efficiently argumentative style against the bad guys. He could even twirl the minds of the most elusive and dodgiest criminals effectively by the play of words, so that they could react with only silence, big eyes and open-mouth.<br/><br/>The restrictions on age in the film is completely legitimate, because the fighting scenes are made so brutal and expressive, that hey hit the screen with true vengeance. I've almost felt the pain when I heard the cracking of an arm or by the sight of a knife slicing through a limb of a lucky man. The camera work is not the most appropriate in every single moment, because there were some hand-to-hand combat scenes where I could have barely seen what's really happening and who's actually hit who. But there is not any bigger (and other) mistakes in the whole movie at all that I could take into account. Denzel tries to get to the Russian mafia totally alone, which could sound totally crazy and incredible, but somehow the movie could present the happenings in a more or less realistic way in front of our eyes, so that we can totally accept this fact.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the plot and overall essence of the film, because it's far more pleasuring to realize it by ourselves by seeing the whole production.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is great! In my opinion it could smoothly deserve the movie of the year title, and I'd dare to risk a couple of Oscars. Although the movies of this kind are unfortunately not often welcomed by the academy. Shame on them! Nevertheless, I would recommend the film to almost everyone who has the ability of enduring the brutality on a serious level. And for the fans of Denzel it's a must-see masterpiece!<br/><br/>Rating 9/10"
"orlando-somera","8","2","6","14 October 2014"," It's good to fantasize about being able to cheat the odds
","The run up is a little slow but does invest the film with a little more soul than it would have had without it and it also gives Chloe Grace Moretz an opportunity to show her stuff. <br/><br/>The thing about action movies like this is that they have to seem just plausible enough or the whole thing crashes down. That requirement is fulfilled here and you are able to enjoy a ride you don't see much anymore, the hyper-talented agent willing to get back in action. Denzel is up to the task and so is Chloe, but for me at least the most surprising delight was that of the bad guy played by Marton Csokas. The guy plays a Russian fixer who is called in to restore the criminal status quo. And in a few beautifully acted scenes, you're convinced he's going to succeed.<br/><br/>A good time at the movies."

I just can't see that type or amount of violence being necessary or good for the society in general. It's often said that in the good old days, sex was implied and out of our line of vision. I'm now voting for us to put the violence out of our line of vision also. Kids spend countless hours with the violent video games and movies of this type feed that appetite. What price are we paying as a society? How is this different than the ISIS beheadings? There was so much of this movie that I had to turn my head from, that I quite reasonably deserve a refund."

","OK so if you like Denzel then you'll love this! Standard action movie with Washington playing a calm composed character with whom people can relate. A down to earth guy who sets out to help others. Good storyline and acting. Well worth seeing if you're into your crime thrillers with plenty of action. Washington is your everyday normal guy with something extra. You'll wish you could do what he does, and his movies rarely disappoint. Definitely worth it's high review score. If you liked him in the book of Eli then this is for you. Ending a bit far fetched but don't think about it too much and just go with it and it'll put a smile on you face."
"FilmMuscle","5","2","6","29 September 2014"," More Than Just Another Denzel Washington Action Movie?
","Antonie Fuqua, director of Training Day, has created another harsh and energetic vehicle for his star, Denzel Washingtonâanother determined warrior who's out for no-holds-barred vengeance. The Equalizer, for that matter, has a lot of styleâthere's no doubt about that. Its cinematography is genuinely impressive, permeated by shots of glistening skyscrapers, luxury cars, and heavily stylized, slo-mo portionsÂbut it's ultimately all too familiar. The Russians, of course, represent the one-dimensional villains here who merely function as tools to showcase Washington's wild skill set. The tone of the film is certainly its strongest suitâvery gritty and dark in a glossy cosmopolitan setting that's oftentimes seen at night. There are plenty of painful deaths and an abundance of blood to be seen. <br/><br/>Other than that, the plot gets rather ridiculous very fast. In fact, we discover soon that its wonderful tone actually isn't very fitting for the content of the movie. A world that's initially established with realism, beginning to introduce compelling themes and displaying how Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) strives to be a better manâstrict exercise and diet regimens, relaxed dinners with classic literary works placed right by his plate, and an optimistic philosophy with which he helps improve his friends and colleagues as well. We quickly learn that he's clearly a man of dignity, integrity, and self-respect; quite the compelling start into the first twenty minutes. <br/><br/>The narrative first fleshes out the tedious routines of his every day until we run into Chloe Moretz's character, Teri. Though she's given disappointingly little screen time, Moretz, as usual, shines with every minute she's givenâa deeply vulnerable adolescent whose innocence glimmers from her eyes, slowly and tragically vanishing while she's raised in a strongly depraved environment as a hooker for the Russian mafia. She doesn't see through the same hopeful eyes that Robert does, and there we see two completely irreconcilable worlds encounter one anotherâthat of the ponderously cynical and that of the buoyant or even, shall I say, naÃ¯ve. Can we truly change the environment in which we have already developed ourselves? Just how plausible is this seemingly mythical betterment of self? These are some of several philosophical concepts and quiet moments of character introspection and reflection as the austere streets of Boston (somewhat resembling the ambiance of 2007's Gone Baby Gone) outside their windows go on by. <br/><br/>Well, all of that potential is quickly squandered as The Equalizer jarringly metamorphoses into a blatant, clichÃ©d action flick that becomes less and less remarkable as it progresses. With his gimmicky watch-setting and slow-motion maneuvering around any given predicament, you suspect that McCall might just be another unstoppable superhero after all. Whereas Man on Fire (a film that can easily be compared to this one) mixes emotion with a hell-bent Denzelâhunting down the kidnappers one-by-one with realistically brutal methodsâthis movie, on the other hand, becomes incredibly outlandish when the protagonist begins effortlessly killing dozens of baddies in one confined arena, magically having enough time to implement creativity into each take- down as well. And, you know, Washington plays a character he has portrayed many times before: deadly serious and tough as nails in his manner of speech and physicality. <br/><br/>In addition, its runtime of 2 hours and 11 minutes doesn't grant it any favors either. The final (explosive) sequence runs on for far too long and feels like it took up almost a quarter of the film. In the movie's first action segments, the grisly violence is undoubtedly shocking, as well as exciting. By the end, it becomes monotonous and unspectacular. The violence is by then cleverly shadowed as to dramatically reduce its severity; I guess it's the implied ways by how they're executed that occasionally provoke the squirms from the audience. But even after that prolonged final confrontation, the film unnecessarily continues with multiple additional scenes as Washington (somehow) masterfully climbs even farther up the mafia ladder with fueling revenge. <br/><br/>The impeccably stimulating score by the ever-talented Harry Gregson- Williams screams with the same tragic emotion and melancholy that Man on Fire did but never effectively translates that onto the screen. If only there was creativity applied to its insipid story and a more grounded approach (complementing the grittiness of its tone), The Equalizer could've made for a memorable action film. At the end of the day though, audiences will likely remember it as just another Denzel Washington action movie among many."

","""What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.""<br/><br/>The infamous monologue taken from the movie of the same name set a new milestone in action pictures, reinventing the vigilante figure with the additional ""special sets of kills"" and replacing the 'crusade against violence' by a less high-scaled and more personal-oriented fight, like saving young and vulnerable girls from the claws of male predators and abusing pimps. It's quite a bold move in an era where 'damsels in distresses' and urban violence have stopped to be popular tropes, but I guess this is why it took the talent of versatile and quality actors such as Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington to elevate the film about the level of pure macho-power exaltation.<br/><br/>Audiences would accept these men as role models rather than regular action movies stars maybe because they bring a dimension of humanity and fatherly warmth. Not that it lacked in Arnie, Sly or Bruce Willis but I'm talking about 2010s standards where it's not too cool to sound cool anymore. As Robert McCall, Washington doesn't replay Bryan Mills but gives his own depth in a role that could have been rather two-dimensional, that he made it to finance his ""Fences"" or make a departure from his award-baity performances doesn't matter, he's quite the man in a performance that isn't too showy even in the showiest parts. And you've got to credit the patience Antoine Fuqua demonstrates in the exposition.<br/><br/>McCall is the bookworm, getting through the Top 100 must-read Books, he works in a home depot shop, gets along with his colleagues, coaches one of them to lose weight to pass a security job test and befriends a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. It all builds up to the crucial moment where he makes his 'Mills' offer to Russian hoodlums who showed that women's welfare wasn't their priority. They're all drowning in vodka and cocky arrogance, with every inch of their bodies harboring intimidating skulls and tattoos but naturally, no one takes ""Dedushka"" seriously... so the old-timer has no other choice than teaching them a lesson or two about time efficiency. It takes twenty seconds of a nasty fight to make his point but since he aimed for sixteen, we get the idea that he's slipping. Still, it's the establishing moment we've all waited for.<br/><br/>The act isn't without consequences and brought the attention to a Russian Mafia ""Don"" named Vladimir Pushkin (quite the name) who sends his best dragon ""Teddy"" (Marton Csokas) to hunt the killer. This is a standard action picture about a man singlehandedly defeating the almighty Russian mafia and while the film does find ingenuous ways to avoid the obvious comparisons with ""Taken"", it's the charismatic presence of Denzel Washington that makes the difference. And it's not a detail, when you have a title that doesn't say much about the film but sound cool enough to make you curious, you've got to have a ""name"" to press the play button.<br/><br/>It seems crazy said like this but choosing the right movie to pick on Netflix is such a patience-demanding ordeal that all it takes is a title and a charismatic actor. Say what you want about Denzel Washington, his movies aren't all on the same caliber than ""Malcolm X"" but he always delivers a memorable performance even in a role that doesn't aim for award and where cinematic excellence consists on dodging caricature and being believable as a skilled fighter. And that's the power a few actors can pretend to have, something that makes Washington equal to Clint Eastwood, his ""presence"" is more vital than his ""words"". But even Eastwood couldn't do without worthy antagonist and Washington's presence is enhanced by a solid villain.<br/><br/>And maybe that's the aspect that gives the film a slight edge over ""Taken"", which is that the villain always possesses a special set of skills and doesn't let himself intimidated as well. And so we follow a cat-and-mouse chase where the roles are alternatingly reversed and where the chasers become the chased ones and we don't know if the film is as good as the hero or the villain So the film follows a long storyline where we see a lot of fighting, some remarkably gruesome that reminded me of ""A History of Violence"", but even violence can get routinely and the most memorable parts turn out to be the quieter ones, which all takes us to a dinner conversation and the closest to a great confrontation the film ever got.<br/><br/>When McCall confronts ""Teddy"" to his own past in Soviet Union, the writing is brilliant, in fact it's so good that the fact that the film chose the safe way and end with a climactic confrontation set in McCall's job area, his own comfort zone, left me disappointed. It seems that Fuqua wasn't so confident about his material that he thought he had to keep on the track and makes the violence an escalating process... but think of a film like ""First Blood"", once we know that Rambo is a man not to mess with, the film surprises us with the heartbreaking Vietnam monologue, revealing a hidden depth in Rambo's personality, I wish ""Equalizer"" could find a way to take us off-guard.<br/><br/>It's a sign of lack of maturity when a film doesn't try to surprise you, even a film like ""Taken"" chose to have a shocking moment where Mills' mission proved not to be a complete success, but in ""Equalizer"" even when McCall's friends and colleagues are taken as hostages, it's hard to believe that none of them was killed just to make a point. So, either the bad guys underestimate McCall to the end, or act dumber than they should or get too soft it's almost off-character. I guess it makes the fiim as good as the hero... after all."

","There is no bigger fan of Denzel Washington than yours truly. Dude is just great at his job. When a person's chosen profession is to portray other people than yourself, it's going to require a lot of studying. Or maybe just a lot of common sense.
 I think almost anyone with enough nerve can probably do some acting. All you have to do is watch how other folks do things in normal circumstances , and imitate them. 
 Yeah right... Denzel does every personality known to man in the most convincing way. From the super dork, to the cerebral peace keeper, to the slightly deranged family man, to the lovingly hateful detective. 
 I like real stuff in movies. The kind of thing that is actually possible for me or someone I know to witness on a given day. The ONE MAN ARMY kinda movie is not really in that realm. I mean does anyone actually have an affiliation with a person like this? Please tell me where these people live. 
 Hollywood has always done a good job of making Marvel comic heros seem to be normal. They make Gotham city and Metropolis look like everyday cities that just happen to have a dude in tights flying around saving days like kids save baseball cards.

"MackMonMay87","6","1","2","8 July 2018"," Makes John Wick Look Realistic
","""The Equalizer"" is based off of an 80's TV show about an ex-spy/mercenary that helps people with problems that need to be solved outside the law, and while the movie ultimately sets this aspect up, most of the film just leads up to that point, and I have to assume isn't really connected that strongly to the show. 
Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua have worked together before in the memorable and very well-crafted ""Training Day"", but Equalizer shows that the people involved are only as good as the script, and that's where the weaknesses of this come into play, as well as some silly editing and scene-transitions. 
Middle-Aged Men action films are something of a sub-genre now after Taken, with multiple franchises and installments based around the concept, including the very popular John Wick series. You always use a jury of your peers, so John Wick is the peer to something like Equalizer, and is better because Wick established a stylized alternate world to our own and had well-practiced choreography without jump-cuts, edits, and slow-motion. Wick also got beaten up and ran out of ammo several times in the movie, and had to be saved by friends more than once; in short he was skilled but still human.
Denzel's Robert McCall almost never expends a shred of effort, with planning skills that would make Batman look like a sloppy procrastinator. It's still fun for what it is, and Chloe Moretz, Martin Csokas, and the rest of the cast do a great job in their roles, but the movie gets more and more absurd as it goes in terms of how resourceful and skilled McCall is, to the point that he singlehandedly takes down a wing of the Russian Mafia, disrupting their entire operation in Boston, and then travelling to Russia and killing the kingpin, all without much effort (even though he does sustain a gunshot wound to the shoulder, which isn't a big deal to him).
I love seeing heroes take on the bad guys, it's a great, timeless fantasy that can be very rewarding and inspiring if done well, but The Equalizer takes any suspense and drama out of the equation, and there's very little struggle on the part of the hero. Wick got outclassed in a hand-to-hand fight and James Bond routinely gets knocked around in his outings, but it's hard for me to root for a hero who at some point doesn't get taxed or pushed, no matter how resourceful they are.
It's saved by Denzel's solid-as-always performance and the rest of the cast, but The Equalizer has material that has been way better by much better productions."

","The Equalizer is based on an '80s T.V. show, and now it's back for a new generation, a new take, a new, and awesome I might add action film directed by mister Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Southpaw). The film follows Robert, played by Denzel Washington (Training Day, American Gangster). Robert is a man of a mysterious origin. Who believes he has put the past behind him, dedicates himself to creating a quiet new life. He works at a Home Depot, takes public transportation, goes to the same restaurant every night to drink tea (even though he brings his own tea bag, so really he is just ordering hot water), reads his book, talks to an underage prostitute, named Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick Ass, Let Me In) and doesn't bother anyone. Until, the Russian mob get violent, and abuse Teri. That's when Denzel decides he needs to get back in his old ways, and deliver a fresh can of whoop ass to the bad guys.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's performance in this film is one of the best performances 'I've seen him do in a long time. His character is brutal, bad-ass, charming, has a hunger for justice, and overall this is a very cool character. This is how I imagined The Punisher in his older years.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua really knows how to mingle a magnificent action movie. It's action packed, stylized, and some very cool shots throughout this film. Denzel Washington really is like a modern day, stylized superhero. Did you notice he wears the same type of shirt throughout the movie? That might as well be his superhero costume! Spray paint a big bat logo on it, and he is good to go.<br/><br/>Accordingly, my only complaint about the film, is it could have been trimmed down to a shorter movie. Also, the villains could have been fleshed out a little bit better. They come off as typical foreign villains we've seen before.<br/><br/>So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on The Equalizer. A good action movie, that has a cool character, scenes, and a cool story. My only complaint is the film's running time is a little long, and with a story like this it doesn't need to be this long. I believe Antoine Fuqua is a good director, and I believe this is a good film.

The story of this felt like it was trying to give him a purpose to do these things, when you could have just done them from one incident.<br/><br/>It also tries to tell you why he got out of the businesses, they give you his whole backstory. John Wick implies it, which it great, it leaves some mystery.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie, but John Wick did it better. I won't be buying it, but will probably watch it a second or third time.

","This movie was actually better than I expected. It was kind of a mix of bond/bourne type ingenuity action with an added modern day superhero quality - the type that allows the viewer to get a bit carried away with all the action without questioning how believable the story line is. For me it has some great high adrenaline action and at the centre of it all is the ever cool Denzel Washington. The story line tends to delve further into the unbelievable the further it goes on - eventually to the point where you wonder how Mr Mccall could so easily seemingly return to his normal everyday life after such outrageous public exposure. But then you remember that it's all about unapologetic action - and doesn't try to be particularly believable or convey any deep and meaningful message. It sets out to entertain - and that it certainly does."

Now excuse the pun but casting aside the casting, I would like to have seen McCall played as the chap with the Jaguar and the posh suits, but this was not to be.

Teddy breaking the girls neck, McCall drilling the gunman's head, The Corkscrew attack in the hit on Slavi where all a bit OTT for me. But having said that this is a great Vigilante movie. I hope there is a sequel and the story continues. Washington does a fine job in playing McCall, but to all the critics who panned me about casting in the last posting debacle' how would it go if Jude Law was to be cast in a remake of In The Heat Of The Night?

I'm a sucker for movies with Russia involved, and this film had so much to do with it.<br/><br/>When I looked at the genre, I'm not seeing the thriller part of it as I'd think it would classify more as a suspense action; either way this movie was good.

","The Equalizer is more of a slow burn than John Wick, and obviously not written with the same intent to have fun with the genre and make something a little bit new in the process, but it is certainly almost as good of a movie. My only issue with The Equalizer comes from the fact that Denzel Washington's character is fundamentally indistinguishable from his role in Man On Fire, essentially the same background can be extrapolated from both characters. This could easily be thought of as having been an alternate reality lived out by the same person in both movies. Having enjoyed Man On Fire a great deal, it is a bit disappointing to see what amounts to little more than a retread with different antagonists. Sure, the motivations that set events in motion are different, but that is really about the only other change. Still an enjoyable and satisfyingly violent movie, but it loses points for a blatant lack of originality in having Washington cast in what amounts to the same role he was already successful with in a better movie. Also, there was really no need for this particular movie to be more than two hours long. Also, it lost a step or two from the original television series. Worth seeing, but it has been done before and better."

","A movie based on an old late 80's American TV series but only very thinly. It is in fact more of an origins plot showing how the main character becomes a vigilante for hire...or The Equalizer. The actual story we see here and the main character are nothing to do with the original TV show (unless this plot is similar to a certain episode I don't know).<br/><br/>The premise is a very simple one. Retired black ops government agent McCall (Washington) is friends with a hooker called Alina (Moretz), Alina is working for the Russian mob. One night McCall witnesses some of the gang members abuse Alina and a few days later she turns up in hospital badly beaten. This upsets McCall so he visits the head of the local Russian mob and offers to buy her freedom, the bad guys basically laugh at McCall...so he kills them all. Thusly a war is started between McCall and the Russian mob.<br/><br/>This movie bears a striking similarity to another glossy revenge thriller...'John Wick', very similar in fact. There Wick goes on the warpath over his dead puppy, here McCall goes on the warpath over a rather sleazy looking lady of the night. The puppy I can understand because everyone likes puppies/dogs, your pet is your best friend, part of the family. The sleazy prostitute on the other hand I'm not so sure. How do you even know if this girl isn't a druggie, if you'll ever see her again, if she'll even be grateful...who can tell, risky gamble if you ask me.<br/><br/>So I guess McCall sees something special in this rather young prostitute and decides to put his whole life on the line despite the fact he doesn't even know her that well (from what we see). From this point on its your predictable, clichÃ©d, stereotypical one man army job with Washington killing everyone...EVERYONE! This movie is all about giving the bad guys payback so expect lots of slow motion highly impressive fight choreography that looks slick as f*ck but you know damn well would probably get you nowhere in a real scuffle. Washington has obviously been trained in various techniques that we've all seen before (errr...John Wick?) and executes them flawlessly against various stereotypical Russian baddies.<br/><br/>Its not all about fisticuffs though, there is plenty of gun play naturally, some high-tech gadgetry and spy stuff and even some good old fashioned A-Team-esque DIY take downs utilising various objects. Actually the entire finale is set in a large Homebase (UK only) styled warehouse so obviously you know things like drills, nail guns, wire etc...will be used to snuff the villains out. I've always wondered how cool it would be to play war games in a place like that, now I know. Everything looks super stylised and well shot, lots of interesting camera angles, great lighting with lots of shadow usage, moody facial closeups, excellent gun porn, expensive cars, expensive sets etc...all the usual stuff.<br/><br/>As for the bad guys well its business as usual of course, these guys are tattooed Russians. Cue lots of ultra short haircuts and facial hair, big bald guys, bling, made to measure outfits and holding your gun in the coolest way possible whilst looking twitchy. Its the usual stream of henchmen cannon fodder basically, the only highlight being the main bad guy flown in to hunt down McCall...Teddy. Yep lets give him a silly soft sounding name, that's really clever of us because in fact he's a nutcase and very tough. This character (in my opinion) is simply a poor man's Agent Smith (Weaving) from 'The Matrix'. He dresses in a suit of course, he looks the same, same type of hairstyle, same type of grimaces and even kinda talks the same to a degree, Russian accent aside.<br/><br/>Again this movie is engaging but its not particularly good. We know McCall is a badass but he does things that seem impossible. When he kills the Russians at the start he manages to enter and leave their busy club without anyone noticing or hearing the commotion. When he sets up two crooked cops where the hell did he manage to get the CCTV of them threatening the restaurant owner originally? He pops up at locations outta nowhere and vanishes just as easily. He takes down an entire money laundering operation way too easily single handed. He manages to blow up an entire cargo ship at the docks single handed. Lastly when he had another crooked cop trapped in his car whilst flooding it with carbon monoxide why didn't the cop just break the glass or stop the window closing...its just an electric window!<br/><br/>Yes this is a lean mean kickass machine, its very sleek, well made and well directed, but its just too damn unoriginal. How many times have we seen this?? aside from the fact that 'John Wick' did the exact same thing around a month after this came out!! (and a bit better). The main issues...its too long and the movie is trying way too hard to be serious and gritty when basically its nonsense. McCall manages to eradicate the entire Russian crime syndicate in Boston...and then he goes to Russia and wipes them all out there too! the f*ck!! If he's that good he could erase more crime syndicates single-handedly all over. You gotta ask yourself why he hasn't been used to do this before, or why he hasn't decided to do so himself if he can so easily. Seriously, he's just one retired black ops dude, imagine what a whole team could do.<br/><br/>5/10"

","At 60 years old, Denzel Washington is still one of the best action stars on the planet. Can we get a Denzel vs Liam Neeson film already? Or perhaps even a team up film? I believe they are both in their 60's now so the clock is ticking. The Equalizer is a pure action film. Much like Taken, the story takes a bit of a backseat to the insane action sequences. But when you get a film as entertaining as this one, that's quite alright.<br/><br/>Washington plays a retired agent of some sorts, who swears to not go back to his old roots and stay clean. It all changes when he sees Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a teenage prostitute, being abused. The premise is very similar to Taken, but I think the payoff for this film isn't as high as Taken. Moretz slips out of the film for the better part of 2 hours. It becomes more of a revenge film without exemplifying the reason behind the revenge well enough. I will say that the action is twice as good, but also over-the-top, as Taken. Robert (Washington) kills people in the most unnecessarily strange ways, but it's awesome. It has all the clichÃ©s of a action thriller, but yet it works. It also helps that every explosion Robert walks away from there's a great score to compliment it.<br/><br/>The film is pretty long for not having a lot of depth to the story, but it still has a great amount of re-watchability. There aren't many memorable characters or even people you care about, besides Denzel. If they end up making a franchise out of it, I hope they add depth to the characters and bulk up the supporting cast.<br/><br/>+Ridiculously fun action <br/><br/>+Denzel is still a bada** <br/><br/>+Catchy music/score<br/><br/>-Seen the story before <br/><br/>-No depth to the characters <br/><br/>7.7/10"

"InMyHonestOpinion","7","1","2","8 January 2015"," A brutal retelling of a class TV series not that thats a bad thing
","The Equalizer<br/><br/>When I was a younger boy one of my favourite shows to watch was The Equalizer, Edward Woodward starred ion the 80's TV show which I absolutely loved. Now when I heard it was being remade at first I was pretty excited, all these actors who could I envisioned living up the mastery of Robert McCall, but when I seen Denzel Washington my first thought was WTF! I was horrified, how, and why. Why would they do that, sure Denzel was great in Man on fire and pretty much exactly what a real life Robert McCall would be. So it's taken me a while to sit and watch this one just for the simple fact I wasn't happy with the casting choice and couldn't see justice being carried out. I didn't want my childhood ruined!<br/><br/>Robert McCall is a solitary man, a man who has routines and runs his life by them. Robert McCall also has a secret, one that only the closet to him will ever know. Every night Robert takes his tea bag wrapped in a cotton napkin and walks to his local diner, where he always sits at the same table, always places his book in the same position, always arranges the cutlery the same way, every night without fail he will be there. Over time he has formed a simple relationship with a young Russian singer songwriter who also frequents the diner and has her own secrets. By day Robert works in the local DIY store serving his customers the best he can. One thing you don't want to do though is p#ss Robert off and you really don't want to hurt his friends.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is a brutal film, its hard core no holds barred action sequences will be enough to force a lot of viewers watching the scenes play out through their fingers. Robert McCall is unforgiving he is a character who sizes up a person and a room in matter of seconds. I will admit Denzel Washington (Man on fire, Fallen) who plays Robert McCall was actually great as the man he recreated and I didn't despise him as much as I thought I would, I would even go as far as saying perhaps it's better to watch this remake of the TV series with a fresh set of eyes, Denzel does his best to make Robert McCall his own and really does it well. Antoine Fuqua (Olympus has fallen, Training Day) really has made a name for himself as a director with his own style. As far as action films go I think he has a great eye for detail, he knows what is needed to make the scene perfect, greatest thing going for him is he likes his viewers to see what is going on in the action sequences, something a lot of directors have forgotten. The film also stars ChloÃ« Grace Moretz (Kick A#s, Hugo) as Teri and Marton Csokas who is actually quite unforgettable in his role as Terry.<br/><br/>The Equalizer will leave you wondering at first where it's going as the beginning is quite slow, but once the action picks up it leaves you wanting more. My only critique would be the few plot holes that are very apparent as the film plays out. It's not a game changer as anything can be forgiven if given a chance."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","7","1","2","6 January 2015"," Denzel Washington is Badass.
","I saw this film a while back and I liked it but I do have some small problems with the film. First The good points. The film has good Fight scenes.Denzel Washington kicks Ass and takes names and he's fun to watch.he's also a calculating character,he was cool and collected but violent when he had to be. Watching Denzel Washington beat up gangsters was fun and seeing everything from his point of view was interesting. also the film was shot well and the music was good. <br/><br/>Bad points. The story was a bit shallow and most of the characters were shallow and had no character development.The bad guys were kind of Lame and the main villain was very over the top,they tried to make him look tough and psycho by having him beat the Stuffing out of one one man,but He was too over the top and Cartooney for my liking.He was also Never scary.<br/><br/>The film also had a slow start and The film lacked substance and the story was not great in fact the film did not have much of a story and to me those are its weakest points.(The lack of substance and lack of story).however there is still fun to be had with this film and I still enjoyed watching it. Denzel Washington saves the film and makes it a fun ride. Denzel gives a great performance as a retired special oops agent who has had a tough life and is tired of seeing bad things happen. You get the idea that his character is troubled and i felt bad for the guy its obvious that hes a guy that is sick of all the violence in the world and he wants to make a change. At the start of the film Denzel befriends a girl at a cafÃ© called Teri played by(Chloe Grace Moretz).they get talking and they become Friends and that's one of the films positives,a good relationship was built up between these two characters and I started to like both of them.<br/><br/>One night Chloe graces character gets slapped and Taken away and Denzil sees it happen and Later in the film Denzel goes to the place the men are staying.Teri is a slave and he offers to pay them money if they free the girl. This was personally one of my favourite scenes in the film because the gangsters don't take him seriously,they laugh at him and they tell him to leave and Denzel pretends to leave but then he comes back and Beats them all up!. He punches some he shoots some he stabs some hits some with glass cups and Denzel totally annihilated them! in one of the best scenes in the movie.he even shoves a cork screw through one guys neck and kills him and the guy falls down flat on his face. I like how Denzel looks at his watch after and sees it only took him 19 seconds to kill them then he watches one guy die then he just calmly walks away like it never happened. It's scenes like that,that made the film entertaining. <br/><br/>What I liked about Denzels character was his cool and calm demeanour,he never seemed to get angry he never yelled he was always cool calm and calculated I liked that about him,he was a character that I think had a lot of anger bottled up inside him but he never let it out out by yelling he let it out through his actions by punishing sick people that deserve to do die which made him a vigilante type of guy,he was just a guy that wanted peace and he was tired of seeing bad things happen.<br/><br/>some people have said he had no reason for hurting so many people and those people have clearly missed the point because it's very obvious from the start why he's beating up gangsters and that's because they mistreated Chloes Character,they beat her up so badly she was in a hospital and Denzel obviously hates violence toward girls so he took a stand and I liked that he did that. Denzel basically just wants to kill evil people and that's exactly what he does in a planned out calculated way.<br/><br/>I was disappointed Chloe Grace was not in the film very long we mainly see her at the beginning of the Film and at the end and I would have liked to have seen more of her because I liked her,but that was not a big issue because Denzel is very Fun to watch and he Beats up bad guys Throughout the Film.<br/><br/>I have to admit I liked the second half of the film more than the first half which had too much talking but I thought the end more than made up for it when Denzel faces of against the Russian mafia at the home Mart store.people have complained about the Ending being too much like home alone and I don't get why that's a problem.I liked the Ending and I found it to be Very Gritty and intense because Denzel sets a bunch of traps up for the bad guys and then he takes them down one by one with tools like drills and Nail guns and barbed wire.<br/><br/>Denzil was very cool and a total Badass! In this Movie.Be warned the Ending is very Violent and over the top and bloody! but if your a Denzel Fan you should definitely give the film a watch.I found the film to be Okay and I would not mind watching it again."
"kwstas-malk","6","1","2","6 January 2015"," nice action movie
","There is one side in the film when it's totally gripping, that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life, often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime. This grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence, sometimes feeling like a doomed, helpless world. But once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of, it doesn't actually sucks out its entertainment quality, but it does betrays that intriguing context, nearly turning itself into a superhero movie, except of course, it's less silly and much violent. McCall, in shorthand, is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger. It may not be big deal to many viewers, especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood, but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice. CLASSIC American HOLIHOOD FILM !"
"Fluke_Skywalker","6","1","2","5 January 2015"," A bit off target
","Antoine Fuqua's 'The Equalizer' is skillfully made and boasts a strong cast, led by the always great Denzel Washington, but as I was watching it I couldn't shake the feeling that it just wasn't quite clicking the way it should. Like a high performance sports car with a bad piston.<br/><br/>I did appreciate that it took its time building up to the point where Denzel inevitably begins equalizing, but after he's pulled back into the world he'd thought he'd left behind, it seems like everyone in his life suddenly finds themselves in need of his special talents and the story begins to lose its focus and momentum. Perhaps this premise is just better suited to episodic television.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I would say that 'The Equalizer' is definitely worth a watch and I'd be up for a sequel now that the groundwork has been laid."
"shaososa","7","1","2","4 January 2015"," The Return of the One Man War on Bad Guys
","The Equalizer is loosely based on the 80's TV show of the same name, but it might have more in common with the corny action movies of that era that featured one man armies against hordes of bad guys. Denzel Washington takes the title role as a mysterious ex government agent of some sort who is trying to live a life of normalcy. But when he befriends a prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz and she falls into trouble with her Russian mob pimps, he falls back to his old skill set to reap punishment on her accosters. And Washington's Equalizer ain't no punk b---h. <br/><br/>Like the Stallones and Schwarzneggers of the aforementioned 80's films, Denzel is a wrecking ball of ridiculous force and wrath. But while those old 80s flicks lacked style and creativity, director Antoine Fuqua breaks out the tricks and flash of his growing repertoire and holds nothing back in the manner in which Washington dispatches baddies. While I raised an eyebrow at the ease in which a 60 year old Washington worked his way through his adversaries here, I was still entertained by a decent script and well shot action scenes."

So I went into it assuming it was going to be a stand-alone type and that I shouldn't hold it to the series. I was right. If you're a fan of the 80's series, don't watch this movie thinking you're going to talk a walk down memory lane. It just isn't there.<br/><br/>That said, it's not a bad movie. It tries to be 'great,' and it lands on 'good.' The first three quarters or so are 'build up,' and the story is OK, but there really isn't much there. It's hard to rely on story when the main character and his past are shrouded the entire time. The story we do know? Well, bad Russian guys are doing bad things. That's pretty much it. Not terribly creative or deep, really.<br/><br/>The first three quarters are slow with a bit of action inserted here and there, but it really picks up in the last quarter. Even then, it's only 'good' and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic.<br/><br/>Don't go out of your way to see this one, but if you're out of movies to watch, it's not a bad flick. It's just not a great flick. And if you haven't seen 'Man on Fire,' watch it instead for sure. Or hell, watch it again instead of this one. You'll certainly be more satisfied.<br/><br/>7/10"
"keyos27","7","1","2","6 December 2014"," Morose and feisty, decent enough to catch action movie buffs' eye
","What makes a great action film? Showcasing a charismatic protagonist that bustles all sorts of powerful moves? Or would it be the thrilling plot that revolves around intriguing motives and cynical enemies? The Equalizer possesses both elements while featuring a veteran, Denzel Washington who plays Robert McCall still has what it takes to waltz through a plethora of wrongdoing by helping others and equalizing the corrupted society.<br/><br/>The movie gets intense as the days of McCall ensue. It begins with an ordinary routine by showing McCall commuting via public transit and gradually foreshadows unique aura that differentiate him from his coworkers in the warehouse center. Then he spends his night reading in the cafÃ© where he often chats with an indecent and polite girl, Teri played by Chole grace moretz. She manages to handle such a promiscuous role pretty well. It will take anyone by surprise when you find out her age.<br/><br/>The prowess of Washington really makes this movie worth watching as his indomitable strength nonchalantly gets unleashed in order to take out the mafia. Nifty, swift, and impeccable, every movement he makes is a sight for sore eyes. Thus the editing seems well-done in terms of cutting and panning the scenes. The Russian mob and their dastardly stooges fit in well as they go head to head with Washington verbally and physically.<br/><br/>However, there is a number of improbable moments that put you into thinking that perhaps McCall is invincible. Despite his strength of being such a skilled combatant, it is unrealistic for one guy to catch his counterparts red-handed in a jiffy as well as thwarting the armed group of mob. Although, that might get resolved by the scene where he heads to the majestic dwelling to debrief his enemies from a lofty couple who seem to be related to the president. It is safe to posit that McCall used to work for the United States Secret Service which explains why he is so formidable.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the equalizer is packed with breathtaking fights in which Washington acts like the present version of cavalier. It is also a no-brainer because there is neither conundrum nor mystery thus you don't need to heed the plot but let your emotion and time to be enraptured by a series of exciting and stimulating scenes that do not feel redundant."

","I went into this movie with an open mind as Denzel is ageing and this movie didn't have much hype. I left throughly impressed and would go back and watch it again. Denzel plays a very calm, respectful and polite older man who frequently visits the local coffee shop where he reads books and chats with a young girl who is into some pretty negative stuff in her life. (Prostitution) He acts as a father figure to her and tries guiding her in the right direction in life. Just as this happens sh*t hits the fan and that's where the action picks up. You find out quickly that he possesses some 'special' skills. Basically this is the type of movie you can't help but get behind and cheer for the good guy. He exacts revenge on everyone who does him or his friends wrong. He does so in a very savage way and uses odd weapons to get the job done. (Rarely uses a gun) Throughout the movie you're shown how great of a human being he is, as he constantly tries helping less fortunate people get ahead in life. The villains are cast very well and give you the impression that they're no one to mess around with and surprise you with intelligence. However a villain is a villain and you know how that ends. If you want to see a truly badass movie with a ballsy tough guy this is the movie. It's not 100% action all of the time but that's what makes it great. Lots of buildup to the ass whoopings! 9/10"

",". . . and yesterday, when I topped off my tank, it had more than tripled to $3.16.9. THE EQUILIZER explains why. The Russian mob has most U.S. Congressmen and state governors on its payroll, giving it a stranglehold on oil pricing and distribution in America. These Russians also corrupt our women, our police, and most every store in the U.S. In THE EQUILIZER, Denzel Washington's vigilante ""Bob"" character can fix all this with barb wire, a staple gun, and an over-flowing sink! In Real Life, I think it will take MORE than Denzel to equalize the playing field. When Vlad Putin's henchmen shot down that airliner, the crime against Humanity was much more brazen and clear-cut than the Sinking of the Lusitania, which drew America into WWI. The West played patty-cakes with Hitler during the 1930s. IF nukes had been invented ten years earlier, 100 million lives could have been saved by taking out military bases near Hamburg, Berlin, and Nuremburg in 1936 or so, BEFORE the Nazis got over-confidently out-of-hand. As it was, historians estimate more than one million American lives, as well as 30 million Japanese, were saved by the deployment of just two small nukes to cut short WWII in 1945. Well-placed nuclear weapons constitute Humanity's Last Hope. They benefit no one gathering dust in bunkers. Since the CIA discovered that Russia's nuclear targeting is wildly inaccurate (plus we have President Reagan's ""Star Wars"" defense), we ought to publicly designate one Russian military base per week for nuking till Putin tells his oil crooks, ""protection money"" extortionists, pimps, legions of internet thieves, and Cyber hackers, ""Hands off America!!"" As THE EQUILIZER proves, lethal force is the only argument that Russian thugs such as Putin understand."

"j-madej","8","2","7","23 September 2014"," A popcorn flick which could have been so much more...but still fun though.
","Who does not like Denzel Washington...? Not many people. The fact is that there is something really cool about the characterizations he creates which often are underplayed and stick in our memory for a long time after the viewing. He likes to transform himself from character to character but always leaves that groove walk that became in some way his signature. The problem with Hollywood film industry is that once something worked in the past it will be repeated. Production companies almost never want to take a risk with the original projects. It is better to find some old movie or TV show and make a new spin off based on the old concept. This is where ""The Equalizer"" fits in on paper, very enjoyable and existing triller that is based on 80's TV series originally starring Edward Woodward. Russell Crowe was originally attached to star as Robert McCall eventually the role went to Denzel and probably with better effect. The only minus is that Denzel has done this type of part on more than one occasion. Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" immediately comes to mind, also ""Safe House"", ""Out of Time "" as well as to some extend ""Training Day"". This last one was directed by Antoine Fuqua who also happens to be director of ""The Equalizer"". Sadly the genius of ""Training day"" did not follow him here even though he did the best he could with the material presented to him in the script by Richard Wenk adopted from TV show ideas of Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. <br/><br/>""McCall (Denzel Washington) is a former black ops commando who has faked his death to live a quiet life in Boston. (we find out about that though half way through the movie) When he comes out of his self-imposed retirement to rescue a young girl, Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), he finds himself face to face with ultra-violent Russian gangsters. As he serves vengeance against those who brutalize the helpless, McCall's desire for justice is reawakened. If someone has a problem, the odds are stacked against them, and they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.""<br/><br/>I wish the script would have been better because there is truly potential here with the cast that has been assembled. Every movie needs a good antagonist and Marton Csokas as Teddy offers a good counterpart to Denzel's character. His mix of sophistication and sadism offers well needed dose of balance between humanity (McCall) and evil (Russian mafia's ""cleaner"" Teddy). The scene between McCall and Teddy in the restaurant when they come face to face is one of the best and most intense acting wise. Watching that scene brought to mind another iconic scene form movie the ""Heat"" between Pacino and DeNiro. Very enjoyable indeed, full of depth and internal dialog specially played in close up where the eyes do the talking.<br/><br/>The action scenes are shot in manner that resemble bit Tony Scott's style of filmmaking, in fact the whole film stylistically might have been inspired by work of the late director. Before every action scene McCall as a gimmick start his stop watch and estimates how long it will take him to kill subjects with the shortest amount of time. He choreographs the attack based on the threat and objects that he uses as weapons with minimal amount of movement. <br/><br/>Despite of the unoriginal story and perhaps little bit clichÃ© ending I did enjoy ""The Equalizer"" for what it was. A popcorn flick which could have been so much more. But then again money roles Hollywood and judging by response of the audience tonight ""The Equalizer"" will make good box-office. I am just hoping for Denzel Washington that he will not get type casted with this type of roles which he always does really well, but here he did not have much to do, in terms of his character development. Though he was still ice cool as always.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"
"ayoreinf","8","2","7","28 September 2014"," A cinematic marvel spoilt by a simplistic story line
","It seems that all the world's problems with crime could've been solved if only we had Robert McCall on the other end of the line. This unstoppable force of nature could bring in world peace in no time, and if we gave him some more leeway I'm sure he'd solve world hunger and global warming too. Which is plainly speaking just a shame, the film as is is superbly shot and acted, it uses the cinematic image like very few others in the industry do, and previous encounters with Antoine Fuqua, proves that he simply has this great understanding of the visual aspects of movie making, The Replacement Killers and King Arthur are just two obvious examples. The original series, was superb because in its Edward Woodward version McCall's limitation were always part of the story, he was super because he never tried to overcome a roomful of armed gangsters, he strategized his way around such circumstances. And never tried to solve the entire American problem with the Mob. What's the point of translating TV masterpieces of the past to the big screen if you miss its core point."
"ferguson-6","6","2","7","28 September 2014"," The Fish gotta be the Fish
","Greetings again from the darkness. While you are likely familiar with slapstick comedy, this latest from director Antoine Fuqua could be described as slapstick action. This fits because the implements of destruction include barbed wire, a power drill, a book (hardcover, of course), a nail gun, and even a corkscrew. Such an unusual assortment takes a bit of edge off the the extremely graphic violence. If the kills weren't so gruesome, we might be tempted to chuckle.<br/><br/>Writer Richard Wenk adapts the story from the terrific TV series which ran from 1985-89. It starred the late, great Edward Woodward as a classy, sophisticated guy who believed in justice for those who needed help against the odds. For the movie, Denzel Washington takes over for Mr. Woodward as Robert ""Bob"" McCall ... the seemingly normal guy with extraordinary skills used to balance the scales.<br/><br/>McCall lives a quiet life with OCD tendencies. He is a friendly guy liked by his co-workers at the home improvement box store (imagine Clark Kent working at Home Depot), and even mentors an overweight hispanic young man in his quest to pass the security guard test. McCall is also an insomniac who hangs out after hours reading Hemingway at a local diner, passing along words of hope and wisdom to an underage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz). None of these people have any idea of McCall's previous career with ""the company"". Our only glimpse of this is a quick visit to the home of characters from his past, played by Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman.<br/><br/>Our villains here are the Russian mob, and it's tough to beat that accent for a juicy villain. David Meunier (Johnny Crowder of ""Justified"" fame) is our first goon, followed up by the slick and menacing Marton Csokas (The Debt) who has an impressive resume of his own. It would have been interesting to have more screen time together for Csokas and Denzel, but we understand why that's not practical.<br/><br/>Similar to the Bourne movies, the good guy always seems to be a step ahead of the bad, but that has little impact on our ability to find fun in the action. Director Fuqua provides four or five really stylistic shots (including super slo-mo), but also relies on Michael Bay-splosions for one laughable scene at the loading docks. Another missed opportunity is the score. We are slammed with a thumping bass line through much of the movie, rather than utilizing the Stuart Copeland theme from the TV series. Expect McCall to arrange the flatware just so, and continue to dish out justice in at least one sequel."
"burlesonjesse5","7","2","7","26 September 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Equalizer
","Without hesitation, I will stand by my convictions and say that the crime thriller Training Day was my pick for best film of 2001. Lead actor Denzel Washington won an Oscar playing a revved up Popeye Doyle type (a la The French Connection) and director Antoine Fuqua hurled himself into the spotlight with his fast paced, eclectic shooting style and signature roving camera technique. Now in the fall of 2014, these two have reunited again (and it feels so good, ha!) for The Equalizer, another crime thriller that is based on a fairly successful 80's television series of the same name. Is this film as messy, powerful, dark, cathartic, or as good as Training Day? No not exactly. But if you're a fan of Washington (who isn't) and are curious to see if Fuqua can actually make something worthwhile again (lately he's misfired with flicks like Olympus Has Fallen being a horrible Die Hard ripoff and 2010's Brooklyn's Finest being overlong and out of his collective realm as a filmmaker), then The Equalizer will no doubt satisfy you, the audience member.<br/><br/>With a plot that seems one note at first before kicking into high gear via the second and third act, and an antagonist who resembles Kevin Spacey's evil twin brother in the looks department, The Equalizer follows retired intelligence officer Robert McCall (Washington). Once a trained killer and someone who supposedly had a fellow agent help fake his own death, McCall now leads a boring, middle aged life. He works at I guess, a Home Depot-like hardware store, he lives in a apartment with basically bare walls and a couple of pieces of furniture, he doesn't sleep, he doesn't eat, and when he does go out of his apartment, he frequents a diner where he brings a tea bag with him and orders nothing but hot water (strange don't you think). McCall also reads books like The Invisible Man and The Old Man and the Sea (these books sort of serve as metaphors for the film's storytelling sensibilities) and likes to place silverware and cups on certain spots on a table. Basically, he's an odd, dull dude until Russian gangsters, a common thief, and two dirty cops mess with a few of his acquaintances (Teri, a young prostitute played by the overexposed Chloe Grace Moretz and Ralphie, a budding security guard played by Johnny Skourtis to name two). Within the film's first 30-40 minutes, Washington's McCall (just like his Alonzo Harris in Training Day) gets in big trouble with the Russian Mafia (essentially the film's main plot point). Why? Because he killed five of their U.S. allies in 19 seconds (give or take). They wouldn't give Teri the freedom she deserves from being their sexualized civil servant. So basically in the end, McCall quote unquote ""has to find peace"" by killing this whole Mafia chain. That is The Equalizer in a nutshell and what helps it rise above most crime thrillers is the intelligence of Washington's resurrected character. He's one step ahead of everybody and you never sense that he is in any danger or peril. The whole nature at which he goes about his situation comes off as predictable and pat. To a degree though, it actually works.<br/><br/>Along with having a similar (or almost identical) film score to Training Day (as mentioned earlier) and eerily possessing its various camera angles, The Equalizer didn't so much remind me of ""Day"" as it hinted more towards Washington's 2004 effort, Man on Fire. The themes are similar (you know the act of revenge on the despicable schleps who do harm to the innocent) yet ""Equalizer"" is superior in that Antoine Fuqua doesn't glorify images of grotesque violence coupled with silly, unnecessary subtitles like the late Tony Scott did. He directs with less flash and the results are careful, calculated, and more efficient (just like our hero, Robert McCall). Yes, this flick is violent and at times, Denzel's special ops character dispatches villains in the style of Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th movies (I'm not kidding people). But most of the fight scenes are done with minimal lighting so you don't see a ton of blood and gore. And to assure you that someone is taking a beating, the sound effects with every bone break/throat slash, are louder than they need to be (a Fuqua trademark).<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, this is essentially a thirteen year reunion of a movie featuring director Fuqua and his can't miss collaborator in star Washington. It's a serviceable effort despite descending into your standard, routine bloody action fare towards its conclusion. It works ultimately because of Denzel who along with Al Pacino and Liam Neeson, is up there with being one of my favorite movie stars of all time. If you cut his arm (hypothetically speaking of course), he would literally bleed cool. With the exception of kicking every one's butt all over the place in ""Equalizer"", he actually underplays this performance. Instead of emoting like a monkey on amphetamines like he did volcanically in Training Day, he instead relies on a natural, burning screen presence and a cool walk through a room exuding confidence and some serious swag. If you choose to take in a viewing of The Equalizer, know that 100% of what goes on involves Washington doing the whole One Man Army thing. Thankfully, he separates himself from the pack (you know, the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and the Seagals) by being a better actor than most action stars, exuding some sophistication on eluding (or infiltrating) the bad guys, and essentially showing the audience how the art of being a one man vigilante would realistically go down. So for those reasons, you should buy a ticket, get settled in this fall, and wait for the lights to dim. After taking in an early matinÃ©e, The Equalizer ""equaled"" three stars for me. I think you'll enjoy it as well."

","Superb movie! However, I could not understand the dialogue between the woman (CIA??FBI?? Secret Service??) sitting on the porch with Denzel visited (from his past). Her dialogue was vaguely about ""giving him permission"" to resume his ""equalizer"" tasks, just one more time or ""its okay to ""equalize"" since that portion of the promise was delivered to this deceased wife without wholeness. anyway, if someone could send me the dialogue between the two, I would appreciate it very much.<br/><br/>I especially thought that the most critical scene occurred in the Home Depot location wherein Robert ingeniously never used a gun to defeat his enemy. Additionally, I applaud the security guard for his unselfish assistance in ""never leaving anyone behind"" even though, he seemed to be mentally injured."

","""The great and abiding lesson of American history, particularly the cold war, is that the engine of capitalism, the individual, is mightier than any collective."" Rand Paul<br/><br/>He's not the detached Jason Bourne and he's not the swinging Bond, but Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is tougher than the two. A modest Home Mart employee, he has a past no one knows about. When asked by some young co-workers, he admits to being a ""Pip,"" as in Gladys. So goes Robert's infrequent wit in the exciting The Equalizer, based on an ancient TV show.<br/><br/>Although he has a limited sense of humor, his past working for a federal investigative agency was intense and unusual enough that he went into a protection plan with a new life. While visiting a diner straight out of Hopper (he is a ""nighthawk""), he meets very young escort Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and spends the rest of the movie revisiting his considerable killing skills to protect her.<br/><br/>So far nothing new except no romance, many clichÃ©s, and stereotypes (especially the Russian mobsters and their thugs). However Denzel brings a quiet competence and compassion to Robert's character despite kicking ass every few minutes. Thus, consider the relevance of Rand Paul's comment introducing this essay about the power of the individual. Liberals, however, will enjoy the action with its mixture of caring and retribution.<br/><br/>Interestingly, although the Equalizer doesn't stray far from the thriller formula, the characters are unique enough to enlist your sympathy, and we all know from our Greek dramas the importance of having sympathy for the hero.<br/><br/>One of the more fascinating motifs is creative killing, wherein at one point, the hero uses material in the home improvement building to take out the Russians. The killing is clean, there's little blood, and it's fun to watch if you enjoy that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Given the heat generated by Putin over the Ukraine, this smart film is prescient about the resurgence of Cold War situations and attitudes:<br/><br/>""The Cold War isn't thawing; it is burning with a deadly heat. Communism isn't sleeping; it is, as always, plotting, scheming, working, fighting."" Richard Nixon"

"CowherPowerForever","8","2","8","28 September 2014"," When you Pray For Rain, you Have to Deal with the Mud too
","The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington is a nicely written story, that is based on the hit 1980s television show of the same name starring Edward Woodward, which ran for four seasons. While I never had the chance to watch the television series before the film, I truly believe this hardcore action film did it justice. If you want a hard R action film with over the top violence and fantastic acting, this is the film for you. The following is my review of The Equalizer.<br/><br/>The film was written by Richard Wenk who recently wrote such films as The Expendables 2 and The Mechanic. So his experience is basically in minimal story action films. Frankly though, in this film, that doesn't show at all. The characters are written greatly for the most part, and the depth of the characters carries the film. The story follows Robert McCall(Denzel Washington as he is a man with a mysterious past and we learn a little about that past as the story follows along. McCall has been laying low and working at a home improvement store. As bad events break out around him, his past experience finally get it's calling once more. McCall delivers so much mayhem in this film, and without spoiling the movie, I cannot correctly described the mayhem McCall brings to the bad guys in this film, though I will not be delivering those spoilers. The film has many slow parts to it. If you walk into the movie expecting action non stop throughout the majority of the film, you will leave disappointed. However, if you can hold judgement until the film is completely over, you will find a fantastic action film. In the slower moving scenes of the film, the acting really pays off. So, overall Wenk delivers a solid story will an amazing pay off for us true action fans.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Antoine Fuqua who is well known for such films as Training Day, Shooter, and the big hit of 2013 Olympus Has Fallen. While this film doesn't have the pacing of Olympus Has Fallen, the action, when it does pop up, is fierce and close to stomach turning. There are a good bit of nicely innovative death scenes to leave you wanting more as you leave the theater. With only a few major action scenes, Fuqua brings some nice camera work in the close combat fighting scenes. While I cannot say the effort is perfect, if you go to the theater expecting a fun action film with tons of violence, then you will greatly enjoy your time during this film. As I mentioned above the film does slow down as the story builds up. With great acting from Denzel Washington, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Marton Csokas, and David Harbour, the slower story building scenes are well worth watching if you enjoy some character driven elements. Denzel always dominates the roles he is in, and while he goes a step up in this film, I really felt Marton Csokas(Teddy) plays a fantastic bad guy, even if he is written somewhat inept at times. Overall, Fuqua delivers some amazing fun with The Equalizer, and fans of fun action and great acting will really enjoy his efforts.<br/><br/>The film was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams who has recently scored such films as Total Recall(2012) and Cowboys & Aliens. I really enjoy a score that adds amazing depth, and the score from Harry Gregson-Williams is fantastic. When the action picks up towards the end of the film, there is a wonderful piece that played, and it honestly got me at the edge of my seat during the nail biting scene. If you really enjoy a nice score with your film, the effort Harry Gregson-Williams delivers is top notch in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoy some action fun, this is clearly the film for you. The film has its faults, and could be considered boring at times as the film has a good bit of character driven dialogue. Some may consider that a minus but, with such an amazing cast of actors, you barely even notice that. The film features a lot of over the top action scenes via hand to hand combat and some interesting death scenes which should get even the most picky fans out to the theater. Frankly, if you are reading this review, I highly recommend this film to everyone. There is no reason to miss this film. It was that amazing and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I also want to touch on the IMAX version of the film, as this is the version I watched. For a ticket price of fifteen dollars(in my area, could be higher or lower in your area), the extra money is not really worth it unless your theater's other screens are sub-par. This IMAX version, as usual, adds amazing depth with the sound. However, since the film was not actually shot using IMAX cameras, the image doesn't live up to IMAX films that were actually shot with IMAX cameras. I would say it is personal preference but, with tickets in IMAX costing so much, you might want to save the extra five dollars or so, unless you can get a discount showing.<br/><br/>8/10"

Chole Grace Moretz is also good, the amount of minutes she's in it. The actors playing the bad guys are great, there cunning and menacing. The movie has you on the edge of your seat, believe me you won't be disappointed."

","Trigger Warning(s): Depictions of torture and up close murders<br/><br/>It can be argued that when it comes to Black actors who are well established, like Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, and Forest Whitaker, that they all have found a certain comfort zone in their acting choices. However, while on paper it may make seeing them in similar roles over and over bland, while viewing the movie you often are reminded why they are allowed this amount of comfort in the first place. For while many will compare this film to Man on Fire, which honestly it only has similarities to since it is Denzel going on a rampage to save a white girl, that is where the comparisons begin and end.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>Robert (Denzel Washington) works at Home Depot and has found himself to be the father figure around the place. The young dudes idolize him, and want to know what he did before working there, the women find him attractive, and he treats them all with respect, a bit of charm and, whether asked or not, he will help them anyway possible. Like with Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), he helps him go from working the floor to being Home Depot security, and then with Teri, real name Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz), he helps her believe in herself, as well as give her a second chance. Something which isn't easy to do for with Teri being young, beautiful, and worth a lot of money, her pimp Slavi (David Meunier) doesn't want to let her go. So, Robert tries to help her. Thing is, as Robert tries to help her he gets involved with the whole business which got Teri to America in the first place. Meaning he has to climb the chain in order to regain any sense of peace in his life.<br/><br/>Leading to the main story of the film which deals with Robert taking on the Russian mafia, headed by Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Julich), a well-connected gangster, and his enforcer/ fixer Teddy (Marton Csokas). But, as well trained and talented as Robert is, he does show signs of aging. Leading you to wonder, in his quest to free one girl from human trafficking, how will he ultimately find peace? With a bullet in the head, but her free? With the snake's head cut off and him going back to being just an unknown face? Or will he find himself without peace for as he tries to climb the ladder, those he loved and wanted to protect end up falling off the roof?<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>In this film, Washington reminds you why his career spans over 30 years and why he is considered a legend in the film business. For while the story, as a whole, doesn't do anything drastically new or different from films with a similar premise, Washington puts his mark on it in such a way that he leaves you feeling the genre has found a new standard to live up to. For Robert is a man who you can see is conflicted about what he does, wants to create the sort of normalcy he sacrificed for most of his life, but at the same time he can't stop being the man who takes care of people when in need. Be it this kid at work who wants to be something more than he is, or this little girl who has lived a hard life but dreams that she can escape it and become better.<br/><br/>Now, as for the action elements of the movie, truly if you are squeamish you may want to be careful with this one for this is a violent movie. For with Robert having this Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr.'s, version, of slowing down time to analyze things, and then really going all out, including using a wine opener to kill someone and us seeing the wine opener in the mouth of someone Robert just stabbed in the jaw, truly the film does get graphic.<br/><br/>And while Washington deserves much praise, I feel you must also praise Csokas too for being a credible villain. If just because his performance, and the build of his character, is so good you honestly think when him and Washington go one on one, there is a more likely chance of them both dying than Washington being alive after their battle. Something which is hard to do since Washington is at the point in his career where it almost feels like there won't be any surprises when it comes to his character. He is either going to live until the end or somehow come up on top. However, Csokas makes you question Washington's celebrity having an effect on whether Robert will live or die.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>First and foremost, I'm rather tired of Russian villains with the names Vladimir, Dmitri, and just Russian bad guys period. It's overdone, and at this point feels kind of lazy. Though the film in itself is very basic and only elevated due to strong performances. However, if anyone else was casted as Robert or Teddy, this film would probably be a straight to VoD release. Mostly because, as lovable as Robert is, you don't get any sort of concrete details about him. You learn he worked for the government, had a wife, but pretty much that is where things end. Robert, for the most part, is as unknown to us in the end as he was in the beginning.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>Between Washington and Csokas, I feel future action crime thrillers need to take note. For as previously noted, this film takes all the basic elements very familiar to movie lovers and pushes the bar up. Leading to a ""Worth Seeing"" label from me."

A worthy adaptation/update of the series as we watch the retired ""operator"" put his unique skillset to use to help people. I can see this turning into a franchise - Liam better look out :) One thing struck me (hence the title of the review) - it very much felt like McCall could be John Creasy redeemed and trying to lead a quiet life. Without spoilers let's just say the look and feel and one or two hints point you to the conclusion that just maaaaaaaybe Washington and Fuqua were looking for a way to get a MoF vibe going with a new direction"

","THE EQUALIZER (2014) *** Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, Chloe Grace Moretz, David Harbour, Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, David Meunier, Johnny Skourtis, Haley Bennett. Big-screen loose adaptation of the cult '80s TV series with Edward Woodward tailored to the finesse of slow-burn Washington as an ex-CIA op whose attempt to keep a low-profile is thwarted when a young prostitute (Moretz) is endangered by her pimp who turns out to be knee-deep involved with the Russian mob who wants vengeance swiftly (and painfully) led by glowering Csokas (a shark in a silk suit incarnate). Washington in in superb form and reunited with skillful filmmaker Antoine Fuqua (who collaborated on TRAINING DAY which scored Washington his Best Actor Oscar) with stealth and lethal ease and a sharp and grittily dark screenplay by Richard Wenk."
"realmuthaf","7","2","9","26 September 2014"," Denzel still delivers.
","While not being somewhat outstanding, The Equalizer is still a potent, albeit a bit too slow-paced, action movie. The plot, obviously, is not very original, so the main question was how good it would be executed.The result is mostly satisfying, among the strong sides I'd name: of course Denzel Washington, who never disappoints (although his other movies I've seen were better), gory action and the overall classic action movie feel to it - the hero is super bad-ass, always walking slowly, dispensing kickassery and not looking at explosions, while the villain is properly menacing and ruthless. The movie's not without flaws, and shaky camera work during action scenes, overly slow pacing and the stereotypical bad guys are among them. (Russian gangsters with cheesy tattoos, lots of vodka and tons of Kremlin and Red Square pictures) Despite that, the movie manages to hold its own and be worth your time and money. It's quite refreshing to watch an old-school bad- ass-distributing-justice movie after all those comic book adaptations and the rule ""Denzel doesn't play in bad movies"" still works."

"breathedirt","10","1","3","28 June 2018"," Breathtaking, phenomenal, astounding, remarkable!
","There's always something to improve but I had to give this movie 10/10. It movie was simply remarkable, and even though the story was predictable to an extent, It seemed to me as if every scene of the movie was carefully planned, directed, reviewed and redirected to make it look meaningful and extraordinary. At the very beginning there are several scenes shot at a small cafeteria where Denzel goes to read books and which also a young escort girl frequents. When they are having a conversation, the escort girl surprises Denzel with her knowledge of people - the small clues she learned to observe about people when working as an escort (""I'm Teri."" ""Bob."" ""You don't look like a Bob. You look like a Robert. Robert reads books like this. Bob watches TV.""). When she is severely beaten up by her pimp, Denzel decides to come back from his retirement and bring justice one last time. He then kills her pimp and everyone else in the room who underestimated him because of his age and calm personality. When Nicolai (Marton Csokas) comes to the city to clean up the mess and get rid of the killer (Denzel), he gathers all the information available until he narrows down the suspects to Denzel and pays him a visit impersonating a police officer investigating a murder (when leaving - ""I'll be in touch."" ""Don't you want to leave me your card, officer, in case I remember anything? That's what you policemen usually do, right?"" ""Must have given them all out."" ""How did you find me?""). Last but not least, the ending fighting scene was simply phenomenal - it was like Home Alone for adults - Denzel as Kevin and Marton with his mercenaries as the burglars who in this R-rated version didn't end up in jail. By the way, I really don't understand the negative reviews here. Enjoy!"
"cshafkat-79041","9","1","3","27 April 2018"," Just amazing
","This movie was simply superb!! The plot is very simple yet manages to make a huge impact on the audience. The director has shown that a simple plot can be made into a brilliant movie. Cheers to Mr. Fuqua for that.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting, Denzel Washington was just too good in his role. I believe no one else could have portrayed Robert McCall any better in a movie than him. The intensity that his character was supposed to possess was clearly shown. Chloe-Grace Moretz as the teenage prostitute was also good in her small role. The villain played by Marton Csokas was also good.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie are its themes which are dark, gritty and violent. The action scenes were very well done especially the climax scene in the warehouse. <br/><br/>Another thing I loved is the concept of the movie. Denzel plays an ex-CIA special forces officer who left his job to live a quiet life as he promised his deceased wife. But seeing a young girl in trouble, he decides to get back in action and goes on a violent rampage against the Russian mafia. In a certain way this movie sends a great message to the society that there are still good people out there who are ready to help all those who are oppressed. Watching this movie will make you wish for the existence of someone like Robert McCall in real life who would provide vigilante justice which is something the world desperately needs especially with all the atrocities being commited around the world on certain groups
of people.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie and a wonderful action thriller which also has a good story that the audience can enjoy and I'm eagerly waiting for The Equalizer II."

I guess it is simply too much to make a movie of just a normal guy or gal who gives to others. The subtext here is important--we need mentors, especially those who can defend the weak, innocent, and vulnerable! It gives hope and restores dignity from those who rob it."
"meltdownmonk","8","1","3","15 September 2016"," Fun Action Thriller; What the Punisher should have been
","I never thought of Denzel Washington as an action hero actor until watching this film. The more I watched, the more it felt like a super-hero film, and then by the end of it, it felt like a slasher film, with Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) as the monster/serial killer. The plot is the typical one-sided hero wins every fight is essentially immortal type deal. Robert McCall is a good citizen day and night, helping his co-worker get a security job, and befriending an escort and encouraging her to change her life into what she wants. There was so much focus on the character and his habits, and his relationships, i couldn't help but fall in love with the movie (I prefer sentimental movies with a lot of heart) It may have been cheesy, but I was sucked right in, and yet also anticipating some serious destruction and violence.. I was almost scared to see it happen. <br/><br/>The fight scenes are brutal and quick, but take moments to dwell on the method of death. McCall has what I would call OCD or extreme attention to detail superpowers, and precise timing of everything he does. He's a complete nightmare for everyone he comes up against, and yet also seems completely harmless, so when he makes his offers to each and every criminal (except the last one) to stop what they are doing, and change, almost nobody listens to him, and an action scene ensues. <br/><br/>Despite the fact you know he's going to win every fight, the movie still keeps you on edge. The director likes to dwell on certain shots for extended periods of time. The violence made me cringe and even look away more than once. The exaggerated scenes result in a dark, stylized, moody and intense artsy and overindulgent kind of feel. <br/><br/>This is the movie that the Punisher should have been. In the Punisher, it was very difficult to care about the character. In the Equalizer, it was hard not to. And they do little to describe his past, which adds to the mystique, and mystery of McCall. <br/><br/>A Monster, a Super Hero, a Action star. Denzel was turned into something like a Jack Reacher/Jason Bourne/Riddick/Bryan Mills in this movie. Dangerous, Thoughtful, Smart, maybe lacking in depth, but plenty or pure action roller coaster ride. Thank you Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua for the entertainment!"
"kenL-gonzo","8","1","3","17 August 2016"," Beautiful, Done Right Movie
","This, was the best action I've seen in a long time. Let me explain: The story is, Denzel is a retired man from an obviously highly trained organization, trying to normally live his life, and gets influenced by a sad prostitute that wants to sing. So, he goes on a rampage killing people to get her wish. That may sound like a trope, but no other movie does it better. Yes, it wasn't the best movie ever, but no movie gets everything right.<br/><br/>You think the clichÃ©s made it terrible? Well many movies would have a hard time making content to put in if they avoided all the clichÃ©s you think make movies worse. I loved this simple good guy doing the right think movie, and Denzel is definitely better than Arnold at this kinda movie."

","A very entertaining revenge movie. Not too far removed from Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" or Jean Reno in ""Leon."" And it has a nicely aggressive surround sound track. We watched it at home and several times we had helicopters flying through our viewing room, and the several explosions shook the pictures on the wall.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, he is a gentle man who works at a Home Depot type of store in Boston, and spends many of his evenings at a small table in a dive of a corner cafÃ©, reading one book or another. But we find that he has a mysterious past as a highly trained killer.<br/><br/>He strikes up an unlikely friendship with ChloÃ« Grace Moretz as Teri, and he soon finds she is being held hostage and mistreated in the oldest profession, a prostitution ring run by the Russian mob. Bob is sort of able to ignore it until Teri ends up in the hospital, in intensive care. After his offer to buy out her contract is rebuffed and laughed at, he goes to work to exterminate the mob.<br/><br/>The main enforcer from Russia is sent to find out who was doing all this and to exterminate him, New Zealand actor Marton Csokas as Teddy. Both he and Washington are good in their roles and the last 30 minutes are the most exciting, including a big battle of wits in the big hardware store.<br/><br/>Edit: July 2019 - Just watched it again, really entertaining movie, Denzel is great.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the big store the Russian guys are killed one by one, using different and unique ways. Barbed wire to hang one of them, a cordless drilling into the back of the skull of another, hedge trimmers through the neck of another, a microwave-induced explosion for another. But in the climax Teddy was done in by a powerful nail gun. Then three days later Bob was in Moscow visiting the big boss, and set things up so he electrocuted himself after his shower."

","I am writing this review just to do what I can in my small way to lower the viewer rating for this movie (if that is what it was). I can only speculate that the majority of viewers saw another movie, certainly not the one that I tried to watch. I did not stay to the end but that is because the older I get the less inclined I am to torture myself. I simply refuse to believe that somewhere in this country that there are not writers who could actually write a screenplay for Denzel Washington that would at least rise to the level of mediocrity. The writing in this movie could only have been dreamed up by a social deviant during a root canal. It scares me to think that anyone around me might find such violent moronic tripe to be entertainment.

I loved 2 Guns and I was really looking forward to this one; The Equalizer. It's definitely one of the better action films released in recent years.<br/><br/>Some bad stuff: I really don't think ChloÃ« Grace Moretz was suited for this role. Also, her relationship with Denzel was fake as hell.<br/><br/>A lot of the film (all of it) was highly manipulative: Denzel is everybody's saviour, sad music at all the right moments (and there're a lot of them), waaay over the top slow motion usage etc.<br/><br/>The bad guy was super cheesy although I do like the actor in other films.<br/><br/>Good stuff: The action.

","I really enjoyed ""The Equalizer"". Denzel gives a fine performance as the cool-as-ice professional who sorts out the bad guys, and ""equalizes"" the equation. It's a role we've seen him do before in ""Man on Fire"", and he gives a seasoned performance again here. The action was well paced, and the story built nicely to a satisfying climax. Certainly the story was somewhat predictable, with the final outcome all but inevitable, but if you like films where good triumphs over evil, and does so violently (ala ""Taken (2008)"", ""Leon: The Professional (1994)), then this film will not disappoint. My only real criticism, and this is really nit-picking, was the song during the final credits. I'll say up front that I'm not an Eminem fan, but I found the lyrics distasteful and ""singing""irritating. Just my opinion, but it left an unfortunate final impression. 8/10"
"nightwing90","7","1","3","21 November 2014"," Old School Action
","A one man show from Denzel Washington in The Equaliser makes it an engaging action movie even though the film is too predictable and clichÃ©d. Smart dialogues, old and conventional but good doses of action and above all a stylish performance from the Academy Award winner DW makes this film a watchable one. Robert McCall who is leading a quiet and peaceful life after retiring as a Black Ops Commando is forced out of his self imposed exile to get back to where he was and what he does best. On trying to help his female friend Alina who is a sex slave in the hands of her pimp, McCall confront and take down the Russian mafia single handedly to extract revenge.<br/><br/>Story wise, the film has nothing new to showcase but Washington deserves full marks to make the film a watchable one through his smart and stylish acting , action and dialogue presentation. Its not that we have action each and every scene but an action mood is created throughout the entire length of the film.<br/><br/>On the acting side, as said earlier its more or less a one man show from Denzel Washington and he is supported well by a host of other actors especially Marton Czokas enacting the character of Teddy the main henchman of Russian mafia don Pushkin.<br/><br/>Nice camera work and cuts along with impressive background score too. But the VFX had some drawbacks, to be specific the bombing scene of undercover building of the gangsters. The latter portions have been too stretched and deserved a trimming of ten to fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Overall, here is a money worth old school action and revenge movie for a target audience that serves its purpose and i go with seven out of ten for The Equaliser. With a sequel in the early planning stages doing the talk, its better you get a feel of the movie now and get ready for more thrills."
"sujanfaster","7","1","3","24 October 2014"," Washington in Driver's seat
","I love it when old guys do the ""coming out of the hibernation"" action movies. So I am going to be partial with this review. After a loud ""Olympus Has Fallen"", Fuqua comes out with a bit more subtle action movie this time. It's not complete popcorn stuff. But it's a must watch for Washington's fans. He occupies almost every frame of the movie (no kidding!). The story is pretty simple. But screenplay is well handled. The movie might bore the family audience at times, but not for long. <br/><br/>Movie is about how a former CIA (clichÃ© I know) operative takes on Russian gangsters and the whole mob to save a girl whom he meets at a bar. There are some subplots as well to show how our protagonist is a ""Knight in shining armour, except he is living in the world where the knights won't exist anymore"". They add a nice build up to Washington's character and climax.<br/><br/>Antonie Fuqua has showed his ability to extract the best from Washington again. Chloe Grace Mortiz has a significant role but she doesn't get much of the screenspace. Marton Csokas gets to play a Russian guy again. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo add strength to the star cast. <br/><br/>There might be a sequel to this movie as there are certain hints regarding the way Washigton's character is portrayed in the movie. When Denzel Washington gives a cold stare and says ""16 seconds"" in that voice, I am not complaining. Are you?"

","""...Brick by brick, dollar by dollar, body by body, I promised I wouldn't go back to being that person...But for you, I'm going to make an exception..."" This is what Denzel, being an absolute badass, says that to his enemy in a key scene of the film. Just when you think Liam Neeson was great as a lone-wolf action hero in Taken (2008), here comes Denzel Washington, upping the ante as McCall, the Equalizer. Yeah, I was completely sold by his performance.<br/><br/>Based on the 1985 TV series of the same name, Denzel stars as McCall, a retired man with a shady past, armed with a formidable set of skills like no other, chose to work at a Home Depot hardware store and lives a quiet, peaceful life. However, he soon discovers all the injustice that are happening around the neighbourhood and decides to take matters into his own hands to 'equalize' the situation by helping the helpless.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I couldn't provide any comparisons with the old TV series as I've never watched any of the episodes before. Similar to Taken (2008) or Man On Fire (2004), I don't deny the fact that the film has a preposterous premise. One guy against the entire mob? Seriously? However, despite its silliness, Denzel Washington - a two-time Academy Award winner with numerous bad-ass roles in the past such as Man on Fire (2004), The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), The Book of Eli (2010) and Unstoppable (2010), managed to deliver a strong, convincing performance with some very catchy, powerful punchlines that actually makes the viewers believe that he's the guy who is really capable of taking down the entire Russian mafia on his own. He owns the character and makes the character come to life on screen.<br/><br/>Aside from that, we get to know him just from his expressions when his personal background is briefly mentioned in the film. Although the film relies on a few plot contrivances for it to work (typical issue for most action thrillers) and it also includes the much overused 'walk-away' explosion scene again, but Denzel just look so bad-ass whenever he fights on screen that I willing to overlook some of its flaws.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Marton Csokas did a great job in his portrayal of Teddy/Nikolai, the intimidating and menacing Russian mob fixer who's sent by the mob to deal with the situation. There's one particular disturbing scene in which he slowly circles a terror-stricken prostitute while comforting and reassuring her that it's going to be okay before leading her to an inevitable fate. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz did a fine job as Teri as well. It's such a shame that she was taken off screen rather early in the film, only to reappear again in the final moments.<br/><br/>The film gives a satisfying climax and the action is well choreographed. Another notable mention is that the film contains a lot of bloody and gory violence. If some viewers feel uncomfortable with on-screen gruesome violent fights, then in that case it's probably not advisable to watch this film. However, please keep in mind that these people (the mafia characters the actors portrayed) are not considered as humans, but merciless scumbags. They treat women as nothing other than sexual objects for money, willing to kill anyone without hesitation or remorse, thinking they're high and mighty and forcibly exert authority and influence over others. In the film, McCall gave them a choice beforehand, but they choose to belittle him instead. So, violence was necessary and they've got exactly what they deserve. To be honest, I don't feel sorry for them at all.<br/><br/>Overall, the film exceeds all my expectations. The film delivers, in spades. I expect Denzel Washington to kick some criminal ass and I've gotten more than I bargained for. Gruesome and brutal, but highly rewarding. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-equalizer.html<br/><br/>""One day someone does something unspeakable to someone you hardly knew, so you do something about it because no one else is going to...Because you can."""

","This Movie has it all,...<br/><br/>The Good: Denzel Whashington, Great Presents, just a few more Lines and a slower Backstory would have been nice. He is Doing a Great Job.<br/><br/>The Sound is Great too, mix well with the Style of that film.<br/><br/>The Filming was very good too. Very Stylish, cool almost understated, the used CGI blend in well isn't to much overstated. This Aspect was done right.<br/><br/>***LITTLE SPOILERS AHEAD (i keep em down i promise)*** The Bad: The Storyline. It doesn't make any sense why after he decided to start his war also a lot of other people, not related to the Mob, crossing his path in a bloody way. Also Nobody seems to bother afterward, he still can visit his old cafÃ©, living in the same neighborhood, nobody specially not the Police cares much. Also the Action of the Russian Mobster who came to investigate doesn't make any sense. All his actions where for no reason and no purpose.<br/><br/>Also the jumps and almost fast tracks of short story lines made no sense. Less would have been more. More slow calm backstory about his personality and life, less small action plot and more logic would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>Also the complete absence how he is doing his secret spy work isn't really satisfying. He is working like a ghost not only to the enemy but also the the audience. This give the movie a certain character but sadly it was replaced by dull action sequences.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The fighting scenes (some of them). Its laughable how those Mobster with their 50k Equipment even go into a fight, they acted like some lemmings (in the game) not like some ex military mobster muscles.<br/><br/>ANd why again was the Mobster hunting the security guard? ***MORE SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Also if someone get shot in his shoulder, you can really fight with it after, you can simply burn it to close it and keep going, there are broken bones, there is a projectile, that he is fixing himself under a shelf while ex-speznatz with nightvision looking for him .. well sorry that was too much.<br/><br/>The Worst action sequence where that nail pistol can shoot over 20 yards, penetrate (didn't he have a bullet resistant west?) a hole body and go trough.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: This Movie has its Moments and is often beautiful to watch but again and again bad writers ruined it. There would have been potential but it wasn't used. Its still very good watchable only for Dencel himself."

","This kept me interested until the last 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Denzel W does a great ""man on fire"" job as a man on a mission. The story develops well and there are plenty satisfying bad-assery scenes. It keeps the ""ex-bad-guy"" mystery throughout and delivers plenty of good moments.<br/><br/>It's let down by a terribly clichÃ©d ending - it was running at an 8/10 until the end and if I were to rate the ending it would be 4/10, but it doesn't seem fair to downgrade the entire movie based on the utterly cheesy closing 5 minutes.<br/><br/>All in all an enjoyable way to spend the evening."
"Prismark10","5","1","4","16 December 2014"," Even the odds
","The Equalizer television series was an unlikely hit. It featured an old British actor playing a tough guy retired CIA operative who rights wrongs and not afraid to use violence.<br/><br/>The film has little relation to the television show apart from the title and the character name who is also an ex CIA operative. Denzel Washington is actually several years older than Edward Woodward when he first played the title role.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua who directed Denzel to a Best Actor Oscar teams up with him again. The film starts slowly, we see McCall working for a Home Depot type warehouse, helping his fellow workers and spending his evening in a diner reading a book. However the fate of a Russian call girl makes him angry and hell bent on equalizing the score with her gangster pimps. However their overlord sends a dangerous Russian hit-man over to find out who is responsible and when he crosses McCall's path he knows he was the culprit and sets out to get him.<br/><br/>The film starts off slowly, maybe too slowly. People forget Denzel is not an action star, he has made several action films in the past and rather a few have disappointed. For every Man on Fire there is a Virtuosity.<br/><br/>However when Denzel gets into action its brutal and blood-soaked as he uses the tools he has at hand, rather handy when he works at a hardware warehouse. Martin Csokas plays a fine gangster, lean, smart, suited and brutal. You look forward to his showdown with Denzel which also has shades of Home Alone.<br/><br/>It is ultimately an OK film, nothing outstanding, maybe slightly overlong and within a few days easily forgotten."

","Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) should be a super-hero. After all only a super-hero can destroy in 28 seconds the US East Coast command center of the Russian mafia (actually exceeding by 9 seconds his plans), can survive an army of armed and dangerous enemies in a Home Depot, even saving the lives of all his good friends, and then take a flight to Russia to destroy the whole organization's brains in the viper's nest.<br/><br/>It is actually the anti-hero vision of the character that gives this story a high dose of credibility. Yes, I am incredulous of having said it :-) Denzel's character building is so rigorous, so precise, so human that he not only builds himself as the positive character we as viewers can sympathize with, but also lightens the whole story, which otherwise would be a brutal encounter between yet another retired agent and the world which would not let him enjoy his quiet reading and lattes at night hours, a world full of violence, of human traffic, of ladies in distress silently shouting for help with nobody to hear but Hollywood super-heroes.<br/><br/>Director Antoine Fuqua seems to make amends to me for Olympus Has Fallen which I liked much less for various reasons. I would have liked Chloe Grace Moretz to be more on screen, but her absence for much of the screen time after having been the trigger of the story has logic. The Equalizer is based on a TV series from the 80s which I did not see or maybe I forgot, but there is enough good material in this film - including mystery hints about Robert McCall's past including a tragically lost love - to make me hope that this is another start of a series, on big screen this time."

"khanbaliq2","6","1","4","29 October 2014"," Watching The Equalizer is almost like watching the Iraq War.
","The Equalizer is one very brutal film. There's hardly any humor in it and, at times, it's violent in the extreme. It's definitely not something that you should watch with your girlfriend because it deals with prostitution, corruption, murder, loss and the underworld. If The Equalizer didn't contain any action it would have been a truly depressing and unpleasant viewing experience. I guess the only reason to see this film is Denzel Washington, who plays Robert McCall. One can think of The Equalizer as a superhero movie because of its break with reality and McCall's ability to kill people in impressive and often ridiculous ways. McCall also has a knack for avoiding injury and he deals with the bad guys mostly at night. There are attempts in Richard Wenk's screenplay to develop the characters but they don't go far, and the result is a simple fight of good against evil. The mobsters are mostly clichÃ©s, their victims are clichÃ©s, and the only thing that McCall has to decide is whether or not he should again become the unstoppable killing machine that he was before. The gruesome and violent action scenes manage to entertain because of Washington's slow-burn, perfectly modulated performance. It's just shootouts and fights. There's nothing new or original about them even if they are expertly staged. As the film moves along it gets more and more ridiculous, going from McCall wanting to help a brutalized girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) to McCall taking on almost the whole mafia underworld, foreign and domestic. The Equalizer is no Lethal Weapon (1987) or Die Hard (1988). It's more like Death Wish (1974). The film isn't really entertaining but it can be compelling, especially when the mobsters try to find McCall and take him down. I don't recommend The Equalizer because it's not much of a thriller and it's not much of an action movie. It has its moments but it's predictable, brutal and mostly forgettable."
"James_De_Bello","6","1","4","15 October 2014"," 6.5/10
","Forget originality, forget emotional depth, forget interesting storytelling and you will have the same fun I had in the theater with ""The Equalizer"". It's pretty obvious that I wasn't going in expecting an Oscar contender, I just wanted to see Denzel be badass. Even though the film doesn't really succeed one hundred percent as a good action flick it still has many enjoyable aspects.<br/><br/>Firstly, foremost and obviously: Denzel. There's really nothing that I can say that has yet to be said on him, he is just awesome, charismatic and badass. He has the ability of gluing you to the screen and without him the movie wouldn't exist. The other highlight in the cast is definitely Marton Csokas. Again nor Robert McCall nor Teddy have any actual depth as hero or villain, but the actors playing them really do a great job and contribute hugely to the fun factor of the movie. There is lots of unexpected violence that firstly caught me by surprise, but as the film went on it made it all the more exaggerated and enjoyable. Finally the action scenes are all very well staged, even though they don't do anything new they have a great vibe. Most of all the final climactic scene was actually pretty suspenseful and carried on for just the right time.<br/><br/>On whole ""The Equalizer"" was all of the above, but it really fell flat in doing anything to make it a superior action movie. It is filled with clichÃ©s, a couple of useless characters and should have been cut by at least ten minutes. Moreover the visual style of the movie offers some good, well staged action scenes, but for the rest doesn't feel shot that well. There were sometimes where I blinked at the screen because of poor lighting. The closure of the movie is totally silly and cheesy. Finally Denzel's character is never, ever in danger and as much as it was fun looking at him being a badass it didn't add up to a cool hero: the stakes were never there.<br/><br/>The film is just another action movie with very few brains, seeing it in the theater is worth the experience, but I don't think I will ever watch this again."
"Seraphion","6","1","4","3 October 2014"," Nice acting but a bit confused on the character build up
","McCall looks like a normal man who works at a home DIY supply store. Helping coworkers and leading a routine life, he does also have peculiar habits of bringing supplies of his own even when dining at his frequent diner. There he meets Teri, a girl hooked onto some nasty men. Standing idle when seeing Teri being picked up forcefully, McCall takes action after one night he finds her beaten up badly. McCall quickly dispatches five Russian mobsters when a deal for Teri, whose real name is Alina, goes sour, The mafia boss in Moscow sends in Teddy his ex Spetznas henchman to track the killer. Meanwhile, McCall lies low after the incident, but it turns out that his own sense of justice is rekindled, secretly exacting vengeance toughly and often violently those who he encounters while being wronged. <br/><br/>His actions soon lead him to focus on disrupting the New York branch of the Russian mafia's operation. Teddy finally catches up to him. After escaping several of Teddy's attempts on his life, McCall contacts his old colleagues in the CIA for info on Teddy. It turns out that McCall was an elite black ops operative who faked his own death in exchange for a quiet life. With his new info, McCall plans to take out the Russian mafia kingpin, Pushkin. But Teddy finds McCall's 'weakness', those he cares about. He then takes McCall's coworkers as hostages to reel him in. McCall tactically dispatches Teddy and his men, without having any conventional weapon. He then finishes his plan on Pushkin, making it to look like an accident. After that McCall receives many e-mails asking for help on similar cases.<br/><br/>The story kind of opens weakly, focusing on the mystery of the main character's background and building on the peculiar things he does. This approach kind of loses its relevance when out of a sudden McCall launches on his slow motion weakness analysis scene. If not for the promotion as a action movie and the TV series background, not many viewers will get the connection between McCall and his ability here. Also, the slow motion analysis thing is nothing new as we can have a better and more entertaining version in Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes movies. They are more detailed with all those commentaries on them.<br/><br/>Again, having the main character's background not developed adequately feels quite strange to those who watch this movie without knowing beforehand the movie's background as based on a TV series. This feels strange because the movie has so many places to put hints and minor details that could subtly point McCall's background out. <br/><br/>Well at least the story unravels itself very much predictably. That means there's nothing unpredictable with this movie, no surprising plot twist nor a grand finale. There's even a poorly done story deviation on the sequence of Teddy's brush with the Irish, which doesn't really contribute anything to the greater picture. Yet the story nicely depicts a black ops supposedly uncanny resourcefulness in using mostly everyday items for combat or even medical purposes. <br/><br/>The action bits are quite sufficient for my expectations. You can't really expect aging stars as Denzel Washington to have action scenes with a lot of heavy motions here and there. Antoine Fuqua compensates this by using closer takes on the action scenes, particularly on the fighting parts. There is also not much running or any other classic action moves such as duck-and-roll. <br/><br/>The acting feels nice in overall. Denzel Washington really can act out any kind of character you throw him. His calm composure really depicts what we expect from an experienced elite black ops guy, especially if we compare his role here to his other more talkative roles such as in Training Day or The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3. Marton Csokas is very much at home with this kind of role as his similar role in xXx alongside Vin Diesel was his first big break. Chloe-Grace Moretz second performance this year makes this movie better. Here she shows that she can take on the varied nature of characters.<br/><br/>My final word for The Equalizer is that this movie deserves just a mere 6 out of 10 score. A recommendation is quite a so-so decision. Honestly it's quite entertaining as a movie, but all the predictability of the story and the not-so-solid character building has left some damage to the overall presentation."
"Rickting","7","1","4","3 October 2014"," Nothing special, but it certainly delivers
","Denzel Washington launches a one man war on the Russian Mafia. Sign me up! This adaptation of the 80s TV show stars Washington as a retired black ops operative who puts the skills from his old life into action when he witnesses a prostitute he has had conversations with getting beaten and throughout the film works his way through the Russian mafia. This delivers exactly was it says on the tin and is a good, well made action movie although you'll forget in a week. Starting with the negatives. If you want to see this because you're a fan of Chloe Grace Moretz, don't bother since she's in the film for maybe 15 minutes. She's completely wasted and as she's the emotional core of a very brutal and action packed film, this was a mysterious decision. There is a sense of mean spiritedness throughout, and the violence, which at times feels like a Saw movie, often feels forced and unnecessary. The film is too long and dips from time to time in the middle, and for some reason there's an unnecessary side-plot with Denzel trying to help a friend lose weight on a regime. Um, this isn't Training Day.<br/><br/>This is a fairly formulaic movie and one which goes the motions and lacks a sense of humanity, but it is better than you might expect. Antoine Fuqua proves himself once again a skilled director who knows how to build tension, and Denzel Washington is excellent as the main character. Chloe Grace Moretz, while totally wasted, shines in her fleeting moments of screen time. The film refuses to go into generic shootouts and fist fights, and instead moves from one old school suspenseful set piece to another. There are some interesting themes of justice, so the film does actually have a quiet power and Denzel Washington's character, although not given all that much back story, gives the film some emotion. The finale is a cut above the rest of the movie and genuinely excellent, meaning I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is quite an interesting and slightly different movie, which has some appreciated (Although really not a lot of) depth. The premise and marketing say it's Denzel Washington taking out the whole Russian gangster community in Boston. That's what we were promised. That's what we get.<br/><br/>6/10"
"starspiredevelopment","8","1","5","19 April 2015"," Almost as good as Goodfellas, La Femme Nikita, or the Usual Suspects
","I love Denzel Washington's work. Again in this film, his work is satisfyingÂ<br/><br/>This story, though common, was interesting, and the make-up was excellent.<br/><br/>Some of the shots were too soft for the hardened criminals that were to be depicted, however. I particularly don't agree with shooting older men from below. Seeing a witty Denzel is more interesting than seeing a puffy Denzel. Everyone looks puffy being shot from below, unless they are rail thin and/or under the age of 25. It would have been o.k. to just shoot the young people from below, and the older people at eye level, or above to make it more dramatic.<br/><br/>The one scene that I did not like was the tanker being blown up, as it was the same scene from the Usual Suspects. The same everything -- slow mo walking, blowing up in the backgroundÂ someone young probably directed this and didn't see that movie, or they quoted it.<br/><br/>In any case, it was still a very interesting, good film that is worth watching. My favorite part was that Denzel won again! I like that about him."

The action scenes were engaging but were stuck between Matrix/Bourne Identity and a Stephen Segal wannabe. I like Denzel's movies but this one could be his worst.<br/><br/>If you have watched the original TV series then you will get it in the last 30 seconds of the movie.<br/><br/>Do not waste you time on this one unless you completely board and have finished that novel you have been planing to write."

","Retired CIA agent Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) tries to lead a quiet life, but a near-death beating of escort/prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) by the Russians changes that quiet life. <br/><br/>This movie is based upon The Equalizer TV show in the mid-1980s starring Edward Woodward. A good show btw.<br/><br/>In the beginning of this movie we are shown a statement by Mark Twain that says there are two important days in a man's life: the day he is born and the day he finds out why. This applies to Robert McCall as you will see.. And yes, it applies to all of us too. That is probably the most provocative thing Mark Twain has ever said. <br/><br/>McCall is the Calm before the Storm and then he becomes the Storm as you will see. Okay, a Quiet, Controlled Storm.<br/><br/>The movie starts off slowly to set things up for McCall to help Alina. McCall tries to buy Alina's freedom from the Russians and you know that won't work. There is only one thing left to do and he does it. <br/><br/>Problems continue when the big boss Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich), in Russia, sends his top enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas) to find and kill McCall. You will note that McCall calls Teddy, Nicholi. Csokas does a very good job of being McCall's antagonist and I am sure we will see more of him.<br/><br/>The acting all around is excellent. The fighting scenes are brutal and intense. You will see blood. The music is heart-racing all the way through and pretty good too. <br/><br/>A downside I found was the big fight scene within the place McCall works, Home Mart (like Home Depot). Too many scenes in the dark . Still good, but in the dark (you said that already). <br/><br/>Move over Jason Bourne, Bond, James Bond and the Liam Neeson character with the skills to right all wrongs, we have another player, a Vigilante, if you will, who has decided he knows why he was born. At the end McCall becomes The Equalizer as we see him offering to help someone as he replies on his laptop. Did I hear someone say ""Sequel?""<br/><br/>This is most entertaining and we like the quiet, controlled storm Denzel Washington brings to Robert McCall, the Equalizer. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."

","Robert McCall (Washington) works at Home Depot during the day where he encourages his fellow colleagues to achieve and be more, at night he sits and reads in a 24 hour dinner and does the same to a local escort who eats there. After a slow burning start its not long before this widower turns into a one man army taking down the Russian Mob and corrupt Policeman alike. Se entirely among the working class population of Boston its set among an urban America not populated by any middle class characters and is all the better for it. <br/><br/>Based on all original Television series starring the late Edward Woodward which always felt a bit cheesy here director Fuqua takes a more gritty and real approach. McCall at the start is just a nobody, but pretty soon its obvious he is a man with a past which is never entirely revealed to us. The Russian mob, led by the dark and scary Teddy (An excellent Martin Csokas) are determined to stop him. You know from the beginning that the film will end with a climax involving the aisles and lots of power tools but that's okay. The film is well paced, well directed and has an edginess that's just on the right side of believable and well away from the wrong side of the likes of Taken 2. All the cast do well and there's a very small cameo from Bill Pullman at one stage where more is hinted at about McCalls past, but this is Washington's film all the way giving a brooding performance as he dispatches bad guys between breakfast and dinner while taking the moral high ground. Its a good modern imagining of the original series, nothing more, nothing less. An undemanding, well made, thriller that will past the time quite pleasantly."

I have to admit that I did really enjoy this and I highly recommend this but it was a little slow in some parts. The only real flaw with the movie is that is seemed to start in the middle and you are trying to play catch up for the first half. That said I did kind of like that rather than being spoon-fed the plot like most movies do. On the other hand this is yet another movie that Liam Neeson usually does, this one has a different actor. I thought Man On Fire was better but this was still very good. If you are into vigilante justice movies like Boondock Saints then you will like this. I did and I recommend this.

","THE EQUALIZER Movie Review<br/><br/>STARRING: Bill Pullman, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Chloe Moretz, David Harbour, Denzel Washington, Haley Bennett, Marton Csokas, Melissa Leo. First of all I am one of Denzel Washington's biggest fan as I have till date been able to watch all his movies. The latest and most recent movie is called ""The Equalizer"". I have just watched it minutes ago and I couldn't help but post a review about this. An action thriller stocked with weighty dramas, gangs, and Denzel Washinton heroically taking the law into his hands to bring justice to the weaker party. McCall (Denzel Washington) is an ex brave commando who faked his death to live a quiet life in Boston. His new life style is mainly comprised of days working at a local hardware super store, while trying to ease restless nights by reading and keeping informal company with other night hawks at a local diner. His lone quiet life gets interrupted causing him to come out of his self-imposed retirement to rescue a young girl, Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz). In the process of saving her, he finds himself face to face with ultra-violent Russian gangsters. As he serves vengeance against those who brutalize the helpless, McCall's desire for justice is reawakened. If someone has a problem, the odds are stacked against them, and they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer. Denzel Washington makes up a lot of ground lost on the page with a subtle and layered dramatic performance. Even though a lot of McCall's motivations and bookstore are poorly explained, Washington's portrayal tells enough of a story all its own in order to make Robert engaging â often conveying a lot of his history (and pains) through a guarded, haunted stare. So, even though the writer doesn't nail down the character, the leading man makes up for it by filling in the details through show, rather than tell. By the end, Washington has completed enough of an arc to make Robert both ratable, bad-ass and still intriguing enough to further explore in future chapters. The rest of the cast revolves around Washington, but manage to each hold their own against him on screen. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz is just as good as Denzel at showing her character's story and personality through subtle performance and mannerisms. Teri is at once a hardened street warrior and a vulnerable child, and Moretz carries that balance in a way that feels real, but never like the typical weak victim or damsel in distress. Teri and Robert's bond is interesting to watch, and provides fertile ground for the film's violent narrative to unfold. Basically, ""The Equalizer"" is an average-Joe blue-collar version of a comic-book avenger, secretly stalking those responsible for abusing and preying upon innocent citizens. And this film acts as an origin story with an ending that suggests a new franchise is afoot. It might not be bad for Washington to stay in the action game in a series that at least acknowledges those who qualify for a senior discount can be crusaders, too. This movie is mainly based for adults. For those who have undergone bullying, for those who have lost trust and faith in human beings. This movie is for those who are doing good in the world. It is to show us it is right to defend the weaker ones. I will strongly not recommend this movie to teens aged below 16 as there is some strong violent bloody actions and languages. So I believe teens under that aged are most probably easier to get influenced as they might misunderstand the message portrayed by the movie. The movie is MPAA rated as 'R"". My personal opinion about the movie putting aside that I am the greatest fan of Denzel Washington is 4 out 5. I was entertained and I will watch three to four times more. My Name is Arnold Kach, I am 26 years old and I am studying major in International Business at Guangdong University of foreign studies (Guangzhou/China).

","Robin hood ex black ops Denzel Washington goes on a killing spree of Russian gang members. The plot is as simple as that really. :)<br/><br/>I have always been a fan of thrillers and this movie is a recommended watch if you're a fan of them. Denzel's acting is fine. The direction of the action scenes is top notch. I liked the enriching camera zooms with slow motion play on the little details in several scenes. There were parts where I thought that the story is too straight forward with little left for the imagination. I just wish it had more plot twists because the end was pretty predictable. Could've given a higher rating had the story been a bit more sophisticated and thrilling."
"mlssufan02","7","1","5","27 September 2014"," Let me give you an accurate review (Somewhat of a Spoiler)
","Denzel is by far my favorite actor, so my rating is a tad biased in that regard. Even so, I thought this movie was awesome, but a slightly above average compared to such Denzel movies as Remember the Titans, Malcolm X, Antwone Fisher, & Training Day. The majority of Denzel movies are action thrillers, and this was no exception. There are generally 2 main complaints with this movie: 1). Too violent and 2). The supporting actress did not have enough air-time. A milder 3rd complaint is lack of story.<br/><br/>I might agree with the supporting actress having lack of airtime, as she was pivotal and crucial to the story, and pretty much went away after 30 minutes. The problem was that this was an old man rescuing a young woman, and I'm sorry but we can't have 60-year old Denzel falling in love with a 20-year old - it just doesn't work; so the only route is protecting her as a father would. When that role is played, it becomes more like Taken, where we don't really see the supporting actress though she is pivotal to the story.<br/><br/>So, how about violence? Well, it is violent, but there were certainly moments where it could have gone to the extreme. It isn't anything new to Denzel, but you have to understand that the whole theme of Bob McCall is someone trained as a killer, so he will do things to survive and make him seem ridiculously violent, so as to send the message that he is not to be messed with. It is violent, but necessary for the portrayal of his character.<br/><br/>The story complaint I sort of agree with. I started out fantastic, but towards the middle it just felt like it jumped to a completely new story. If they had given us a little more explanation of the bad guys, maybe their story or something, even a small snippet, it might have been OK, but all the stories seemed like they were supposed to be connected, but they did not come across that way in the end product.<br/><br/>The dialog between Bob McCall and Alena, as well as McCall and the french gang leader are clearly the high spots of the movie. Denzel still gives a great performance throughout and is as captivating as any other Denzel movie.<br/><br/>It is not the best Denzel movie ever, and probably not the best Denzel action movie ever, but it is intense & suspenseful, and i was glued to my seat for the entire movie."

","Denzel Washington has been a favorite of mine since my teens. With hit movies like Philadephia, The Pelican Brief, Fallen, John Q, Virtuosity, Crimson Tide, Man On Fire, The Hurricane, Deja Vu, Training Day, American Gangster, The Book Of Eli, Inside Man, The Bone Collector, Malcolm X, Mississippi Masala, Heart Condition and Ricochet, he has won a place in the hearts of all cinema lovers. <br/><br/>This film is an intense action thriller about a man who is trying to protect the ones he loves and fighting against evil in whatever form it may be. Be it pimps, drug-dealers, corrupt cops - the Equalizer has an answer to all.<br/><br/>In this film Denzel plays the role of Robert McCall a retired black ops government operative who lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works at a Home Mart hardware store, where he befriends many of his co-workers and also tries to help a security guard trainee named Ralphie pass his qualification exam. McCall has promised his recently deceased wife that he'd leave his old life behind, but is compelled to act after his teenage friend Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) whose real name is Alina, was seen being mistreated by her pimp. Alina's life was destroyed at the age of five or six when she was a victim of sex trafficking by the Russian Mafia and then became their sex slave and forced into prostitution.<br/><br/>Robert vows to save her after she is hospitalized after being brutally beaten by her pimp, Slavi (David Meunier). McCall enters a restaurant owned by the Russian mob and tries to convince Slavi to release Alina by paying him $9800, but Slavi refuses. Find out what happens next...<br/><br/>The film is directed by veteran director Antoine Fuqua who has directed acclaimed films like Training Day as well as The Replacement Killers, Tears of the Sun, King Arthur, Shooter, Brooklyn's Finest, Olympus Has Fallen. The good thing about him is that with each film he keeps getting better and he adapts to the style of film. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington gives a very powerful performance as a man who is pushed to the limits and has no other option but to retaliate with extreme force. Opposite him is equally good actor Marton Paul Csokas who has starred in films like xXx, Evilenko(a must see film!), Ãon Flux, and Kingdom of Heaven. Marton plays as an enforcer to the Russian crime-lord Vladimir Pushkin. <br/><br/>The film has intense action scenes filled with graphic violence and so it is only suitable for persons over 18 years. The background music, cinematography and script is top-notch and well polished. To my belief, I did not see any plot-holes in the film - it is a solid action thriller which will become a cult-classic as one of the later films in Denzel Washington's career."

","Denzel Washington is at his absolute best. Cool, intelligent,unbeatable,smart,quick, and also human and generous. The close-ups ,the slow motions with his amazing face, expressions, and his moves,the way he walks,they all add to the intensity of the plot. I admired the way the movie was shot, fast scenario, great choice of music, and kick-ass scenes that made me feel so satisfied ,because he took justice in his hands and wiped out the rotten mafia up to its core and got away with it. Gerard butler did the same in "" abiding law citizen"" though the ending was unfortunate. Loved everything in this movie.at last a movie to feel ecstatic about."
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","6","6 October 2014"," Washington challenges Liam Neeson's senior action flick
","A recent cinema-going of Denzel Washington's latest thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, the man behind his Oscar-crowning good-cop-goes-bad turn in TRAINING DAY (2001, 8/10). But that is only a one-off bait for his Oscar consummation. As one of the most consistently bankable actor in Hollywood (at least in the domestic market), Washington's good-man card never fail his audience, bar his sortie in portraying an ambiguous character as a drunken pilot garners him another Oscar-nomination in Robert Zemeckis' FLIGHT (2012, 7/10). So this reunion is more or less commercial-oriented than an ambitious art-house attempt as Fuqua has established his status as the Hollywood go-to action journeyman after producing profitable outputs like SHOOTER (2007) and OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013). <br/><br/>The plot is a derivative individual heroism boosting fare, Washington is Robert McCall, a former government agent, now lives alone in Boston as an ordinary employee in the Home Mart hardware store. His quiet life is disrupted when he bonds with a young hooker Teri (Moretz), who is in the throes of a brutal Russian gangsters, after Teri being violently beaten by her pimp Slavi (Meunier), Robert decides to save her from the business, but instead, he swiftly kills him and his minions. Subsequently he determines to single-handedly takes on the entire gang, lead by the merciless enforcer Teddy (Csokas), as well as the big boss Pushin (Kulich) in Moscow. <br/><br/>It sounds Liam Neeson has some serious competition in the sub-genre of twilight badass actioner, but unlike Neeson's family man Bryan Mills in TAKEN franchise, Robert has no such liability, he is purely a righteous vigilante, a Black version of the Punisher, lynches low-life scumbags where legal law force fails to execute, indeed near the end, he even accepts request from Craiglist (a sequel is already being announced). Although it is impossible to swallow the concept of the protagonist can spectrally annihilate a whole mob by himself (with a little help from his amiable Hispanic friend) without sensing the off-putting whiff of propagandizing Hollywood's individualism, Fuqua manages to glaze the film with a Neo-noir patina in a steady pace to accentuate his aesthetic demanding and stylish cinematography; in lieu of resorting to ostentatious action stunts (surprisingly comforting there is no car-chasing sequences at all), Fuqua actually is patient enough to allow Robert's situation and his struggle being cogently formulated before he turns into an invincible executioner of justice and starts his fulfilling mission of killing. <br/><br/>It is an entertaining movie, sometimes too violent for common taste, but sharply hits the bulls- eye for its target audience. Its ultimate depot confrontation calls to mind a darker and more lethal upgrade of HOME ALONE gimmick, and the face-off between Robert and Teddy is unexpectedly anti-climatic. Washington is so comfy in his wheelhouse and can feasibly pull off the platonic friendship between him and Moretz without any May-December suggestion. The perpetually Russell Crowe dead ringer Marton Csokas finally gets a bigger part as the gentleman-looking but beast-inside killer, it is the best offer Hollywood can ever offer to him, it is also a timely wake-up call to reconsider his career options, maybe a romantic comedy for a change."
"moviescoundrel","8","1","6","26 September 2014"," Not All Movies Are Created Equal
","I have to say that after skimming a couple of reviews before seeing this, I was skeptical it would be very good. The last action/suspense movie similar to this that I recall Denzel being in was ""Safe House"" with Ryan Reynolds. That had some potential I thought, but was very mediocre. I was not exactly sure how this plot was going to unfold. We are introduced to Robert's (Washington) character and see that he has a very particular, solo, obsessive compulsive type of life and habits. He does have a couple of relationships with people who he cares about and is trying to help better their lives. When a friend's life is in danger, Robert has to become the man he used to be once again in order to help keep her safe. Unfortunately, by doing this, Robert also awakens a bit of a beast with a lot more problems than he expected. I had first thought that most of the plot would be based on this antagonist/protagonist idea and Robert versus this Russian mafia. This is the central plot, but there are also some pretty cool side plots where we see Robert help others that are being wronged, all after putting in an honest day's work at Home Mart which is a big box store similar to Home Depot.<br/><br/>A couple of the things I read about this movie said it was too violent. It is violent, Robert executes with extreme precision and uses any instrument that his hands come into contact with. I find this pretty entertaining, and while violent, the point is made, and most of the men that are on the receiving end of this type of punishment not only are very bad men, but also have a chance to make things right or change before they receive their punishment.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the sound, the action, and the subtle acting of Washington make this one very good. Although I lowered my expectations a bet this one was pleasantly surprising, and is probably worth a second viewing for sure."
"rgkarim","7","1","6","27 September 2014"," Graphic Kills, Story Lacks Thrills or Surprises
","When you have a Denzel Washington movie you can be sure that fans are going to flock into the theaters to see the legend himself. Today I went back into the trenches of the local theater to watch Mr. Washington's latest adventure entitled the Equalizer. This film based on a television series from the past, has promised some dark justice being served in the streets of New York City with the hint of action that many movie goers have come to expect. Yet is this just another knockoff Taken, or is there actually something that helps this movie stick out? <br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the trailers, The Equalizer's plot is about Robert McCall, a retired special forces agent, who chooses a simpler life of working and reading after some major life event. Of course, the dark world that he dove into seldom leaves it's denizens alone, and McCall finds himself back into the bowels of darkness to correct the problems at hand. And just like the trailers promise, this movie is indeed dark in nature. After a rather drawn out introduction into the world, the first mission, as seen in the trailer, rips off the training wheels and throws you into throngs of violence. Using the power of quick observation, a knock off of Sherlock Holmes, Washington brings his skills of improvised weapons use on to the screen. While this is clever, and quite awesome, the downside is the amount of gore that follows his moves, and the areas to which those devices are inserted. Should you go see this film, there is hardly any censorship in this film, but instead an eyeful of sharp objects being slowly jammed into the unfortunate victims. What makes it even worse, is the sounds the victims make, especially during the prolonged moments where the victim seems to be savoring the kill. Some of course will like this, but for this reviewer there is a limit to how much hostility one can take in a movie. Unfortunately this scene is not isolated, as the carnage and suffering only get more intense with each body added to the count. <br/><br/>Intense suffering aside, the next component that you might be wondering about is the action that is promised in the film. So what about it? Well it depends on what you define as action. If you are thinking of action like Taken, where our ""hero"" moves through the setting with superhuman reflexes, firing bullets with one hit kill accuracy that many gamers would kill for, then you will be disappointed. Instead this action is a bit more conserved, focusing more on using his mind then tearing up the bad guys with force. Sure McCall has some moves that you want to see, especially close up, martial arts moves to disable the weapon from their hands. Yet the fight scenes often involve slamming someone's face viciously into an object, and are over in a matter of seconds from the beginning. Such brief spurts of action, were fine, but for an action movie I had expected a little more excitement and a little less torture. At the end, the battle was a little more to my expectations, though still filled with gruesome kills, some of which, I have to admit, were pretty sweet to see, sort of like Home Alone meets the Punisher. No matter what the scene is though, Denzel Washington brings the edge that you expected to see, so much that a few in the audience yelled, ""He is such a badÂ"" well I won't finish that quote. <br/><br/>What else is there to say about this movie? You can pretty much guess that it is all about Denzel, with just about every scene having the legend in it. Luckily his acting is still top notch, and brings a lot to the movie in just his character. As for the story, well it's alright in some places, but for the most part it's rather plain. The main plot itself has very little sustenance, with what seemed to be a slight attempt to interlock the cases with a big mafia group. It failed for me though, and the mafia group became nothing more, than more bodies for Denzel to pile up. Denzel's character has little story development, the fragments we get hastily explained and sometimes ill-timed that it loses any value. Perhaps the only thing that really develops his character, is his ""fight"" to fall back into the soulless monster he was prior to the movie as he doles out justice. Yes, one will feel a mixture of emotions at the bad guys getting their just desserts, but aside from that there isn't much emotional stimulation behind this film. As for the dialog and humor, they are not strong enough to make up for the story. References to classic literature being integrated into the morals was a plus for me, a nice twist to the typical, overdramatic scenes we often get. Yet these heart filled moments are offset by yet another curse laden dialogue that seems to become the common trend. Guess they will never learn huh? <br/><br/>Overall The Equalizer is an okay film, but failed for me on on a lot of levels. Fans who will enjoy this the most are those who think Denzel can do no wrong, and those who just want dark, twisted kills. The legendary actor still impresses me with his commitment, but for this reviewer, Mr. Washington cannot carry this movie for an entire two hours. My scores for this film are:<br/><br/>Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0"

"matti_sillen","6","1","7","1 October 2014"," A nice vigilante story â with a ton of brutal violence though
","Sentimental vigilante finds his calling in wiping out the mafia<br/><br/>One man who is able to level an entire gang, it seems to good to be true, but Denzel Washington makes it happen. This movie gives us the hope that justice will prevail, albeit making some messy hands on the way. The movie has a good gloomy vibe, good dialogue and nice acting, but has so much killing in it that one wanders who holds the title of good guy in the end.<br/><br/>Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) seems to be a regular guy, just suffering from some insomnia. He leads his life in Boston, working a daytime job at Home Mart and reading at a diner at night. Everything changes when Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), an escort who also visits his diner and a friend, is beaten up by her pimp. This is the trigger that wakes up the vigilante in McCall. At first McCall tries to buy off Teri's freedom from the Russian gangsters that run the escort service, but when this appears to be impossible, he kills all five gangsters in he room where the meeting takes place. Here he uses some great combat skills resulting from his past as a CIA-agent. What follows is a manhunt on McCall, in which the Russian mob does everything in their power to find him. The scene where mobster Teddy (Martin Csokas, know for playing Celeborn in The Lord of The Rings Trilogy) visits McCall at his house is a highlight in the movie. It has subtlety, suspense and great acting by both lead actors. If only this movie had more of that. On the whole, one can say that the character of Teddy is a bit overdone. An action movie needs a distinct antagonist, but making him a psychopath is not enough. McCall states his motivation for his fight against injustice during his stay at the house of former CIA- colleague Susan Plummer (played by Melissa Leo). He explains that someday something terrible was done to someone who didn't deserve it, and he wanted to do something about it. Here we see a glimpse of McCall's history at the CIA, though this isn't scrutinized any further. It all comes down to McCall's coworkers being held hostage, which ends up in a big killing finale. This scene â nicely staged in Home Mart â shows us how the Russian mafia is getting what's coming to them. McCall kills them to the last man, sometimes brutally, which put question marks to him being solely a vigilante, and not a sadistic killer. But at least Teri is free now.<br/><br/>What is great about this movie is Denzel Washington's acting, as a regular Joe and as a mob slayer. He is a sentimental man with a good heart, but he goes to extremes to fight injustice. The fact that the character of Robert McCall remains sketchy (he hates injustice period) is a pity. Furthermore, the director seems to want to give us mind-blowing images of explosions and brutal fighting scenes, but the fun in this movie is actually in the subtle scenes and the play between actors (especially Washington, Grace-Moretz and Csokas). All put together it is a better than average action movie that is worth your time and money, only with a sleight bit of overkill. The storyline is nice, and the actors do their best to make it a good movie, though it isn't a brilliant one."

The acting....its freaking Denzel Washington Chloe Grace Moretz with the short amount of screen time she has is good in the movie but she's more of a plot point that gets Robert McCall back into this dark world, other than that she doesn't have much to do. The main villain played by Marton Csokas was entertaining to watch on screen and the interactions between him and Denzel were the best part of the film.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is creative almost home alone like and some of it is gruesome and will make you flinch. But is the action entertaining?.. Yea for a good portion of the film it is, till you realize that Robert McCall is a superhero! I mean the man is barely touchable! It gets very predictable almost boring! Every character Mr. McCall comes up against stands no chance at all! Except one guy at the end of the movie, when you think Robert McCall found his match he kills him within a few seconds. Even when you think there's going to be a ""final awesome showdown"" between him and Denzel's character it doesn't happen Robert McCall takes him out with ease. <br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua makes a good looking film although sometimes artsy its still nice to watch. Is this film as good as his other film with Denzel Washington ""Training Day"" I mean no, is it entertaining yes. If you like Denzel Washington this movie is for you. If you want to see Denzel Washington kicking ass and fairly untouchable like a superhero this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Solid action movie."
"oceanic_osprey","7","1","7","1 October 2014"," You will be equalized!
","Greetings all, I happened upon this film having seen very little advertising save for the odd television teaser, from which I discerned a Taken-esque format. And to my pleasure this delivers very much like the first Taken did. I could draw more comparisons with the wonderfully brutal fight scenes but we all know this formula by now.<br/><br/>My main praise must go to Denzel Washington who charismatically plays the introverted, unsuspecting lead. He brings a weight and dignity to the role that may have been lost had some one else filled this position.<br/><br/>The action is very convincing, with deafeningly loud gunshots and uncompromising hand-to-hand choreography that really leaves you in awe. Although there is a purpose for his actions, I did find it hard to justify some of his killings, especially since he appears remorseful over past wrongdoings.<br/><br/>As supporting casts go this was not star studded, and nor did it need to be, with nameless henchmen receiving their fair share of fisticuffs left, right and center. I must give a hand to Martin Csokas, who adopts the lead psychopathic villain with such grace, and a reasonable Russian accent.<br/><br/>For me the downside of this film was Chloe Grace-Moretz. Perhaps it was because of the lighter films in which I'd seen her feature, but I found her a hard pill to swallow as a Russian-speaking prostitute. In fact it left me a little uneasy at the sight of it.<br/><br/>As a sucker for a soundtrack I was very aware of the particularly entertaining, gritty musical pieces that featured within. They grew in decibel as the drama did and the main theme left me wanting more. It was somewhat reminiscent (in places) of Electro's suite in The Amazing Spider-man 2. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall I would very much recommend this film, most definitely if you are a fan the first Taken, which this will undoubtedly be compared to. But more so for it's ability to be a decent standalone action thriller, if not ever so slightly predictable."
"bardia-moose","8","1","7","28 September 2014"," Not your average action film.
","Let me begin this review by saying that I've never seen the Equalizer TV show, so this review will be based on how I thought of the movie alone. This isn't the first time director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington have worked together. Training Day was a film that produced a Best Actor for Denzel, so I was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film. However, this ain't your average action film. Fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework. He's not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline, he actually uses the action to tell the character's story. You learn more about Washington's character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue. The film also had a strong antagonist, played by Marton Csokas, who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself, which most action films lack, however, like I said before, this ain't your average action film. All that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end."
"sipov","8","1","7","28 September 2014"," cool,tense,interesting film
","This is a really cracking film. Not the run-of-the-mill action plot I was expecting, a very pleasant surprise. The main character developed quiet slowly and was worth the patience of the viewer. His back story was not laid out on a plate for you. Much was held back and only hinted at. A genuinely cool, reserved character in the old sense. This is very refreshing and proves that - it is as much what you leave out, as put in, that makes an interesting film. The main bad guy (dark hair) in the film was riveting and as sinister as he was interesting. You can see some plot areas coming, but, as ever, wanted to see HOW he was going to get out of this one. It doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>I couldn't help having a bit of a giggle to myself, that a good alternative title for the film would be 'Showdown at B&Q' ! ( in the UK ) This was only a small momentary laplse of reason on my part and in no way should detract from the serious nature and quality of the film.<br/><br/>Again, another great film located in Boston ! I'm not sure why, but it has a different, dark side to it and seems a good backdrop for a thriller/ heist/ mob related film.<br/><br/>As well as dealing with the everyday details of the main character, it also was'not afraid to expand out to the bigger picture, towards the end - always the sign, I think, of a good, well balanced film. More importantly, one which doesn't insult your intelligence, too much. A film that, I get the feeling, has learned from the mistakes and lessons of other films that I may have not seen. It jumps just that little bit ahead of what I was expecting. This gives it an interesting edge.<br/><br/>A great, enjoyable film"
"moviexclusive","8","1","7","27 September 2014"," If someone has a problem and have nowhere else to turn, they can call The Equalizer to make things right
","Yup, although Irish actor Liam Neeson has taken on baddies in countless movies (in case you didn't know, the Oscar-winning actor will be threatening to hunt you down over the phone in Taken 3 next year), we still don't think he cuts it as an ""uncle"" action hero. Now, one guy we'd root for is 59 year old Denzel Washington. The two time Academy Award winner (Best Supporting Actor for 1989's Glory and Best Actor for 2001's Training Day) is known for his portrayals of real life personalities like human right activist Malcom X and middleweight boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, but he is also a bona fide action hero. Look no further than his illustrious filmography: Man on Fire (2004), The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), The Book of Eli (2010) and Unstoppable (2010) are just some of the New Yorkborn actor's finest works.<br/><br/>Here, he teams up with his Training Day director Antoine Fuqua to play, well, a violent man (the movie is rated M18 for Violence and Coarse Language) out to eliminate baddies. And it is one exhilarating ride indeed.<br/><br/>Washington plays McCall, a middle aged retired intelligence officer who believes he has put his Special Forces past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when the calm and collected man meets a young girl under the control of violent Russian gangsters, he decides to help her. Armed with some really impressive skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would bully the helpless, McCall comes out of his self imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened.<br/><br/>Based on the 1985-1989 TV series starring Edward Woodward, the film adaptation retains the basic theme of a kind stranger helping those who can't help themselves, but triples up on the violence â something we feel will go down well with fans of action movies.<br/><br/>We love this 132 minute movie because we like Washington, and we watch in delight seeing him kick some booty. Without Washington,this would be an average movie, but trust the award winning actor makes the character come to life. He is intimidating and dangerous. He is also cool, with a steely resolve in the face of danger. Who doesn't want a hero always promising to bring the bad guys to the house of pain without needing to yell hysterically about it? Washington has the perfect intensity to make the action feel explosive. This movie is a sure hit with guys.<br/><br/>The antagonist played by New Zealand actor Marton Csokas (he was Lord Celeborn in the first and third films of The Lord of the Rings series) is scarily effective. Watch the demonically tattooed villain lurk around in his slick skyscraper while getting vexed and sadistic, before getting his troops to destroy McCall. Elsewhere, Chloe Grace Mortez (If I Stay, Kick Ass 2) expands her choice of film roles by playing a young prostitute who ends up being a punch bag.<br/><br/>Fuqua, who staged some really beautiful shots in his previous works (2003's Tears of the Sun, 2013's Olympus Has Fallen) doesn't have as many opportunities for breathtaking visuals, but he frequently finds unique camera perspectives and lighting techniques to make the film look like a higher-class action blockbuster. The film starts to get a bit longer than necessary at the final act (revenge thrillers rarely cross the two hour mark), but the action makes up for the length. We want to shout out to The Equalizer: go kick some ass!"
"StarkTech","Null","1","7","26 September 2014"," Denzel is Awesome... The third act not so much
","Needless to say, Denzel really elevates this material. I truly loved the slow set up and development of the story and his character. It was refreshing to see an action film build a base and let the story breath to start. I loved Denzel's slow burn as he's drawn back in his violent ways. His deeper philosophy and new life spent imparting life lessons was very well handled. It's too bad they kind of wasted such an intriguing set up with some very over-the-top moments when everything hits the fan. <br/><br/>Spoiler>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Denzel kicking ass at the ""Home Mart"" was a crazier direction then I thought this movie was heading in. It reminded me of an ""R"" rated version of the TV show Chuck (attack on the Buy More) crossed with a Steven Seagal flick. I was expecting more intrigue and smarts to be honest. Using nail guns and hardware from the store instead of guns seemed too much an attempt to be cool but came across as super gimmicky to me. End Spoiler>>>>>>>>>>>><br/><br/>As many have mentioned the movie descends in to clichÃ©s and may have tried to be too slick for its own good. At least they delivered one of the all-time CLASSIC ""cool guys don't look at explosions"" moments for an update to that montage someday."
"stevendbeard","7","1","7","26 September 2014"," Good Action Movie
","I saw ""The Equalizer"", starring Denzel Washington-The Book of Eli, St. Elsewhere_tv; Chloe Grace Moretz-Carrie_2013, the Kick Ass movies; David Meunier-Justified_tv, The Incredible Hulk_2008 and Marton Csokas-The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Bourne Supremacy.<br/><br/>This is based on the 1985-1989 TV series of the same name that starred Edward Woodward. If you are not a TV nut like I am, you probably have never heard of it, but I used to enjoy it. The basic premise is that the Equalizer is a retired spy that helps people that the police can not. The movie is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also did Olympus Has Fallen and Training Day. Denzel plays Robert McCall, a retired spy that now works at Home Mart, a hardware store-I guess they could not use the name, Home Depot. You can tell that he has OCD-obsessive compulsive disorder-and likes to keep on a tight time schedule-he is always checking his watch and timing things. He befriends Chloe, a hooker that wants to be a singer. David is her Russian pimp and slaps her around a little but makes a big mistake of doing it in front of Denzel. After Denzel shows David some of his old skills, the Russian mobster's boss sends Marton from the motherland to take care of Denzel. The movie is a little slow at first-like most good origin stories are-but when it gets going, the action is good and violent-just the way I like my action movies. It ends with a sequel in mind and they even tip their hat to the TV show by showing how he gets future clients. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual situations-no nudity- and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

And I don't mean Denzel being black, but he still doesn't strike me as an ""old man"" as was the TV Robert, sorry Edward Woodward. ;) Grey and all.

"DareDevilKid","8","1","8","16 December 2014"," Fuqua and Washington Deliver Big Time
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.9/5 stars<br/><br/>With Antoine Fuqua behind the cameras and Denzel Washington dispensing justice, ""The Equalizer"" is a highly stylized, violent, and engaging action film that delivers on many counts. Fuqua infuses the film with a low-key energy and is in no hurry to rush into things, which is something many action films nowadays could learn from.<br/><br/>In ""The Equalizer"", Denzel Washington plays McCall, a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when McCall meets Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra- violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help.<br/><br/>Though the plot looks familiar, this familiarity can be welcome when the practitioner is so good at what he does. And there are few actors more commanding than Washington (perhaps only Neeson and Wahlberg among post 2000 action stars) when he's taking out bad guys. Washington, as always, holds your attention, finding in McCall a vulnerability that goes beyond the script's lip service. Denzel's performance and the film's high-voltage action premise make it one to watch this fall season. ""The Equalizer""is without a semblance of doubt, Fuqua's most accomplished effort along with 2001's ""Training Day"" and 2013's ""Olympus Has Fallen"", and should give its veteran action star his very first movie franchise.<br/><br/>Along with ""John Wick"", ""The Equalizer"" is the best R-rated, stylish, brutal, gory, adult-skewed action film to emerge from the Hollywood stable this year."
"Robert_duder","8","1","8","6 October 2014"," A dark nasty little action thriller that we don't get to see much of anymore
","The best thing for me about The Equalizer was that it felt, in some ways, like an old-school 80's/90's adult action thriller. Its one of those dark, gritty twisted films that bucks genre elements and says ""I'm gonna be violent and dark and if you don't like it don't watch it."" The Equalizer is brutally violent. I'm shocked they got this released without being severely watered down. It could be called an action/thriller/drama/horror hybrid and there are few films like that. Add in the fact that you have the extremely strong charisma of Denzel Washington and a complex and captivating character and you have one hell of a good time at the movies. Its Death Wish meets Batman meets Jason Bourne and how can you go wrong with that sort of mix? The film opens at a slower pace, carefully introducing our main character and giving him significant depth that you wouldn't normally get in your typical action film. By the time this movie is done you will be left breathless but you'll be asking yourself questions about our anti-hero Robert McCall for hours later. Who is he? What is his training? Where did he come from? What does all the subtle hints at his past add up to? The creation of this character is absolutely brilliant and if they serialize this...they could unravel him as they go.<br/><br/>I have always liked Denzel Washington. He is a brilliant actor with an amazing career. However, I have also said before that he often exudes a certain egotism in his performances. That is toned down in this part but it is there a little bit but its also necessary. He is a man with insane unstoppable killing abilities trying to control them and dealing with a lot of his own dark demons. The character has significant OCD and it only serves to add to a host of questions. Is his condition in order to control his killing? Does it have to do with training? Is it PTSD? Washington IS this character and he is perfect in it. The brilliant young actress whom I adore ChloÃ« Grace Moretz is good in a unfortunately small role as a wayward girl who Robert McCall takes a protective role with. When she is hurt and nearly killed, it inspires him to get back into action righting wrongs and crossing off thugs. Moretz is very good and this is a very adult role for her but it works. Her innocence and down to earth charisma makes you feel a lot of empathy for her character. We have a number of villains or ""Big Bads"" in the film, each of varying degrees of mobster. David Harbour is very good as a crooked cop and a formidable foe to Washington for awhile at least, David Meunier is sold but short lived as a scumbag pimp but Marton Csokas absolutely steals the show as THEE main villain. He is a cold blood psychotic killer with skills not unlike Washington's and he is the sort of action hero villain you simply don't see anymore in films. He is terrific!! His final scene opposite Washington might go down as one of my favourite in action films. Johnny Skourtis is also really great as McCall's good friend and sort of partner (think Equalizer's Reginald VelJohnson of Die Hard...make sense?) He adds some humanity and down to earth qualities to Washington's character. Despite top billing Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo are barely there as cameos mid-way through the film.<br/><br/>As expected Antoine Fuqua holds no punches. There are some downright nasty, blood splattering death scenes that had me cringing and really forcing myself to stare at the screen and not cover my eyes. He directs the action scenes to near perfection because while we get two or three full on violent hand to hand battles, many of the fight scenes are implied. We know McCall can kill, we know how he does it and we can imagine him doing it so we come in after he's already done it or jump over it as he's walking away. This way we don't get tired of seeing him in action and are inundated with his insane skills. This is a rare film because our hero is literally very nearly unstoppable. He is a killing machine and hardly gets a scratch on him. By the end of the film you figure he must be very close to the most deadly man alive and he has this deep emotional attachment to the human race that he wants to protect the innocent. When I first heard of this film my initial thought was that it wouldn't be the same as the TV Series(which it isn't at all) because it would be one single case he was dealing with. Fuqua cleverly handles this by giving him more than one instance where he helps the innocent. He handles like a good superhero origin story. The film is straight up excellent. I will watch it again, I was completely entertained, it is far from mainstream junk and it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a very long time. I feel as though the quality of future instalments would not be nearly as good (which may deter Washington from doing them at all) but I will be there if they do because I want to know more!! 8.5/10"
"samsoknite","8","1","8","30 September 2014"," One of the best action films in a while
","When I first sat down to watch this film I came in with little expectations. I hadn't seen the TV series it was based off and I hadn't read up at all on the plot. I saw the trailer, it looked interesting, and when I left I had felt a certain pleasure that I rarely feel when watching a film. <br/><br/>The Equalizer is easily a contender for being one of the best action films in a long while. Safe to say that Denzel Washington nailed the role as the lead character and the supporting roles - especially the antagonist - were equally well done. What we have here is an action film with the right stars, a solid plot, and superb cinematography to match. <br/><br/>Perhaps a particular favourite was the creativity in action scenes. It felt real, I didn't stop for a moment to think ""No way could that happen."" I felt the same for the characters, not a single one was out of place. Particularly the main character whom you never really know much about -- his past remains a mystery. <br/><br/>It might seem ClichÃ© from that perspective and I know some are going to be shocked - as I was - at the plot's progression. It was simply well done; it made sense, it paced fantastically, and it ended fine. When it comes to an action film starring Denzel Washington I don't think you can get it better than that. <br/><br/>As far as criticism goes. There is a specific character - who I will not spoil - that acts as the primary catalyst for the film's events. I personally felt the resolution was redundant and that the character existed solely as a plot device. Her acting was great, however."
"cpollis","8","1","8","30 September 2014"," Don't Eat Pringles or Other Junk Food!
","What's not to enjoy? A great-looking African-American protagonist, played with intelligence, grace and wit by Denzel Washington, who is unassuming but very, very clever, concerned about what he and others put into their bodies by way of food, erudite, fastidious and committed to righting situations for a few decent acquaintances trying to improve their lives against long odds. This guy thinks outside the box when up against Russian mafia evil-doers and is merciless in inflicting punishment for bad deeds. As others have said, it is comic book violence and very gruesome at times. But there is still creativity in the execution in keeping with the savvy of our hero. Two hours of pure entertainment."
"gordem1-51-400035","2","1","9","26 February 2016"," Absolutely terrible movie
","Uncreative, amateurish plot with terrible acting (like most Keanu Reeve's films). Ridiculous ""shoot-em-up"" action throughout with no redeeming moments. I gave up after Reeves had slaughtered his 153rd victim with little more than a few scratches in return. One of Willem Dafoe's poorest performances and typical of Keanu's high-school acting. Even one of my favorite actresses, Bridget Moynahan drowned in the murky waters of this garbage film. The musical score sounded like it was produced by a bad garage-group of teenagers. The cinematography sucked and it took an uncommon staying-power and determination to sit through it 'til the end. This flick is a total waste of time and anyone who gives it more than a 2 has been smoking bad weed."
"athena-j-dennis","9","1","9","15 December 2014"," Moral of the story is: Don't mess with Obama, I mean Denzel
","Obama...I mean Denzel swings some seriously massive and intimidating American penis against Russian mafia in this film. <br/><br/>In all seriousness though this film is totally awesome. It features great actor Denzel Washington, who does have an uncanny resemblance to the president. He is the man not to be messed with in this film. The narrative pits an unethical, evil and corrupt Russian underground with a righteous, courageous and overall good American hero (Denzel). <br/><br/>This was a narrative of good versus evil that was very popular in other films during the Cold War Era. Therefore it's hardly surprising, given the recent political events in Russia and the Ukraine that this film is also very much following along that well trodden path. <br/><br/>Although I am making it sound as though it's clichÃ©d it is actually a good film and Denzel is always great to watch on screen. Of all of the shoddy action films out there, I would rate this one highly. Which is surprising as I'm a woman and I normally absolutely hate action movies."
"monstermayhem32","8","1","9","27 September 2014"," One of Denzel's best works
","I would say that Denzel gives one of his best works on the film as Robert McCall an ex CIA agent who wants to put behind his CIA does and live a quiet life while helping those in need. One night Robert merts a girl named Elena played by Chloe grace moretz who reminds me of Jodie foster when she played a hooker in taxi driver. One night Robert finds out that Elena was beaten up rather badly by one of her clients and takes it upon himself to seek justice for her his own way by going after those that intimate and threaten others while offering life lessons to those in need who seek his wisdom. I would have to say what makes Robert a complex hero who is forced by dire circumstances to become something that he is not but while still maintaining his sense of right and wrong."
"stroggos","3","0","1","28 March 2020"," One of Denzel's worst performances - soul-less and generic
","Everything about this movie is generic: the music, the lights, even the fighting, with some pretty corny cinematography to round things off. I generally really like Denzel Washington as an actor, but he gives such a lackluster performance in this one, and I think he has been miscast, or at least been misdirected by a director who does not seem to have a unique vision at all. Denzel's character's back story is something that we have seen time and time again, but it comes off as unbelievable here. On top of that, the story is so badly structured, with some characters that play a big role early on seemingly forgotten for the rest of the film. Altogether a huge disappointment."

Denzel Washington is some ex-CIA/super-soldier/superhuman/whatever that helps out good people and kills bad guys. Straightforward, right?<br/><br/>Action scenes were damn enjoyable and the ending was epic. Who else could kill with a nailgun and look so badass?<br/><br/>I was debating on giving this film a 3/5, but I've rewatched it so many times that I think it deserves an extra star.<br/><br/>4/5."

"andrewmerritt-31652","6","0","1","8 January 2020"," Watch out for Denzel Washington
","The Equalizer stars Denzel Washington and is directed by Antoine Fuqua who directed Training Day, which also starred Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington plays a hitman who wants to lead a normal life, but after an innocent girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz ends up in the hospital by some Russian gangsters he decides to take matters in his own hands. We don't really know what Denzel did before he decided to live a normal life but from what I saw it looked like he was a hitman and I like how he portrayed the different personalities to this person. The movie was a little too long for my taste, because it focused on his vigilante personality while at the same time dealing with the Russian gangsters. But what I really enjoyed was how he goes to an ordinary innocent man to an assassin when people mess with the things he loves the most. He's not necessary lonely he likes helping people and he tries his best to leave his past behind and the concept of having someone go from innocent to hitman is very well acted by Denzel. But this is where the movie has its faults. For one thing Chloe Grace Moretz doesn't have a lot of screen time and I felt that they could've done so much more with this character so we could understand the pain and suffering she went through. The main antagonist is the other problem. He tries so hard to be scary and intimidating that it almost comes off as laughable because we've seen this happen in so many movies that he doesn't really give us anything to work with. This movie is more of a spy movie than a revenge movie as it is mostly a cat and mouse and also feels like a Hitman video game than anything else. So overall, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, it was average with a protagonist that was likeable, but there were some pieces that didn't fit together and that's where it went wrong."

","I really enjoyed this film. Denzel Washington proves time and time again he has immense talents, transforming what could be a generic action thriller into something fun and surprisingly emotional. I can't imagine this movie being nearly as good without him. His character moves from gentle and sympathetic to intense and heroic, with frightening efficiency. The movie never fully overcomes genre tropes, but it is a fun ride nonetheless.<br/><br/>At its core, this is an ""old man getting dragged back into the game"" story, and it spends enough time building a well-realized character with believable motivations. Denzel works a day job at a large hardware/home store, and spends late nights reading at a 24 hour diner. He takes sympathy for a young girl who is involved in a bad way with some Russian dudes. The story soon spirals into ""Denzel takes on everyone"". He believes is justice and acts as a moral arbiter for the everyday person, the down and out. The action often revolve around Denzel surveilling and taking out bad guys with old-man resourcefulness, incorporating every-day tools and home-goods into the violence. In a way, this is ""suburban Dad dream film"", and as such, you don't have to take it too seriously.<br/><br/>My major gripes with the film: The main villain is a cartoonish baddie. He is one dimensional and boringly evil. Also, every Boston accent is a travesty. Even for hollywood Boston accents this is not good (Denzel Washington shrewdly avoids attempting one)."

","Movie starts off in the life of Denzel's character Mr. McCall. At first the audience will see him as a single older black dude who works at home depot or in the movie its called ""home mart"" anyhow he apparently helps out some heavyset co worker get his security license and is also providing knowledge and wisdom to his two youth co workers also. He appears friendly and polite to all his female coworkers as well. The plot delves a little deeper as we learn his character can't sleep and has insomnia and spends most his nights at a 24/7 diner drinking tea and reading books. it is there where he befriends a young Russian prostitute and she gives him a CD of her singing and befriends him back. Later something happens to the girl without too much spoilers she is a prostitute for the Russian mob. He goes after them out of revenge for hurting her.<br/><br/>The plot: it was very bland and mild. It sort of is intriguing but most of it you will say to yourself eh, its been done before.<br/><br/>Action sequences: again nothing special here, the ending part to the movie is very cool and Antone Fuqua uses his typical cinematography with water dripping every where.<br/><br/>The sound track has a song by Moby that we all know and a song by Eminem at the ending credits.<br/><br/>Keep in mind this movie came out in 2014 and most of you have seen it already. My basic review is this: its an okay feel good movie but doesn't do Denzels great acting abilities any justice. Like I said the plot is very bland as we later find out in the movie that he was an ex-CIA assassin and left his wife due to the agency. its never really explained why he goes after the Russians considering they didn't kill the girl. Nor does it go into detail about his connection to the CIA<br/><br/>The antagonist who is the ruthless Russian Mafias lieutenant is assigned to find and track down and kill Mr McCall for a bigger Russian boss located in Moscow called ""Pushkin"" played by an actor I like named Marton Csokas.<br/><br/>The Russians are in bed with some corrupt cops as well who work in Boston and one is played by David Harbour (Hell-boy). Denzels character tracks him down and is able to use him to flush out the remaining mobsters.<br/><br/>The fat guy is played by Johnny Skourtis an unknown actor who does a pretty good job of being Denzels side kick as he always seems to have one in all his movies. Denzels character is trying to help him lose weight to become a security guard for the Home Depot company they work at and Denzel is constantly finding him trying to smuggle potato chips in his healthy tuna sandwiches.<br/><br/>The girl is played by Chloe Grace Moretz another unknown at least by me, who actually survives but unfortunately her friend isn't so lucky who falls victim to Marton the antagonist character.<br/><br/>All in all like I said its an okay movie. reason being is Denzel Washington you expect the movie to be great and when it isn't it is somewhat of a disappointment however like I said the movie doesn't disappoint but isn't great either just flat out okay."

This one beats the bar by some height. The scene between Teddy and Robert in the restaurant was truly epic in its perfection so Kudos to Denxel and Marton for nailing it. Only minor niggles were the small plot holes and Roberts use of anything but a firearm for maximum death causing. Lets be honest, given his former trade I am sure he is more than proficient in stuff that goes bang at the pointy end. Having said that, maybe it added to the overall deadliness of our main man and perhaps JWs pencils could be added to the mix lol.

","I saw this film two years ago. My stepfather insisted we watch it. I was dubious from the start, considering it's not my sort of thing, and could see it was rated 18. Cue about 30/45 minutes in and an incredibly graphic and disturbing violent scene which I tried hard not to focus on (I discreetly took my glasses off). There was another one near the end too. Is also full of swearing. My stepfather was laughing. Really? Most load of violent rubbish I've ever seen. He's on about watching the sequel now, there's a film I'll be giving a miss, especially after reading about the violence in that too. I dare say there are others who liked it though. The reason I've rated this more than 1, is the fact that I do know Denzel Washington is a good actor."
"ironcraftleague","7","0","1","7 March 2019"," A kinda mediocre film.
","It's a strange set up for an action thriller. I love the ideas and ""cat and mouse chasing"", but honestly it has really bad trouble with its messages and direction. It felt really bland half the time and it really brought down my interest. The characters are passable along with some other elements. Some great fights scenes are shown and other ways of killing people are also seen. The way he works up through the gangsters system and taking them down is very awesome to see. However, this movie is kinda mediocre to the point where it's only passable overall. Yes it has good things but a lot of other things aren't execute well. 7/10."

","Denzel Washington calculates in his mind how much time he needs in order to finish 5 gangsters in a room. He says ""16 seconds"" but he fails for 6 seconds. This is most probably a shame.<br/><br/>Professionals like Denzel should be hired in the U.S. special forces. Their men are too slow, weak and inefficient. If Denzel managed to finish the whole business of some Mr. Pushkin in the East Coast alone, one wonders what the hell their men do for living."
"paul-pezmail","8","0","1","1 January 2019"," A high quality action movie
","I'm not sure why it took me so long to watch this - perhaps the hype surrounding it put me off, or maybe my dislike of remakes - but I was pleasantly surprised to find The Equalizer to be a well written, well directed and superbly acted action movie.<br/><br/>
The pacing is excellent - a little slower than most of the genre, and with a measure of subtlety not usually found within it. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying this is The Godfather or A Matter of Life and Death, but it's a damned fine action flick. As Luc Besson found with Taken, get a solid script and put a superb actor in the lead, and you can raise the bar on the standard gun-toting fare.<br/><br/>
As you might expect, the movie is violent, often gory, and some of the action a touch on the heroic side, but it's well enough done that it is believable and never for a moment takes the viewer out of the film.<br/><br/>
Highly recommended."

","So I watched this movie, 'couse becouse of christmas I have some free time and I just wanted to watch good, simple action movie to relax.<br/><br/>My problem with The Equalizer is the fact that it's over two hours long and that's way too much, becouse the plot is very simple. Hour and a half would be just fine but it feels just way to long.<br/><br/>Action scenes are fine. They're not nearly as good as fight scenes in John Wick, but they're fine. My problem is that they were too dark and it wasn't always clear what's happening.<br/><br/>I really liked the actors. - Denzel Washington was good, but Chloe Moretz stole every scene she was in. She was as great as usually.
The other thing that was missing for me was some humor, but it's not a big flow.<br/><br/>Overall it's okey. If you haven't seen John Wick, or new Mission Impossible movies, or A Man From U. N. C. L. E. I recomend any of those over The Equalizer but if you have and you like action movies. - It'll do alright."

","I would never recommend this movie to anyone, but to those who just wanna watch a mindnumbing action movie. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a B-movie as well.""The Equalizer"" is just that. But watch the ""Taken"" series with Liam Neeson instead, because it is much more gratifying to watch: more original, suspenseful and more and better action too.<br/><br/>I cant help but compare ""The Equalizer"" to the ""Taken"" series, because they look like copies of eachother, in which ""The Equalizer"" is the bad copy though, because everything about the ""Equalizer"" is mediocre and has been done before. And has been done a lot better. A LOT. It is worse enough that the story is just plain dumb, but the rest is average as well: the photography, editing, soundtrack are all anoyingly mediocre as well. <br/><br/>The supporting actors who play the bad guys are just stupid and not convincing at all, they resemble game characters that can be shot with one kill in easy mode. Just anoyingly boring.<br/><br/>The acting by Denzel Washington however is good. He saves this movie from drowning. Without his part, this movie wouldnt even have made it to the cinemas. But WITH Denzel this movie is still watchable. Ideal for young kids, who just want a plain, simple hero who wins every fight.<br/><br/>Instead of this crap I would highly recommend ""Training Day"" . That's another Antoine Fuqua movie starring Denzel Washington, but that movie is brilliant, suspenseful and true to life. Just spectacular. Everything ""The Equalizer"" is NOT."

","I never really watched the TV series, I just saw it here and there, so I can't claim any 'fandom'. It was mostly a case of watching this as a standalone film. The revenge genre is one of my favourite genres and this film is a very worthy addition. It actually scared me at times, sort of like The Godfather did, but the direction, the script, the performances and cinematography are all top notch. I've not seen the second one yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Washington nails it, as usual. Is there anything he can't do?"
"ikizdevran-882-254684","7","0","2","4 August 2018"," What do you see when you look at me?
","Mark Twain once said; ""The two most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you find out why."" ""The Equalizer"" opens with this quote. This quote reveals the purpose of the film and what to expect from it. In the first 10 minutes of the story, we get an intense character depiction of Robert ""Bob"" McCall (Denzel Washington). This description is very important for the development and progression of the film. Robert is a perfectionist and overly organized. He lives alone and works at a construction store. He has insomnia and when he can't sleep, he goes down to a 24/7 diner where he drinks tea and reads. In the beginning of the film he reads The Old Man and The Sea from Ernest Hemingway. If you know this book, you can easily relate the old man to him. His inner thoughts and dilemmas are similar to the old man's. Actually, in the first 10 minutes of the film, director Antoine Fuqua tells you more or less everything you need to know about Robert. After this point, nothing surprises you in the means of his life and actions. During his visits to the diner, he creates a special bond with a young Russian hooker Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz). They mostly discuss about the book and its effects on the real life. One night when Alina is beaten up and sent to hospital, he visits the Russian Mafia, who are selling her, and offer them $9800 to let her go. They refuse the money and after a little talk he kills all the five men in the room brutally in 19 seconds. The film actually starts after this point. This scene proofs that Robert is not an ordinary man, but a professional killer.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" is a one man show. It is one man against the Russian mafia. This time, an American hero saves a Russian girl from the Russians. I normally hate this kind of stories where Americans are the good guys and Russians are the bad. Cold war is over and they keep making films like this. However, this one time, I will pass on this fact because the story is much more complex than just the Americans and Russians. Also, the main actor is one of my favorite actors of all time. I know this approach is not professional but I am not a professional critic anyway. As I said Robert is a highly trained killer. Through the story, we find out that he is a retired CIA black ops operative. He tries to live a quiet life, but this kind of guys can never be left alone. The more they try to stay away from trouble, the more trouble finds them. ""The Equalizer"" is a story of a guy like that.<br/><br/>The story of ""The Equalizer"" is like a chess game. Both sides are trying very hard to win. They both think before they act and there is a constant attempt for anticipation of the opponent's move. This is the strongest point of the story. ""The Equalizer"" has the same idea as in John Wick or Taken series. There is one man against everyone else. The film is action packed and highly entertaining. It is maybe a little brutal but this doesn't change the course of the film. The soundtracks are equally beautiful. ""The Equalizer"" was loosely based on the 80s TV series of the same name. A couple of days ago, ""The Equalizer"" 2 was released, and tonight I am going to see it. This was the main reason why I have seen ""The Equalizer"" for the third time. After tonight, I am going to write also about the second film. No matter how cheesy they can get, I like stories like this. People like Robert are revengeful. No matter how good and fair they are, once you do something bad to them or to their loved ones, they never hesitate to go until the end.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's performance is outstanding and it sets the limits for the film. In films like ""The Equalizer,"" leading role performance is as important as the story itself, because everything is based on this performance. To be honest, I don't recall a bad film from Denzel Washington. I find a lot of similarities between him and Morgan Freeman. Washington's performance is not the only outstanding performance in the film. Marton Csokas, as Teddy Rensen/Nicolai Itchenko, puts an amazing performance as the villain of the film as well. He plays a highly trained sociopath. His performance makes an enormous difference. When both the good and the bad guy's performances are harmonized with a good story, you get to see a film like ""The Equalizer."""

","As a fan of the TV series I was disappointed that this bears little resemblance to it's source material. That isn't to say this is a bad film. In the series Edward Woodward fed up working as an agent gave it up, but wasn't willing to let his expertise go wasted. He took out an ad to help those in need. He occasionally had help for former colleagues. He lived in a nice apartment. Drove a Jag. The very city of New York was almost a character unto itself. The Robert McCall Denzel plays him more like Liam Neeson in the Taken series. 
I guess my big problem is once again Hollywood has taken a property with name recognition. I enjoy this film for what it is, but I would still love to see a faithful adaptation of The Equalizer."

","I liked how the movie led the viewer into the story without giving a full background of Robert McCall's character (played by Denzel Washington). This way there's a little mystery lingering around him the whole movie and the viewer is given some bits and pieces that he or she can put together on their own.
That said, the peaceful start of the movie ""goes south"" real fast once McCall pisses off the wrong people so he becomes the target himself. One thing I can say for sure - you don't want to find yourself on Robert McCall's bad side.<br/><br/>I found this movie really entertaining as it kept me in suspense the whole time and also guessing what twist might come next. The psychological battle between the protagonist and his nemesis was very well done. So were the fight scenes which were brutal and merciless at times.<br/><br/>The ending and the resolution was a bit amusing to me, since Denzel unleashed his inner-MacGyver in order to deal with matters at hand. I might get some strange flashbacks the next time I visit supplies retail store :)"

","""The Equalizer"" opens with a Mark Twain quote that gets to the heart of the mystery of the protagonist Robert McCall: ""The two most important days in your life are the day you born and the day you find out why."" In the course of the film we find out the answer to Mr. McCall's purpose in life, namely, to serve as a modern day Robin Hood and balance things about between good and evil in the world.<br/><br/>The film developed a compelling narrative with the ex-CIA black ops specialist McCall who has left his past behind and assumed a mild-mannered role as a Home Mart employee and an avid reader of the classics. Following the death of his beloved wife Vivian, McCall has taken to reading the most famous 100 books. He is seen reading Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man."" But the most relevant is the one is the novel he only briefly describes to Alina as a story of a medieval knight errant fighting for the causes of good in the world. Of course, that novel is Cervantes ""Don Quixote."" <br/><br/>Robert McCall is a much more effective redeemer and revenger than Don Quixote. He takes on the Russian mafia that has infiltrated the East Coast, enlisting corrupt Boston policemen and American politicians, and engages in human trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities.<br/><br/>The best line in the film occurs at the lavish estate of one of Mr. McCall's old CIA colleagues. When McCall pays a visit to her, the CIA official casually informs her husband, ""He didn't come for help; he came for permission."" The ""permission"" granted to him is to become a one-man wrecking crew of the nefarious Nicolai Itchenko and his associates, plus the Russian based ringleader, Vladimir Pushkin.<br/><br/>""The Equalizer"" was well-directed with stunning location footage of sites in Boston, outstanding work with camera angles, and effective pacing for a longish film. One of the best scenes is a quiet conversation in a restaurant where Mr. McCall nearly teases out of his adversary Nicolai Itchenkoa confession that Nicolai was the boy who killed his kind benefactors after adopting him and giving him a loving environment. <br/><br/>Nicolai Itchenko obviously found out who he was early in life, but refused to change. By contrast, Robert McCall recognized many ways that he could fulfill his destiny, then shape-shifted his way to a sense of service to humanity. One path was working in black ops; one was working as the Equalizer; but another was in the simple act of lending a helping hand to those in need like Alina. The best part of the film was Denzel Washington's complex interpretation of this multi-layered role."

","The equalizer is an action movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, where Denzel Washington is the leading actor. In this film, Denzel plays McCall, a man who is retired CIA operative and now he works at a hardware store. He belives that he has put his mysterious past behind him and now he can live a quiet life in Boston Massachusetts, but during his last nights reading a book in a restaurant he meet Teri a teenager prostitute under the control of Russian mafia, he can't stand the situation suffered by the girl and decide to help her.
Therefore, the equalizer is a great film to someone that like a good action, because it is full of this. In addition, the film talk about the traffic of women, where the women need to work such as prostitute in another country and suffer in hands of bad men. So, besides the good actions the film makes a criticism about this problem faced in our society."

"The-Sarkologist","8","0","2","11 June 2018"," Thrilling
","I must have missed this film when it came out, and in a way it's a bit of a shame because it is actually a pretty cool film. Come to think of it, it did remind me a lot of the television series Chuck, but only in the sense that the protagonist happened to be this Black Ops specialist who was working in a Bunnings style hardware store. Well, not quite Black Ops because he has retired, but in many ways he still seems to be set in his ways.
 Anyway, he has this habit of going to an all night diner around 1:00 am to have a cup of tea (and he even brings his own teabag, they just supply the water). So, he strikes up this conversation with this girl over time, and it soon turns out that she has landed up in a bit of trouble. She happens to be a prostitute, but not one that is doing it willingly, and her pimps are basically treating her as a disobedient possession. As such he decides to go and teach them a lesson. Well, he is polite at first, but these type of people tend to be so cock-sure that he eventually shows them who they are actually messing with.
 Well, one doesn't simply walk into a restaurant owned by the Russian Mob and pretty much take everybody out without drawing some attention to yourself, and this is basically what happens. A highly trained special forces operative, who happens to be the guy that cleans up messes for the mob boss, comes over to the United States to find out what is going on. Well, I guess you can probably see where this is going.
 It isn't really one of those fast paced movies, at least at first, but that has more to do with the cat and mouse nature of the protagonists. Both are quite highly trained soldiers, though one of them doesn't like to let it on, while the other seems to want to show off his skill any change he gets. It seems to relate to the various types of power relations - soft power and hard power. One rules by the first, while the other simply rules through what he doesn't do. We obviously suspect who comes out on top in this particular movie, but then again the ending is generally pretty much set out right from the beginning.
 I guess this film touches on a few things, but once again it seems that the Russians are being painted as the enemy. Even if it isn't a hangover from the Cold War, it does seem to create this stereotypical image of the brutal and hard Russian who lives by his own rules. Once again they seem to be taking upon the mantle of the bad guys, and even if they aren't KGB, they are Russian Mafia, but the difference is that they tend to be somewhat less refined. However, when compared to other mafia group, they do come across as the more brutal and nasty of them. 
 Yet it was still a pretty cool movie, and there were a couple of little subplots thrown in as well, which all tie up nicely in the end. However, one interesting thing is that they don't always show our protagonist acting, sometimes, such as when he went after the armed robber, there is only an implication of what actually happened. We know he found him, but we don't know what he actually did to him - we just know that he eventually got what he wanted. This was well done in a way.
 It's a pretty cool movie, and certainly worth watching, though one of the main reasons I wanted to watch it was because I saw a preview for the sequel where he happens to be posing as an Uber driver."

"iNickR","8","0","2","6 November 2017"," Denzel Kicking Serious Bad-Dude-Ass as a Bad-Ass!
","I sort of remember the mid-80's TV series The Equalizer, and I sort of remember watching a few episodes. I certainly don't remember the late Edward Woodward kicking serious bad-dude-ass like Denzel Washington does as Robert McCall!<br/><br/>First, the bad news. I know every bad-dude-ass-kicker looks good in the near-dark, lit only by a single 7k Xenon sitting high atop a Skyjack 25-yards yonder, with the pouring ""rain"" twinkling all around in the background and rolling off said bad-dude-ass-kicker's weathered face and squared jaw, but was it really necessary here? I mean, come on, it looked like it was done on purpose...and not in a good way. The scene I'm talking about could have been shot somewhere else to have the same impact. Worst. Shot. Ever.<br/><br/>More bad news: Open Memo to Hollywood: We get it, the Russians are the bad guys again but please stop, for the love of Igor, stop using non-Russian speaking actors to fill the roles needed - especially Henchmen and smaller speaking roles. We hate it when ""Russians"" are actually Americans pretending to be Russian after spending an hour with a dialect coach in their trailer before their scene (I'm looking at you-who-shall-not-be-named-but-starred-in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). (Ok, so I exaggerated that a teeny bit, but her accent was terrible in that movie.) Anyway, I digress. For this movie, I'm talking about the horrible Russian spoken by ChloÃÂ« Grace Moretz. She plays an underage Russian prostitute with perfect English, but horrible Russian. I guess that's better than a horrible English accent and horrible Russian! I knew nothing about the plot of the movie and I didn't even know she was a Russian prostitute until the bad guys showed up! ChloÃÂ« is a great actress, and for her limited screen time did well...save for the parts where she needed to speak Russian! For the sake of credibility, another talented and beautiful female actress - from Russia - could have worked just fine. It's a small role with limited screen time (even ChloÃÂ«'s name on the one-sheet seemed like an afterthought.)<br/><br/>Now the good news: Denzel, belovedly referred to as ""dedushka"" (grandfather) by the Russians, and ""Pops"" by his co-workers at the local ""Home Mart"" (and that's another thing, why not make a little sponsorship cash and have Robert McCall work at Home Depot?) seriously kicks some bad-dude-ass! His character is a little OCD (I can relate) and quite inventive (oh, the things one can do with a corkscrew in under 19 seconds)!<br/><br/>I loved Denzel in Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004). He was almost born to play these kinds of characters (I know, right). The Equalizer is a good action film that will keep your attention, but no gnarly 80's tunes to bring you back to the days when a middle aged Edward Woodward was playing the dedushka (hmm, the Russians were our enemies then too)."

Does he get the black jag with the wide wheel arches in the sequel 2018? Maybe they could give him a Metallic Black F Type with a few modifications. Its quite funny because when my antidepressants don't work so well, I put this film on and it makes you fell good. This is Washington's signature career character, every actor searches for one many never find it. I prayed for the sun when I commentated last time and had to deal with the heat. I am a big Clooney fan, I seriously love Denzil in this but cant help wondering how George would have been in the role, but better still he could do a sequel of The American and reprise his role of Jack Edward Clarke. The Equalizer is definitely in my desert island top 20 must haves. PS is there any chance of a homage to the old 80's theme tune in the sequel movie?"

","Odds against you? Need help? Indeed, the Hillary Clinton campaign could have called upon the Equalizer to battle against the Russian- led fake news in the 2016 presidential campaign.

No messing around by McCall. He gets the job done, delivers justice and rails against police corruption. Perhaps in the sequel he can also rail against the TSA agents who like to pick on minorities, and maybe McCall deliver his own kind of justice to them.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman play former CIA operatives, and it's good to know Melissa's character can beat rush hour traffic by getting a lift home in a helicopter.

","The Equalizer is certainly not an original. Movies like The Matrix or Bourne Supremacy come up from time to time to make our head spin. The rest of the time, you get junk. The Equalizer is somewhere in between. Solely because Danzel Washington plays an interesting character very well. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The direction and photography makes it enjoyable to watch. It seems to me that many viewers are addicted to fast pace movies. If it's a bit slow starting, they tune off. I don't mind personally. Not every action movie has to be fast and furious. There are people, who like fast pace and others who enjoy some thinking time, or are simply waiting for a break in the action to go to the bathroom. Your wife or girlfriend won't likely appreciate the violence, but in this kind of action movies, you expect the baddies to act evil. I found The Equalizer enjoyable. Love the atmosphere and waited patiently to see the bad guys get wasted. It's always a satisfying feeling. Short of ever seeing that kind of outcome in the real world, we're bound to see many more of these movies, good and bad, in the future."

","This is not the Robert McCall I grew up watching and that isn't a bad thing. I like the idea that writer Richard Wenk and director Antoine Fuqua reenvisioned the 1980's character for the modern era. As always Denzel Washington is superb and brings a new dimension to the character of The Equalizer.<br/><br/>Robert McCall is a warehouse worker in a D I Y retail store who at work helps his fellow employees, though out of work he's a solitary character with a habitual routine that verges on obsessive compulsive disorder. Each night he goes to the same diner and sits at the same table and orders a cup of water, into which he drops a teabag. While there he reads a book, he's on number 97 of the top 100 books to read before you die. He has a conversational relationship with one of the prostitutes that use the diner as a way station. This relationship becomes stronger and when she comes in battered and bruised McCall takes it upon himself to help her out...<br/><br/>From here on in you begin to learn of McCall's secret past as the action and violence amps up. McCall is a dark man who keeps his feelings in check though you never get to find out what makes him such a cold and logical executioner. This may be because there are more works in the pipeline, I hope so as this was an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The only irksome element of the story and movie is the relationship between McCall and the prostitute Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. As I previously stated, their relationship takes on an extra vitality. However, when she's hospitalised, he goes to the hospital though never makes contact and this is the last we see of her until the end; and this appears to have been an afterthought to give McCall a more humanistic presence. I think if the characters had more scenes together throughout the movie this could have help to detract from McCall's cold robotic personality. Maybe this wasn't the director's vision.<br/><br/>There's nothing in this film that hasn't been covered in other movies but that doesn't stop this from being an entertaining 132 minutes; It kept my attention so well that it really doesn't seem that long a film.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the series, or like action films, or love Denzel Washington (or all three), then this film will be right up your street."

He doesn't just kick butt, he really kicks it and he looks them straight in the eye when doing it. He's no nonsense, no explaining the situation, no negotiating. The payback in this feels good because the bad guys are so bad - well acted, too. The scenes are done well - setting the mood. The late night diner scenes are great. If you've ever been up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep, and you go out to the local 24 hr cafe - this is just what you'd picture it would be like. You don't get a lot of detail behind Denzel's character only that he's definitely been through a lot, had a wife, has OCD. His apartment is stark - no decorations, just the necessities to live. No mess. Everything in it's place. Denzel does this characters incredibly well. It's a tough one to play. There's very little emotion even in very emotional situations. Great action - great power.

Denzel Washington ploughs through the killing with single- minded, stony-eyed purpose. The deaths of the baddies are gory, inventive and leave you with a warm glow of justice done. As with John Wick, there is no romantic distraction to water down this excellent, macho indulgence: mano a mano from first frame to last. I'm on my third viewing. There'll be more.

Teri becomes vulnerable there and shares her interest in what he is reading, rather than staying in hooker character. And McCall dispatching of the hit-man sent to kill him stresses the finality of his actions.<br/><br/>While the last scene in Homemart is a little smaltzy, with McCall dispatching the tactically armed bad Russians with gardening tools, fencing and a nail gun, is a little incredible; it is a statement on his inventiveness. Skills that have served him well in his ""black-op"" life.<br/><br/>Leaving no loose ends he ""cuts off the snake's head"" and Teri is allowed to return to a life she desires.

"Relkinlaw","10","0","1","10 August 2016"," It is the depth of the Characters as brilliantly woven together by A. Fuqua that Earns a 10 from me.
","This movie is about the war of good and evil, the transformation of the hero, Denzel, from killer to protector, and his ardent wish to be in the service of good--a redemption from his Black ops background. I believe it is the subterranean nature of this conflict that makes him an anti-hero. His past was something he describes only to Teddy: ""I've done a lot of bad things in his life; things for which I am not proud."" The use of violence by DW in his past is unquestionably evil and a disease from which he suffers (he is unable to sleep and dream), and from which he must find redemption; clear ref to Bush era of targeted assassinations, imprisonment and rendition of huge numbers of violent men taken to black sites--for money and never based on any evidence. Thus, he planned his death to avoid destroying his soul because he knew the things he was told to do were fundamentally evil. There was never any real basis for their death or imprisonment, nor was the Bush admin. ever able to do anything but lie about the use of violence. Thus, with violence co-opted by the ""Government"" for whom he worked, he is a man who has lost any faith that his ""work"" had, or could have, a moral basis. We meet DW in this shadowy world of dreams he reads the Old man and the Sea by Hemingway and Don Quixote, by Cervantes. And the reason he is doing this is spiritual. He keeps a connection with his wife, recently having passed, through this ""dream-world"" of fiction she had begun: moreover, The Old Man has no name, yet he fights ""forces of nature"" to be himself; Don Quixote fights for freedom in a time when his abilities are out of sync with the nature of the times. So, too, DW, learns that he is both men, thus, when he returns, he plans and executes his own death, and is symbolically reborn by destroying true evil."

He has promised his deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind, but is compelled to act after his teenage friend Teri, whose real name is Alina, was seen being mistreated by her pimp, Slavi and this leads into him seeking on the Russian Mafia.

When this came out, my mom got this movie for me on Bootleg, along with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", while my sister, Da'Quantria, got me ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and I liked both of those, but I also really like this film and it was so damn good.<br/><br/>The plot is really amazing and it does not take me that many times for me to understand and the script writer of this film, Richard Wenk, did a really great job and it was spectacular and amazing to see and hear the dialogue was really amazing and so damn spectacular.<br/><br/>The one major thing that bothers me and this is the reason why this movie appears on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list on IMDb on my profile is because some of the action scenes can get a lot bloody and violent in a few areas. I don't mind blood at all, but it's just that they use way too much blood in some of the action sequences in The Equalizer.<br/><br/>The performances in this film as phenomenal in this film. Academy Award winner Denzel Washington is known for his superbad villain role in the 2001 film, Training Day, which he won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal and that film is just beautiful and amazing and it is really cool to see him as a good guy, fighting against the Russians once again, after what the Russians did to him at the end of Training Day.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz plays Arina / Teri and she does a great job after I watched her in ""Carrie"" and in ""DARK SHADOWS"", and she does two hell of a performances in those films and she's really nice here. Melissa Leo, despite my mixed feelings towards her in PRISONERS, I like her in this film. Her performance is incredible. Bill Pullman is in this film and does a really great job. Martin Csokas plays Teddy and he does a great job too, despite the amount of screen time that he has in the film, he does really great. The production values are amazing, especially the music and action sequences but like I said, the action sequences are way too bloody, gory and violent and I think it does not hurt my viewing experience. This is an R-rated film, so if you did not like blood and violence, don't watch it for all you sensitive kids, but for all you people who likes blood and violence in action movies or scary movies, or science-fiction or zombie movies, The Equalizer is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars and the film is just really amazing and I have no problem watching this again and again. The film is just really amazing and Denzel Washington's performance is the best of his long time career and I encourage you to watch the film. You might get something out of it."

","Denzel Washington has discovered invisibility. He can walk through the city killing all the bad guys, but no one ever see him. He is so proud of his invisibility, that he even rejects taking the guns when he has the opportunity and 10 armed guys in front of him, because it is fancier to kill them with his own hands (or whatever devices he finds around, to make the movie bloodier than needed). Of course, he gives the bad guys the opportunity to repent from their sins, but they reject and he feels obliged to kill them (typical justification of the capital punishment of so many American movies...). All this spiced with the so original wuthering past of a guy who does not like what he does but is forced to do it by the reality, the corrupt policemen, and the dumb friend who finally becomes a hero (if not calling the police when several armed guys are trying to kill someone could be considered a heroicity)."

It's got nothing to with Denzel really... well, at least for me it doesn't. But what truly made this film as outstanding as it was and utterly brilliant in every way possible, was the way it was written, the way the story unfolds, the way it almost forces you to be neutral (unless you're a Denzel fan then you're obviously cheering him on from the moment the production studio logos appear).<br/><br/>But I cannot think of any other film (help me if you know of any) that so brilliantly makes two extremely opposite characters - the protagonist and antagonist obviously (or good guy and bad guy as we call them now), appear so similar, just to make them face off at the end in what usually is a sharp contrast of good versus evil. And it's really not a question of who's gonna win at the end (because it's obviously the good guy -duh!), but the challenging part really, is who do you root for!<br/><br/>We all love villains - not that we root for them, but we just love the characters. But in this film, you not only love the villain, but you feel a strong urge to secretly root for him. Mainly because it takes a while for you to realise he's actually the bad guy. So torn between two worlds, you're literally forced to step out of the picture and eagerly watch the action unfold with bated breath to see what will happen next. By the time the end credits roll, you're still sitting motionless in your seat trying to take it all in. The adrenaline in this film is extremely high - even in some of the slower paced scenes. Watch with caution if you cannot handle that."

","I didn't know for sure until I saw the list of credits listed herein, but I definitely had a feeling that Antoine Fuqua had something to do w/this film, and that feeling went on to be justified. Unlike ""Training Day"", an entirely moral man was to be portrayed--a man who believes in the rights of the ""little guy"" and that right should conquer over evil, which McCall goes on to do. I loved this film and loved the role that Denzel plays in it. Denzel (almost) always has chosen to portray great characters in film. Sometimes evil; more often moral, but ALWAYS interesting and this film does that with a capital I!

McCall now enjoys the quiet life, but when he meets Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) a young girl who is brutalised whilst she's under the control of the Russian Mob, McCall finds that he needs to use all his specialist skills and know-how to bring the mob down and set Teri free from them.<br/><br/>The first notable problem with this film is its running time and clocking in at around the 2 hour 15 minute mark one could argue that there's not enough material to justify such a long running time. It also seemed that the writers didn't really know what sort of film that they're making; it starts off with McCall having to protect Teri from the mob, then while she's laid up in hospital it then turns into a Death Wish type film where McCall becomes a vigilante and makes his mission to avenge anyone who wrongs his work colleagues then he'd go back to pursuing the mob and then it would cut back to McCall protecting his work colleagues. These deviations were good to watch. but had nothing to do with the story making me wonder why they were included? It does make the film a little messy at times and a lot of it felt like unnecessary filler.<br/><br/>McCall is an anti-hero here and is a fairly likable individual; he's a bit of a man of mystery and we learn very little about him throughout the film. I do get a bit annoyed when films don't develop their characters, but this wouldn't matter so much if this film had a much tighter running time (90 to 105 minutes), but it's tough to get fully involved in a film that's this long when your main character hasn't been developed at all. Aside from not learning much about McCall's past the writers don't bother to explain other things such as McCall constantly stopping and starting his watch - did he suffer from some kind of time-obsessed compulsive disorder? How did he manage to track down the bloke that robbed the money from the store and the ring from the woman? He's clearly got an eye for detail as he noticed various distinguishing features on the man, but how did he track him down after he left? <br/><br/>Although I had quite a few issues with this film I have to admit that I did enjoy it and it's great fun watching Denzel kick a load of ass and at nearly 60 years old he's quite clearly not too old for this sh*t just yet. The editing is also fast, sharp and of very high quality. The final showdown at the end was also entertaining and it was quite intriguing seeing how McCall would off each baddie. Denzel Washington is great here and does pretty much everything that Jason Statham can do (only with Washington you get better acting and perhaps slightly more charisma). Moretz is a good little actress, but she's criminally under-used here.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is a fairly good film but it felt like the writers tried to do too much and as a result it made the film far longer than it needed to be. Still the fight sequences are good, the showdown at the end was fun and creative and despite the odd lull now and again I never got to the point where I was bored. It's certainly worth a look and the ending also suggests that there may be a sequel."

I for one look forward to the possibility of more Robert McCall further down the line, and with Fuqua and Washington working together anything is possible. 10/10 for me and also in the age of action films with very little story this is a breath of fresh air, the depth of the characters McCall specifically/"

","I've got to admit that I had my doubts about this film even after seeing the trailer for it. Not because it looked like just another over-the-top actioner, but because it didn't really strike me as a film worth watching. Boy, was I ever wrong, and I'm SO glad I decided to watch it after thinking ""Ah, what the Hell...I'll give it a try"".<br/><br/>The Equalizer is actually one of the best recent action films that I've seen for a good while and everything - from the direction and cinematography to the casting and action & suspense - is just so well done. It's very refreshing to watch an action film that has a credible & enthralling story to it as well instead of some simple, IQ draining, clichÃ© filled tripe like The Fast & The Furious.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good scenes throughout this film and I think I would be hard pushed to pick out just one that was better than any other. In saying that, though, the slow-motion scenes were definitely some of the stand-out moments for me and were filmed perfectly, capturing the calculating mind of McCall nicely.<br/><br/>The cast was spot-on as well with Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz all doing bang-up jobs with their characters. Washington's portrayal of McCall was just nailed to perfection as was Csokas's performance as the vicious, calculating Russian mafia henchman Nikolai ""Teddy"" Itchenko.<br/><br/>I think the only reason that stopped me from giving this film a higher rating was due to it being a wee bit slow in some places. I know that to be a GOOD action film, you need to develop the story, the characters, and the mood for what's coming, and while it succeeded in doing all of that. it just felt a touch slow during some scenes. That's a very minor point, however, and it in no way spoils any of the viewing.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film then you're definitely missing out on an absolute gem. Great cast, well written, and full of action & suspense. What more could you want?"

","First, let me just say that I was a big time fan of the television version of The Equalizer in the 80s but the only similarity is that the characters share the same name.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a super organized and friendly loner that works in what appears to be a Home Depot type of store. His past, which is clearly working as a CIA operative who was believed killed, haunts him so he can't sleeps and spends his evening at a local coffee shop, reading and socializing with a very young attractive prostitute, Teri, played by Chloe Graze Moretz.<br/><br/>After Teri is assaulted and hospitalized by her pimp, played by David Meunier - Justified fans will recognize him, McCall proceeds to go on a killing rampage which starts a war with a powerful Russian king pin.<br/><br/>The story then follows a by the numbers action/kill fest that leads pretty much where you expect to go but what makes it work are excellent performances by everyone in the cast and the tight story telling. There is no chaff in this film and it does not pretend to be anything than what it is, a great way to spend a couple of hour being entertained and not thinking. If you are not a ""fan"" of pretty graphic violence you may want to avoid this one."

","I didn't get to see this at the movie theater, but I did get to see this on HBO. When I sat down to watch this movie I thought I knew how this movie would end based on the previous movies I have seen Denzel in. I was surprised completely. I really liked this movie. I thought it was really clever. Denzel has always been a very serious actor, so It was no surprise when I saw his part in this movie . It is always such a pleasure to see him act. His characters are so believable. In some scenes the way the camera was positioned it gave the audience a surreal view of the actions from one of the characters views. I only wish the audience would have been given a little more information about Robert McCall's past life. His character was such a mystery, but I guess that's what makes his character so intriguing."

","The Equalizer (2014). Better yet, fill the empty box with Denzel Washington â secure in his position, coolly cranking out box office hits â then dress it up a bit so it looks like it's about a few halfway relevant things, or even just one thing, or even just half of a thing. And if that half of a thing is Denzel Washington fighting the faces off of bad dudes with lumber and drills and his bare hands, then that's a good enough half of a thing.<br/><br/>Washington is Robert McCall, a Boston man with a mysterious past. He lives quietly and works at a Home Depot-style store called ""Home Mart."" He's an insomniac, spending his nights reading classic literature in a 24-hour diner so Edward Hopper-ish that it might as well be named ""Nighthawks."" He reads The Old Man and The Sea. He reads Don Quixote. These titles are meant to convey the shape of his soul and the deeper themes a different film might explore. Aim well, movie; fill that box. As for a rewatch (02/25/17') this film is definitely more slower paced than one remembers. The action is there and far out within each other, and Denzel is great in this role. The Equalizer being compared to John Wick is quite accurate, both very similar films in tone and story. The Equalizer is still a solid slower paced action film."

","I was a big fan of this TV show. I was excited to see this reboot, and especially with Denzel as Robert McCall, a simple day worker at a big box home depot type store, but with an unknown past.<br/><br/>Denzel delivers in spades. His character is very slowly revealed as a vigilante type who takes no crap from any bad guy who wrongs the simple, hard-working, common person on the street. Kind of like the Charles Bronson Death Wish series. Some of the interactions are funny, especially with the other femme semi-lead, young lady hooker who dreams of being a singer, but is instead deep in over her head with Russian bad guys.<br/><br/>Well, you know stuff is going to happen, and when it does, you want Robert McCall on your side. He takes on the Russians and other bad guys. The fight scenes are all slow-motion timed out choreographies that reveal part of Denzel's character's compulsion with organizing everything in his life.<br/><br/>You learn only a little about his past, something to do with something powerful in some government agency, but there are little details given, other than the knowledge that this is a guy you do NOT mess with.<br/><br/>The ending leaves the sequel door wide open, and I hope they follow this up while Denzel is still young enough to do this action stuff. One thing's for sure - next time I go to Home Depot or Lowes, I'm going to look at the guys there muccccch differently. Enjoy this excellent action flick."

","The Equalizer is a movie that I wanted to see because it was a movie that I wanted see because Denzel Washington was playing him and the director of Training Day, Antoine Fuqua, was directing it and the film was based on the 1980's television series of the same name. <br/><br/>The film follows Robert McCall and he is a retired black ops government operative who lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works at a Home Mart hardware store, where he befriends many of his co-workers and also tries to help a security guard trainee Ralphie pass his qualification exam. He has promised his deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind, but is compelled to act after his teenage friend Teri, whose real name is Alina, was seen being mistreated by her pimp, Slavi and this leads into him seeking on the Russian Mafia. He then identifies himself as ""The Equalizer"".<br/><br/>The film is a dream come true for me. When this came out, my mom got this movie for me on Bootleg, along with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", while my sister, Da'Quantria, got me ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and I liked both of those, but I also really like this film and it was so damn good.<br/><br/>The plot is really amazing and it does not take me that many times for me to understand and the script writer of this film, Richard Wenk, did a really great job and it was spectacular and amazing to see and hear the dialogue was really amazing and so damn spectacular. <br/><br/>The one major thing that bothers me and this is the reason why this movie appears on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list on IMDb on my profile is because some of the action scenes can get a lot bloody and violent in a few areas. I don't mind blood at all, but it's just that they use way too much blood in some of the action sequences in The Equalizer.<br/><br/>The performances in this film as phenomenal in this film. Academy Award winner Denzel Washington is known for his superbad villain role in the 2001 film, Training Day, which he won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal and that film is just beautiful and amazing and it is really cool to see him as a good guy, fighting against the Russians once again, after what the Russians did to him at the end of Training Day.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz plays Arina / Teri and she does a great job after I watched her in ""Carrie"" and in ""DARK SHADOWS"", and she does two hell of a performances in those films and she's really nice here. Melissa Leo, despite my mixed feelings towards her in PRISONERS, I like her in this film. Her performance is incredible. Bill Pullman is in this film and does a really great job. Martin Csokas plays Teddy and he does a great job too, despite the amount of screen time that he has in the film, he does really great. The production values are amazing, especially the music and action sequences but like I said, the action sequences are way too bloody, gory and violent and I think it does not hurt my viewing experience. This is an R-rated film, so if you did not like blood and violence, don't watch it for all you sensitive kids, but for all you people who likes blood and violence in action movies or scary movies, or science-fiction or zombie movies, The Equalizer is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars and the film is just really amazing and I have no problem watching this again and again. The film is just really amazing and Denzel Washington's performance is the best of his long time career and I encourage you to watch the film. You might get something out of it."

I heard he always chooses his movies very carefully, and this fits straight into what he prefers, good v evil where good must prevail. I found myself really drawn in and very engaged when he assesses the threat capacity of his opponents. There is something quite satisfying about the action he takes and I felt that I was on the journey with him. As for previous comments who really cares if the Russians were not authentic Russians??? The casting was really good. I prefer to view movies as pure entertainment and I think trying to critique everything or the authenticity of people places and story lines just takes the fun out of it.

","The Equalizer was one of the most underrated shows of the 1980s, it was a great show, but it always lacked a certain intensity that the lead character needed. In this 2014 film adaptation of the series, Director, Antoine Fuqua, made sure that didn't happen again. Denzel Washington stars and can play anyone, but I find he's at his best when he's playing a dark loner like Robert McCall. McCall, a former CIA operative has retired and is attempting to live a normal life. Everything is going as planned, until he sees a young girl being abused, and decides to take action. McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel. It may not be a new TV series, but it's still something exciting for the fans, and I for one can't wait to see more."

When you need a night of low life punks getting obliterated, sliced/diced, shot with a nail gun, cork screwed through the jaw, this is the one to watch! The interesting aspect for me is that every villain has an opportunity to stop his behavior before judgment. It's a really great picture of spiritual truth. Another powerful message comes through loud and clear. We all have the ability to serve someone in need. Take a look around and you will see someone you can help."

It ended up a lot better than I expected, I'll watch anything with Denzel Washington, but this appeared very clichÃ© and typical from its trailers, offering nothing interesting or new material for moviegoers. While it may not have the most original set up and storyline, it makes up for it with a dazzling performance from Washington and Antoine Fuqua's cool and slick directing style, this saves it from being a boring movie. It's a very good franchise vehicle for Washington, he owns this role, his character has many flaws which manage to make the character more likable and help us symphatize with him more, but there is still a lot to learn about Robert McCall which future sequels could answer. It has its flaws, but the Equalizer mostly makes up for it by being a generally enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller. <br/><br/>A man who decides to put his dark past behind him must jump back in to action to save a young girl who is under the control of Russian gangsters. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Denzel Washington Worst Performance: Bill Pullman"

","In this film, Denzel Washington as a former agent-turned-Home Depot associate ""Bob"" is confronted with the question: Must he act against injustices instead of just standing by, given his past training as assassin, given who he is? <br/><br/>He befriends a hooker, who thinks he is rather a ""Robert"" than a ""Bob,"" and she is right of course. They always chat at the same diner, where he sits at a meticulously arranged table reading is latest book, such as ""Old Man and the Sea."" When she, a singer at heart, is brutally mutilated by her pimp, something snaps and Robert starts offering the bad guys an option: behave, or die. None of them take him seriously until they are dying. This attracts the attention of the highest echelon of Russian crimelords: they can't figure out who is messing with their US operations.<br/><br/>The movie starts out very quietly introducing Washington's character as a man of precision, reader of a good novel every night, and helper in his community. Then it turns hyperviolent to set the tone of Robert as a clockwork killer. He assesses each situation, estimates time to mission completion, sets his stopwatch and... proceeds to cut out eyes with broken glass rims, drill though necks, strangle people with barbed wire, and so forth. Then he washes up and goes back to work.<br/><br/>Once the film has established his extreme capabilities, it dials the mayhem way back to focus on a cat-and-mouse game between Robert and the Russian emissary who comes after him. By the time Robert blows up the crimelord's shipyard and neutralizes their money laundering operation, we are willing to believe that he could do it, never mind the details. Plot holes are avoided, such as when Robert gets permission from his former Agency bosses to clean up the Russians.<br/><br/>The climax in Robert's store is well played. As the emissary dies, one can tell that this is an incredible situation for him: how could he, who dispatches people like lint, suddenly be the lint? Unfortunately, the film then commits the sin of Hollywood action flicks incapable of quitting while ahead of the game. When Robert has walked off into the night, the film needed a quiet shot of the unoccupied diner table, open to page three of a newspaper announcing a Russian mafia lord in Moscow has been assassinated, then panning over to the latest reading material ""Invisible Man."" Instead, we get an unnecessary scene of electrocution of said mafia lord in Moscow, and Robert happily ever after meeting up with his friends, as though he could (Agency permission or not) despite all the FBI and police have learned. All to loud rock music that does not fit the tone of a man quietly equalizing the world for the weak. And then Robert gets his first text message to ""save someone"" on his iPad, the call for the sequel.<br/><br/>Could have been 8 stars without the botched ending, but a good film even so."

"Sandcooler","9","0","6","9 February 2015"," Brutally violent, yet still atmospheric
","The revenge flick is one of those subgenres Hollywood never seems to get tired of. The main reason for that is that they just look so damn easy to write: just get a gang of evil stereotypes harming someone innocent and then turn the tables, you're done. It seems like the formula really does everything for you, it just comes down to coming up with action scenes until you can finally kill of the main villain. ""The Equalizer"" however is a movie that shows us how much you can do with the genre if your screenwriter's not phoning it in. For example, most revenge movies make the error of barely establishing the victim, making it difficult to care when the baddies get their comeuppance. In this one Chloe Grace Moretz doesn't get much screen time, but it's not necessary: it just takes about two scenes to start caring about her character. In fact, everything about this movie seems compact yet efficient. There isn't a single scene that goes on for too long, nor is there a single boring moment. While most action movies just throw everything they have at you and see what sticks, ""The Equalizer"" is just a perfect puzzle: the pacing, the visual style, the almost cartoonish violence, the brilliant performance by Denzel Washington (who switches back and forth between loving friend and cruel angel of vengeance with baffling ease), everything just clicks together. ""The Equalizer"" is nothing you haven't seen before, but you've rarely seen it done this competently."
"p-jonsson","8","0","4","7 February 2015"," Very entertaining vigilante flick
","For me this vas a very entertaining vigilante flick. Denzel Washington is excellent in his role as a cold and calculating yet compassionate vigilante. The movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured (for a movie in this genre) and well done.<br/><br/>Although there is a red thread, started by McCall's first act of vigilantism, running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie. I like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie.<br/><br/>The main thread pitches McCall against a real psychopathic Russian enforcer. No one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy. The role is quite well played. The guy is creepy to say the least. Not to mention violent of course but then so is McCall when the time is right.<br/><br/>One thing I liked with this movie is that McCall it is not one of the usual run around, look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes. McCall is always calm, calculating, behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late.<br/><br/>Sure, the capacity of McCall to clobber the bad guys, usually without getting hurt himself, is bordering on superhuman but what the heck, it is fiction after all. Totally realistic movies are rarely fun, at least not movies of this genre. Also, the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better. Especially since the Russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point. Having said that, I did like that it did not degenerate into the usual 20 minute shoot anything that moves nonsense. McCall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative.<br/><br/>On the whole I found this to be a rather entertaining movie. In one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff, which I happen to like, but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to Denzel Washington's cold, calculating and intelligent portrayal of McCall."

","I've got to say, I want to see more of Robert McCall, the main protagonist of Equalizer. This guy is a realistic badass, using his skill and perfect timing to even the odds in a one-man-war against the Russian mob, who have taken over his city.<br/><br/>At first, I didn't buy this movie (figuratively speaking). First maybe 30 minutes were a snore, but once it got into it's odd groove, the movie is pretty cool. Some little bugs, like an overuse of slow-motion (in an attempt to make it ""cooler"") and some other stuff, but the overall product isn't bad.<br/><br/>The musical score is awesome. The only time I remember a better one is in Transformers (you can hate on the movie series, but the musical score is one of the best I've heard). The acting from Washington is believable.<br/><br/>The overall believability in this movie help it gain it's own footing in the individuality.<br/><br/>One of the things I wished they focused more on is his past. It's so murky, that it leaves you scratching your head.<br/><br/>The movie is gritty, dark, and again, realistic.<br/><br/>The preview was promising, the style was cool, but in the end, most of the movie until the end is boring. No immature boob shots, so hurray!"

","At first in the early part, I was a little worried as I know how these revenge pics go, where the surrounding atmosphere of story isn't new. A good hearted guy, Robert Mccall, ex CIA, (Washington) avenges a brutal attack on a teen prostitute (a sexy Chloe Moretz, not the first time in a role like this) who's caught up with the Russian mafia. We know all too well, after films like Eastern Promises, what these scum are like. The movie had me thinking in it's earlier stage, ""It wsn't cutting it for me"". As the movie progresses, luckily it avoids not falling into that ""trite, seen it before scenario"", where it uses smarts in it's plotting, where we see more bad guys getting away with stuff, one incident unrelated, involving a robbery, with Denzel returning a hammer to his place of business and robbery scene, implying, a bit of face reconstruction to that poor robber. Denzel's character, McCall, is such a smart cookie, we don't know what his next trick is, which make it's fun it's waiting and suspense. Prior, Denzel had taken out like eight bad Russian dudes, in a swift slick method of kill, which has you thinking back to The Boondock Saints, what he's done has opened up a can of worms. The movie cranks it up after it's first thirty five minutes, One bad Russian dude, like a mafia Godfather, also no dummy, has arrived in town, setting the story further in motion, where he's intent to get the truth, despite his unwelcome presence from some associates and bad eggs, un Russian, where to him he's just a visitor. Quickly, they learn he's sorely mistaken. Always with Denzel, we have to watch him act, as if visual proof, to realize, what he can bring to each character. He doesn't really have to try to act. He just be's that character, where in no way has his acting ever slacked. An older Bull Pullman and Melissa Leo, also CIA, once, though Leo's character works for the secretary department there now, though small in roles, must be acknowledged for their strong performances, particularly Leo. The Equalizer is a smart slick thriller, a new refreshing vigilante film, where the time has been right for a new one, sort of Death Wish, 2014 style. The action climax is protracted though, yet explosive in it's resolution of it's final chief baddie, in a cool slo mo, atmospheric shot of Denzel where overhead sprinklers, send many streaks of rain, catching his face, as is on the movie poster, which reminds you of the Sin City one. And Denzel goes after everyone, and I mean everyone, in an after ending, just recently like the one in Sabotage. Also speaking of Sabotage, a warehouse of moolah our agents stumble upon here, gegives new meaning to the term, surplus. The final reuniting scene of Moretz and Washington, was so predictable though, but necessary."
"brchthethird","8","0","3","20 January 2015"," Denzel Washington plays another badass, so what's not to love?
","Directed by Antoine Fuqua and based on a 1980's TV show (which I haven't seen), THE EQUALIZER stars Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a quiet man with a murky past who has a keen sense of justice and helps those in need. While this film could have been a pulpy, ultra-violent mess, the team of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington (who previously collaborated on TRAINING DAY) bring a sense of realism and attention to character that elevate this above your typical revenge action picture. As the title character, Denzel Washington brings gravitas and his usual ""coolness"" to the role of Robert McCall. He's a man of few words, and also one who is methodical and precise. He also has a good sense of right and wrong, which is why he does what he does, and not just in a violent way. He's a very friendly man who helps his friends and co-workers in other ways as well, i.e., training a fellow Home Mart employee for a security guard exam. One thing I really liked was the way in which you could tell what he was thinking by him just giving a look, and in fact, we are introduced to him in a largely wordless opening sequence. The film also stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Ilina/Teri, an underage Russian prostitute. While she did a great job portraying her character, she was little more than a plot device that springs McCall into action. I should also mention Marton Czokas as Teddy, a Russian heavy who is brought in to investigate after McCall kills several Russian pimps in retaliation for putting Ilina in the hospital (of course, after offering them a way out). He was the only other character besides McCall who really had any depth, and he brought a certain lethality and sadism to his character which contrasted nicely with McCall. Other than him, all of the villains were expendable and generic, which is unfortunate considering the quality filmmaking here. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo also appeared in glorified cameos as a friendly couple tied to McCall's mysterious past. They weren't anything special, but it was nice to see them in the film. Regarding McCall's past, though, they don't really go into much detail but it wasn't too much of a big deal because it contributed to his overall mystique and kept the focus on his everyman persona. As far as the action and technical side of the film, it was well-staged and shot, and it looked like Denzel did most of his own stunts. The fights were up close and intimate, but it was still possible to tell what was going on from shot to shot as well as having a good sense of geography. However, for the most part, the violence was restrained and brutally efficient instead of lingering on it in a gratuitous way, which was true to the character of McCall. Overall, despite not delving too deeply into any of the characters but McCall, THE EQUALIZER is a good examination of a down-to-earth hero who does what he feels is right in order to level the playing field for those who are unable to help themselves. There's also a nice sub-message about being who you want to be in life and not letting others dictate that for you. It's one of the best action movies in a while, and a great re-teaming of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington, who appears here in top form."

This movie gave me everything I needed and it satisfied me to the very end. It was complete, well written, and efficient. There was no grandstanding just good old fashioned maneuvering and outwitting your opponent it was like watching a chess match but with a grand master and a novice at the board. <br/><br/>If you go in without any expectations I believe you will enjoy this movie for what it's meant to be and that's just a good time.

","When watching action movies, I always wonder if it's even possible to have a film where the hero doesn't make mistakes, and still have it be a entertaining film with suspense. Because, in too many action movies the hero will slip up in a ridiculous way so the story can lead to the inevitable standoff, but that doesn't happen here.<br/><br/>In The Equalizer, Denzel Washington is an ex-Assassin turned ""Bourne again"" Assassin who does it right. He's an ""ordinary"" human being with superhuman skills, unleashing violence when persuasion fails to move the bad guys. The fight scenes are really cool, you have the thing where the situation is surveyed in slow motion and then the fighter leaps into action, I always like it when films show this process.<br/><br/>The movie makes you feel intelligent for watching people get brutally murdered, because Robert McCall is a one-man wrecking machine and he must use his wits to turn the tide against the numerous enemies. He may seem impervious at times, but in no way does his continued survival feel forced.<br/><br/>There are a few minor quips I have about the movie though: There's some ridiculously obvious ""metaphors"" early on in the exposition (about hope etc) that rather annoyed me because its obvious the writers were trying to compare the character dialog to the impending storyline.<br/><br/>I praise Denzel Washington's character, but his success wasn't completely possible without the villains being at least slightly stupid. Simply, the villains make mistakes. Oh well you can't have everything.<br/><br/>Overall though, with its intelligent yet intense and satisfying violence, a rarity of a ""perfect"" hero and simply overall entertainment, The Equalizer is perhaps the best Action film of 2014 and you'd be doing yourself a disservice to miss it."

","Last year when i saw movie ""flight"", i thought its best ever movie by Denzel. As i watched ""The Equalizer"" i realized that there is nothing the best for a great actor like Denzel. Every flick is great in its own way. Character Robert McCall is a mysterious person and talks with eyes. His acting shows how mature he is as actor, its something that's earned over years. ""Marton Csokas"" played brilliant role and he too is a mysterious character. Actual plot as i think is that lead character ""Robert McCall"" is actually fighting with himself, He saw his helplessness in that girl, so he was actually fighting for himself to be out of his not so good past. Lead actors carried films so well that crowd will not think of logical things like how's and why's. Its a must watch in Theater, and i am sure the whole team of ""The Equalizer"" will keep coming with excellent stuff like this one."

","I sat down to watch this film not expecting much but i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it so much i was compelled to write a review, so that says something! Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as the lead character, ably supported by a rather hot Chloe Grace Moretz amongst others plus a host of your usual Eastern European, tattoo covered mobsters. The film builds nicely from a rather slow start, a start which contrasts well with the action to come, giving you no clue as to what will unfold. My only caveat is with the end scene/boss fight. Thankfully it wasn't a shirtless, gladiatorial fight to the death, however, the scene is set inside a DIY superstore where our hero uses a variety of store products to dispatch those pesky Russians. I can see a parody where, as he hangs one baddie with barbed wire using cement bags as a counterweight i can see him pausing to say ""barbed wire, not just for fencing and only $1 a foot"" he proceeds to use a cordless drill, some kind of long handled shears, gas bottles etc etc. Just looked a bit naff and took the edge off what was up until that point a very solid film.

"louisesth","9","0","2","11 January 2015"," Good update and revision of an ""oldie, but goodie""
","I enjoyed the old television Equalizer program and I feel that this updated, revision was exceptional. The theme of both the old television program and this movie is of hopefulness. It is a fantasy and it is entertaining. Unfortunately, the violence portrayed is just a representation of what happens to some people in real life, just like the suffering and struggling that is represented. This is the world in which some people live. That there are parts that could be realistic only makes the story suspenseful. I am not into analyzing the plot or character development. I am not looking for realism when watching movies or programs of this type. This is not a documentary. It could be escapism for some from a difficult life. That is what I enjoyed from the television series. The bad guys got their come uppance. I am just glad that sometimes that for the good, decent, ordinary people, there is a hero or superman to save the day! I have been a fan of Mr. Washington's since his early television days. To witness and experience his transformation from television actor to his growth of a superstar is impressive."
"callumniatory","7","0","1","11 January 2015"," Equal Eyes Equalise Equal Lies
","I regard this film nicely. However, there are many points to this movie that made me feel like, Man, that wasn't equal at all. Why call it the equalizer? This question of identity invoked me to comment and review this artistic representation of ex-killers working at home depots. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington did a superb job representing an intellectual ex- killer working an ordinary and satisfying job at what seemed to be a franchise hardware store. I, myself, would have preferred glasses Denzel in this particular film but I realize that if we were to take him as what he was, he would seem a little bit like a serial killer (with the glasses and all.) Not that he wasn't anyway, because he serially killed (a lot of guys (pretty ruthlessly too.)) Marton Csokas also did a fine job representing a cool slick Moriarty cross with the demon dude from Supernatural. His character was a bit all over the place, and often there were times when the things you would expect his character to do, didn't happen. For example, in the home scene where Teddy visits McCall at his house. If their respective characters were truly themselves, then some things would've definitely have gone down during that interaction. It left me feeling like they could've ended the film then and there but decided to drag it out via a few thousand deaths and ""justice"" scenes (also for the final home depot scene.) Which, as an action film, I kind of expected. Chloe Moretz was an OKAY Teri. She didn't get much screen time. They had such a thick friendship for him to go through all that jazz but they only had the occasion of meeting up (in the film) three times. Which was kind of weird if you think about it. But it was good that the focus wasn't just on a girl. It seems as though in this film, women and men are equalized. The other characters didn't really seem very important to the plot. Just extras dying.<br/><br/>The cinematography was decent. I mean, they got the actions parts pretty good. But the slow scenes felt more slow than they should have been. I understand this is build up technique for tension, but honestly, for tensions scenes i personally would go for a straight one shot rather than flick over multiple camera shots to show many perspectives of one person being choked to death (for example.) The first action scene was brilliant and I wished there was more of that (equalisation) but the remaining action scenes and sort-of action scenes left a lot to be desired. The final action sequence definitely dragged out for too long, and it was not really known how many people Nikolai had entered the building with and that made me feel quite an imbalance with what was going on. Especially since in the previous scenes, they illustrated each character and their deaths (if they died.) The final scene where Nikolai versus McCall was way too short. This whole rivalry the film built up between these two equalizers felt like it was for nothing as McCall obviously out equalized his adversary. Extremely quickly too, unfortunately. Left me feeling incomplete, especially after the scene where McCall directly threats Nikolai in the restaurant.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty unrealistic. The idea behind it was decent I guess with the whole moral obligations, follow your heart served with the side of justice combo meal deal type of thing. And i suppose it was fair that McCall did get roughed up once or twice during his altercations. But to take down an entire enterprise and then immediately travel to Russia to shut the whole thing down officially? These guys must have been trained in COD or something. Really. Teri's character was a nice trigger, but the plot focused far too much time trying to create the relationship between her and McCall. <br/><br/>The script was pretty nice, made the dialog flow very well. Straight to the point with a touch of melodrama during some certain monologues. The conversations didn't seemed forced. But the whole special prostitute meets special agent kind of thing was kind of fake feeling. Like in a book from the 1970s or something. Like Pretty Woman never existed or something. Since when do you make friends like that in diners nowadays. And I assume this was 2014 as he was using a smart phone to take pictures and he was using a laptop to hack cameras. <br/><br/>PLOT HOLES. Why the hell did he have two houses? did he know this thang was gonna happen? How do you rig a surveillance system in your house with the wages from home depot? How did he create an entirely new identification for himself when according to his CIA friend, he was dead? Wouldn't the CIA have found out? Wouldn't his friend have been breaking protocol? Would the CIA suspect something, what with all the killings going on and suddenly a retired CIA asks to see some files relating to the recent killings? Is the CIA that chill? Why did the tanker company have no security? Surely he didn't as he is a sentimental character who believes and peace and justice. Why did the Russian mobsters decide to kill McCall ruthlessly at the end when at the beginning they spent so much time trying to make it look like a clean death? What, rich Russian mobsters cant afford silencers? They couldn't have stationed the sniper from the other location outside of home depot? They couldn't afford smoke bombs or the like, even though they had night vision, couldn't they afford thermal scopes? He could have easily been taken out so many times. <br/><br/>All in all, great film. I enjoyed it. I laughed. 7/10. Would watch again, provided I forgot what the film entailed. Which isn't going to be a problem, two weeks from now."

This is one of the greatest action flicks I've seen in a while. Denzel is fighting for something and when he's playing a character that does that, I think it just makes him sexier, showing throughout that he does care for the few people in his life. He's very mysterious throughout the movie and the audience is left trying to figure out what exactly is in his past.

With ""The Equalizer"" he's a Producer so may have settled for less salary. Regardless, this film spends time introducing and defining the characters which I think is a plus and it establishes a trust the viewer has in Robert (Denzels character) that allows us to feel comfortable with some very uncomfortable violence he bestows on the Russian Mob in Boston and the crooked cops working with the Mob. BTW, I feel certain many people were turned off by the violence and thus gave this film a low rating. All I can say about that is, the picture reflects reality so if you want to continue to live in a fantasy world go and see Disney's Frozen. Also, if you want to see another Bronson (remember The Death Wish days?) type movie starring Denzel by all means rent or purchase ""Man On Fire"" its Denzel Vs The Mexican Drug Cartels over a kidnapped little girl.

","""When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.""<br/><br/>Can you remember Denzel Washington's performance in ""The Book of Eli"" ? His coolness and calmness. The grimness. The power he has to move mountains. Approaching his target confidently , his inner tranquility taking over and with extreme precision dealing with his opponents. Shrewdly assimilating the situation, let it sink in for a moment and than act fast accurately. Masterfully, breathtaking to watch and immensely exciting. He also demonstrates these qualities in ""The Equalizer"". The only difference is that he's not completely blind here.<br/><br/>At first sight Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) looks like an ordinary, well-organized man who has an normal job in a hardware store. Apparently he was one of the Pips performing with Gladys Knight in the distant past (according to the plausible explanation of Robert who as a bonus demonstrates a few sultry dance moves as illustration). The fact he has nothing to do with the Pips, quickly becomes obvious. His true identity is not explained completely in detail. It's evident he had a career as a sort of Special Task Force member which he turned his back on and now runs a meticulously organized and strictly simple life. A sober furnished room with precisely folded bed sheets, a sink that looks spick and span and a daily routine going to a coffee shop with a tea bag tucked in his shirt after a consumed supper and a book in his possession which he puts on the table on the same exact place every time. He himself is a walking ""Wikipedia"" who comes up with an appropriate philosophical quote from time to time. So, it's a militaristic ordered life.<br/><br/>But he also has skills to deal with injustices. It's as if he gives the criminals of this world, who placed themselves above the ordinary people and act as untouchable individuals who manipulate defenseless civilians, a taste of their own medicine and knock them off their pedestals. A kind of liquidator. Similarly when the face of Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), a young hooker Robert met in the coffee shop, is being remodeled by her pimp Slavi (David Meunier) (pimped as it were) after which she ends up in the hospital. When Robert wants to straighten out the situation (by offering Slavi a substantial sum of money, which the Russian of course declines) we finally get what we were waiting for after 30 minutes : no-bullshit action in slow motion with a with precision hitting Washington wiping out a complete Russian gang in about 19 seconds. And apologizing after wards for it. A beautiful scene with a true avenging angel playing the starring role ! The only drawback is that he has liquidated an important part of the Russian mafia. And of course they are not going to start a Cossack dance. On the contrary. They send Teddy (Marton Csokas), a violent character without emotion and also with deadly skills. He looks after the affairs of a certain Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich). A fearsome opponent for McCall with similar qualities.<br/><br/>That things aren't really believable and the same old clichÃ©s are used again, I take that for granted. Washington can set himself as a one-man army and dismantle a Russian gangster mob as a Schwarzenegger, whereby there's slow motion footage and rousing music. Also the usual characteristics of a revenge movie aren't eschewed : the simple way of getting rid of a rather well-organized criminal group, explosions in the background (and of course there's no looking back), again members of the mob who are too dumb for words and are all horrible lousy shooters who'd miss an African elephant even while aiming at it from a meter away and the well-known climax in the end with usage of all available attributes. You know a clichÃ©, you got it. And that the Russians are back, merely has to do with the fact that this is allowed again on an international level. As soon as North Korea stops rocking the boat whenever their country is used in a movie and starts sending threats to certain countries, you can be sure there will be Korean casualties again in future action movies.<br/><br/>Washington is the most suitable man for this part. Just think of the character Joyhn Creasy in ""Man on Fire"" who leaves a trail of destruction in Mexico city while looking for Lupita. Also the same coolness and determination. He plays those roles with a certain flair, as if they were written specifically for him. His famous ""Denzel"" -characteristics he uses in each film : the quiet gaze, his typical smile and the icy one-liners. I must admit, I'm a Washington fan. His mutation of a cheerful, helpful and humorous average citizen into an avenger of the top shelf who exhibits sadistic features, is magnificent. And despite her young age, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz shows a lot of maturity. The makeup probably helped with this, but still it's an excellent interpretation by this young talent. The rest of the cast really looks like a bunch of terrifying mobsters with their upper bodies covered by tattoos, their corrupt spirit and their stone-hard indifference.<br/><br/>Despite the long playtime and the slow storyline, I never felt bored. This action packed revenge movie was over before I knew it. Of course the content is a bit shallow and after wards you start wondering why the heck there isn't a global group of such figures as McCall who hunt down organizations worldwide and liquidate them with an arsenal of nail guns. You do get the impression that McCall is a kind of super hero with human vulnerability and that it's just an intense action movie with some mindless hulks.

A powder actuated fastening tool doesn't cut it with me for a firearm....sorry, you can even see the strip of nails in it. Enough of that, the movie makers just don't know when to quit and take the last sliver of believe-ability out of it when they try this sort of thing. At least use a real firearm or a prop that mocks a firearm, not a nail gun that doesn't shoot nails unless you compressed directly on something.........even then they are low velocity. I guess they succeeded in bluffing 99%. This part was too Mel Gibson and Danny Glover copy cat for shooting the bad guy with a nail gun for me....outside of that last bit, the movie rocked!"

","Denzel Washington delivers a grand performance which has to be described as 'epic', in this vigilante thriller about a mysterious man who reveals a brutal and lethal side when faced with violent gangsters. The film purely as a film is not great but there is one thing that is undeniably the difference and that is the lead actor. Chloe Grace Moretz is good also and her on screen chemistry with Denzel is one of the highlights in the film. Many films owe their star actors much of the credit and this is one of those movies, which is fast paced and entertaining with an extra dimension. The ex-CIA assassin; Robert McCall works in a hardware store and is faced with decisions to make as to who he 'really' is. This insight into McCall makes this whole journey fascinating and the best part is that the audience don't know that much about McCall's past even by the end. This is a 'bad ass' movie, old fashioned and relentless, maybe we've seen it all before but not the way Denzel does it!"

","Robert McCall works at the Home Mart store, frequently helping his co-workers make better of themselves. <br/><br/>Every night, McCall goes to a diner, and he befriends teenager Teri, who is a lady of the night. <br/><br/>One night, her pimp Slavi brutally beats her and she is hospitalised. McCall goes to the Russian restaurant where Slavi is and offers money for her freedom. Slavi does not accept the offer, so McCall kills him and his four bodyguards. <br/><br/>Russian kingpin Vladimir, sends enforcer Teddy to find who killed his men. Soon he finds that McCall is the one who killed the mobster and Teddy begins a war against him......<br/><br/>The first thing you notice is that this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the eighties series of the same name. Now if you can forgive its shortcomings, and cashing in on a well known name, its a perfectly perfunctory action movie, with one of Hollywoods biggest stars at present.<br/><br/>And Fuqua knows how to direct action sequences. It's just a blooming shame he doesn't know how to trim a movie, because this is at least half an hour too long, and feels a little bloated at times. Even though Denzel is the only reason to watch this, we could have done without all the zen type stuff he does in this, and many other films he is in.<br/><br/>You know,the calm soothing monologues about life, and the past that seem to go on for ages, and instead of drawing you toward the character more, pulls you away from the narrative.<br/><br/>Moretz is in it at the beginning to trigger his revenge switch, and then pops up at the end to show him that all his equalising was worth it, because she reads books, and wears no more make up.<br/><br/>The action is relentless and pretty brutal, and even though the first set piece reminded me of the slow motion bit in Spider-man, the final showdown in the hardware store harks back to the exploitative slasher movies of the eighties.<br/><br/>So all in all, its nothing groundbreaking, way too long, and just a showcase for Denzel.<br/><br/>But he does walk away from an explosion in slow motion, that's always worth a watch."

","This is not my favourite film of the year but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable in terms of the action thrills and suspense. Comparisons with Matt Damon in the Jason Bourne movies are for me way off the mark.<br/><br/>I have never watched the 'Equalizer TV series' and Denzel Washingtons acting in this movie must rank as some of the coolest I have seen in a while which makes all the film appealing.<br/><br/>This film has a gripping story and will you watching until the end. No romance in the story unless McCalls association with the girl was considered in some way romantic. I didn't.<br/><br/>I love to hate Russians anyway for the way the gangster-manner they are portrayed in the film full of arrogance and disregard for Society. the story bolts together nicely but the shoot-out towards the end of the film was the one negative for me (rather than the false Russian accents throughout) as that was not in keeping with the nature of the film. it lacked subtlety and Mr McCall deserved more respect in bringing terminus to proceedings.<br/><br/>I would like to see a film on the back story on what led to Mr McCalls quiet and secretative life portrayed in the film, it would be quite a pre-quel."
"gbacquet","7","0","1","25 December 2014"," ""You are what you are in this world""
","If that line from the movie were true, Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua are the embodiment of it in ""The Equalizer"".<br/><br/>Those familiar with Antoine Fuqua's filmography know that he likes it gritty, dark and violent, but also that his films are very much character-driven. That's what separates this film from your average action, revenge-type movie. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a man with a mysterious past who strikes an unlikely relationship with a young prostitute (Chloe Grace-Moretz). This relationship and what comes of it will make his past come clashing with his desire to leave it behind. <br/><br/>Washington plays a broken man at odds with his choices, and it's no surprise how well he can play it. After all, he's done it before. But make no mistake, this is not ""Man on Fire""...This film is much slower and takes its time exploring both the character and his choices, which as the film progresses seem logical and consistent with what you've seen. It doesn't have Tony Scott's flare and visual tricks, but it's much smoother, less distracting, slicker and atmospheric. <br/><br/>The action scenes are mostly well done, and Marton Czokas plays a worthy adversary to Denzel's McCall. Yes, some of the dialog is a tad clichÃ© and some lines seem out of place, but it won't pull you out of the movie: this is not a movie about great dialog and it certainly won't win an Oscar for best screenplay; its strengths lie in the exploration of the character, his motivations and inner conflicts, as well as in the creation of a great visual atmosphere totally ad-hoc with the story. In the end, that's really what the film is about: a man, his past, which is never entirely revealed but does help to understand him, and how it will affect his future decisions (I did say mostly well done because for most of the film the actions scenes were actually plausible and added realism to the film, whereas the final showdown does go over the top...It's fun, mind you...but highly unrealistic. When you see it you'll know why)<br/><br/>One additional aspect I'd like to highlight is the soundtrack, which contains songs by Eminem and Zach Hensey, among others, and really adds to the general dark atmosphere of the film. Sometimes songs in films are badly chosen and kill the mood...It's the complete opposite here, they enhance it and help heighten emotions.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Fuqua's previous films, but I did enjoy Training Day, The Replacement Killers and Shooter for what they were. This movie is a step up in pace, story and visuals, while keeping some of his trademarks. If you like dark, well-paced gritty thrillers, or Denzel walking around with a broken gaze and nothing to lose, this film is definitely for you."

","Honestly, i had fun watching this. There is probably plot holes and impossible stuff but who care? Its made to be an action type of movie. Yet that is the small problem i found in it. Its an action movie but the pacing is very slow. There is a few action scenes here and there, but way too few of them and sometimes even off screen...<br/><br/>On the other hand the story is nice, Denzel play his part very good, Chloe do the job even tough the role is small. But maybe its because i saw John Wick before, i couldn't help myself but to compare the 2 and its obvious when you do, you realize one is an action fest on testosterone, the other a nice movie but that do lack something.<br/><br/>The premise is not the same but similar, the bad guys are both Russian mobs, in both case the protagonist is a guy with super skills... And if i got to pick one, yes John Wick was much superior for me. But that does not mean Equalizer is not a good movie. Like i said, i had a good time, the movie is over 2 hours long yet i was not bored, despite it being slow paced. The character is interesting, the main bad guy acting and presence is nice, although i had higher hopes for him, and basically its what it is, just a good action movie."

He's the best of the best with a dark past. If you haven't gotten enough of this, watch this flick. It's a LOT of the same, but still worthwhile time waster.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua again proves he has a very sympathetic ear to the streets. Meaning, he likes the percentage of people who are always getting screwed in life. I like that. I like that theme. And I like there is someone who doesn't wear a cape or have superpowers that have been bestowed on them due to gamma rays or whatever. It's just a man who was upset. Nothing wrong in that.

","Trying to live a quiet life, Robert - Bob - McCall realises that he cannot simply sit idly by and let bad things happen to people he knows don't deserve it. <br/><br/>The premise is nothing new. In fact, I had seen most if not all of the series from the late eighties of the same name and wondered how Denzel Washington could possibly have been cast in the part of Robert McCall, a part formerly inhabited by the late Edward Woodward. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think Denzel is a fine actor and thoroughly enjoyed other movies I've seen of his, but somehow, I just couldn't get the image of Woodward out of my mind when thinking of The Equalizer.<br/><br/>So it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch this movie that boasted a running time of over two hours. <br/><br/>The beginning was slow and I wondered whether it was worth it. This Robert McCall seemed no more than an assistant in a DIY store who enjoyed reading, slept little and drank tea.<br/><br/>Wasn't he?<br/><br/>Apparently not.<br/><br/>When a young girl he'd befriended in the all-night cafÃ© he frequented is badly beaten by Russian mobsters, McCall decides it's time he did something about it, opening a can of worms even he wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>From mild-mannered assistant, McCall suddenly becomes someone who proves he will go to quite extraordinary lengths to get the job done, standing up for the little guy - or girl - whoever happened to be benefiting from his help at the time.<br/><br/>Despite its fairly pedestrian start, this movie is a real roller-coaster of action and tension. There's no shortage of violence, much of which is bloody and brutal, but I believe it's necessary. No-one crossing the mob - whichever nationality they may be - would get away with a stern talking to or a slapped wrist.<br/><br/>It's difficult to go deeper into the why's and wherefores of this movie without giving the game away and while I have checked the box marked ""Contains Spoilers"", I will not go any further with the plot or the contents. Let's just say, it's another stellar performance from Washington with brilliant support, slick camera work and an excellent plot, one which Woodward himself would have been proud of."

"johannes-marks","6","0","1","14 December 2014"," allyourbasearebelongtous - fighting for justice in godmode
","In my opinion, this movie has two things going for it: 1) Its start. The protagonist is just one of those world-literature-loving, working at a hardware-store insomniac retired black-ops-kinda-guys. He's helping the people around himself better themselves and is generally a pretty cool guy. The story starts off slow, but you get enough time to get to know the characters and get attached to them. Although in the trailers it looks like the young prostitute Alina, played indifferently by Chloe Moretz, and what happens to her are the starting point for Denzels characters hunt for justice, she gets beaten up once and then pretty much disappears. 2) Denzel Washington. He's just badass.<br/><br/>Apart from those, I think ""The Equalizer"" wasted a lot of potential. None of the mooks the Russian mob sends against him (Wahshington) stands any chance, and there's really only one instance in the plot where Denzels character (Richard, I think?) actually has to fight for his life. Briefly. In other, comparable, movies, like, for example, ""Taken"", for me a lot of the suspense was created by the fact that, although taking names and chewing gum, the protagonist was still just a human. This feeling disappeared quickly watching the beginning of the second act of The Equalizer.<br/><br/>All things considered, I still believe the ""Equalizer"" to be an enjoyable way to spend two hours, but if you haven't seen a lot of these hunt-for-revenge-kind-of-movies, I'd recommend seeing the better ones first (Taken, the man from nowhere, the bourne trilogy, the list goes on)."

","Edward Woodward's The Equalizer downplayed the violence that lay at the core of the character. Violence was a necessary evil but it was presented as something employed with regret and a certain analytic, constrained precision. <br/><br/>Its a shame then that whilst this updated film attempts to convey the same sentiment it fails to follow through, taking almost boastful glee in the often ugly violence dished out by its main character played by Denzel Washington. <br/><br/>To add insult to injury the story line is hackneyed and predictable.

"sesht","Null","0","2","22 November 2014"," What about Bob?
","Perhaps one of the most slickly done mainstream action movies out there, in a dying genre, that I recommend it on those genre-related merits alone, though it could've been done way, wayyyy better.<br/><br/>The first hour spends time setting the main characters up, and that's the best part about this flick. Sadly, content-wise (that IS important to note here) its all downhill from that point on, and becomes a by-the-numbers vigilante's vendetta flick. Denzel's on call and the loneliness of his character is beautifully realized here, but that character is called upon to perform so many acts that are beyond the realm of suspension-of-disbelief, that few viewers have compared this one to Steven Seagal flicks (more on that later).<br/><br/>What this movie has got going for it, in spades, is sheer style and chutzpah (a word grossly misused for effect in a recent overrated local flick). Each action set-piece is preceded by McCall- cam, borrowing, intentionally or not, from Guy Ritchie's rendering of Sherlock Holmes-cam, and that novelty factor, for most, wore out its welcome after the first time, though the technical effort expended whenever it is used is exemplary.<br/><br/>The cinematography, and the soundtrack, is some of the best to grace the screen this year, and in the case of the latter, there is one track that fits a particular action set-piece so well, that its presence, along with its companion action sequence, almost redeemed the lazy Bollywood hi- jinks resorted to by the makers for most of its running time: Slo-mo focus on the lead, really???? We get it, but...really?<br/><br/>There is also a point after which its not just the lead's invincibility that gets hammered into us, but also the inanity and the predictability of it all, that is only redeemed by the style on display.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua, with this, has returned to 'The Replacement Killers' territory, which, though slick and technically proficient for its time, was equally plagued with every action clichÃ© that acts as a checklist item for most of its ilk, though thankfully falling just short of corny 'Transporter' or 'Fast and Furious' territory. For that much effort, I'd gladly handle multiple viewings of movies like this rather than 'Transporter' or 'Fast and Furious'. <br/><br/>His take-no-prisoners style also mirrors his approach in 'Olympus has fallen'. Coincidentally, Butler was also considered for the McCall role.<br/><br/>I wish the movie had continued to include a key character, who precipitates everything that happens in this flick, throughout, rather than dispense with him/her, and then only bring him/her back at the end. I was like, 'Huh? Did I miss something?'<br/><br/>Haley Bennett (Music & Lyrics) has a change of scene here, and acquits herself well. <br/><br/>The spare, quick, brutal and realistic (for the most part) mano-a-mano fight sequences seem to be used Aikido moves for the most part, and this, more than anything else, perhaps has prompted a few viewers to make comparisons to Steven Seagull flicks after having watched this one. I wouldn't cover them all, but am sure that the final set-piece between Seagal and Tommy Lee Jones in 'Under Siege' was a definite inspiration of sorts to the action choreographer/director, and it is undeniably effective, and is a welcome technique.<br/><br/>I'd watch this again, just to enjoy the set-piece I spoke of, and the cinematography + soundtrack, but still feel that the movie could've been better than what it turned out to be. I think there's the inevitable sequel coming, esp. since the box office for this has been decent, and hope they fix what needs fixing for that one at least."

There he encourages co-worker, Ralphie (Michael Skourtis), to lose weight and move up the ladder by becoming a security guard. <br/><br/>After work the McCall visits a local diner to eat, read, and occasionally discuss life, calmly extolling the virtues of self- discipline and healthy eating. There, we see also that he has become a genuine friend to a young working girl, Alina (Cloe Grace Moretz). She asks questions about the book he reads and looks troubled. <br/><br/>In the first act we often wonder when McCall will show his aces. Washington's nice guy character is introduced as quite passive and slow moving, as it moves through several relationships with increasing drama and tension. This reaches a peak when he confronts the Russian mob, who have beat the living crap out of Alina. <br/><br/>McCall has come to the mob's restaurant to buy Alina her freedom, making an offer the boss, Slavi (David Meunier), instantly mocks and refuses. Here, finally, we see McCall as the bad ass MF we have been impatiently expecting. The camera and special effects go into high gear revealing him to be a calculating, superhuman fighter who swiftly dispenses the heavily armed Russians in an incredibly bloody and violent encounter. <br/><br/>Now the die is cast, pitting McCall against the big Russian mob boss, Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich), who must retaliate and kill him. To do this he employs Teddy, aka Nicolai (Martin Csokas), his best and most ruthless lieutenant. Working with corrupt cops Teddy methodically tracks down McCall, hurting or killing anyone who gets in his way. Meanwhile, more is revealed about McCall's past, when he meets with mysterious (CIA) characters who provide him with information and tools he requires to deal with the Russian mob.<br/><br/>This version of the Equalizer is quite compelling as was the original. There are few of us who have not wanted an equalizer in our lives to deal with an actual bully, predator, or obnoxious asshole who seem beyond the reach of ""justice."" This is about a primal as it gets when you find yourself as as a victim with no defense. So rooting for McCall is a piece of cake, no matter how much violence he spawns, and very uplifting, potentially. <br/><br/>Alas, this fantasy ends when we leave the theater, but maybe not, if we keep wishing harder!"

","I liked the movie. I enjoyed its entire run time except the finale. It spoiled the entire build up of the story. If the Villain killed some of the Home Depot employee's it would have ended spectacularly but we get too much of Deus Ex Machina vibe in the end. One man can't save everyone. Sometimes when a war's started there will be casualties. Denzel may be calm, precise and deadly but he too can't kill 10 people with a single sniper shot. Chloe grace's acting was good but I liked the actress who played Chloe's friend. She really looked the part. This is not a full blow by blow action movie. I realized when I saw the trailer that I have to savor the silence and enjoy the mayhem. Becacuse silence increases the violence level."

Turns out he can kick ass pretty well and so achieves justice in the end. Fuqua's style delivers a good spectacle with focus on Robert's supernatural talents and combat. There is a scene that is reminiscent of Denzel in ""Man on Fire"" where he walks away from a blanketing explosion with swag and that's always jaw-dropping cool! lol. Some disturbing and gruesome deaths to witness but they are gracefully executed and over in seconds. #skillz! #booyeh! <br/><br/>Also want to mention how much New Zealand's Marton Csokas reminded me of Kevin Spacey in this film! #themlooks<br/><br/>The audience are given a happy ending and I was fed hope that there really are hero's like Robert out there."

","Helpful gentleman Robert McCall is a retired black ops government operative who after befriending a young woman goes head to head with the Russian Mafia.<br/><br/>Antoine Fuqua's The Equalizer is stylishly violent with both Denzel Washington as Robert McCall and Marton Csokas putting in tense and excellent performances. Harry Gregson-Williams score complements the dreary mood but lacks Stewart Copeland's signature theme Busy Equalizing.<br/><br/>Mirroring the recent Sherlock Holmes (2009) in terms of fighting logic this offering is more reminiscent of the Get Cater (2000) than The Equalizer 80s TV series. Writer Richard Wenk and Fuqua's drop nods to Woodward's McCall a silhouette, his ingenuity and stone cold shootings but it's comparable to Ridley Scotts Robin Hood (2010) being an almost The Equalizer prequel, in terms of how/why he becomes The Equalizer.<br/><br/>Overall, put against Fuqua's own Training Day (2001) written by David Ayer or in terms of being a film based on 1985-89 The Equalizer it falls short. That said, as an atmospheric revenge action it's wonderfully filmed highly entertaining and worth watching for Csokas performance alone."
"manojative","6","0","2","2 November 2014"," Entirely too predictable..
","The only thing that was not predictable was somehow you sensed some twist is coming, but it never does. A regular superhero movie without being called it that. The protagonist, our beloved Mr. Washington, never sets a foot wrong. Never ever gets beaten and is always two steps ahead of the bad guys. The action sequences are well done and I quite enjoyed them. The humane story arcs of helping someone at your mundane jobs, (playing batman at night), and telling that he had a dark and painful past was too forced (he takes a break from all the action, travels to some important person's house for a few days, just to explain that there is a past!!!! 20 minutes just for that! Out of nowhere!). There is absolutely no reason for anyone to spoil the movie.. It spoils itself."

","Don't get me wrong, I loved Man on Fire and Eastern Promises, they are two of my favorites. But are there really no new ideas in Hollywood ? This film is a formulaic rehash of two ten year old action movies. Denzel does an excellent job of beating up bad guys, for a sixty year old man that is. But fo reals, can even a CIA-trained killer really hold his own against FSB-trained killers half his age ? Denzel was falling apart in Man on Fire, and that was ten years ago ! I'm not saying that this film is bad, because it isn't. There is a surprising amount of character development for a movie of this genre. But in my opinion it stretches the believability factor due to Denzel's age. It's like a 60-something Sean Connery bangin' twenty-something hotties in the Bond films. Wait a minute...."
"victuki","7","0","2","23 October 2014"," True Justice
","Based on a TV show from the 80's but with some changes (McCall was a British SAS ex-operative, not an American), comes this remake directed by Antoine Fuqua (Olympus Has Fallen, 2013). Denzel Washington is Robert McCall, a former CIA operative that is morally compelled to go back into action to help a lady in distress. Though it looks like ""The A-Team"", it is surprisingly deep in terms of character motivation, and those characters are way better performed than the standard blockbuster movies.<br/><br/>Fuqua is reunited with Washington after ""Training"" Day, (2001), the film that got him an Oscar award as best leading actor. Fuqua has made some major blockbusters but all of them very well crafted and full of deep-layered characters that reach you (""King Arthur"", 2004) or ""Shooter"" (2007), both blockbusters that were also critically acclaimed.<br/><br/>He usually gets to work with solid cast, and this time is no different: ChloÃ« Grace Moretz (Dark Shadows, 2012) or Marton Csokas (Lord of the Rings, 2001-2003) or ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) support Washington, and they both deliver (Csokas is great as a crazy Russian operative).<br/><br/>Bottom line, a great action movie, the kind you watch all over again every time is on TV. Let's not kid ourselves, if we had to choose a film to take with us to an isolated island, we would not choose a David Lynch or a Hitchcock film, but something like this or the Lethal Weapon saga. 'Nuff said."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a law abiding citizen respected by all his peers. He has chosen to leave his dark and mysterious past behind to live a quiet life. However, when his friends are threatened by criminals and corrupt cops, Robert cannot sit idly by and takes matters into his own methodical hands. The Equalizer, is not deep in narrative or storytelling, but quite frankly it doesn't have to be. This is just a fun film where you just get to relax with your snacks and drinks to watch Denzel Washington kick rear-ends till the very end. If that's all you want and need, you'll be more than satisfied.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Let's be honest here, nobody is expecting an instant classic from this movie. As long as this movie delivered on the fun action, it did its job.<br/><br/>Thankfully it was entirely Denzel Washington show and he killed it in his role while he killed the Russian mob. I tend to like the more methodical action heroes, people who give attention to the smallest detail for everything they do. You see that throughout the movie where Washington is thinking ahead and timing his moves perfectly. The fights are well shot too with little shaky cam and perfect sound to really make every punch or shot feel painful. The villain played by Marton Csokas was actually pretty good. They could've gone the generic villain route and this movie would still have worked, but Marton Csokas brought in just the right amount of unbalanced temper that he was big enough threat to care about.<br/><br/>The Equalizer is not without faults. One in particular that kind of took me out of the movie was that there were way too many subplots within a short time span. This also made it feel longer than it should. Other than the main plot of the Russian mob, there were two or three other subplots where the Washington's character needs to intervene additional criminals and/or corrupt cops. These were supposed to show how loyal and honorable Robert is. Yet I feel, this could've been achieved through the main plot itself, making the overall movie a bit more concise.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed watching The Equalizer, I got exactly what I was looking for. Fans of movie such Taken, Dredd, or some fighting elements of Bourne Trilogy, will find it to be an entertaining time in the cinemas. Now let just have a cross-over with Taken to watch Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson duke it out!<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","4","17 October 2014"," Washington carries this film thanks to his particular set of skills
","""I am offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.""<br/><br/>With the exception of Training Day, which I absolutely loved, Antoine Fuqua hadn't directed a film that merited much acknowledgement. Being able to team up with Denzel Washington once again definitely attracted many people's attention towards this project, but if they were expecting The Equalizer to replicate the success of Training Day then they'll be disappointed because what they get with this film is a standard, by the books action thriller. It plays out like most revenge thrillers do and it follows the standard formula of the genre in such a way that you can easily predict the outcome of most of the film. What The Equalizer does have going for it however is the presence of Denzel Washington in the titular role playing a character with a particular set of skills. Washington is solid and he elevates this generic film in such a way that he manages to keep us entertained. There is something cool about his character and he portrays that interior smoothness very well here. His character may seem calm and friendly in the surface, but when it comes to helping the weak there is no one who can serve them justice better than him. His character will easily remind people of Liam Neeson in Taken, or even Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher although Washington's character is much more likable. The film also takes its time to set things up and it works to the films advantage here; I would even say the buildup is much stronger than the execution. The stylized violence is also present in this Fuqua film and I enjoyed the overall look of the film with the underlying score setting the tone. The Equalizer reminded me a lot of Man on Fire, which was a film I really loved so if you were a fan of it as well you might want to check this out. It is very similar in structure and I would go as far as saying that it has a superhero movie feel to it as well. <br/><br/>I have seen over 20 films starring Denzel Washington and I yet haven't seen one I disliked. Sure, there were some average films he made, but never have I been disappointed by his movies. I know The Equalizer isn't groundbreaking and I shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did because it is full of clichÃ©s, but it was impossible for me to resist Washington's charm once again. He gives a solid performance in this action thriller and he carries the film. The female characters are all portrayed as victims here once again, but Chloe Grace Moretz sells her character very well. She has some solid scenes with Washington at the beginning of the film which help set the premise of the film. Melissa Leo could have been the strongest female character in the film, but she only has a brief appearance. This is basically a one man show with Washington personifying coolness. Marton Csokas is set up as a pretty strong villain during the first half of the film, but he could have been better used in the second half. Csokas is Washington's counterpart (kind of like what The Joker was to Batman) and the buildup to the face-off is what works best in this film. I had a great time with this action thriller despite all its flaws."
"gonion4230","7","0","3","13 October 2014"," good action movie
","This was a very good movie, but a little too long. The set-up was slow but I knew what was coming so was willing to wait it out. Denzel Washington's character is a former CIA-type who now lives alone and works at a home improvement store. We get to see a lot (maybe too much) of that store. Luckily, the action in this movie finally started and it eventually became explosive and non-stop. Very fun to watch! Many of the characters were pretty one-note, with the exception of the villain and Chloe Moretz as a prostitute. Those two were very good. The other characters simply served the purpose of the story -- which basically was to let Denzel Washington beat people up and outsmart them single- handedly. You can see this was set up to have a sequel."
"honyltd","Null","0","5","11 October 2014"," How many times can you say ""WOW""
","My memory of ""The Equalizer"", was a late 80's television series of an older British actor named Edward Woodward, who specialized in helping people with seemingly unsolvable problems.<br/><br/>The late Richard Jordan, taken too early, round out the cast. It was a favored show.<br/><br/>This ""EQUALIZER"", with Denzel Washington, is no retread, but a completely different take on a man who if you were the opposition, would never want to challenge.<br/><br/>Many times it has been said this is like the good guy version of ""Training Day"". The only legitimate comparison is that gifted director Antoine Fuqua, was the director of each, and already had his main star's persona in his head, so 100% of Denzel's skills were on view.<br/><br/>This movie is not formulaic. Perhaps some of you never met the Russian Mafia from the comfort of your 9-5 jobs, but they are every bit the savage, seemingly unconcerned with consequences personalities, that would affect any human, not a sociopath without conscience or sense of morality.<br/><br/>Fuqua uses diametric opposites in order to sharpen this INTENSE, as accurate a word as I can muster, for this movie, which makes no compromises.<br/><br/>You have Denzel Washington's character, never fully explained, but clearly a former special forces commando. I go with NSA over Delta Force or Seals, as he shows a calculating non-remorse for the job he has taken on, avenging the beating of a Russian Prostitute who was left for dead, and to whom he had a common late night eatery as a bonding point.<br/><br/>Like Clark Kent, by day , McCall is an everyday ""Home Mart"" employee, well-liked for his hard work and concern for his fellow employees. But, like Bruce Wayne, when the former commando emerges, he takes no prisoners, leaves no walking wounded. Still, unlike any other action movie, his deeds all seem credible and believable.<br/><br/>In the end his fellow workers see the real Robert McCall, at the edge of your seat conclusion , the last 15 minutes of what turns out in the end, to be an epic movie in scope. He literally goes to the head of the snake after an unforgettable duel in the Home Mart, which might as well be the main street in any Western.<br/><br/>Always true to his sense of JUSTICE, good is good, bad is trash to be taken out, we are treated to a new genre sub-category, the super action film, an ordinary man, capable of extraordinary acts.<br/><br/>10 of ten for a can't miss winner, I guarantee you will like."
"captainmike-michael","7","0","4","10 October 2014"," Monotonous Plot with Intense Violence
","The movie has an extremely slow pace before starting off with action scenes, though slightly monotonous which is likely due to the intention to present the simple and low profile of the main protagonist's life, it is generally fine. The story does not actually fully reveal the real background and the past of the main character, it does get silly with the old style plot by having only a hero who uses violent skills against the villains to restore the peace of the needs. Denzel Washington performs extremely well but when the film focuses too much on him, the potential of the supporting cast however being overshadowed by the lack of characters development. The score itself has nothing special but the offer of violent, brutal and intense action sequences through director Antoine Fuqua and David S. Lazan at behind the screen undoubtedly will excite the audiences."
"jeffreyhillen-364-945381","7","0","4","10 October 2014"," Denzel Washington & Chloe Moretz : A great combination
","When you look at the list of films were Chloe Moretz played in you really see a big diversity in the characters she played and the films she had done. A lot of actors want to keep it safe but Chloe doesn't that makes her, apart from her brilliant acting skills, one of the most talented teenage actors we have at the moment. So I was happy she played in this film and when you watch this film you see the combination of Chloe Moretz and Denzel Washington works really well. As an audience you have to believe that these two characters have this special relationship. Throughout the film Denzel Washington delivered an outstanding performance as a very lonely man but without fear, you can see it in his eyes that he's been through so much in his life and Denzel does an amazing performance on that.<br/><br/>I think the storyline really great. There is a very high pace which makes it never boring. There is such a great character development. Mr. McCall isn't just a lonely man who wants vengeance. No. The audience get to know who he is. They developed that really well. The problem with this film was for me personally was that everything was going so easy for the main character. He never lost a fight and that was something I saw as a bad thing. You have to make the right balance between not losing to many fights and not win to many. That makes it unpredictable. The story wasn't unpredictable but somehow you knew that when was in a fight he would win this.<br/><br/>I rate this film 7/10 because of the outstanding performances of Denzel Washington and Chloe Moretz. But also because of the good working and fantastic written storyline. DVD/Blu Ray worthy! I very much recommend this film."
"tlhalford","7","0","4","9 October 2014"," Out of storyline
","I saw this on Sunday at Showcase cinemas. I enjoyed parts of the film, but to be honest a lot of the film could have been cut out. Robert has turned into a killer to try and get Teri her freedom, but she disappears for almost half of the film! While she is gone, Robert kills the whole off Teddy's gang, however Teddy doesn't feel the need to kill Robert, and they can even sit across a dinner table from each other and talk like nothing has happened. At first, you think the bad guy is Slavi, as he is the man mentioned most by Teri, but that's the twist, when he kills him very early on in the film, we realise there is someone bigger than him. Denzel Washington can be the perfect actor for any film, but I don't think this film was his best compared to Flight which I loved! A Walk Among The Tombstones was released around about the same time as The Equalizer, and there was no need to, as they are pretty much the same. They both have gory scenes with a lot of blood, and they are both after 1 person or gang. All action films have the same predictable story! It's the actors that make the film great, including Martin Csokas calm but deadly character, and an innocent Chloe Grace Moretz. There are a few comical lines that made me laugh, and the audience also found them amusing, and there are parts that could make you feel faint! My favourite part was the ending, when Robert finishes his mission in slow motion, in a rainy warehouse, with the soundtrack blaring in the credits (Eminem- Guts over fear ft. Sia) I did prefer Liam Neesons A Walk Among Tombstones, as it was a more believable story to follow. I would recommend this film to action film lovers, but what I will say is not to expect anything too special. Overall I rate the film 7/10, as I enjoyed the action packed parts, but believe it went of the story line slightly."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","7","0","3","8 October 2014"," The Equalizer Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>I know this is based off the TV show that was around in the 80's. I also remember watching at least some episodes, but it was not a family staple in my household, so I can say that I am not coming in biased in any way to the movie remake.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that when it is said and done with, if you really start thinking about it, you will start poking holes in itânot to say that that is a bad thing. What The Equalizer is giving us is something of a slow burn movie in my opinion. We follow the day to day life of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) working at home mart, helping a coworker attain his dream, and visiting a diner in the middle of the night due to not being able to sleep. We then come to learn that Robert McCall is not who everyone thinks he is; he is a man with a past that no one can seem to uncover.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie are really well put together; they have a mixture of the hyper sense of the Sherlock Holmes movie with there own spin on things. Robert McCall is just trying to live his life, but when he starts seeing people that he cares about in trouble, it reawakens his old life style and he can't help but help those people out.<br/><br/>It is an enjoyable movie and very watchable, but there is not a lot there when you think about it. It is really very cookie cutter in what it presents to the viewer. Like I stated earlier, once you start thinking more in-depth about the movie, the more you can poke holes in it, especially when it comes to the Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) story line.<br/><br/>And one thing that people in the theater seemed to really love but I was kind of disappointed in was a battle between Robert McCall and one of the bad guys that was worked up to be such a bad ass. The fight was satisfying, but I was expecting so much more from it.<br/><br/>Âand it did end in the way that the TV Show ended. <br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>We are moving out of the blockbuster season, and we are not going to be getting great movies every weekend. The Equalizer is a good movie to check out if you are looking for an action movie where you can turn of your brain and just enjoy it. If not, wait util the DVD comes out."

","It's just another entertaining action movie, no complicated plot and sometimes it doesn't even make sense, but it will if you just shut your mind,fairly predictable, some scenes are interesting while other ones are completely ridiculous, like when Denzel's character tortures a guy by putting him on a car and filling it with smoke, a ""guy who would never break"" apparently the only thing he doesn't break is the window of the car, or at least put your arm before it closes its certainly not gonna chop your arm off. Anyway Denzel is the usual bad ass he plays on most of his movies, you know that always calm guy that makes unusual things making you think hes insane and capable of anything, which for me is kind of getting old.<br/><br/>The only way to enjoy this movie is to set your mind back as if you're twelve years old and never have watched a Denzel Washington movie"

","In ordinary circumstances, I don't crave for action flicks where super heroes fight against very evil guys with highly expected results. But this film is the exception. It reminds me many late eighties and early nineties action movies produced by Joel Silver, such as the LETHAL WEAPON or DIE HARD series, or even LAST BOYSCOUT. These were perfectly done, absolutely flawless. Like this one.<br/><br/>Denzel Washngton is terrific, action sequences astounding and the bad guys outstanding, especially the new comer whose I certainly won't forget the face. The face to face between him and Washington is awesome, as I LOVE SOOOOO MUCH!!!<br/><br/>Even everything here is predictable, it is, I repeat, so well done, in a so professional way: film making, acting, screen writing, editing.<br/><br/>And, above all, there is not here any silly, stupid, run of the mill f...romance stuff for sissies. Just touching moments. A movie may be poignant without being marsh mallow. <br/><br/>But there are here some missing sequences; such as this one, just after the armed robbery at the store where Washington works, a robbery where the Hood takes the female employee's ring. Washington let him go, runs to take a big hammer, and the scene after he brings the ring back without any explanation... You have here some short cuts as this one. But I assure you that doesn't reduce the quality of this terrific actionner."
