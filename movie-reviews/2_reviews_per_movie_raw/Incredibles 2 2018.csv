","While I understand the disappointment, this was NOT a bad film. It isn't as good as the first one, but I think it holds up pretty well! There's lots of fun to be had watching this from the animation to the humor, and there are still some touching scenes that show there is heart put into this film. I recommend seeing CinemaWins ""Everything GREAT about Incredibles 2"" if you want to see why this film is still pretty decent. Only somewhat weak spot in my opinion was the main villain who was somewhat predictable, but man the animation at times truly is ""Incredible"" (pun intended)!<br/><br/>Go see it! It was well worth my time and I enjoyed it, so I'm surprised to see it get all these 1 star reviews. Far from Pixar's best but still a good flick. I know you can't please everyone but I think this movie is terribliy overhated. That's just my opinion at least. 9 stars out of 10!"
"Ajk2386","6","195","270","10 November 2018"," Definitely not as good as the first Incredibles movie
","Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.<br/><br/>Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon."
"bigal_a","7","7","7","25 April 2019"," Much better than I feared
","When I heard the synopsis of this film, I feared it would be going down the social justice rabbit-hole as so many other popular franchises have done.<br/><br/>My main fear was that Elastigirl was going to shine effortlessly and Bob was going to be totally out of his depth and incompetent. And in truth, there was some of that, and a little bit of feminist by-play between Elastigirl and Evelyn.<br/><br/>But, to be honest, I think even super-mum Helen would have had her hands full with Jack-Jack, who shines in a scene where the baby fights a racoon, emerging untouched and the animal slinking away terrified.<br/><br/>And Bob does get to grips with his enforced home life, getting the ever-enjoyable Edna Mode to look after Jack-Jack (which she seems to enjoy), so he can get a night's sleep and get back on his feet. So he ends up effectively and clearly teaching maths to Dash before an exam, and getting lovelorn Violet back on his side. Even when Jack-Jack returns, Bob seems reinvigorated, almost reveling in his baby son's burgeoning powers.<br/><br/>Not to say too much about the climax of the film, but suffice it to say that all the kids play their parts, as well as some new supers with bizarre powers that the Deavor siblings have gathered from around the world.<br/><br/>And at the end, Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and Frozone end up fighting as a team, together again.<br/><br/>I liked it, and I probably will watch it again some time."
"NarniaIsAwesome","7","64","89","2 October 2018"," Incredibles 2 is... Exciting and Acceptable.
","'Incredibles 2' was probably the most anticipated movie of the year; it's hard to believe it's made 14 years since the first original. So obviously everyone was more than ready for this.<br/><br/>The film does come through when it comes to entertaining action and comedy, with Jack-Jack, Bob, and Edna providing most of the biggest laughs. The plot is interesting, because we've got to know what happened to the Parr family. As far as the supervillain mystery, it's acceptable and somewhat entertaining, but a bit predictable and generic. The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.<br/><br/>That being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all ""painful"" to watch.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing."
"randomStuff101","4","230","386","20 November 2018"," Worse than original. Politically correct box-ticking. Bland story details.
","Half way through watching this in the cinema, I thought ""maybe it's me"". Maybe it's my fault I'm not into this movie. But I loved the original, so what's going on.<br/><br/>No. The problem is this movie is a bland attempt to express messages about gender roles and current society issues. It lacks flow, it's just a bunch of scenes one after the other, there's no coherent thread or curious elements tying it together.<br/><br/>Nice visuals goes without saying, but the story is let down by a sense that it's been engineered around a board room table by people referring to their social media feeds for inspiration, rather than dreamt up by talented writers.<br/><br/>Sure, some scenes are fun. But we're not watching a youtube playlist here, this is a movie and it's supposed to work as a whole, not just momentarily.<br/><br/>The script is uninteresting, the action is exciting sometimes, but other times you just want it to end or move on. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 was a great sequel, but this is a very poor sequel. Forgettable.<br/><br/>If you love the first, then hold onto that because it doesn't get better. It gets worse."
"sfgebel315","8","41","62","4 July 2018"," Predictable, But Perfect
","I cannot believe it has been 14 years since The Incredibles came out. The gap between sequels seems to be getting longer, but the director, Brad Bird, said he wanted to wait until he had the perfect story. There's even a clip before the film starts where actors, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter tell us it will be ""well worth the wait""--and they were right!<br/><br/>Though 14 years later, the film takes place minutes later. The first film ends with the Parr family having to fight the Miner who pops up out of the school parking lot, just after Violet gets a date with Tony. The sequel starts with that fight and we see how it backfires as the Parr family get arrested for destroying part of the city and because superheroes are still illegal. Enter our new characters, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deaver, who both want to help superheroes step back into the light, but they believe the way to do that is with Elastigirl. Therefore, our sequel twist is that Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad having to babysit Jack-Jack and learning of his dozens of powers, teaching Dash ""new math"", and inserting his foot into his mouth when he tries to help Violet with her crush--all while Elastigirl is improving superhero relations. <br/><br/>Personally, I thought the movie was predictable but perfect. I loved it for its simplistic plot that was not hard to figure out. I knew right away who the ""villain"" was and what their motivation was; however, I did not know exactly how the climax would occur, so I was still very much engaged. Not to mention there was enough character development and funny scenes to space out the predictable plot arch. <br/><br/>Often times animated films are more for the adults who are taking the kids, then for the kids themselves. Most kids will not understand half the references, but will still enjoy the overall concept. At the same time, this film comes out when the kids who saw the first are now adults, possibly with kids of their own. Therefore, this film is a great blend of adult and child humor. I found it hilarious, and as a teacher, I particularly loved when Mr. Incredible stays up all night reading Dash's ""new math"" textbook so he can teach him new math, which was what it was called in the 60s (the time period this film alludes to) and is a shout out to our modern common core confusion. <br/><br/>What I really love about this film is that there is even more Frozone and Jack-Jack, which brings me to my all-time favorite scenes--learning of Jack-Jack's powers, particularly when Violet and Dash call Uncle Frozone over because their dad is going insane from sleep-deprivation and trying to keep up with Jack-Jack. I lost track of how many powers he has and all I will say on the matter is that the best scene in the whole film is when Jack-Jack fights the raccoon. <br/><br/>If you want a light-hearted comedy with some fun action sequences then this film is for you. If you loved the first one then you will love the second one. If you have not seen the first one, what's wrong with you?"
"ModishMovies","7","358","655","14 June 2018"," Can't Escape the Incredible Legacy of the Original
","Since I already know you are going to rate this review as ""Not Helpful"" because I didn't rate this 10/10 stars, I figured I might as well start off by telling you how much I love the original Incredibles. The Incredibles (2004) is one of my favorite films of all time and is my second favorite Pixar film (right after Finding Nemo). I got to see Incredibles 2 early because I caught a double feature of the two films in IMAX, just in case you were thinking of complaining that I didn't see it since this review is out early. <br/><br/>What I loved about the original was the authenticity that the story, characters, and animation had to it. It felt more creative, natural, and beautiful. Syndrome was one of the greatest superhero movie villains of all time, not because of the amount of damage he was able to inflict upon the world, but because of the emotional pain he was able to cause Mr. Incredible and his family. The moments in which Mr. Incredible regrets his past mistakes and realizes how his actions affect others, especially his former biggest fan, are what makes the film stand out from any other hero-villain dynamic. Sadly, Incredibles 2 does not have a villain or story as deep or as thoughtful as Syndrome.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 boldly and intelligently begins right where The Incredibles ended. This smart move on Disney Pixar's part eliminates all confusion and time gaps that may arise after a hiatus of any amount (especially fourteen years) between a sequel and its predecessor. The story that follows is relatively contrived and characters are clumsily introduced in order to expand the universe instead of expanding the emotions of the beloved characters. The action scenes are creative and well-animated, but they aren't memorable enough and take place in bland settings and accomplish nothing for the characters. There were many points during this film where I noticed how hard Brad Bird was trying to replicate the formula of the original film, but it became more and more noticeable to the point that it detracted from the story itself. <br/><br/>The great Pixar films all have excellent, fluid stories. The great Pixar films also have superb plots that deepen our understanding and feelings for the characters. The good Pixar films have entertaining, sensible plots, but they rarely deepen our love of the characters involved in them, such as A Bug's Life, Cars 2 (don't hate me!), Cars 3, and The Good Dinosaur. Incredibles 2, sadly, falls into the latter category that has a fun, creative plot, but a plot that does nothing new for its characters.<br/><br/>Since the villain is introduced in the trailer, I don't think that it's a spoiler to say that it doesn't feel authentic or inspired enough to be considered one of Pixar's best villains. While the motive for the villain is there, it is simply unnecessary, contrived, and unexciting. New heroes are also introduced (as seen in the poster and other promotional material). Many of them are underutilized or unnecessary. The film's weakest parts involve the newly introduced characters because they all lack the liveliness and creative spark of the original characters that are explored slightly more deeply in this film. <br/><br/>But enough of the aspects of the film that let me down. For all of the disappointments, Incredibles 2 also has many surprises and amazing qualities. For one, Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. At first, I worried that too much of Jack Jack's powers were revealed, but that was hardly the case. Jack Jack is actually one of the best parts of this film. He is easily one of the funniest parts of any Pixar film. I couldn't help but burst out in laughter every time he made a single noise. The humor in this film is slightly more present, or maybe more memorable, than in the original. The film's message also tries to be more important and necessary besides highlighting the importance of family.<br/><br/>Obviously this review won't stop you from seeing this film, nor was it intended to, but I encourage all of you to see this film in theaters, but heavily reduce your expectations and don't think too much about what made The Incredibles nearly perfect, or you are sure to be sorely disappointed."
"admin-16582","2","398","734","23 July 2018"," Forced feminism ruined this movie.
","This movie is not about family like the first one!<br/><br/>Having a strong female lead is great, but emphasizing their superiority over men, over and over, joke after joke, just made this movie unbearable. That is not equality!<br/><br/>The first Incredibles movie brought the entire family together as a whole and was solid, one of my all time favorites. Even though the Incredibles 2 started off good and it was funny (at first) with how Mr Incredible had a hard time with the kids, it never ended. As the movie goes on and on you soon realize what's happening because it's not subtle. The boys can't play because their masculinity is too destructive, so Elastigirl has to go solo to restore their image, but she's really just being tricked by an even smarter female who has an idiot for a brother (he just happens to be the President of a huge telcom company). Violet's character is developed as she matures and is beginning to understand the world as well as her powers. But, Mr Incredible and Dash are just kinda punching bags to make fun of and serve no other purpose. Other than us seeing all the powers Jack Jack has, he really doesn't do anything either other than cause problems. Sure near the end the whole family sort of gets involved, but they're mostly just taking turns running after Jack Jack. The movie really should have been called ""Elastigirl and Friends"".<br/><br/>To sum it up, the story was boring and predictable. They had a certain direction to follow with the feminist agenda and the writers probably did the best they could. But if you think I'm crazy, even the film's producer Nicole Paradis Grindle confirmed that its feminist premise was years in the making. This movie taught my daughters that family only gets in the way, masculinity is dangerous, men are stupid, and women are victims. <br/><br/>It's worth noting that my first review was declined by the IMDb staff using a general ""does not meet guidelines"" reason, which simply means that person doesn't agree with me and chose to censor my review. This is my opinion and view of the movie, and your bias should not be used to censor your opposition to further promote your agenda."

","This movie is fantastic, loved the story and the characters. Where this movie loses points is in three separate continuous sequences of intense flashing. My sister is epileptic, and with no warnings we weren't prepared for any of it. She ended up seizing after the first sequence, and we had to cover her eyes for the their two. If you or any family members are sensitive to this sort of thing, AVOID THIS MOVIE."

","If you have seen lot of movies and read tons of comic books like myself it would seem predictable plus movie does have certain base plot elements similar to original. But don't run away yet because that is not fun part about the movie or what movie makers were focusing on, it was the family dynamics, role reversals and yes the much anticipated Jack Jack the Big bang in the small pack and all his wonderful powers which wreck havoc and yes make him most powerful member of the team.
 I can't say anything else without dropping spoilers but its a movie about a family that can be enjoyed by all families young and old together."
"domdom-63818","1","199","361","28 October 2018"," Kinda funny how the villain is a microcosm of the movie itself...
","It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.<br/><br/>The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.<br/><br/>At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.<br/><br/>I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.<br/><br/>I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days."

"trw-98462","8","24","37","22 June 2018"," A Simply Super Movie
","Having grown up in the 2000s and being an advid fan of animation and superheroes, I'd be lying if I told you that I wasn't entranced by Disney Pixar's Incredibles from 2004. Fast forward fourteen years and I found myself sitting in a movie theatre with a bunch of other twenty year olds excitedly waiting to watch its sequel. But was Incredibles 2 able to reach the high bar set by its predecessor?<br/><br/>I'd personally say yes. This movie was an incredible success!<br/><br/>I just love how Incredibles is able to expertly mix superhero action with the struggles faced by your average family. When they're not fighting crime, the members of the Parr family find themselves dealing with basic human predicaments, like trying to raise a baby and figuring out how to do math homework. These two genres may not seem compatible on paper, but Incredibles is just able to make it work. This results in Incredibles being a truly unique feature.<br/><br/>Of course originality alone isn't enough to make a film great, especially if the writers are unable to compose a comprehensible story for their film. Thankfully, the plot of Incredibles 2 was able to exceed the basic fundamental requirements of storytelling, especially for a superhero film. Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable and it is honestly quite simplistic at its core. Nonetheless, the story is executed quite well, and there are relatively no plot holes present in the movie. Although the story is fine, what I found to be a major highlight of the film would definitely be the characters, specifically the protagonists.<br/><br/>Each of the main characters added their own little flair to the movie. Helen takes the spotlight for a decent portion of the film, and viewers got to see her awesome crime fighting abilities as Elastigirl. Violet was pretty amazing in this movie. She went through development as a person, as a superhero, and had some pretty hilarious moments like when she squirted water out of her nose. Dash also showed some character growth in the film and he ended up being an enjoyable presence. When it comes to Bob, I do wish that the creators would have showed off his prowess as Mr. Incredible a bit more in the film. But since he got some enjoyable scenes as a stressed dad trying to take care of his children and was the primary focus of the first movie, it didn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me ended up being how great I found the Jack-Jack scenes to be. I couldn't believe how entertained I was by the antics of a baby in a movie, and he actually wound up being one of the most memorable parts of the film for me. Returning characters like Frozone and Edna maintained their charm from the previous movie, and some of the new characters ended up being pretty decent as well.<br/><br/>I simply can't finish this review without talking about the breathtaking aesthetics of the film. The animators really outdid themselves with the movie's technical aspects. Expressions, movements, and scenery were impressively well animated, and the visuals have set a new standard for animated movies. Of course, this is to be expected. The creators did have a solid fourteen years to make this film as spectacular as possible you know.<br/><br/>Overall, I was genuinely satisfied with Incredibles 2. It maintained the quality of the first film and even surpassed it in some aspects. Pixar did a lot of things right with this movie. And if you're unsure of whether or not to watch it because ""it's for kids,"" I would wholeheartedly recommend giving this movie a shot. I doubt that you'll be dissapointed by it. It is a pretty incredible movie after all."
"IsabelM11","1","290","548","23 July 2018"," Dumbed Down to the Max
","(I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum)
I really don't know what to say about this film.<br/><br/>As someone who absolutely loved the first one and went into this one desiring to love it as well, I was extremely disappointed and just incredibly confused. I have a number of issues with it, but let's get into the first one.<br/><br/>Tone: Not every film in a series/sequence needs to maintain consistent tone, I get that. But the first film has always stood out from other animated movies, because of its serious tone and mature themes (children and adults can enjoy it). This movie feels like a different franchise entirely. It lacks all the high stakes, emotion, and seriousness of the first film. Consider just a couple moments from the first film: the plane crash scene, the scene where Mr. Incredible threatens to kill Mirage, the scene where Buddy gives his ""it's bigger, it's badder"" monologue, the scene where Mr. Incredible realizes his fellow supers are dead and is then absorbed by black slime, or when Elastigirl considers that Mr. Incredible might be having an affair when she finds a white hair. Any one of these scenes is more complex, emotional, and interesting than the entire Incredibles 2 film. The second movie lacks any sense of stakes or seriousness. It felt like the most dumbed down version imaginable. The first film was so smart in its approach and dialogue, and the characters felt realistic and intelligent (the fight between Elastigirl and Bob when he comes home late). This film has lost all of that completely. For example, the scene where Elastigirl is talking to the sister and says ""are you asking the believer or the cynic?"" was possibly the most cringe-worthy, out of place dialogue I've ever heard. Like they were trying to intellectualize a moment so hard it just felt forced. Even the color scheme of this movie felt jarringly different and so saturated, like the colors were turned up to the max. The first film had a color story that made sense: it's grey and depressing when Bob is working, explosion of color once you get to Nomanasan. There's a development of color that is both metaphoric and makes sense. This film's color story felt childish, which would be fine if it was just a children's movie. But it's apart of a franchise that's first film was an iconic masterpiece with mature yet fun themes, and in that respect it is seriously disappointing and difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Plot: Most predictable plot ever made. As soon as you see it, you know the siblings (sister) will turn out to be bad, and that she's controlling screen slaver. And of course Elastigirl finally gets her turn to save the world and Mr. Incredible + family will have to go save her (a reversal of the first movie that at first seems creative then becomes almost too predictable). And I have major issues with the villain. They are literally fighting people who can be calmed down if they just remove goggles. <br/><br/>Characters: What happened with the characters? They were all dumbed down versions of themselves. Even that scene with Dash where he can't pronounce decimals, which was supposed to be family friendly and cute, was just irritating and felt dumb for his character. Elastigirl was over the top to the point where she didn't feel like herself. Bob was the... same? I guess, but had zero development. Violet, who I get is going through her angsty teen thing, is okay. Even the minor characters, Edna aside who was fine, like the guy who helps them relocate each year was off. In the first film I appreciated his seriousness and matter of fact style, which appeared cold but you could tell he actually cared. Even he felt crazy different. <br/><br/>It actually hurts me to continue critiquing this film, so I'll stop there despite the many other issues I had with it."

"dezriknightangel","2","343","667","22 June 2018"," Entertaining (Until You Think About It)
","At first viewing the Incredibles 2 was on par (no pun intended) with most Marvel sequels: Not deep, but visually stunning and entertaining throughout most of the film.<br/><br/>That said...<br/><br/>First of all, the story is weak and forgettable. The family for which the movie gets its name is hardly relevant, with Dash and Violet having no impact on the plot (and Dash failing to receive even an attempt at a subplot). Mr. Incredible fails in everything he attempts in both heroic and domestic pursuits, and Elastigirl saves a few lives before falling for an obvious trap and being controlled by the villain.<br/><br/>As the story comes to its climax, all of the heroes (including Frozone and both parents) have been enslaved by the villain and its up to Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack to save the day. Rather than showing how young people can be just as heroic as adults, a car gets to be the hero, with their sole contribution being accidental. The film then concludes with complete victory for the heroes and an utter lack of character development. Such plots as the Underminer, the technology to erase memories, the damage lawsuits, and the villains unused ability to enslave the entire human race were ignored and forgotten.<br/><br/>This movie was little more than an excuse for Disney to push its increasingly heavy-handed political agenda into the minds of young people. Every scene is filled with cowardly men, evil entrepreneurs, and flat jokes. The movie explicitly states that it is villainous to unplug from technology and live your life and that vicarious living through screens is ideal and that protests and law breaking is the only way to change public policy.<br/><br/>This is not intended or writtwn ironically. This is the film's actual moral message.<br/><br/>I'll end with this: If you enjoy the most recent Star Wars movies where beloved characters are rendered irrelevant and progressive politics are the driving force of the story you might not mind this movie. Yet in the theater with me were a lot of children who weren't laughing and a lot of parents slowly realizing that Disney is no longer family entertainment.<br/><br/>Disney is a propaganda mill ranting against the capitalist middle-class society that supports it, and I urge you to stop supporting the films they release until their focus returns to quality filmmaking."
"corpse_man","2","421","833","20 June 2018"," Another movie ruined by radical feminism.
","First of all, this movie is nothing but a giant piece of propaganda. I was a huge fan of the original Incredibles, and it's quite sad to see this new film reduced to nothing more than a means to push radical neo feminist ideologies.<br/><br/>To summarize the plot, it's basically about how Elastigirl is a more competent superhero than Mr Incredible, and so she gets chosen to be the face of the new superhero resurgence, while Mr incredible stays at home and looks after the kids. Not surprisingly, the movie emphasizes how poorly Mr incredible is at handling his new duties at home. <br/><br/>The main message of this movie is that Elastigirl is just as good or better than Mr Incredible at superhero work, while Mr Incredible is vastly inferior at taking care of the kids and home life in general. So basically, he is just all around inferior to her. Or let's just say it out loud, Men are inferior to women. That is the real message of the film. Ironically, it was actually released right before FATHERS DAY!!!<br/><br/>Now if so many other movies were not packed with the same sort of blatant propaganda recently, I could probably just right it off as part of the plot, or just originality or whatever, but since almost every big budget movie recently is so full of similar plot lines, it's quite clear what it really is. PROPAGANDA.<br/><br/>In the original Incredibles movie, Elastigirl and Mr Incredible were equals. They both had strengths and weaknesses, and in the end she ended up saving him. I loved that movie. It was about a loving family and about equal partnership. This new movie however, Mr Incredible and Elastigirl are not even close to being equals. he is completely incompetent and demasculinized, while she is vastly superior at pretty much everything. AS I stated previously, this fits in with the modern trend of movies, which seems to not only put Women in postions of power (which is great) but also seems to greatly emphasize their superiority over men. This needs to stop. Especially on a movie released just before fathers day. Like seriously?<br/><br/>WE are basically telling our children they don't need fathers and don't need to listen to their fathers or respect them, because they are just completely incompetent, second rate people. I would NOT let my children watch this movie!"

My problem had NOTHING at all to do with the movie having a female lead, but just that it was simply so uninteresting! Too much dialogue and build-up that never went anywhere, the characters were whiny, and I don't even think kids over 4 would enjoy this snooze-fest (if even then). What a waste of the past 14 years -- all that time passed and no one bothered to develop a clever or entertaining plot/script. My kiddo and I booked it immediately as the credits began to roll.

","Over all I found it somewhat entertaining for a popcorn flick. It has a good amount of action and a few chuckles. I noticed an improvement in the art (which was already stellar in the first film). the problem is that it's a sequel to...THE BEST FILM EVER MADE! How does one wait fourteen years and come up with this?<br/><br/>My biggest fear about having a sequel is that they'd messed with the original and/or get political. They did both. As far as messing with the original, Tony will never have the memory of getting the courage to ask Violet out at the track meet, the epic finale of the first film where Bob and Helen see Jackjack's superpowers while being taken away by Syndrome was written out like it never happened, and we knew in the first film that the Pars were going to mop the floor with the Underminor. That was the punchline of the whole film. Also the 'family as one' moral of the first film went out the window.
*Spoilers*.
In the new film, the Underminor gets away and never gets what's coming to him.
I like the idea of having the villain being a woman this time, but Evelyn filling that role just seemed forced. I have a hard time buying it.
We see Bob jealous and hurt by not being included in Winston's plans but he never gets to redeem himself (his big deed is pushing a rudder?). In the first film he was 'super' in every way possible (remember how he calculated the velocity of the jumper and when he outsmarted the robots?) In this film, they paint him as sloppy which is unfair. Helen never had to deal with Jackjack's powers like Bob did. There is no closure to the (outdated/overused) Mr Mom thing. No redemption. 
We saw JackJack turn into metal in the original but it never touched on this. The little devil monster and the 'multiply' trick was used over and over. Would have liked to have seen more of his mimicry skills. Heck, if this movie was all Edna and Jackjack, it would have been a big improvement!
All the new supers they brought in just cluttered up the plot (not that there was much of one). We know nothing about them except that they are dumb.
 It also lacks that wonderful mid-century charm of the original. It is way too urban and the house and boat are just sterile. 
 Dang, I would have LOVED it if they at least could have included the original incredible house being rebuilt at the end of the film. It would have signaled that the charm of the original might eventually come back (in about fifteen more years after a dozen more penguin films ;)<br/><br/> I actually posted to the old IMDB message board two years ago that I was afraid of the idea of a sequel. I was right. And the feminist political theme didn't help (if you doubt me, notice that almost all the males have strange, fruit shaped heads).
Sorry, I don't mean to be such a pessimist. It's not a TERRIBLE film. But as a followup to the greatest film ever made? I'll go with my original assessment from two years ago and watch The Incredibles with a smile. And pretend this film never happened :/"

The original was great (8/10 or 9/10), this was not. Even asking the kids all said they knew who the surprise 'villain' was early in the movie.
Many animated movies have a depth to the movie that both adults and kids enjoy. This did not. It was very simple humor. The main humor had to do with the super powers of the baby and how hard it is to be the Dad left alone with the baby. Just wasn't funny unless you really like simple humor.

","SPOILER: I have occasionally been asked, ""What is your favourite movie?"" It is a question I find hard to answer but ""The Incredibles"" usually comes to mind.<br/><br/>The first movie was brilliant on so many levels and all the characters had depth, even the minor ones like Mirage and Bob's boss. The tension between Bob and Helen felt real but was constrained in a way that was totally appropriate for a family movie. The humour was clever and tensions worked out in a thoroughly plausible way. The movie thoughtfully and often subtly explored family dynamics in a manner unprecedented in superhero movies or mainstream animated movies,<br/><br/>In the first movie Bob and Helen were both strong, willful characters who learned from each other. They put effort into their marriage and were ultimately rewarded for it but it was portrayed realistically as a work in progress<br/><br/>In this movie, not.<br/><br/>It was not brilliant on any level other that the technical. The animation was fantastic. Although I actually enjoyed the parts of the movie there was much I did not like.<br/><br/>The characters lacked the depth of the first movie. Helen as others have pointed out was particularly shallow, ironic considering how aggressively feminist the plot was.<br/><br/>The minor characters were like cardboard cutouts. The new superhero crew seemed to try to tick demographic boxes, although I am sure someone will rant there was none identifying as a woman of colour with a speaking part. (apart from Frozone's wife Honey)<br/><br/>The tension between Bob and Helen was largely replaced by Bob's tension with the feminist world view. Bob's emasculation for most of the movie was nauseating to watch. While feminists may rejoice at the role reversal, I have met very few women who find underachieving, stay at home dads attractive.<br/><br/>The villain was quite predictable and her story-line felt contrived.<br/><br/>An over arching feminist agenda seemed to dominate the movie in a thoroughly skewed manner.<br/><br/>Pro women:
1. the main superhero action was given to Helen. She is portrayed as nearly perfect and able to singlehandedly do almost anything.
2. the main superhero of the new group is Void
3. the main politician is the Ambassador
4. Violet gets a story arc but Dash gets very little. (Jack Jack does but babies are rather gender-less). Violet's superpowers save people several times
5. the technical wizards of the movie are both women and although Edna Mode is arguably transgender, she still identifies as a woman.
6. the evil genius is a woman but not that evil; almost as if to say women villains are so much nicer than male ones. She only tried to kill one person, where as Syndrome actually killed several. For a bonus feminist point she is quite possibly lesbian and therefore really does not need men at all.
7. Violet after much effort, angst and embarrassment finally gets her date with a nice guy, only to leave him standing at the ticket counter. The message is loud and clear, girls can do as they want, when they want and men should accept this without question. <br/><br/>Anti men
1. Bob is portrayed as inept, reckless when doing the superhero thing and chauvinistic. Even when doing his superhero stuff, he never succeeds until one or more people are helping.
2. Dash has a relatively minor role and is often reckless and impulsive just like his dad. His most memorable achievement is stealing a car!
3. Rick Dicker a important male authority figure from the first movie, is portrayed as ineffectual and is put out to pasture.
4. Winston Deavor is arguably dangerously naive, implausibly altruistic and rather shallow.<br/><br/>Finally the most ridiculous part of the whole movie. Jack Jack. It is a given that a certain suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy any superhero movie but usually there are rules to constrain the plot and make the story worth while and set up an internal coherence. Every Superman has his kryptonite and in another age every Achilles had his heel. In what universe is a baby with highly destructive, poorly controlled and nearly limitless superpowers a good idea? That Jack Jacks antics have such benign effects is implausible to say the least. However did the raccoon survive? By sheer political correctness I suspect. We can't have babies killing wild animals in a Disney movie. The internal realism of the first movie is thoroughly absent here.<br/><br/>In summary it feels as if the original movie got a Neo-Marxist rewrite. There was enough spark left over from the original movie to make it watchable but not enough to redeem it."

","'Incredibles 2' picks up right where it's predecessor, 'The Incredibles' left off, with the titular heroes, the Parr family, thrust into an exciting new adventure. The plot focuses on Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl, with the help of millionaire businessman Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn, trying to make superheroes legal again, while Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, stays home with the kids. When a new villain emerges with a dangerous plan to turn the general populace against Supers, the Incredibles, along with family-friend Frozone, must band together to stop the rogue. I found it humorous how Bob and Helen's roles are reversed from the first film, but it's refreshing and it works. I found the story very compelling, with the perfect combination of action, mystery, suspense, and humor. Unfortunately, the film's antagonist, The Screenslaver, isn't as compelling as the first film's villain, Syndrome. Screenslaver's identity is kept hidden for most of the film, with clues here and there to keep you guessing. Ultimately, it's not too difficult to figure out who is under the mask, but it's still an interesting mystery. Most of the cast from 'The Incredibles' returns for the sequel, and once again do a stellar job. The animation has greatly improved from the first film, with the characters and scenery looking better and more realistic than ever. One aspect of this film I especially enjoyed is that we see more of the Parr family working together to take down the bad guy, with even the kids, Dash and Violet, helping to save the day. The film's standout character is without a doubt the Parr family's youngest member, Jack-Jack, who is a delight to watch and steals every scene he is in. Overall, 'Incredibles 2' is pure fun and enjoyment from beginning to end, and I actually enjoyed it more than the first. Much like 'The Incredibles', the film's ending leaves the door open for another installment, and I immensely hope we get to see 'Incredibles 3' one day, because I can't get enough of this 'Super' family.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9.5/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","48","89","30 July 2018"," Falls short of super or incredible
","Have always been a big fan of Pixar, liking to loving pretty much all their short films (particularly 'Presto', 'One Man Band', 'Geri's Game', 'Piper' and 'Knick Knack'). Also like to love a vast majority of their feature films, my favourites being the 'Toy Story' films, 'Up', 'Coco' and 'Inside Out' and my least favourites being the 'Cars' sequels and 'The Good Dinosaur'.<br/><br/>While not one of my favourite Pixar films, 'The Incredibles' is still a very, very good film that has gone even higher in my estimations after a well overdue re-watch to get myself prepared for 'Incredibles 2', fantastically animated, exciting, funny, emotionally investable and ground-breaking with great characters. Expectations were high for its long awaited sequel fourteen years on, and while it is not as good a film, and what could and should have been super and incredible wasn't quite, on the most part 'Incredibles 2' was worth the wait.<br/><br/>'Incredibles 2' does lack 'The Incredibles' originality (not much new here) and its emotional impact and character development is also not as good, the latter particularly is noticeably thinner (Bob for example was more complex before). It was a little too long for a story as slight as it was, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes and tightened the first act's pacing with it taking a bit too much time to get going.<br/><br/>Like others, among my biggest problems were to do with the villain. The villain was forgettable (one of Pixar's weakest easily), the twist concerning their identity that was too obvious too soon. Found their plan convoluted, that when explained made me want a re-wind button which was not possible in the cinema, and the motivation was pretty weak and extreme, took a while for me to get my head round. While the characters are fun, it did feel like there were too many, not sure whether it needed that many superheroes that aren't given enough to do other than in the climax.<br/><br/>However, it may sound like 'Incredibles 2' was a bad film. It wasn't. Actually enjoyed it a good deal. The animation is fantastic, smooth, vibrant in colour and meticulous in background detail, some very striking details, a richly immersive setting and the characters are well designed. Michael Giacchino's score gets one in a rousing mood while also being dynamic with the action. The action is superbly animated and thrilling with real suspense and excitement.<br/><br/>Writing has many moments of humour that provides a lot of laughs (Jack Jack steals the show here, especially with his powers and his fight with the racoon, with some nice lines later from Edna), moments that probe thought and drama that's relatable and never too sentimental (if not as poignant as one would like). The story does grip, more so in the Elastigirl story that really held my attention before the villain reveal underwhelmed. The family drama stuff is also very prominent, and while it is repetitive at times and there could have been less of it the best moments are very funny and it is very easy to relate to the dilemmas the characters face. Pacing mostly excites when things get going.<br/><br/>Character development is nowhere near as strong here and it would have benefitted from less characters and more done with the existing characters and more thought with the villain and their plan/motivations, but the characters are mostly fun with the highlight being Jack Jack. The voice acting is terrific, especially from Holly Hunter, Craig T Nelson and Samuel L Jackson. Brad Bird is a lot of fun in Edna's small role and Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks are good additions.<br/><br/>Overall, very enjoyable but wanted to like it much more. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"jameskidac","9","8","11","26 June 2018"," This beast bucks the formulaic trend of the recent Disney movies
","Kudos to Brad for making the movie tight like a mission impossible adventure. There is a sense of danger, anticipation and then delivery of that promise, against a very believable villain, and with none of the weird generic formula that plagues recent films like ""A Force Awakens"" and ""Star Trek Discovery"" which really gets in the way of telling a good story. I don't know what it is, but those aforementioned films feel the same and I can't tell them apart and always feel like I watched an alternate universe rerun of the same thing. I truly believe that Pixar is on a good path with exception to Cars 3, and that is a small price to pay to keep the lights on!"

"b2280545","8","13","20","18 July 2018"," The Incredibles Return
","The Incredibles return in the highly anticipated sequel that fans have waited for 14 long years to arrive in theaters. The first Incredibles released in 2004 was a masterpiece of filmmaking for it's time and is part of Pixar Animation Studios's Golden Age of films along with past iconic titles Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo. What these films have in common is how they were able to touch the hearts of audiences across the world, as a result becoming cult classics. In the past, Pixar has produced sequels to their films from time to time, with the Toy Story franchise being the most popular and with the next sequel Toy Story 4 scheduled for a 2019 release, the franchise continues it's success. Cars and Finding Nemo both have had relatively decent sequels but this one was highly desired for the last fourteen years. That being said, there hasn't been nor will there ever be a case when a sequel to an adored iconic film is released that audiences especially fans of the original who hold it dear to their hearts will not perceive the sequel at first glance as inferior to the original. That can damage a film's reputation. Incredibles 2 does look different (the animation literally looks different) and yet is similar to the first film with a new twist. It's habit of bringing back the nostalgia that made the original loved is it's biggest strength. <br/><br/>The film picks up right where the first film ended with the first superhero family facing off with the villain the Underminer giving viewers the idea of the kind of film their about to watch. One thing this film does well is develop each character's powers to new levels. For an animated film, the action sequences are thrilling, sometimes heart pounding and super fun to view. The music is similar to how it was before giving exciting 60's spy movie vibes. The best moments of the film are the ones where Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible is watching over his children while his wife is away saving the world, something we did not see in the first film was his relationship with his children. The theme of wanting acceptance in a world that hates you is back, a relatable subject in today's world for some people, and just as in the first film, it's presented well. Incredibles 2 is an enjoyable action packed superhero fest with a coming of age aspect to it. All the characters are under pressure by the world around them that's telling them how they're supposed to live their lives creating sadness and desperation for them. As time goes by, they must choose what they want to be. Pixar has always included deep emotional topics like this in their films all to their credit. <br/><br/>Finally while the additional characters new to the film may not have been the most memorable Pixar has invented, it had an interesting story, entertaining action, a final act that pays off, humorous moments and seeing the characters return made the film worth the wait. It doesn't completely live up to the original though nonetheless it is a worthy sequel to one of the most successful animated films in history."

"pangaea6","2","150","310","21 June 2018"," Not the G rated Disney your used to
","Pretty good plot, not as good as the first. First off this Disney cartoon has 2 uses of profanity that didn't need to be there, Damn & Hell. Since when did Disney cartoon characters curse? And at least 2 uses of God's name in vain. SO after that our family was kinda lackluster on the rest of what happened. Of course women have to take center stage. Which is ok but when its obviously a trend in society, it seems manufactured. The extra super heroes seemed kind of generic and one dimensional, they threw too many in there and their animation seemed sub par. Violet did some cool stuff with her force fields, but Dash seemed slower, Mr Incredible not as strong but Frozone seemed to have a little stronger ice. And the plot didn't really make sense. Seems like after 14 years it could have been better, like the Finding Nemo sequel. But don't be surprised in the next Nemo movie if Marlin curses out another fish for picking on Nemo, its coming apparently with Disney."
"SnoopyStyle","8","9","13","29 October 2018"," continues to be fun
","This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise."

I will happily wait another 14 if the third installment is up to the caliber of #2.<br/><br/>The animation was top notch and the script is surprisingly deep. Superheros are struggling to regain their lawful status in society, Violet is going through teenage dating pains. Family finances and stay at home parenting are heavy themes on top of the standard villain vs. hero struggle. Still, it manages to be laugh out loud funny all the way through. Jack Jack's ability reveals are easily the funniest scenes in the movie, and we love the Poltergeist Easter egg. Wonder if Craig T Nelson had anything to do with it? <br/><br/>Yes, the main villain is kind of weak and predictable, but that only took one star off. The story was kind of long, as in the editor could have cut 10 minutes without losing much. <br/><br/>Like the original, we will watch it again and again when it comes out on disc."

It doesn't quite get to the heart of the matter and misses an opportunity to be a clever critique of our current times. The theme even seems to be jumbled and incoherent at times.<br/><br/>But overall, the film is saved by funny characters and doing what action-filled, comical, Hollywood blockbusters set out to do: be entertaining.

","""Incredibles-2"" - bright, vigorous, dynamic, full of humor and funny cartoon scenes for family viewing. Everything is fine in it, unless you compare it with the original film and especially with the best films ""Pixar"", published in the pre-Disney era. Alas, after the purchase of ""Pixar"", in the ""Disney"" and failed to create a single sequel that can surpass the original films and ""The Incredibles-2"" was no exception on this list.<br/><br/>The director and scriptwriter of the first ""The Incredibles"" Brad Bird three years ago peremudril with the failed ""Earth of the Future"", so this time I decided not to take risks, having made almost a complete remake of my own film. Dramaturgy is again built around playing up family problems and places of people with abilities in society, and the main antagonist still believes that in his troubles, born from a distant childhood, only superheroes are to blame. Of course, watching the same story, retold the second time, even with the addition of a funny Jack Jack, is not as interesting as the first, especially given the number of films about superheroes that have appeared over the last decade.<br/><br/>The expected change in the plot was only the distribution of roles in the superfamily Parrov. Now Elastiko earns money in the corporation ""Devor"", at the same time saving the world and the reputation of superheroes, and Mister Exclusiveness awaits a full family break-out in one of the mansions of the Devors, a midlife crisis, chronic insomnia, depression and the problem of finding a new identity. Detective intrigue, which was the hallmark of the first ""The Incredibles"", this time became more predictable. In both films, the main villain reveals long before the final, but if in the original film the appearance of Toddler's kid became a real surprise for the audience, then in the sequel the main villain is easily guessed already in the tenth minute of the film. In order to somehow diversify the plot, Bird tried to go many times to the tried and tested way - to increase the team of superheroes. In theory, this could give the sequel a new breath, but in reality it looks artificially and somewhat strange, especially considering that in the first film Buddy made a total purge of the superhero world.
If the original cartoon was equally interesting to children and adults, the new ""The Incredibles"" turned out to be more straightforward, simplistic and childish. Adult viewers can be more pleased with the guessing of references to various films that permeate all the plot lines of the sequel. Already at the very beginning, Byrd plays with amusement the famous scene of erasing memory from the ""Men in Black"", then the plot moves along the rolled track of ""Hancock"", telling about the need for good PR for superheroes, in the middle it smoothly passes to ""Bondiana"" with the appropriate style and music , and ends with a retelling of a couple episodes of ""People X"".<br/><br/>Children such complex allusions will be incomprehensible, but they will like the dynamics and humor of the new film, which are significantly added, in comparison with the original. Cartoon cheerfully begins immediately after the battle with Buddy Payne, which ended the first ""The Incredibles"" and after that famously rushes through a lot of adventures, pursuit and fights, right up to the finale. The fun this time is built, mainly around the polymorphic Jack Jack, who adores not only cookies, but also a zombie, who can not understand anything good a child can. All this, together with the immediacy and uncontrollability of the manifestation of emotions and various superpowers, delivers to the father a lot of hard minutes. However, he gets not only him, but also a thieving raccoon. His fight with Jack Jack, made in the style of Walt Disney's classic films, has tangible moral defects, but it also causes the most laughter in the hall.<br/><br/>Of course, through the abundance of fun and action scenes from all sides, the ideological aspects of the ""children's"" cartoon also slip. As a positive US Secretary of State, the image of Hollywood's favorite Hollywood Clinton is easily discernible, and feminist ideas permeate all the plot lines of the film from the first to the last frame. Starting with the ""Mulan"", released in 1998, militant feminism has become the main semantic concept of Disney products, adding with each new cartoon. ""The Incredibles-2"" raises its banner to such a height that it will be difficult to surpass in the future, because absolutely all the female characters in it from Violet to Evelyn DeVore not only completely surpass their narrow-minded, listless and incapable partners, but also conduct among themselves amusing discussions about the role of women in society. On the one hand, this really reflects certain trends in public life, but on the other hand it directly programs them. It's funny that the villain Ekranotiran is just talking through television to zombie Americans that in the modern world people are completely lazy, they stopped critically assessing information and simply mindlessly absorb the dregs that are pouring on them from every screen every day.
Somewhat strange in the cartoon about the family is built and the supply of family values. The Parrov family is in fact completely connected only at the very end, under the threat of survival, and before that, the male and female parts of the family practically do not interact. Elastiko, completely forgetting about the family and the baby Jack Jack, after work prefers to rest in an expensive hotel, and Violet is absorbed in the first teenage love, not noticing anyone around her. In the end, it turns out that Edna Modd, voiced in the original by Brad Bird himself, puts much more effort into the education of the younger son Parov than his own mother.<br/><br/>Well, unlike the dubious value assumptions, the technical side of the cartoon is flawless. A huge time difference between the first and second cartoons allows you to clearly see what a huge path made computer animation in the last decade. Thanks to the improvement of the technologies for the transmission of facial expressions and emotions, from time to time it really seems that on the screen there are actors that are not drawn, but live.<br/><br/>In general, if you do not pay attention to the secondary, banal and straightforward plot and crumpled finale, the cartoon fully fulfills its functions of easy summer entertainment for the whole family. But for many years Piksar has raised the bar not only technical, but also the semantic content of its best cartoons, that against their background, ""The Incredibles-2"" looks just like a tuned eight next to the newest Mercedes."

","While Pixar may have been slipping up in recent years with films like the Good Dinosaur and Brave, this sequel felt so fresh and they only reused two jokes from the original film. I had a great time watching it and the family was just perfect from start to finish with Frozone along for the ride.<br/><br/>I loved all the moments where Bob has to look after the kids as that was so relate-able and really made you understand how parenthood works. Finding out that Jack-Jack had powers was really hilarious to watch and watching Edna Mode bond with him really took the cake.<br/><br/>The whole villain while really tightly woven in, was not so good. The villain was really cleverly revealed but I could see it coming a mile off. It was a bit predictable, it's something that we've seen a million times before.<br/><br/>But once again, this sequel was passable thanks to the really funny dynamic between the whole family we've grown to love.

"ironhorse_iv","8","12","19","21 July 2018"," While, this sequel was not as incredible as the first movie. It's still a good watch.
","Following the success of 2004's Pixar Animation Studio's computer-animated superhero film 'The Incredibles', Walt Disney Pictures really wanted a sequel. However, writer & director, Brad Bird held off development to do other films. It wasn't until his last movie, 2015's 'Tomorrowland', bomb at theaters, that he returned to the project, in order to make the producers happy, while also try to salvage what left of his career. Because of that, I don't think, personally, Bird had the same heart & desirer for this, like he had, during the original. After all, it kinda shows in this film's script. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the story is pretty much a rethread, just with more poorly done foreshadowing and callbacks. Instead of Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Voiced by Craig Nelson) being recruited by a private company to do superhero work. This time, it's his wife, Helen/Elastigirl (Voiced by Holly Hunter) being chosen to, and now, Bob is the one, stuck at home, stressing out, while taking care of the kids. The only few differences comes from the overall tone. The first movie's is a little more fun & unique, as it portray superheroes in an bright, gratuitous 1960s spy genre adventure style, while the sequel takes the more murky atmospheric neo noir pulp detective mixed with 'Body Snatchers' horror approach to the main story. Because of that, the movie's vibrant, retro mid-century designs are not that endearingly nor as beautiful to look at, like the original. Thus, making the movie, a bit misty. Parts of the movie, was even hard to watch for some audiences, as the strobe lights used in the villain fight scenes cause them to suffer epilepsy. As for the rest of the action. While, less violent & fewer body count than the first movie, it was entertaining, but it lacks the overall family dynamics for a film called 'Incredibles 2'. They barely team up in this film. It's sad, because the climactic battle of the original, made them seem like they would fight crime together, regardless, what laws may say, and what challenges may come. Yet, the sequel drawn out, unnecessary excuses for the family, not to. It's highly annoying, because, the kids at this point, are very knowledgeable with their powers, when face with danger. As for the struggles of them, living in a 'herd morality' society. It's not that fresh nor does it make any sense worth continuing in the context of the last movie. That clash of beliefs has already been tackle greatly with the Ãœbermensch through man-made technology VS Natural God-Given Abilities storyline from the original. It didn't need to be, recycled yet, again with a similar, yet predictable new villain. Nevertheless, I kinda dig the smart cautionary tale of allowing the perception of media to supplanted reality & dictated control of our lives for good, or for wicked means. That part of the main story was somewhat captivating to watch. Too bad, it wasn't explore to its fullest, due to the many interferes from producers. Just think, how much more powerful, the film could had been, if they went with the original idea; superheroes vs computer AI. The same can be said, if they kept the baby storyline as the main plot. The idea of uncontrollable somewhat powerful toddler wrecking society with his body horror could had been very fascinating. Sadly, instead, the movie choose to moves around, way too much with too many mini different subplots. Thus, making the sequel, a little unfocused, badly paced, & muddled. Not only that, but also full of jarring plot-holes, bigger than the school on Saturday debate and the Elastigirl hypoxia question. After all, one of the hardest things to believe, in the movie, is that the family doesn't know, about the baby's powers within the three months, timespan, they spent together in a cramped motel. I can go with the idea that the villain from the last movie, not killing all the superheroes, due to them, not being well-known, but the idea that the family doesn't see the baby's abilities really did take me out of the movie. Nevertheless, the story, is a lot better than non-canon 2005's video game 'Rise of the Underminer', but not unique enough to outdo the 2009 non-canon comic adaptation of the first film. It was bit lackluster in creative in that sense. As for the jokes. It was a mixed bag. Some of them, flew over my head, such as the 'New Math' sequence. Being a millennial, I didn't get it, but most of the others jokes, were funny. The only one that I had a problem with, is the joke with the baby fighting the raccoon. It's not like the animal was stealing, anything of value. It was just searching for crumbs to eat in the trash. That sequence make the baby, look like a total psychopath. Despite that, the animation overall for the movie was pretty damn good. Since, Pixar no longer, used the same computer systems from the original. They had to create everything from scratch. Because of that, we got more crisp, vibrant and detailed effects. It really does look amazing. With the exception of a few performers, most of the original voice actors and actresses returned to their respective characters. This is a bit impressive given how long the production gap was. Not only that, but they were all great in their roles. As for the newcomers, they were alright. However, nobody from that field was really that memorable. As for the music; composer, Michael Giacchino's jazzy score for this movie was just as good as the first film. The nostalgic tunes were catchy to listen to. Overall: In the end, ""Incredibles 2' still turn out to be, somewhat great; even if it doesn't match the majesty of other Pixar sequels. Still, I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. It delivers as much of the joy, pathos, and adventure as the original. It's worth the price of admission. It's super, too."

","Incredibles 2 was a great movie. The characters were all written wonderfully, it's genuinely funny and loads of fun to watch, and it's a satisfying sequel to the 2004 film that brought joy to the whole family. <br/><br/>While watching this film, there were moments where I actually said ""this is awesome"" while watching the film. It's just so great to see these superheroes back in action after 14 years, and it's funny and exciting throughout. I loved seeing the whole family trying to resolve issues while fighting crime.<br/><br/>I do think that the villain in the film was both underdeveloped and pretty easy to spot. From the first time we meet her and her brother, we know something's up, so it wasn't a surprise that one of them was the bad guy. I also think that the scene where Elastigirl is in that electric cage was a bit of a mistake on the part of the animators and the directors. Although I don't have epilepsy, it was still uncomfortable to watch, and that scene makes it harder for those who do have epilepsy to enjoy the film. <br/><br/>Overall, Incredibles 2 was a really fun and satisfying movie. 8 out of 10"

","I watched the first movie around 10 years ago. It was a very good movie: The animation was incredible for the time, the story was pretty deep and complex, the universe was explained, the action was amazing and the characters were defined. It was a very good experience and I actually recomend it.<br/><br/>The second one is... just that. The second one. Let's put the good first, because I know your finger is already twitching in the ""this is not useful"" button: The animation is flawless. It is extremely detailed, even physically acurate. And the action scenes are good: Whole action with no thinking required. The music and sound design are solid, if not simplistic until the credits roll and you actually hear the theme song for Frozone (You rule man).<br/><br/>Speaking of thinking... The plot is really bad. Painfully lazy. It goes into Nazis at the center of the earth territory. It is so painfully predictable that you only require 15 minutes to predict the (not at all surprising) villain, its completely flawed logic and reasoning and even the final sequence. Also its plan is so incredibly dumb it falls into irony when it fails because of how much effort it used on making it fail: It helps the good guys, it gives them the means to defeating it and even gives them enough time for them to save the world. It was pointless.<br/><br/>The humor is ""Jack jack is a baby doing baby things but with superpowers. Laugh."" It fails unless you have the brain capacity of a 6 years old. Or you have a very simple sense of humor, and I mean simple. As in ""somebody got hurt or almost. Laugh."" Also called the ""early youtube syndrome"".<br/><br/>Also they tried to develop a baby as a character... why?. You have a teenager that has teenager problems, with no development on her character. Or an arc. Violet is actually better defined in the first film! She was a shy teenager, learning how to interact, learning to love her family, learning to control herself and to be responsible. Here she is just there... being the deus ex machina. Dash is just there too, not being even a good deus ex machina, unless activating remotely a car and causing property damage counts as it. Mr Incredible is just being there, not learning anything and failing to evolve, only lies at himself and others to cover up his errors and to learn nothing. I can't reinforce that point enough: he learns nothing.<br/><br/>Elastigirl is just an independent woman that needs no man... wait a minute... no no no no... don't you dare... Yes, you did. You broke your own movie universe disney. You did it. You transformed a fully alive family where everyone had an arc, everyone was learning and everyone can progress and everyone is learning into a joke where only the mother and the baby are important. Good job.<br/><br/>The morale is... pffft... keep dreaming. The first one teached you that everyone in your family is important even if you can't always tolerate each other. This one teaches nothing. It is completely devoid of meaning.<br/><br/>Pointless.<br/><br/>Also important: The first film actually has a heart: It makes you feel emotions, excitement, the characters actually try to resolve problems, they can interact with a natural pace. You are actually afraid for their lives when necesary. It actually warms your heart. This one can't. It is just pointless joke after pointless scene about pointlessness.<br/><br/>In short: An empty premise kills a 14 years old masterpiece. Stay with the original.This is only a full-action animated soul-less cashgrab."

Micheal Giacchino nailed the score, and like other Pixar/Disney films there are amazing visuals. However, the thrill and brain of this movie, differentiates itself from the traditional cookie-cutter PG animated films. So far, it has been highly rated by critics, and could be one of the biggest releases of 2018. I can't wait for Incredibles 3."
"spete-42141","2","100","216","7 July 2018"," What is with the cursing and drinking?
","My personal opinion is that the drinking and cursing was totally unnecessary. One of the reasons I enjoy going to the theater with my family for a Pixar movie is because I feel that they are clean and I don't have to worry about what they contain. This one really surprised me with all the drinking and curse words. Having to explain afterwards to my 4 year old that we don't say those things is pretty embarrassing. Next time I will be looking up Parent Reviews before paying to watch it in the theater. The kids did enjoy all the parts with Jack Jack, and the teenage hormones were quite humorous. Unfortunately it left a bad taste in my mouth with the add garbage and I won't own this one."

This time Helen is out being the superhero, while Bob stays at home & takes care of the kids. <br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is a supremely entertaining film. Writer-director Brad Bird makes sure that the 14 year gap between The Incredibles(2004) & this sequel, is definitely worth the wait. The animation is flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The humor is another strong point of the film. The talented cast who have lent their voices, make this movie unforgettable. Craig T. Nelson is outstanding as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter is spectacular as Helen Parr/Elastigirl. Sarah Vowell is brilliant as Violet Parr. Huck Milner is superb as Dashiell 'Dash' Parr. Catherine Keener is amazing as Evelyn Deavor. Eli Fucile is adorable as Jack-Jack Parr. Bob Odenkirk is awesome as Winston Deavor. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Lucius Best/Frozone. Michael Bird, Sophia Bush & Brad Bird are great as Tony Rydinger, Voyd & Edna Mode(E), respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Incredibles 2 surpasses The Incredibles(2004) in every way. It's a must watch. I hope I don't have to wait for another 14 years, to watch Incredibles 3!"
"mullikine","3","70","148","29 June 2018"," 100 roadrunner skits end to end
","Incredibles 2 was such a disappointment, even for me. i loved the first one. i'd find 2 hours of elevator music more memorable. no way near as imaginative as the original. you can only take so much shock value comedy, like americas funniest home videos. the dramatic music is the modern day substitution for canned laughter and reminds me of the way old movies would double the playback speed to make james bond look like he could punch someone, do a barrel role and plant his ski poles in under 5 seconds -- the drama is cringy. the movie was predictable every time it gave you a moment to think. sometimes it felt like the characters are on the set of Tommy Wiseau's The Room, awkwardly making irrational decisions, such as Dash simply not removing eye masks. unlike how in the first movie every character appeared to use their powers to the best of their ability, this time they were only used when convenient to move the plot forward. this movie feels like a cargo cult version of the original, having been run past the engineers at the last minute, to make sure it is functional enough to prove the critics wrong. it's like the modern day equivalent of 100 roadrunner skits end to end. itchy and scratchy has more anticipation, transformers has more character development and shortland street has far more realistic drama. forced, contrived, unimaginative, predictible, just like everything disney makes these days."
"Ashishsinghal97","4","48","98","26 June 2018"," Disappointment.
","Went in with moderate expectations, came out thoroughly disappointed. Fell well short to the now classic predecessor. <br/><br/>The Man gets to do the woman job. He sucks at it first ( of course) but makes everything right by the end. Woman gets the man's job. She is just perfecto. Nothing can be wrong in the hands of a woman. The film relies way too heavily on the baby got powers comedy. It works for a time before getting tiring near the end. There is a major twist too which not a twist but an insult to the basic IQ of today's moviegoers. That happens when a movie with few characters tries to build a mystery around the main villain. Nothing special, no surprises. Just nothing. Highly predictable movie. Only good part is the two big goose bumping action scenes (The Underminer's and the metro rail one). Minus them and the movie is a giant turd in everything. The hype is fake this time around. Can't believe how critics just give free passage to such movies in the name of entertainment. They do more harm then do good by doing so."

","I just came out of the theatre and while watching I generally enjoyed all of the visuals. Now, like I said the plot line is predictable, but, Disney did stay away from some clichÃ©s (such as making the seen villain not the main attraction, which meant they focused more on who was behind it all rather than just scratching the surface). <br/><br/>But, anyway...I was blown away and will definitely be seeing it again.

"Quinoa1984","9","14","24","25 June 2018"," What a sequel should aim to do. Not perfect, but so what
","Yes, it lacks the gigantic heart of the first movie (or the rather adult conflict within the family unit; here, Bob kinda feels like 'damn Im emasculated by my wife' for a scene and a half, but then thats dropped because Super-Baby, who is never not funny and steals the show in a fight with a raccoon, takes center stage in the sub-plot), but so what? Brad Bird is 5 for 6 (and even the weakest one is still pretty good), and shows why he's one of the vital comedy/action filmmakers around. I also dug how for a few scenes this kind of turned into hypnosis-laden V for Vendetta for kids (when it is already a bit like Fantastic Four meets Watchmen for kids).<br/><br/>I kept wondering who the voice of Eleanor was; when I saw in the credits it's Catherine Keener, it suddenly makes sense why the character for the first two thirds of the movie moves exactly like Keener does. I also found there's a point Elastigirl and Eleanor have a conversation about gender roles and it suddenly occurred to me, ""wait... This is happening in *this* movie? Will anyone point to this movie being woke as a heart attack?"

"escobedojason","9","9","14","18 July 2018"," Good
","A lot of people say that the drinking and cussing was not needed, but you have to remember that even though it is pixar, that doesn't mean it always has to follow to rules of being nice at all times. The first incredibles was awesome because it was a little adult. The first one had that action that left people dead. Dash made 2 people crash and possibly die. The villian gets taken into a jet engine. Thats adult. This second film exapands upon that level of seriousness. It is action filled and still has the same stylish tone as the first. Just because people don't like the drinking, it doesn't mean its a bad movie. Just over protective parents who don't want their kids to know about ""adult"" things in a pixar movie."
"Quantom-X","9","12","20","3 October 2018"," Worth the wait
","It's been a long wait. 14 years since the first film and at long last we get the continuation of the story. This movie picks up right where the first one left off. Supers are back in the light and the public opinion is mixed as always with the law not taking too kindly to the Incredibles' efforts.
Honestly with how the movie goes, I can see that their really wasn't much else they could do with the story or where to take it and it still feel like Incredibles and carry the same spirit as the first film. It could easily have just become just another super hero movie with the family stopping some big threat or some other. They went deeper with this story and kept the similar tone of the first, and it works wonderfully. It may be more of nostalgia talking, but the first film still seems to hold up better. Then again I've only seen the sequel once in theaters so far. I was not disappointed and think the movie was wonderful.
Just hopefully we won't have to wait another 14 years for part 3... if we ever get a part 3.<br/><br/>Also. Whats up with the girl Evelyn looking almost identical to Roxanne in Megamind?"
"bsilbor","9","10","16","4 July 2018"," Very good sequel.
","I remember watching The Incredibles back in '04 and was blown away by it. My 40-year-old father was even more excited than I was at the time. I won't fanboy over this sequel, but seeing these characters return as if there wasn't actually a fourteen year gap was a ton of fun and hilarious. I couldn't help but smile. The action scenes and the powers/technologies used in the scenes were so clever and fun and could really only be perfected in animation. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the animation (and this goes without saying, again given the fourteen year gap) was ten steps up from what it was in the original. Frozone's ice powers, Violet's shields, even the hair was incredibly realistic (pun 100% intended).<br/><br/>There were a few slight things I felt could have been improved, though didn't hinder my enjoyment in any way. One is, as stated by many others, the villain. Syndrome was a personal villain going up against Mr. Incredible. A fan-turned-enemy. The Screenslaver was not personal, and their plan seemed a little convoluted and, because we only got a couple minutes of backstory, the motives felt lackluster. Their identity is also a bit predictable, as there are really only two suspects. But one other thing that was lacking, but not absent, was the depth of the characters. Bob Parr was so desparate to get back to heroics, that he totally dismissed his family. When he thought they had died, he realized what he was missing. A character arc like this was not present in this one. I will say, however, that the message the villain plays up is very topical. <br/><br/>Waiting for superheroes to save the day is impractical and dangerous. It's up to normal, everyday people, the ""Joe Shmoes"", to fix the world if it's broken. Because in reality, there won't be a Mr. Incredible, or a Superman, or a Captain America to save the day. We are our own superheroes. We can't wait for a superhero to fix our lives...WE need to fix it ourselves.<br/><br/>I've also noticed quite a few people claiming that the message of the film is that women are superior to men because Elastigirl got the superhero gig and Mr. Incredible was ""stripped of his masculinity"" by becoming a stay-at-home dad. No...it's just that Mr. Incredible had his time to shine in the first one, and now it's Elastigirl's turn. Disney didn't bring gender politics into the movie...you did.<br/><br/>This was a great, but not perfect movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Hopefully it won't take another fourteen years for a third one."
"davispittman","8","10","16","25 June 2018"," Not as good as #1, but still very entertaining
","I am a big fan of the first incredibles film, one of my favorite animated features. It was very well made, and many of the good things they did in the first film is in this one too. I loved the chemistry between all the characters... the same great chemistry from the first. The actors all did great jobs with the voicing of the characters. Helen Parr/Elastagirl really shines here, she is the main focal point throughout the majority of the film, and I was glad she was because its so entertaining to see Helen kick butt, and it was fun to see Bob/mr incredible have to stay home and try his best alone with the kids. Being alone with them proves very hard, especially when Jack Jack starts experimenting with his powers... Which leads to some very funny moments. The villain was voiced well (Catherine Keener), this is a spoiler but honestly I could who the villain was early on... I think Evelyn was a pretty good villain, not the best I've seen but still pretty good. The first incredibles is nearly impossible to live up to completely... and this sequel doesn't but its still a really good film and a worthy sequel. 8/10 for Incredibles 2."
"kressckerl","8","11","18","21 October 2018"," Good action scenes, bad villain, non-solid plot
","I am gonna try not to spoil too much, at least here in the start. I think this movie had a lot more potential than was included in the package. The plot was predictable, no emotion in the villain like the prequel, and the characters were bland and boring. But it wasn't all that bad, it scored a solid 8 from me after all, I liked the part with the stay-at-home dad, though it was really funny. And the action scenes were cool and entertaining.<br/><br/>Spoiler past this point -------------(I am bad at separating spoiler-content from non-spoiler content)<br/><br/>As said above, the villain is super bland and extremely predictable, and as soon as the siblings invited the Super' characters, I knew something fishy was going on, thus I already had the siblings as prime suspects in my villain investigation. When Helen captures ""The Screenslaver"", I was honestly not sure if it was meant to try to fool the viewers into thinking it actually was The Screenslaver, but I thought it was dumb how Helen didn't stop to think for a second that, that could have been the case.<br/><br/>Even tho I didn't like the plot nor the villain I still found the movie entertaining, at first when I exited the cinema I could not decide wheater the first movie or this one was best, but I can now."

"littlemankazoo","4","232","546","15 June 2018"," Tremendously disappointing
","Let me spin you a bit of a Greek tragedy here; Coming back to a world and characters I loved 14 years ago when I saw the original at my 8th birthday party, only to discover something terrible.<br/><br/>I'm not going to sugarcoat it: Incredibles 2 was IMMENSELY disappointing.<br/><br/>Even as I sat in the middle of a dark theater, filled to the brim with people who were laughing and enjoying a film that seemed to turn so many nostalgia dials in the room...I just could not join them in letting my nostalgia glasses take control.<br/><br/>Because, in the end, with nostalgia put aside, this is a HEAVILY flawed film, and considering it's something of this magnitude, I simply can't let that slide.<br/><br/>So, with that said, let's slip our Nostalgia Goggles OFF for a moment, and let's begin...shall we?<br/><br/>'Incredibles 2' has been hyped for lord knows how long, as it is perhaps one of the few worlds that Pixar (And Brad Bird as well) created that had something to build-upon and create something new and different with a second installment. Unlike films like 'Cars 2' or 'Monsters University', a sequel truly felt necessary in a world where the market has become so saturated with superhero films. With all that considered, it seemed like a no-brainer that another Incredibles film could work in this current landscape and provide a new outlook on the genre of superhero films, just as the original film did back in 2004.<br/><br/>Only problem is, I think they forgot to write a new film.<br/><br/>My main gripe with 'Incredibles 2' is just how recycled and empty the entire experience feels. The film, without any self-awareness or irony about it, essentially carbon copies most of the plot-threads from the original film, only switching it up to provide parallels to the original. While this could have worked if executed cleverly, we instead receive these same plot points, played-out by different characters, but lacking most of the depth the first film.<br/><br/>The film intends to use Helen as the main character this time, which initially intrigued me in that it was an interesting twist on the original to give Elastigirl the main action/conflict and giving Bob the family struggle after we saw his story told in the original. Instead, however, we get a Helen sub-plot that feels so half-baked and without any depth to it, it truly might as well have just been pulled from the film and we would not have lost much.<br/><br/>None of the conflict of the original film is present. The themes of family and the struggles that come with being that are so surface level it borders on the cliche in some respects. Helen is given NOTHING to be her own character in this, and instead is given action scenes to play-out and a sub-plot that only serves to remind me how much better the first film was. Rather than giving us a great and in-depth character plot for Helen, we get something so weak and honestly regressive for how hard this film brandishes itself to be a feminist advocate that I would dare say it's offensive how shallow Helen's character arc and story comes off in this.<br/><br/>Bob's story arc doesn't fare much better. The concept of flipping the script and giving him the family to run and learning how to be a proper father on his own is an interesting way to parallel the first film and the story it gave him...but instead, we are only given small glimpses at the depth this story can provide.<br/><br/>Instead, make way for funny comic relief Jack-Jack scenes! Watch him fight a cartoon raccoon for 5 minutes! Watch everyone try to take care of the baby for 5 minutes! Funny poop joke! Funny baby sound!<br/><br/>Hopefully, you're beginning to see my point. This film, for all its attempts to TRY and prove it has depth and a reason to exist, lacks all the depth of the first film and lacks a reason to truly exist.<br/><br/>I found myself asking, at some point in the theater, ""Why does this film NEED to exist?"". Why did this story need to be told? What does this story tell us that the first one couldn't?<br/><br/>I think the answer is simply this; this film exists because it was going to make money.<br/><br/>This film feels so unnecessary in the thick of things. After 14 years, you mean to tell me you cannot do anything better than copying the plot of the first film, then writing a screenplay that lacks any of the depth from the original? You can't give us a compelling, introspective story about Helen dealing with being an extremely famous superhero AND a mother? You can't give us a deep story regarding Bob balancing being a father and his wish to be a superhero again? You can't give us ANY reason to invest emotionally into this film?<br/><br/>That, quite frankly, is frustrating beyond belief.<br/><br/>Not everything is bad in this film, much as I am deriding it. In fact, there IS a lot of fantastic stuff in this. The animation looks spectacular in every scene, the action scenes are actually tremendous to watch and were the few times I had my eyes glued to the screen, and the brass-y and jazz-y score by Michael Giacchino is just as excellent as the first film's. Indeed, there ARE great things in this film.<br/><br/>However...if you're going to make us wait 14 years to do something new with this endlessly-interesting world you built, you need to do something NEW and INTERESTING with a sequel like this. Not copy the first film, attempt weak commentary that has already been done better in other media, and expect us not to notice otherwise.<br/><br/>I'm tremendously disappointed in Brad Bird. I'm tremendously disappointed with Pixar. But most of all, I'm tremendously disappointed with 'Incredibles 2'.<br/><br/>But hey...at least we still have the first film, right?"
"sikdogsshaq","4","83","184","17 June 2018"," Glad the first Incredibles movie was made 14 years ago and not today
","Saw it last night with my wife and two kids(3 and 5). Kids really laughed only at Jack Jack. Certainly not the level of amazement and immersion we experienced watching the the first Incredibles. I saw the first one back in the day and then just last week on video with my kids, just to prepare for Incredibles 2. Sorry to say i was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>Pros:
1. Animation and action scenes were amazing
2. The few times the family worked together to fight the bad guys.
3. Jack-Jack<br/><br/>Cons(some, not all):
1. Before the movie started, why did they show the voice actors introducing the movie and ""telling"" us we'll love it? they are all old. That kinda messed me up since the movie continued in the parking lot after Dash's track meet where they were still young(2004). So my image of the parents and kids would still be those of where the first film left off. I love Holly Hunter, but their faces messed me up for like the first 30 min. but then i forgot about the intro.<br/><br/>2. The villain(unknown to Helen) and Helen drinking alcohol when they got together. Just seemed strange for a kids movie and was like they were trying to tell us that women need to relax and drink too.<br/><br/>3. Sequences with the kids: Bob being completely defeated caring for the kids. the kids disrespecting him all the time. I understand that is normal adolescent behavior, but why do they portray him as a total weakling.<br/><br/>4. Forced diversity: the fricken green haired hero, i also saw a pink haired one, what was that big Brick ""they"" hero? The possessed bad guy heroes looked skinny and wimpy. And the old guy with vomit acid reflex powers? It wasn't funny.<br/><br/>5. Probably shouldn't be a con by a guys standard, but Helen's curvy figure was distracting. it was like she was drawn to be super hot(with bigger boobs in some scenes) but still be a powerful mother..or something. Although hot, it didn't help the story.<br/><br/>6. Weak villain. <br/><br/>It wouldn't be a waste to see it at the movie theatre. just don't expect that you'll leave the theatre fulfilled like you did with the first movie."

Second let down...making Mr. Incredible a complete idiot for 90% of the movie. I am ok with giving Elastigirl the spotlight since Mr. Incredible had his time in the first movie. I am ok with him being a stay at home dad. The fact that this movie depicts him as an idiot incapable of raising his own children, and pretty much a boob, was just a little too PC for me. Third...the intentional use and mention of alcohol by Elastigirl and the villain. I am not opposed to alcohol, but I have a hard time with it presented like an enticing advertisement in a kids film.

"msaofspc","3","64","140","19 June 2018"," Generally speaking...
","I intend by writing this review just so that others who feel likewise can know that you are not alone in thinking/feeling this way. It's been a couple years since I watched a movie in theaters. Some things which stuck out for me were that the sounds were way too loud in theaters and the pictures were way too stimulating, the movements were too quick, and the plot, dialogue, etc. felt very empty of meaning or purpose. It was just a stimulation fest, and it didn't leave me feeling very peaceful afterwards, especially combined with the fact that I was eating sugary treats during the movie. I don't intend by saying this to be a hater, but actually a lover of people, genuinely wanting good things for you. I feel the younger generation may be getting overstimulated, over-distracted. I think they may be unnaturally unable to keep focus and attention and this is disturbing their psychology and peace. A person must know their meaning in life and purpose, not just be fed with pseudo-purpose superhero cliche films filled with stimulating light/color shows. The film should have shown the super-heroes as having super moral character, which would be an inspiration and very pleasant to watch. There should be an underlying guiding theme/moral point of the story that should put the characters to the test and the characters must teach us how to pass those tests. There was some of that only. I just highly recommend people stop watching most of the movies out there. The villain in this movie actually did mention a good point - that we're glued to the tv sets and our couches and are not really living our lives. It's because we're just intaking stimulants over and over to put ourselves in a state of forgetfulness. I'm just saying to you and myself, that be moderate, enjoy just enough, but find the meaning and purpose of existence - you need to if you want to be happy. A person needs to find our their purpose in life and how to have a good relationship with their Creator, with family, friends, their community and world, as well as working to provide for their family and improving their skills/talents. These are needs that should be aimed for otherwise one will not really be happy, and no amount of stimulants/drugs/movies will make up for it. This movie might not be preventing you from all that, but at least if it was made differently I believe it could truly inspire you to work on the steps to make yourself successful, rather than just entertaining you and leaving you all stimulated up with less peace."

","I've waited patiently for 14 years for the sequel to my all-time favorite animated film and I'm excited to say, it was well worth the wait; I just hope I don't have to wait another 14 years for a follow up. It did a great job of balancing comedy, drama, the action scenes were spectacular and I LOVED the new supers they added to the franchise; Sophia Bush's Voyd was my favorite out of the new characters, she was dope. Everyone had a moment to shine but Jack Jack was, hands down, the MVP of this movie. I'm going to see this film at least 2 more times in the theater. Bravo, Brad Bird; you did it again!!!"
"benraddon87","3","23","46","31 July 2018"," Typical sequel of the lousy modern day.
","I was mostly entertained by this. On YouTube there is a video which talks about this movie and the video was called the Rise of Feminism, I figured it was just someone trolling. Nope. 
Some of this movie was entertaining, 'some', but after watching it and thinking more about it, and looking at other reviews, I saw that it was right. Only if you're not paying attention at all, even when you're being bashed over the head with this would you not notice. 
The action was impressive, but Elastigirl feels like a Spider-man rip off, she pretty much just does what he would do, and men who are made to look useless and stomped on.
In a way I'm glad I have watched this so I can from my own opinion, but it's unlikely I'll be watching this again. I'm done with movies which force political agendas instead of just giving us qualify entertainment, that's why I've stopped bothering with the new Star Wars franchise, and I'm sticking with the classic originals. 
Anything else wrong with this movie has already been covered in other reviews.
One last thing for any ladies who are reading this to think about...if a movie was released with the deliberate underlying message that woman are idiots, would you watch it? I highly doubt it, chances are you would be deeply offended."
"Jared_Andrews","7","68","156","19 June 2018"," A satisfying sequel the whole family will enjoy
","Fourteen years after the original, writer/director Brad Bird returns to helm the second installment of The Incredibles. The movie landscape has changed greatly since then. Many moviegoers may not realize that The Incredibles came out four years before Iron-Man, which launched the ""Marvel MCU."" <br/><br/>So, for any fans who love superhero movies, don't just thank Robert Downey Jr. for kicking things off. Thank Brad Bird. For fans who are tired of the oversaturation of superhero movies, still thank Brad Bird because The Incredibles is a truly wonderful film.<br/><br/>The sequel doesn't quite reach the lofty standard of the original, which would have been nearly impossible, what with the originality and seminal nature of film, the characters and the exceptional villain. <br/><br/>But Incredibles 2 does boast improvements to the visuals. I advise you to sit relatively close and take a good look at the detail of every scene. The lighting, the color, the movement-it's all immaculate. In a visual sense, this movie is a marvelous achievement. <br/><br/>The weakest aspect of the movie is the villain. The villain is obvious, predictable and unclear in his or her ideology. I get the sense that all the necessary pieces were there, but the filmmakers couldn't quite put together the puzzle. <br/><br/>Fear not, the villain's shortcomings are certainly not enough to spoil the movie. It has the appropriate blend of action, thoughtful commentary for the adults and silly jokes for the kids. <br/><br/>I opted not to mention the plot at all because I thought, ""why bother?"" The Incredibles have to stop a villain, and they also deal with other issues. Great, you get it. Now go see this movie."
"bullmoosebell","1","10","17","19 May 2019"," Disney's attempt to be PC-woke
","Way to push an agenda, Disney. We know women are great, no need to ruin a sequel to reflect that fact.
This film had so much potential to be an adequate sequel to one of the greatest animated superhero movies of all time. But the politically-correct undertones were more like Progressive overtures. As a result the agenda they're pushing detracted from an otherwise medeocre movie.
Beyond that; there are situations that kids don't understand and some language is not suitable for children (Mr. Incredible quoting Rocky, ""I Eat Thunder and Crap Lightning!). The action is sporatic, no real pattern or anticipation and nothing to really keep children interested. This movie is more of an attempt to teach people that women are better than men than to entertain children.
With the obvious programming this movie promulgates, I expect to see Michael Moore in the end credits of Incredibles 3."
"CriticalOfEverything","8","10","17","28 July 2018"," A little bit below the original, but still an absolute blast!
","Whilst I didn't expect it to top the original, I can safely say that Incredibles 2 is a little bit below, but in terms of enjoyment I'd say it's about on par.<br/><br/>The story sort of follows the same structure of the original, but still has enough new ideas to make it stand out as different.<br/><br/>The writing is funnier than the original, hell sometimes it's outrageously funny. But it's still pretty dark at points like the original, so you don't have to worry if you think The Incredibles has been dumbed down to a full on comedy.<br/><br/>There's a lot more action than the original, which is a good thing because it IS a superhero movie, but it isn't completely filled to the brim with ongoing action so there's time for actual storytelling and plot progression.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely fantastic. It's stunningly detailed, expressive and stylish. Just like the first Incredibles, actually, except the fact that Incredibles 2 is obviously going to look grander than it's predecessor from 14 years ago.<br/><br/>The characters are still great and they haven't changed a bit, all of them are just as lovable as before. But the new villain, Screenslaver, is quite a disappointment. Screenslaver's a decent villain, but when compared to Syndrome there's a clear step down. Plus, the twist for who Screenslaver is is very predictable and I could see it coming a mile away.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fantastic, it's great to hear the Incredibles theme again after so long and it's used in different styles to match the scene now. <br/><br/>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I thought that because modern Pixar is a bit of a mess that I'd get a cash grab but it instead I got a well made and excellent movie that deserves the 2 in it's title. I will just address the whole feminism thing people say it's promoting. YES, there's a slight feminist message that you can only see if you really dig deep for it. But unlike that of the new Star Wars movies, it isn't shoved down your throat and is more ''equal treatment'' than ''kill all the white men'' so stop saying it's propaganda, coming from a male by the way."
"ssnake_z","6","5","7","21 August 2019"," Elastigirl: The Movie
","INCREDIBLES 2
RATING: 3.2/5<br/><br/>Honestly, this should have been called ""ELASTIGIRL: THE MOVIE"" because she's really the main star. The rest of the Incredibles family takes a back seat to her, so much so that you barely even get to see the family suit up, much less work together as a real team. Dash suffers the most out of the family in that regard. If you're looking for character development, it's not really here outside Mr. Incredible learning how to be a stay at home dad, and even that's questionable. Frozone gets more screen time, so he's not just the token Black guy this time around. The villain is pretty meh by the end of it, and if you give their evil plan more than a passing thought, it ends up being pretty dumb and pointless overall.<br/><br/>This film is basically a time capsule, being that it takes place pretty much right after the first Incredibles movie. After 14 years, 3 Presidents, and 10 years of Marvel Studios superhero movies, Incredibles 2 needed to be way more than just a run of the mil sequel. This may have worked when they were at the top of the superhero mountain in 2004, but they've been lapped by so many other superhero movies now that this really doesn't cut it in 2018. Add to that the fact that they're still on the whole superheroes being illegal thing, which Captain America Civil War covered much, much better, and Incredibles 2 just ends up feeling outdated.<br/><br/>The score is pretty fantastic though. It's loud, it's bombastic, very 60s James Bond but with a superhero flair to it. The voice acting is solid with Mr. Incredible being the MVP with all the range of emotions he has to go through. The animation is great, no surprise there from Pixar. The action is pretty fast paced and serviceable, but for some reason, i just wasn't impressed by it. I really don't know how many other ways Hollywood can shoot a runaway train scene. It also didn't help that the first fight just reminded me how much of a Fantastic Four ripoff The Incredibles are too. I chuckled twice during the whole film, but my theater laughed a lot, so the jokes were clearly working on some level.<br/><br/>One of the other issues is that there are really no clear positive male figures in the film. Mr. Incredible is relegated to a stay at home dad, and he can't even figure that out on his own. Mrs. Incredible though, she can apparently do it all. In fact, almost every female in this film is infallible, while almost every male has some character flaw or has messed something up somehow. It's really weird. Like, the movie props up the women at the expense of the men, which i think sends a bad message.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a few laughs, action, and to go back to 2004, you'll probably have a great time with Incredibles 2. If you're looking for a good story, good villain, balanced positive male and female figures, and a superhero team that actually practices teamwork, then you should probably look elsewhere. Outside the animation, music and jokes, the movie fails on almost every other front and that's just unacceptable after 14 years. Beware the hype with this movie, cause it simply does not live up to the first Incredibles, at least not for me, not by a long shot."

"highmarksreviews","9","8","13","12 July 2018"," Fourteen years? Worth it!
","The Incredibles 2 has finally arrived and after a long wait does what few sequels can and probably should. It lives to the hype in the best of ways possible. Worth noting is that this movie might just be one of Pixar's most visually stunning and vibrantly animated pieces yet and that just adds extra atmosphere. The cast is terrific, with welcome returns from fan favourites giving solid performances to the franchise's fully realised characters. The story is simple, yet interesting and has several side elements that are incorporated very well. The idea of a larger superhero world and their legality is discussed with a narrative that is surprisingly mature and conscious of the message it wants to convey. The action and overall spectacle is beautiful and creative, even if its not as large-scale or grand as the first one. I will say though, Incredibles 2 has gorgeous scenery, an awesome cast and a great story, but it has a villain problem. ScreenSlaver isn't really connected to the world in any meaningful way and ends up being a one-off baddie with only a few memorable moments. But, in the end, the movie is still a win, and manages to tie up loose ends from the first and open up new doors for possible new instalments, which I honestly hope are yet to come.
 
The good: Visual design and clean animation, Performances from the cast, Good story that tied into the original, Great new characters as well as recurring older ones, Creative and vibrant action sequences<br/><br/>The bad: Main villain is a little off and forgettable, Some characters may feel a little under-utilised at times"

"patboldt","9","7","11","27 June 2018"," 14 Years but Not Too Late
","Going into this movie I expected to see a film that just outright sucked. Too much time had passed, the voice actors had to change, the hype was going to be too great and there was no way it would please expectations which would be way too demanding. Then, when I heard this film was really good I thought that people might be overreacting and just saying it's great when really it wasn't. This is how I thought, this is how I was trained to think. Well? <br/><br/>They're damn right! This film was awesome! It was on par with the original! It was super! <br/><br/>In an age of superhero movies you'd think that they wouldn't be able to get it right with a sequel for a movie that came out 14 years ago.Yet they did, Brad Bird scored again! The key to this film's success is the pacing and flow. The movie feels very upbeat with energetic action and an engaging story. It has some quiet moments for storytelling but it never feels like the story comes to a halt. There is also plenty of humor but unlike say the Marvel movies it feels natural and doesn't come from dumb one liners but instead from slapstick and funny writing and a few running gags. This helps the story maintain a fast beat and the audience is almost always invested. <br/><br/>The only real downside is that the villain is not nearly as good as the villain in the first movie. I don't wanna get into spoiler territory but it isn't as memorable or as entertaining as Syndrome (the first villain in these films). Once you watch it you'll see why. With that said, this is more than made up for with the family dynamic. This film continues the great family that we got a taste of in the first movie and devokes so much time into it. The only detracting flaw from the first movie that kinda pulls people away is the fact that a lot of the movie (at least in the beginning) deals with Mr. Incredibles mid-life crisis and not the family dynamic. But this wasn't a problem since this allowed him to be the main character and thus we feel a closer connection to him than we would with Elastigirl. Well, now it's full circle. Even if the first film has the better villain, this film gets the better family so it's pretty even. <br/><br/>Holly Hunter, how do I say it, damn well killed it. She is so good in this movie! I had my doubts and I kinda expected her character to be a step backwards but she felt really natural. The perfect family dynamic from the first movie is preserved and even expanded on and Elastigirl is no exception. Also really liked Mr. Incredible who was my second favorite character from the last movie (Syndrome was number one). He goes through a pretty convincing arc and he is still a great father character, something that had become rare in animation today. The kids are great too, including Jack Jack who is hilarious as ever, and though Dash has a different voice actor (which I know is unavoidable) I am very pleased that it sounds so similar to the original and my suspension of disbelief was preserved. <br/><br/>Go watch this movie, it's worth the wait and really fun to watch. If you loved the original you'll love this movie too. It's great. Super great. 9/10. Really fun to watch."

","Incredibles 2 was smart, action packed, visually stunning, and HILARIOUS! It's everything you expect from a Pixar movie minus the tears. Actually, scratch that. The nostalgia and the genuinely funny moments will make you cry of pure joy. I personally loved seeing these lovable characters fight their way through super villain mayhem on once again. Incredibles 2 takes place right where the original left off, so expect to jump right into the action. Some of these action scenes were so flawless and exciting that I could've sworn they were taken straight from a Marvel or DC movie. However, Pixar still managed to create original action sequences by using the Parr family's abilities in many creative and innovative new ways. The animation, lighting, and surface texturing was also something to marvel at. From the individual strands of Dash's hair to the wrinkles on Mr. Incredible's clothes, this movie was a detailed filled masterpiece. When using the word ""masterpiece,"" I must also mention Michael Giacchino's brilliant score. The Incredibles theme was brought back for this film and used in so many exciting new ways. You can tell Giacchino loved experimenting with this powerful score that he wrote over a decade ago. Be prepared for many laugh out loud moments in this movie as well. Jack Jack will melt you heart in one moment and make whatever you're drinking come out of your nose in the next moment. He really does steal the show. From a nostalgic stand point, this film did not disappoint. It hit all of the marks of a successful movie sequel and as a Pixar Fan, I couldn't be happier. All in all, this movie is a blast and will probably be amongst the top 5 movies of the summer. It DEFINITELY lives up to the original and some might even say it's better."

I feel like this is what is wrong with the world and what the world's norm is becoming. Why do you have to have ""I'll be damned"" in the movie, can you not think of another saying? It's as if now it is ok for children to use these ""light"" cuss words. And, yes I did see that someone also posted a seizure warning which I can totally see because there is a LOT of flashing. The movie was too long and the only thing I can say good is that it was action so it did keep my attention most of the time."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","12","22","22 June 2018"," A Great Sequel but Just Falls Short of Incredible
","The animation in the original was great but this movie took it another leap forward. Having seen the original so many times, it took me a bit to adjust to it, but the movie never ceased to beautiful or have something imaginative. The attention to detail is insane (Bird has a reputation for being nitpicky, so much so that the animators of the original partially modelled the character Syndrome after him) and there was never a moment was I wasn't impressed or even blown away by how stunning this movie was. Adding on top of that, I would stack the action scenes in this movie up against any modern superhero blockbuster. They are thrilling, and I would even say astounding. My favourite was the runaway train scene. I hate to keep playing the same note, but I think the visual style in Incredibles 2 is as impressive if not more than any animated movie I've seen in the past couple of years. I also understand the worry about triggering epilepsy because one of the fights features a lot of flashing lights. I thought it was a sensational scene but the warning is warranted.<br/><br/>Moving from the animation to the characters, Bird and his team do a good job developing the familiar and introducing the new. Instead of Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) being the main character, the focus shifts to Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter). I was worried when I saw the trailer, not because Helen was the hero, she's a great character and my trepidation was never about the story having a feminist slant. But the husband not being able to handle the family duties is a tired thing, it's been done over and over and this movie calling attention to it seemed counterproductive. Is anyone offended by a stay-at-home dad? It was a temporary arrangement and I feel like we've gotten past that being weird. Anyway, Elastigirl is a great hero and her narrative was compelling. I liked how she bounced off of her new corporate backers Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) and while those character play to the actor's strengths (Winston isn't Saul Goodman but he's not too far off), they had plenty of personality. I'll talk more about Bob later, but I also liked how Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Huck Milner) hugged the line between having issues yet not being too bratty. Violet is pretty moody throughout the course of the movie, but they give her a nice moment near the end that compensates. Luscius/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is a funny returning character but he drifts in and out of the movie, I would have liked him to have more screen time. Everyone's favourite characters are back in Edna Mode (Brad Bird) and Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack was a riot and I loved almost every second we got to spend with him. Edna stole the show in the original and while she doesn't get more screen time, her appearance is pitch perfect. They go with the less is more plan with her and she's just as effective as Bob's suit designer/confidant. <br/><br/>
Looking back on the trailer, a lot of the more annoying moments actually ended up being some of the better bits of the movie. Bob trying to handle Jack-Jack's endlessly varied power set was hilarious and although the movie centres around Elastigirl, the war on the home front occupied my attention completely. I still did find some minor problems however. Incredibles 2 shows off Helen's abilities superbly and she capably anchors the film. But on the downside, I thought the movie betrayed Bob's abilities as a superhero. He defeated a robot in the original that killed dozens of other heroes, yet he can't handle someone who has never tested their abilities in the field? I approve that the movie put Mr. and Mrs. Incredible on more equal footing (I'm also good with Helen being the more professional hero which is what Incredibles 2 seems to insinuate) but they didn't have to bring Bob down to build up Helen. I wish we had gotten more opportunities to see the family fight together as a team. As the trailer shows, the family each has their moments but rarely as a group. It doesn't detract from the action but the fight scenes with the group together were wonderful in the original and I wanted more of that. I would also comment that a lot of the subtext is going to fly over a younger kid's head. Its nice that they include adult friendly banter about complex issues, all the best family movies can appeal both to adults and kids. But I doubt kids are going to understand much of the debate that fuels the villain's motivations. <br/><br/>I watched the original entry before going to see this and it only inflated high expectations. The Incredibles is a masterpiece and it should be regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made. This movie had a lot to live up to and despite some minor stumbles, I think Incredibles 2 comes close. It boasts some phenomenal action, the animation is top notch and while some of the story elements were better handled then others, I still left the theatre impressed. At worst, I took a couple of small issues with the progression of some of the characters, which is a relatively minor complaint. If you've been waiting for another adventure with the Incredibles, I think you're going to be pleased. Pixar makes phenomenal movies when they're firing on all cylinders and this movie is no exception. I highly recommend this to fans of the original and newcomers alike."

","The 14 year wait was worth it. I was thoroughly entertained for the entire runtime. The characters are what we remembered them to be, the action was fun and the plot was entertaining. Adding more supers to the movie allowed for some unique fight scenes and new story arcs. The Screenslaver was a good villain who was menacing enough with good reasons for being evil. However I wish the Screenslaver would have done a little more during the action scenes but I'm fine with what they did. I also would have liked them to play with our emotions a bit more during the 3rd act. The music was as good as the original and the ending was really satisfying."

","I saw the villain and the ending coming a mile away, so much so that it distracted me from the rest of the film. I kept begging them not to take the story down that road, that it's tired and unoriginal, and they did it.<br/><br/>And worst of all, they completely blew it when the time came to giving the villain a captivating motivation. Like when Ozymandias of The Watchmen wanted to frame Manhattan for the destruction to avoid nuclear holocaust. He gave a final speech that made you question your morality. The Screenslaver is clearly meant to be the adult messaging in the movie, a critique on society's obsession with technology and the draining effect it has on our lives. But we never really have that reckoning, and the villain is silently vanquished.<br/><br/>The denouement of Screenslaver was just lame. Very surface level villain stuff. Compare that to the outstanding never-meet-your-heroes betrayal plot of the first Incredibles, you see why this villain falls short.<br/><br/>It was also unbelievable that Bob Parr is such a terrible dad. He's been parenting for like 14 years now? But thumbs his nose at changing a diaper? Dude has three kids.<br/><br/>I'm so hard on this movie because the first Incredibles was one of the best Pixar movies ever and it should have lived up to its pedigree. Finding Dory was worthy, why not Incredibles 2?"
"chrisrs123","8","2","2","28 March 2020"," Incredible!
","A great superhero adventure with a real human side to it, rendered beutifull by Pixar just like the first one. It's a bit more predictable and less original but it's a great sequel. Screen-Slaver was a great creepy villain (although the twist was obvious) and Elast-Girl is brilliant as the hero lead. Meanwhile Mr Incredible takes on the family side of the film and seeing his struggles as a dad are hilarious and heartwarming. There isn't an out of place feminist message like some people claimed, they just play with gender roles a bit and dare to have a female character in a lead role. Really enjoyed this film, would recommend."
"snowfre","7","2","2","12 March 2020"," Incredibly entertaining but suffering somewhat from an ""all over"" synopsis
","The wait is finally over, everybody's favorite superhero family (The Fantastic Four aren't related by blood) is back. And it's been a wait. Similarly to ""Finding Dory"", a whole generation has anticipated ""Incredibles 2"". So how was it? First of all, I think the script is extremely well-written and I must highlight the way director Brad Bird approached the conflicts within the Parr family. For an animated film, the character arcs are polished to almost perfect, and throughout the film, we get to follow each family member's individual emotional journey. All of that being said, I think the plot of the film itself was somewhat uninteresting. The main reason behind my opinion is that it is somewhat unfocused; of course you could combine Mr. Incredible's stay-at-home dad storyline with the main plot featuring Elastigirl and the conspiracies at Devtech, but ""Incredibles 2"" easily comes out of phase, leaving its speedy, action atmosphere suffering. However, let's not forget that it is an entertaining film, animated to perfection. And it is incredibly nice (yes I chose that word on purpose) to see these old favorites back on the big screen. While ""Incredibles 2"" might no be the biggest Pixar hit to date - partly due to its length - it is a joyful, vibrant, action packed film to watch."

I felt that we could've gotten a deeper dive into Violet's character instead and it would've been better."

","Following on from events of the first film the authorities still believe the damage caused by supers is more expensive than the cost of the original crimes. Wealthy businessman Winston Deaver wants to bring back the superheroes so, along with his sister Evelyn, an inventor, proposes to have Elastigirl be recorded fighting crime. She is selected as she causes the least collateral damage. She is soon successful in preventing a disaster and identifies a new villain... the 'Screen Slaver'. This individual is able to hypnotise anybody looking at a controlled TV screen. Meanwhile Mr Incredible is babysitting the children; something that becomes difficult as baby Jack-Jack's powers start to emerge; if that weren't enough daughter Violet is having boy problems. Ultimately the family will have to work together again if they are to defeat the Screen Slaver and save the reputations of those with super powers.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the original film so was a little nervous that this might prove a disappointment... while I don't think it is quite as good as the first I still think it is a great film. I liked how it followed on from the events of the original before leading into the new story. While the ultimate identity of the Screen Slaver probably won't surprise too many viewers that isn't really a problem... I'm sure younger viewers will enjoy identifying the villain before our protagonists. Having Mr Incredible and Elastigirl separate for much of the film worked effectively; she got to showcase her abilities in exciting chases and fights while he provided more comic moments as he struggles to cope with the children's various needs. More laughs are provided by Jack-Jack; especially as he battles a racoon that was raiding their rubbish bin. Later on there is a good sense of danger but nothing too scary for younger viewers. As one would expect from Pixar the animation is spectacular, especially during the action scenes. The voice cast does a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to all fans of animation looking for a great family film."

"neonadventure","6","2","2","16 June 2019"," Incredibles 2 Movie Review (SPOILERS AHEAD.)
","Summary: The film is takes place right after the first one did. They fight against the Underminer, which they did already with Mr. Incredible and Frozone in ""The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer"" (2005). But they change the ending of that game just to continue on obviously which is good because the game only has Mr. Incredible and Frozone to play as and NOTHING ELSE. Then they get in trouble for destroying a Government building and then they have to live in a motel after the aftermaths of the Underminer attacks. (kaboom) Eventually, Frozone comes and talks to Bob and Helen Parr about a guy who wants to help all three of them bring back supers into justice again.<br/><br/>Thoughts: I was happy at first, and now I wish that the third will be stronger than this stale piece of bread. Oh sorry, did I offend you, well everyone has opinions too you know. (I didn't offend you right?) Why do I think this movie is bad, well because the movie has a bad storytelling. In a way it's like you see an intense crime fighting scene, and then you see some father having an emotional breakdown over his new math book. Well that's not the point actually, the point was that there are no major plot twists that ever shock you, you just know that, ""Ok, something doesn't feel right and then that lady who doesn't sleep just puts a mask over her head and she's like 'I'm so sorry little one.'"" And I kind of felt like this was a little weak since most of the stuff that goes in the movie kind of copies off of the other film. I really thought having that ending was just bad.<br/><br/>Seriously, this film isn't that great as I expected. There are a few mistakes that I have noticed throughout the film and the story isn't powerful and there isn't anything new to explore. (Hey guys look at my basement, it's empty.)<br/><br/>Although Incredibles 2 does have positive ratings from many critics, it is one of the most disappointing films for me this year when it comes to movies that came out in 2018. (NINJAGO MOVIE) The 1st film is where the Parr family deal with mediocrity as the main theme of both of the films. Well Incredibles 2 is the just a synonym for mediocrity.<br/><br/>My dark predictions will ruin your day. There might not even be a INCREDIBLES 3 movie unless if they have a plot twist. (But it's going to be useless to add in a plot twist.) This movie is where Brad Bird is like, ""You've watched the 2nd, i'm finished."""

The animation improvement and higher budget is well utilized and noticeable. This film has heart thanks to Brad Bird's excellent writing and directing. The villain is standard but the best aspect of the film is when the family just behaves like a family. The voice actors are great as it does feel like a direct continuation of the original, Dash is the only character with a voice actor change, and you wouldn't even notice. The score is excellent by Michael Giacchino. This movie is great and I could not recommend it more."

The sequel has virtually the same plot, which is a bit of a letdown but the movie is just as entertaining, just as fun. Jack-Jack is the stand-out, he is an absolute delight and it is exciting to uncover all of his superpowers. There are plenty of superheroes with cool powers. The animation is spectacular. The theme-music made me feel like a child again. The makers take the nostalgia and add something to it. My only issue with it is the villain, Who is underwhelming.

Of course these animated films aim to create believable personalities and behaviours that are acted to a high standard. Unfortunately for me this film just doesn't achieve this, most noticeably with Mr.Incredible.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like I'm just watching someone overact every emotion possible, distracting through every conversation and even being flat-out annoying in certain scenes.<br/><br/>The pacing is also off, the entire first half of the film feels like everyone's on cocaine. Where are the pauses? The contemplation before an answer? Nowhere.<br/><br/>Still, it's admirable to see Pixar aiming for a down to earth, emotional films with action sequences often just about making up for the disjointed conversational scenes, also the twist in the story is decent and I for one did not make a correct prediction which is always nice.<br/><br/>
Bottom Line:<br/><br/>If you've not even seen the first film, you'll probably love this.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the first film you'll probably enjoy this.<br/><br/>If you're a super fan of the first film, this second instalment will remind you why."

And I haven't even seen the second one so what the hell am I writing a review about?! Well, my fan-boy 10 out of ten is actually for the trailer and the short that Pixar made by cutting it out of the original. Jack-Jack is just perfect, and hilarious; I love the delighted/amused look on his face when he discovers he has laser sight for the first time -lets hope the kid doesn't have allergies when he grows up or he'll be sneezing and blowing off people's heads off left and right every spring.
This review does deserve a ""no helpful"" rating since I'm really just saying they did Jack-Jack perfectly - whoever did the animation for his character deserves a big fat bonus for their work - I'm going to see the movie in a theater and will buy it from Amazon just to see him discover his powers - which are awesome by the way - and the music when he ignites is a perfect match also.
I'm sure this is going to be one of the rare ""Im going to see it 14 or 15 times"" movies - which is saying a lot because lately I haven't even been able to watch through the entire movie of the last few that I was looking forward to but they turned out horrible new release movies that have been released.

"tannithcattermole","6","12","23","2 November 2018"," STILL reinforcing gender stereotypes
","My partner expected me to like this film, given that it's got a lot of 'gender equality' in it. Erm, no, it hasn't. In fact, in many ways it serves to reinforce those messages.
Some examples:
<ul><li>Mr Incredible insists on going back to work instead of Elasta-Girl because 'it's just something I've got to do' (read: '...for my male ego')</li><li>Mr Incredible inferring that he would be better to lead the campaign to promote super-heroes because 'well,,,, you know?!' where he almost, but doesn't quite say 'because I'm a man and she's a woman'</li><li>Mr Incredible struggling to manage Elasta-Girl's 'female' work - childcare, feeding, bedtime, homework etc</li><li>Mr Incredible gritting his teeth to be supportive but clearly hating it that Elasta-Girl is working and doing super hero stuff while he's a stay at home dad</li><li>Elasta-girl ready to come home at a moment's notice because she clearly doesn't trust her husband to have it all under control (she even 'mispeaks')</li></ul>To the people saying that this is feminist propaganda, I have news for you. None of these are positive messages, and all of them actually serve to reinforce the gender stereotypes Pixar appear to be clumsily attempting to combat.
In fact, a positive gender equal message would be Mr Incredible actually delighted that his wife is chosen to lead the campaign, and genuinely supportive. It would be to show him delighted that he can stay home and spend time with his kids. Or actually managing the household, and not being made to look like an incapable, incompetent twit. Her showing confidence in his ability to manage okay.
I get that these are plot devices, but they are OLD FASHIONED, and patronize both men and women (in many ways, men more so.)
You could have made the same film without patronizing men and their ability to be stay-at-home parents, or reinforcing the message that men should feel emasculated by women working and being more of a success than them.
Good try Pixar/Disney, but you're still trotting out the same outdated gender stereotypes, even when you try to do the opposite."

","You wouldn't think a female would find feminism annoying but yet here we are.<br/><br/>I was only 4 years old when the first movie came out and I loved it so much! Especially the scenes of the plane attack, Dash running through the jungle, and the family fighting Syndrome and his machine in the city! What made it the greatest film was family. They worked together, along with Frozone, to defeat the machine and defeat Syndrome, an iconic emotion-based character, once and for all. This one failed to achieve what the first movie was all about.<br/><br/>Now 18 and excited for the sequel, I was quite confused on the release date. It was to be released on Father's Day! I thought the movie was gonna be family empowerment, defeating a wicked female lead villain, and having action packed scene! Nope, it was all about female empowerment. My dad wasn't but I was offended they would release a feminist based movie on Father's Day! Not to mention they made all the Male-based characters lazy, not ""incredible"", weak, and tired.

"alexissebastian","5","85","227","17 June 2018"," Why it feels forced...
","Funny and fast paced: granted. Should that be enough? My two main concerns;<br/><br/>1) Everything feel forced: by example, the character of Edna is brought back with no real justification (the choice to babysit Jack-Jack, really?). You may cut her scenes and the plot remains the same. She is not here because the story needs her; this is the usual ""making by the numbers"" that defines Disney these days.<br/><br/>2) The motivation of the villain is extremely weak. (Spoiler ahead) She is upset because her father believed in superheroes and he lost his life during a home invasion. Sorry, but it sounds that she must consume her energies for revenge against petty criminals, instead of superheroes (Imagine somebody close is killed during an assault but police arrive late... Will you decide to convert into a vigilante against police officers or against criminals?). Once again, this feel extremely forced.<br/><br/>I know that the majority of moviegoers just want the thrills and easy laughs (thanks, Jack-Jack) and put character motivations and plot in second plane. If that is your case, you will have a great time indeed."

"maxkarges","10","9","17","31 July 2018"," Phenomenal
","Incredibles 2 is my favorite movie of the year so far. It is such an enjoyable movie to watch. The action sequences are amazing and the characters are fun and relatable. I love the setting of the picture. The 1960s is one of my favorite decade, and this movie captures the look of that decade so well. I love the look of the cars and mid-century modernism architecture. The score is also perfect. Michael Giacchino composed another score that perfectly captures the feel of the movie. I love the jazzy vibe it has along with its strong brass instrument sounds. It is also refreshing to get a story about super heroes that shows them as normal people with problems to deal with like any normal family would have. For instance, Violet is having trouble with a boy at school, Dash has trouble with his homework, and Mr. Incredible is struggling to take care of the kids. Just because they are super does not mean they are without their problems and are perfect. I love how I can relate to the problems that the characters are having on-screen, such as not being able to figure out a new math lesson. It is also very nice to get a story from the perspective of another Parr family member, Helen Parr a.k.a. Elastigirl. Elastigirl takes center stage in this movie, but Mr. Incredible, Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack are just as important in this film as they were in the previous one. Most people find that Screensaver was not a strong enough villian. While I feel that the Screenslaver was not as strong as Syndrome, Screenslaver felt strong enough for me as the main villian of this film. All in all, I prefer the original just a touch more, but this movie is well worth the 14 year wait us fans had to go though. Incredibles 2 deserves a well earned 10/10 stars from me because of the strong, lovable, and relatable characters, fresh story, great atmosphere, jazzy score, and fantastic action sequences. In my opinion, it is a near flawless film and my favorite film of the year so far."

","THE MOVIE IS SOOOOOOOOOO WHITE!!!!!!!! IT'S SO ANNOYING!!!!<br/><br/>also, I agree with what "" domdom-63818 "" says
--->It's just full of propaganda, I enjoyed it overall but almost every 10 minutes there was something new trying to brainwash me which I appreciated very little.<br/><br/>The ambassador or whatever it was is a woman, that's fine. They added what seems to be some sexually ambiguous folk in there as well, which is also fine. They said Elastigirl is a better superhero than Mr. Incredible, they showed how great of a mother and super hero she is. Then they showed how crap Mr. Incredible is at looking after the house and everything in life to be honest, a complete disaster in fact.<br/><br/>At the start they had to make sure Violets boyfriend tells us how he likes powerful women 'cause he's so secure in his masculinity or whatever. Two siblings run a major company, the brains behind the operation of couse, a woman. The parents of the two siblings died, yes, you've got the hang of it now, because the father was an idiot and didn't listen to his wife. The super intelligent villain, is that same woman. These are just some of the things I remember, but one of the scenes that really bothered me was a really short clip of a TV ad where a guy was baking a cake or something and the narrator said ""so simple even HE can do it"", imagine this scene but with a woman trying to fix a computer and the narrator saying it's so simple even SHE can do it, many people would be very upset.<br/><br/>I thought the first movie was pretty equal, each member of the family was equally valuable, they all realised they needed each other. While the super intelligent superhero might have been a guy, the super intelligent superhero suit designer Edna is a woman. It all seemed pretty well balanced. I'm just shocked the judge at the end wasn't a black woman as well to be honest.<br/><br/>I'm all up for having women with the more significant roles in a movie but this is just an overload to the point where it's blatantly obvious they're trying to brainwash us through a screen, which reminds me a lot of the villain of the movie, peculiar... The message I took away from this is that we're best off just getting rid of men because women are perfect. I guess that's what equality means now a days."

Literally, this movie is (and I have seen a lot of movies) maybe one of my favorite movies ever and by far my favorite Pixar one! It is a VERY well animated, funny, sweet, and not even gonna lie, at one point kinda scary movie. Some scenes could be tense (elastic girl's fight against Pizza Boy), but lightened things with a comedic scene. I love the family oriented plot line with Bob just trying to figure out parenting without his wife. A lot of this movie remind me of my parents and my family and it just warms you up. You leave the theater leaving happy, and that to me is incredible. (Lol, get it?)"
"Jisk","7","3","4","15 November 2019"," Lacks the INCREDIBLE-ness of the original
","Incredibles 2 is not a bad movie, per se, but it does not exactly take off the way the first one did. There was so much originality and genuine surprise in the first one and this one has little of that. The same great characters are there but the circumstances they have to face in this one are nowhere near as cool or interesting as in the first movie. There are a lot of nice moments here but they just don't add up to as compelling a narrative as we had in the first one. Which is too bad. They spend a lot of time and energy on the whole ""should supers be illegal or legal"" or not idea, and frankly I don't think the audience really cares too much about that. We've had X-Men movies and Watchmen traverse this exact same territory and the villain in this one is no Syndrome. So on the whole the film, especially if you are a fan of the first, is a bit of a letdown. There are some new supers here but they don't get much screen time. The most interesting ""new"" development is the discovery of jack jacks powers, which lead to the films most spontaneous moments. Which is too bad because Incredibles deserved better IMO."

"MartinHafer","8","3","4","17 January 2019"," There have already been 888 reviews....what's one more?!
","I hate most sequels and don't think most of them are necessary...they are just an excuse to squeeze money out of the popularity of the first film. This is especially true to kids' films in recent years an it seems like a bazillion cartoons and CGI movies have been made and remade in a cynical attempt to make money. Are they any good? For most, I'd say no. However, I am happy I saw ""Incredibles 2"" as it was worthy of the franchise and offers enough new content to make it worth your time.<br/><br/>In this follow-up, super-heroes have been banned and the Incredibles family is not about to break the law. However, when an eccentric billionaire offers to help the family rehabilitate the image of heroes in an effort to get them unbanned, bad things are in store. It's not that he is evil....but someone around him has an agenda of their own. In the meantime, Mr. Incredible is forced to become a house husband...and he struggles with learning to parent effectively and live without using his super skills. Ultimately, however, the entire family is forced into action to not only save the day but Mrs. Incredible.<br/><br/>Of all the recent kids films, I must say that ""Incredibles 2"" has the strongest feminist message. This is NOT a complaint. I liked seeing Mrs. Incredible become the family breadwinner and Mr. Incredible learn to be tender and a caregiver. There are also other feminist aspects of the story...but I'll say no more since it would spoil the plot!<br/><br/>Overall, an incredibly well animated and thoroughly enjoyable film. Not exactly original (hence a score that isn't higher), but well worth seeing....unlike the countless ""Ice Age"" sequels and the like."

I do think that Jack-Jack *is* this movie, but in any case, I enjoyed myself throughout.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint, it's the score. Giacchino goes way overboard with the horns."
"MovieManChuck","Null","3","4","26 August 2018"," Well worth seeing, but short of ""Incredible"".
","3.5/4<br/><br/>After 14 years, the highly anticipated ""Incredibles 2"" waltzes into theatres. Based on the trailer, and the fact that Pixar has (in recent years) started to become more hit-or-miss with their efforts, I had very low expectations set for this movie. Of course, I watch it opening night, and while it doesn't quite match the first one, it's still a great movie.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 picks up right where it's predecessor left off, at the track meet with The Underminer making his debut. It's general theme is concerning the Parr family's attempt to bring supers back into legality and legitimacy. This movie takes a shift in its primary focus and puts the spotlight on Elastagirl, as she takes her turn in saving the day.<br/><br/>The Parrs were perfected upon, and the action was one tough act to follow. Some of the powers really make for some great sequences. The kinky romance between Violet and Tony was fun to view, and Jack Jack was incontrovertibly awesome. On the flip side of things, some of the ""new heroes"" introduced were simply downright annoying to me, and the villain was predictable (and maybe a bit ineffective if you ask me). However, a few unlikable characters aren't going to kill the fun.<br/><br/>While this movie didn't quite resonate with me in the way the original did, the original set some pretty mean standards. The Incredibles one of the greatest family movies ever made. Incredibles 2 is great as well, just don't go in expecting a repeat of the first one."

"Scabloonshki","8","3","4","23 June 2018"," Fun, creative, and engaging
","The main thing (for me at least) that makes Incredibles 2 such a fun movie to watch is the dialogue between the characters, specifically Bob and Helen. I was a little concerned that the film was going to portray Bob as a stereotypical clumsy father who just can't help messing everything up due to incompetence, that simply isn't the case here. While Bob certainly makes mistakes, you can tell by his actions and his general attitude towards the kids that he is trying his best to make sure that they are happy and are getting the care that they need. When Bob struggled it isn't due to incompetence, but it's because he is dealing with something that any parent would have difficulty handling. Let's face it, any parent would be under a certain amount of pressure if they were dealing with a super powered baby. Helen's end of the story is also really fun to watch along with Bobs. While the villain is highly predictable and the motivations don't seem to make much sense (which is keeping me from giving this movie a perfect score), it was still really enjoyable to watch her deal with certain situations that were jeopardizing her and the Deavors goal of making supers legel again. Some people will call predictable sure, but predictable in my books does not equate to being bad, so long as your movie is enjoyable enough that it can be overlooked. That's something that I can certainly give this film credit for since it does a great job at utilizing each characters unique abilities to create FANTASTIC set pieces and action scenes. Combine that with the 10-10 dialogue, and you have one hell of a good time at the theater."

There were a lot of times where a majority of the theater started chuckling and laughing so there was no absence of comedy. The villain arc was somewhat predictable but it still felt pretty satisfying and the story definitely had many interesting moments. The story flows well and should keep the whole family entertained.

Yes, because if they did not take that much time it wouldn't have been as solid as this film is for a sequel. Just come into this film wanting to have fun watching it.

Nelson) role from the first film which is she is been given a oppertunity to bring superheroes to not only help the rest of the Parr family but also try and make superheroes legal again, while Bob takes Helen's role from the first movie which is to look after the kids, Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack while Helen is out to do secret hero work and try and take down a new villain Screenslaver before he hypnotises everyone in the city, so it may be slightly formulaic and predicable, but it sure did a great job of doing the best it can, throughout the whole thing I was hooked on what going on, the plot is executed smoothly and the two plots with Helen and Bob connect quite well with each other, everyone actually has a part to play instead of being there, the movie still has it's great humour and there are some memorable moments of humour that evolves Jack-Jack, there's a subplot with Violet that is having a problem with her date and that got interesting since she's my favourite character in the film series, however as brilliant, clever and well executed the writing is, the movie still has great heart, especially with Bob and Violet, but sometimes it just plays it for laughs instead of taking it seriously which does kind of ruin what makes the Parr family relatable, especially at the restaurants scene which didn't really help, that and the reveal of who Screenslaver is which may not be who you expect but at that reveal moment, it becomes slightly predictable, but those are nitpicks, the movie still has originality, good heart, great laughs, it's actually more adult then kid friendly like the first movie, you care about these characters and it gets more interesting and it all comes together nicely.<br/><br/>The animation is a massive upgrade from the first movie, the animation in the first movie did look great back in the day and it hasn't aged badly or anything, but it's starting to look not quite as brilliant as it was in 2004, however I still like it, but this animation has improved a lot, the movie looks more colourful, each character's design may look the same from the first movie but here it has a nice upgrade to them, The Parrs looks so much better, the backgrounds and the city looks more down to earth, when not using their powers, the characters has a smooth but slightly cartoon movement, but it's mostly down-to-earth, the action scenes are very creative and fast, when Jack-Jack or the rest of the Parr family use their powers it actually looks really cool, although if you get seizures from flashing images, i don't recommend this movie though because the villain Screenslaver has TVs that he uses to control his victims and in a fight that has TVs with lots of flashing images, so yeah that can be debatable, but besides that the animation is massively improved from the first movie and it looks fantastic!.<br/><br/>The characters are still entertaining and memorable as they were back in 2004, even the new ones has a lot to offer, the Parr family is still great, Helen is a well developed character who gets even more screen time and her plot gets very interesting, Bob still has his funny moments and is still a likeable father, Dash might be annoying to some but I found him entertaining enough, but Jack-Jack and Violet stand out for me, Jack-Jack brings some great laughs with his different powers and Violet is one I found interesting and I did care about her the most besides the Parrs, Lucius Best a.k.a Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is still awesome, the new characters are also great, well mostly, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) is charmingly and delightful character who I like all the way through same with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) although he remind me of Sterling from Cars 3 at times but I still liked his presences, the other superheroes like Voyd, Brick, Reflux, He-Lectrix are basically just other heroes but they do play a part like i said before, the villain Screenslaver had potential to be a great villain but came out as disappointing, the reveal of who the Screenslaver is can come off as predictable and the villain's plan did start off interesting but then it made no sense and Buddy Pine is so much better, but how can I forget Edna Mode voiced by the director himself Brad Bird, she still is really fascinating, funny and very entertaining when it comes to her and Jack-Jack, but at-least the voice acting is still amazing, Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson return and they are still great as they were before, the new ones like Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush, Jonathan Banks and many more do a fantastic job as well, but even with a weak villain, these characters old and new are still loveable and wonderful just how they should be.<br/><br/>So maybe not quite as well crafted and important as the first film, but it still has what made the first movie amazing, it has an engaging and original plot, the animation is fantastic as always, loveable characters with great voice acting, really good humour with great heart and amazing action, this is high recommendation, if you love Pixar, the Incredibles or superheroes, please do go check this one out, along with Deadpool 2, this is one of the funniest superhero films of this year, I can't wait to see what Brad Bird makes next.<br/><br/>Of course I'm going to give Incredibles 2 a 10/10!."

Just like with the first movie, younger audiences might be bored or scared. I would suggest six and up. There was a wonderful segment at the very beginning of the movie where some of the voice actors and the director came out and essentially said- we know it's been a long time guys but we promise it will be worth it. And boy was it. Picking up where the first movie left off, superheros are still not in favor with society. The super heroes trying to change that leads them to learn more about family and winning together. A movie to watch with your kids!

"osama_sarm_1000","5","70","202","17 June 2018"," Don't believe the hype...
","Let me start by saying that the Incredibles (2007) was one of my all time favorite animations, which is why i was so confused about a sequel 14 years after the first one. But given the fact that i really liked the first one, there was no way in which i wouldn't go and watch this one.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting much to be totally honest, because i have come to realize that sequels many years in the making often doesn't make a good watch, and i was right, i didn't see anything worthwhile. It's not to say the movie was bad, it was entertaining for the most parts, but it was an unnessecary sequel that had many flaws and weren't worth the wait....that is....if someone was actually waiting for it.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the movie was very over the top, it threw me off completely, as it was loud and exhausting to watch...but after that, the pace slew down a bit and i was able to enjoy most of it.<br/><br/>The plot weren't that special too, i was able to see the outcome from a mile away.....surprise surprise, the overly good people are the actual villains.
One thing that struck me the most is that the movie lacked the charm it had in the first one, although the characters looked amazing, the special effects are better and the voice acting is really good, it just didn't feel as charming and as endearing as the first one, maybe it wasn't the movie's fault really, i think that's a natural outcome if you're going to make a sequel 14 years later is that people's mind have developed in such a way that what you did to leave a good impression on them 14 years ago wouldn't work now....specially with all those really good movies coming out in all those years....my point is that, if you're going to make a sequel that many years later, you have to bring something new to the table and not just special effects and loud scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was entertaining in the most parts and i would suggest that you go out and see it if you liked the first one, but don't expect it to better than the original and don't believe the hype. it's just an entertaining movie, you shouldn't expect more than that because nothing is worth 14 years of waiting."

","5/10
Incredibles 2 is the most corporate and boring film of the year so far. This film commits the worst offender of a sequel possible, not needing to exist. Nothing was gained, nothing important happened. All the characters are in the exact same spot from the beginning of the film to the end. There is no arc for anyone. The villain is one of the worst villains in cinema history. The plot is the most predictable and boring plot of recent years. There are some enjoyable things though. The action is fantastic, the humor mostly works, and some characters like Frozone and Violet are more interesting than others. Overall this is the safest thing Disney could have done with this film and it really shows. It's a shame because this could have been a fantastic film."
"ferguson-6","8","27","77","13 June 2018"," Jack Jack is a star
","Greetings again from the darkness. In 2004 THE INCREDIBLES became the 6th Pixar film in a row to dominate the box office, and also the 6th straight to ""WOW"" us with a combination of animation, story, action and characters. All these years later, Brad Bird, the creative force behind the original, is back with the much anticipated sequel. Mr. Bird's career over those years has featured a blend of other animation (RATATOUILLE, 2007) and live-action (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL). <br/><br/>Bird is not the only returnee for the sequel. Also back is the entire Parr Family: Holly Hunter as Elastigirl/Helen/Mom, Craig T Nelson as Mr. Incredible/Bob/Dad, Sarah Vowell as Violet, Huck Milner as Dash, and Eli Fucile as baby Jack Jack. The story picks up not long after the original ended. ""Supers"" have been outlawed, and the Parrs are in some type of Super Protection Program - similar to Witness Protection. Of course when one is a superhero, doing the right thing just comes naturally, and the opening scene finds them battling their old nemesis Underminer (voiced by Pixar good luck charm John Ratzenberger, who voices a character in each of the studio's films). Our heroes stop the crime, but cause significant damage to the city. This leads to our first social commentary when the powers that be scold the Parrs and inform them that the banks have insurance, and it's cheaper to let the criminals get away so that the damage is minimized. <br/><br/>As superheroes non-grata, the Parrs try to go ""straight"" and live a normal life. That is until a powerful brother and sister corporate duo offer a proposal. Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deavor (twist that pronunciation just a bit, voiced by Catherine Keener) want to generate a PR plan to help rebuild the reputation of supers. The idea is to make Elastigirl the public face of the program by having her wear a body cam to show off her heroic deeds (in this age of 'pics or it didn't happen'). She's chosen over Mr. Incredible for economic reasons, and he's relegated to stay-at-home parent (or as we called Michael Keaton in 1983, MR. MOM - an unacceptable sexist term these days).
Elastigirl enjoys her time in the limelight, while Bob doesn't much like being just Bob. Plus he can't understand why they changed math, as he gets frustrated trying to help Dash with his homework. He's also challenged with Violet's teen angst over a boy, and even moreso over the discovery that Jack Jack has POWERS! In fact, Jack Jack has multiple powers, but as a baby, he has little control - though his battle with a raccoon is not a segment you'll soon forget. <br/><br/>Also returning is Frozone - voiced by Samuel L. Jackson (minus his trademark ""MF'er), and costume designer Edna Mode - voiced by director Bird. Other new voices include (Odenkirk's fellow ""Better Call Saul"" castmate) Jonathan Banks as Rick Dicker, Isabella Rossellini as the Ambassador, and Sophia Bush as Voyd, one of the new generation supers (which includes Reflux - one you'll just have to experience). <br/><br/>The big new villain causing problems for Elastigirl is ScreenSlaver, who hypnotizes large groups of people through their screens - more social commentary on our dependence on technology and the addiction/affliction we have toward device screens. The flood of superhero movies over the years since THE INCREDIBLES exposes the not-so-complex story in this one, but it's terrific that the film keeps much of the original look and feel, and yet brings something new ... baby Jack Jack is a star!<br/><br/>Filled with the beautiful colors and art design we've come to take for granted from Pixar, the film also features some of the best action sequences you'll see in any movie. The train sequence with Elastigirl is simply spectacular - as is the final action sequence. It's also nice to see the flip in gender roles as Mom (Holly Hunter) takes the lead. Michael Giacchino returns as the composer and he blends in a touch of James Bond theme with his wonderful work. If the film needed extra credit (which it doesn't), certainly the inclusion of a ""Jonny Quest"" clip would qualify. Family films don't get much better than this, and even though it runs 2 hours, the closing credits feature the theme song for each of the superheroes, and could easily have been a short film unto itself.<br/><br/>Speaking of short films, a Pixar tradition is to include one before new releases. This time it's BAO, a Chinese mother/son and food-oriented story from director Domee Shi (animator on INSIDE OUT)"
"MrDHWong","8","19","51","14 June 2018"," A well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right
","Incredibles 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the Disney Pixar classic The Incredibles. Written and directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille), it is a well-made follow-up to one of Pixar's best movies and a solid superhero film in its own right.<br/><br/>A short time after the events of the first film, the Parr family, Bob/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and Jack-Jack, continue to protect their city from danger while also trying to live out their lives as normal citizens. One day, Helen is recruited by an organisation called DEVTECH, who are devoted to restoring the reputation of superheroes and regaining their popularity with the public. With his wife now away working for DEVTECH, Bob is tasked with looking after the kids and tending to their needs, which proves to be much easier said than done.<br/><br/>The film is more action-packed than its predecessor and thanks to improved animation techniques, is far more exciting at times. All of the charm and familial love of the original film still remains in this sequel and once again there was a good balance of comedy and drama. Most of the original voice cast returns, including Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl, and of course Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone. In the previous film, it was the character of Edna who stole show in every scene, this time, it is the adorable baby Jack-Jack who gets the most laughs every time he is on screen. The only major issue is that the villain was highly predictable with generic motives and as a result was much less clever than Syndrome was in the original. Overall, this sequel was worth the 14 year wait and hopefully there will be a third installment in the not-too-distant future.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"rickyymtz","10","41","125","12 June 2018"," A Great Movie

"pranayjalvi","8","28","81","13 June 2018"," Sequel worth waiting for
","Though it would be unrealistic to expect ""Incredibles 2"" to have quite the genre-busting surprise of the original, it is as good as it can be without that shock of the new - delivering comedy, adventure and all too human moments with a generous hand. ""Incredibles 2"" takes advantage of the advances in computer animation since the first film came out, and the family's adventures look snappier and super-exciting, but it is the echoes of the original (including a dynamic new score by the returning Michael Giacchino) that hook us. It surely exceeded the expectations."

No resolution with the first villain. No demonstrated resolution for the main story. The Bob-with-the-kids stuff was too much of beating a dead horse. A couple of dozen supers that do nothing. The entire script should have been set on fire. To have to wait for fourteen years and end up with this is very annoying. To be fair, I viewed it and was disappointed. I waited eight months and viewed it a second time and just plain I hated it. After this, I doubt we'll see an Incredibles 3. What a way to ruin what could have been a great franchise."

I know a few people didn't like it something about bad language and lifestyle adjustment but I thought that was good. Through life we always have to adjust and if we haven't had to do something before it can be hard and comical. The incredibles really showed this and by the end you can see that everyone has adjusted to their new roles in life very well. Is the the end? I'm guessing not if there will be another movie and in life we are always changing our roles so I cannot wait for the next movie and the humorous challenges that await them"

","Nearly two hours of horrible drawn out story line with terrible dialogue! Won't keep a kids attention and definitely doesn't keep the adults attention who were anxiously awaiting a sequel as good as the first one. Dash is basically a waste of a character in this movie as his lines are not as comedically timed as the first movie. The first 60-90 minutes of the movie is basically a snoozefest and has very rare comical moments. Most of the time it tries way too hard to be funny and rather tries to make subtle political comments about current events. Avoid this one if you can unless you just need a movie to play in the background during a nap."

With all these new additions to the incredibles universe we are also left with a familiar but suspenseful save the day storyline filled with mind control and some really dark moments glanced over on screen.

It seems the only thing Pixar forgot about in this movie is that it should be a kid flick....the plot, the setting, the music, the jokes and everything in this movie is too much for adults rather than for kids, lacking essential childish creativity and fun, which is a shame given that the first Incredibles was one of the funniest and witties of all of Pixars great movies."

The baby side story also isn't funny and Mr Incredible is reduced to a dull side character.<br/><br/>The feminist angle also gets annoying and preachy - it's meant to be a light relief and not a post 'me too' movement campaign.

","Great visual animation does not make up for the cringey dialogue and uncompelling story. The characters that you fell in love with in the original act so different in this movie and sometimes contradictory to their character. Most of the scenes don't move the story and the ones that do have laughably unsmooth exposition. Most of the scenes are bits to try to get the audience to laugh which would be fine if they were true to the characters and there was a compelling story that they fit in. The villain does not work at all; dumb motive, dumb plan. They definitely had potential but for me it was not executed well and it wrapped up terribly. Granted, there are some cool showcases of powers that were creative and new which is where I thought this movie shined. And I also thought all the scenes with Edna were great and I felt like I was watching an Incredibles movie. It doesn't forgive the faults. One thing I was really excited for was the score from Michael Giacchino; In the original, he flexed such an impressive ability to compose emotions and motion while also fitting the score together, perfectly, with the pacing of each scene. In this one, the score doesn't get time to shine and is less noticeable. It's partly due to amount of dialogue in this movie. It came to a point where I felt relieved when there wasn't and I could just watch the action and listen to score. Overall, this feels like another cheap-shot try-hard sequel. They make incompetent references to the first movie. Everything seems forced and unnecessary. I found myself bored at points during this movie which really disheartened me. See it for the action, Edna, jack-jack's cuteness, and small gags that mirror regular family life and feuds but don't expect a compelling story, dynamic dialogue or interesting characters. I feel like an old man who doesn't understand the world anymore because I know a lot of people will like this movie. Maybe because the original was so magical, this one could never live up to my expectations. But to me, it didn't get close."

","At long last here is Incredibles 2! Being a 2000's kid who saw the first one in the theaters, I have been greatly anticipating this movie for 14 years!! I loved the first one as a kid, and my appreciation has grown for it over the years as I have grown up and gained insight to the more adult themes of the film. It is so much more than a super hero film, and I count it as my favorite Pixar movie.<br/><br/>I try with most films to keep my expectations low, and I tried with this one but because of the first one being integral to my childhood and t being 14 years it was hard. That being said, here are my spoiler free thoughts on Incredibles 2-<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely hilarious! Defnitley the funniest Pixar movie in a long time. It's balanced out well with the more serious and emotional elements of the story. 
The themes of parenting and sticking together as a family are played very well, in this flipped around plot where Bob is staying home with the kids and Helen goes out to have the super adventure. I thought this was a great choice, because it provided great opportunities for character work as you see how they are tested and learn from the new experiences they have. I always appreciate when films take the time to do this, especially to give further dimension to characters everyone already knows and loves. <br/><br/>Where the movie falters is the external plot, which unfortunately does not escape certain tropes of the superhero genre. This is especially noticeable in the 3rd act, when the villain plot, while very effective and complex when introduced, ultimately becomes a tad silly and seems very detached from what the film spent the first hour and a half focusing on. This most likely will not be a huge issue for most, the conclusion to the film is very action packed and entertaining, it was just a tad disappointing to me and I felt like it was lacking cohesion. But you can decide for yourself! <br/><br/>All in all it's a very fun sequel with fantastic character work, humor, and exhilarating action sequences. Albeit a tad disappointing for me, it is a worthy sequel to the beloved first film. Go see it and have fun!"

I really didn't want to read that into the story line but after an hour or so you just couldn't ignore it. When it was all said and done I found my self pausing the movie several times just to see how much of it was left. The first one was so well done, I just ended up feeling bummed that this was the movie we all waited to finally see."

","The original Incredibles movie released in 2004 was fresh, exciting and uniquely different from other animated films at the time. Of course now with this sequel being 14 years later, the animation is just as great if not better but the overall film isn't as good and entertaining. Having not remembering too much detail about the original film was remember enjoying it and thinking it was special, this film is a letdown.<br/><br/>Not as great action, humor isn't as good and the plot is somewhat bland and has too much of a focus of Elastigrl being the major focus instead of the entire family. Also it is entirely predictable and the basic setup has been done many times before. It was very obvious from the beginning that it was a setup and that either Winston or Evelyn (or both) we're simply using Elestigirl, and that they were the villains. As it turned out it was only Evelyn.<br/><br/>The baby having a unique set of powers was a nice touch but that camera little late. Although this film isn't that long (less than 1hr 50mins excluding end credits) it feels as if it drags on.<br/><br/>Overall, for a highly anticipated film to have waited 14 years to be released, it was disappointing. The studios waited too long. Given the huge box office success, we hope the third film won't be as long to be released."

"bjoernidler","8","3","5","6 March 2019"," What's with all the hate?
","Let me start with a few words about what films are. Films are manipulation of the audience. They manipulate our feelings through pictures, music, sound, acting, mise-en-scene, editing etc...
Disney and Pixar represent the absolute mainstream of film-making. It almost is expected of them to send messages to their supposedly young audience (although I can't imagine all the hate comments were written by the target audience...).
Most of the time Disney sends out messages to manipulate us. Sometimes it's ""It's okay to be different"", sometimes ""friendship is important"", ""Stay true to yourself"" or ""fight for your dream"". Almost everybody can relate to those.<br/><br/>In Incredibles 2 it's time for female empowerment. This is just as valid as the other messages I mentioned but as you can see when you read other comments about the film, it creates some controversy.
I think it's unfair to shout 'Propaganda!!' here and not also talk about Moana, Frozen and other films that have strong female characters.
I think all the criticism is not valid.
Mr Incredible isn't weak here. He actually is the most relatable of all the Parr family. He's not un-manly because he takes care of the kids and fails at first. He's manly because ultimately he succeeds in the end.
Elasti-Girl isn't better than him. She puts career and the 'greater good' before family. This is controversial at least. She also draws wrong conclusions, needs rescuing and isn't the most capable of the Supers. So what is all the fuzz about?<br/><br/>This is a fun film that has a message not everybody might enjoy but that is equally important in our day and age. Yes, it might be too much for 5 year old kids. Then for god's sake, don't take your 5 year old to a film that's about a superhero family and takes about 2 hours! See 'Cars' again on Disney channel!
I truly enjoyed the spy movie spoof moments, the whole family dynamic, the humour (for lots of the jokes it also helps if you're older than 5...), the animation and yes, also the message, although I admit it is quite in-your-face.<br/><br/>If like me you don't trust 1-star and 10-star ratings, watch the 'Incredibles 2'. I can't imagine any sane person that enjoyed the first part or the ""How to train your dragon"" films to leave the cinema truly disappointed.<br/><br/>Finally, this is a way better sequel than 'Finding Dori' was. This one takes more risks and tells a different story than the first part."
"joelnova93","7","3","5","11 August 2018"," The only character development is Jack Jack
","And by development, I just mean new powers. The Incredibles family were just dropped into a script. None of any of film's characters' core beliefs, including the villain, are tested or evolve over the course of the film. Sequels need to either double down on our known characters, or introduce fresh new ones to fall in love with, and this film did neither. <br/><br/>However, the action and comedy are extremely fun! A good fight will easily make me want to re-watch a film, but I'm not sure sitting through the dull parts around the scenes that I do like is worth the trouble. <br/><br/>I can only rate films an 8 or above if I'd gladly re-watch it solo on my own time, but this only gets a 7 because I'd probably only watch it again at home with the family if they put it on TV."
"ojiisanhikui","7","3","5","9 August 2018"," Not bad, but could have been better.
","First off, I love all the little touches they put into this movie. For example: at one point billionaire Winston Deavor offers to let the Parr family stay at the home of one of his billionaire friends who ""needs to get away a lot"". Although it's never specifically mentioned, it's Tony Stark's house from the Iron Man movies.
 The plot actually works for this movie. Although a lot of people deride the fact that it's simply a gender-flip version of the original, it actually does bring Bob and Helen to think about how the other person felt in the first movie.
 Furthermore, the plot goes a little deeper than standard superhero fare. The ScreenSlaver provides a vicious commentary on our social media society, and how we can become slaves to our technology without even realizing it.
 With all that being said, the reveal of Winston's sister Evelyn as the villain was obvious since the first moment they appeared on the screen, and her motivations were not exactly clear. If this was all revenge for her father's death, why even do anything at all? If Helen hadn't stumbled into ScreenSlaver's lair, the plan would have failed.
 All in all, a good movie, but they could have plugged a few holes."
"valen060","8","3","5","26 June 2018"," 14 Years Later: Incredibles Has Matured in Content with Impressive Results
","Things have changed greatly since the lighthearted 2004 Pixar hit The Incredibles. In this 2018 sequel, it feels more darker in content - like on the boundary line of PG to PG-13 - compared to its predecessor. See, unlike the original which played on the superhero genre of the early 2000s with sitcom-like humor, this feels like a blend of the current decade's juggernaut of ever-growing superhero movies with some maturity in these characters we've come to know those years ago.<br/><br/>A few months have passed after Syndrome's defeat and the Parr Family have moved on with their lives as though nothing's happened. When a wealthy tycoon offers to bring Supers back into the spotlight, he asks Bob Parr's (aka Mr. Incredible) wife Helen (aka Elastigirl) to be the front in making it happen again, resulting in a new villain called the Screenslaver to wreak havoc.<br/><br/>Compared to past Pixar films that spawned sequels (or a prequel) of their own, director Brad Bird did an impressive job by having these characters retain their sitcom-like quirks, but also including some character development that wasn't explored before. This is a sequel that was long overdue to be released years back and it was worth quite the wait (especially for the kids of 2004 who are now young adults in or out of college). The returning voice cast and the new cast members did splendidly well with their roles and the real scene-stealer has to go to both baby Jack-Jack and Edna. I wasn't bored in the least, it's a pretty good follow-up."

","THE INCREDIBLES 2 REVIEW :<br/><br/>
'Pixar does it again'... Whenever i see Pixar films this sentence has always made it to appear in my review/mind. Long wait of 14 years, so much anticipation finally comes to end with a Worthy sequel to The Incredibles. The Incredibles does entertain you throughout and on a high note tells some family values lessons as well. Comedy, humour, thrills everything is just perfect and so does the film.<br/><br/>Story is about Superheroes are not legal, they should not use their powers which causes the destruction so they gotta stay at home like common people. Then how they survive from a conspiracy in a heroic style which better be seen in theater. We know 4 superhero characters in previous films and the addition of new cute little superhero is surprisingly amazing. Background music for the same is very effective and accurate as far as that particular scene is concerned. Cinematography is Excellent, especially in action scenes those moving camera angles will blow your mind. Visual effects are eye pleasing. Director has done a mind blowing job by keeping this excellent written product entertaining and engaged from the first frame to the last.<br/><br/>Overall, The Incredibles 2 a Must See for Pixar Lovers, at some moments it looks even better than it's prequel. On a funny note i say, Marvel should take lessons from Pixar on how to make a Terrific Superhero film barring regular money making stuff. I never thought The Incredibles will have a Sequel and after watching The Incredibles 2 i want more and more sequels in this franchise. With a grin smile on my face, i rate it 7/10*"

","After attending the movie premier at an IMAX, we were awe-struck. The visuals, coloring, editing, music, animation and action sequences were all perfect. The family's chemistry is better than before with Jack-Jack also chipping in this time. <br/><br/>Continuing where it left off last time was a nice move by the creative team that won't be affected by the aged voice actors. Edna's character is awesome though present for less time.<br/><br/>While the critical reviews that mention the movie has weak villain, I can't agree with the argument completely as the movie's motive is more than showcasing a perfect villain; bringing the rich family drama together.<br/><br/>Action scenes are top notch and make you glued to the screen; At times I forgot I was watching an animated movie. The lighting, sounds, camerawork around the scenes is perfect. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't waste any time in focussing on unnecessary conversations or scenes and yet is the longest pixar movie of all time.

","I have always been a big fan of the original. In fact, I consider it to be one of Pixar's best. Maybe that's part of the problem. It's difficult to follow up the excellent original. <br/><br/>The Good:
1. The opening is a nice setup for a plot line that plays well throughout the movie and has an amusing conclusion. <br/><br/>2. The opening and ending action sequences are excellent. Nice teamwork sequences. <br/><br/>3. The Jack-Jack bits are fun and fleshes out his character significantly. <br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1. Far too much time is spent on Elastagirl. I thought this was supposed to be a movie about the entire family. Why is she doing pretty much all of the interesting superhero stuff while the dad and kids do mostly nothing for vast stretches of the movie (save for the aforementioned Jack-Jack bits)? I mean, I get that that's part of the plot, but it seems like a weird direction to go with the story in the first place. <br/><br/>2. The identity of the villain is obvious from the beginning. I realize it's a movie for kids, but Pixar is usually smarter with their writing. I understand it's hard to top Syndrome, but this villain is uninteresting for the most part. <br/><br/>3. The middle of the movie drags. It's far too long. At one point during the middle, I just wanted it to end. It was dull for too long. It would have benefitted from tighter editing and a shorter run time. <br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>1. Curse words and swearing in a Pixar movie. Really, Disney? There is no excuse for this. I should be able to take my kids to a movie like this without concerning myself with the language. <br/><br/>2. Political nonsense. Elastagirl is made to looks like a nearly perfect superhero while Mr. Incredible is made to look like an inept parent. Of course, feminism and SJW trash seems to be slipped into just about everything coming out of Hollywood these days. We hear this stuff in the media all of the time. Is it too much to ask to leave it out of entertainment made for kids?<br/><br/>3. Lack of humor. Maybe it's just me, but this movie doesn't seem to contain hardly any of the clever humor of the original. There are one or two scenes that are somewhat funny, but part of the charm of the original was the way the comedy was integrated. This one, for the most part, falls flat in that department as far as I am concerned. <br/><br/>To be fair, I really didn't have any interest in seeing this movie despite my fondness for the original because the trailer was uninspiring. Perhaps the story and execution would have been much better if they hadn't waited 14 years between the original and the sequel."

","'Incredibles 2 (2018)' - sans 'The', for some reason - is essentially just a worse version of the first film, with its narrative playing out so incredibly closely to that of its predecessor that beat-for-beat comparisons are almost easy. How it took Brad Bird fourteen years to come up with this is anyone's guess. Its character arcs and overall messages actually feel as though they backtrack upon the original's, only to reach the same conclusions. Both this picture and even the first (or, at least, its finale) actually seem somewhat redundant due to this. The two narratives don't really feel like they connect all that well, considering where one leaves off and the other picks up, despite them carrying directly on from one another. What I mean is, while the main plot may flow from one piece to the other, many other threads and character arcs don't come together quite as cleanly. The only real positive this picture has going for it are some genuinely exciting and, at times, suspenseful action sequences. These moments tend to flow fairly well and provide some real, if brief, entertainment. In general, though, the film feels very subpar. There are some very poor character designs. The new heroes are honestly some of the worst characters I've seen, from a visual stand-point, in some time. They are actually difficult to look at and don't fit the aesthetic at all. Pixar should be producing better original characters than this. It may just be me, but the film seems slightly over-animated, too, and loses the 'realistic' look of the first, even if it is more impressively rendered. The flick's main issue is the writing, though. It feels off from the start. Overall, the movie lacks the narrative strength to stand on its own - thanks, in no small part, to some strange plot holes, poor motivations and weak characterisations. It fails to fully capture the quality or even spirit of the flick it follows. It also has a bizarre underlying philosophy that holds its very genre (or a subsection of it) - as well as the audience that enjoys such fare, which is apparently now oversaturated and underdeveloped (a debate best saved for another time), and even the increasing demand for that fare - seemingly in contempt while also playing entirely into the worst aspects of it and becoming the very thing - in concept, execution and intent - it appears to dislike. It ends up just another entry into a fading 'fad' with nothing new to add. 'The Incredibles (2004)' certainly can't be described as this, even all these years later. It's a shame, too, because this film didn't need to be better than that original feature, just a good one in it's own right. Honestly, it doesn't do a great job at that. 5/10"

The first Incredibles was great, very original, each character had it's place on the plot, you could see a family working together and the story felt super original. <br/><br/>On this new one, it's more about ""strong female"" (they should make a movie of ""Strong Woman"" from South Park) and very predictable story (kind of story you can already know how it's going to end on the first 10min of the movie)<br/><br/>It's a good movie to watch at home and just spend some time, when you don't have anything better to watch. It doesn't worth the ticket to watch on the theater. <br/><br/>Hope Pixar can return to it good times and return to make good stories again without politics on it, as it seems they are really loosing their creativity upon political agenda since Cars 3.

In the skit, Phil Hartman plays talk-show host Donahue, and he starts off an interview thusly: ""With us today is Dr. Norma Hoeffering, author of the book, Women Good, Men Bad..."". For me, that pretty much sums up the over-the-top PC level of Incredibles 2. Lots of other reviewers seem to have documented this aspect, so I won't add any more here.<br/><br/>Beyond the PC overload, I also find it kind of annoying that they wasted Mr. Incredible on a never-ending Mr. Mom remake. That might have been funny for a few minutes, but it went on and on and on and on... And even once Mr. Incredible finally gets into the action, he doesn't really seem to have much to do.<br/><br/>On the up side, the animation is fantastic (as always in a Pixar film), and the kids were pretty good.

","This review will be buried under 800+ others, but I just had to put my homage to the movie here. I lost count of how many amazing set pieces. Yes, there is little character developement, but we already know those folks. The movie puts them in new roles, and that is enough. We already know the universe they inhabit, and frankly exploring social themes would be a waste of computer power. I could get through even the overbearing feminism, but that is probably because with so much netflix, PC stuff has beaten me into submission. Also, because the elastic woman is so well used. So I ended up enjoying Mr. Incredible trying to be a stay at home dad (and relatively succeding, giving the utterly impossible circunstances). Yes, the plot is predictable, but this is kind of expected in such an action-oriented flick. Jack-Jack gives enough surprises.<br/><br/>Incredibles 1 was good, but it dragged at times, specially in the 1st half. This one will not let you down, it really puts everything into the action scenes, and there is never less then 10 minutes between them. The chasing of the Screenslaver in the building and the Violet/Voyd fight were my favorites. Introducing new people with new powers was a smart idea, and it works better here then in the overcrowded X-Men sequels. The ending is overdone, but in the age of Marvel movies, ending battles have to be overdone, it's kind of a rule. I just took this movie like a Mission Impossible sequel: give me nonstop thrills, without being overbearing, and that is enough."
"chakor-74657","1","6","14","30 December 2018"," How the mighty have fallen...
","Let's be honest with ourselves - Incredibles 1 is the only movie where the ""the world is afraid of superheroes so they need government supervision"" plot trope worked. In everything else it's just boring and tedious (Civil War, Batman v. Superman, etc.). So what's the logical choice for the plot of this movie? Revisit that trope for what feels like the one millionth time.<br/><br/>It starts out promising, but the plot is one of the most boring and cliche I've seen in a superhero movie in a long time. Elastigirl is the only character who gets anything to do, meanwhile all Mr. Incredible gets to do prior to the third act is stay at home taking care of the kids. They play with this subplot of Violet having a crush on this one boy from school (can't remember his name), but they barely make anything out of it. And to top all of this ugliness off, the film copies the ""villain twist"" from Iron Man 3 with this lame throwaway character called Screenslaver who is only in the film for about 50 seconds. Meanwhile, the real villain is incredibly cliched and forgettable.<br/><br/>All around a total fail and letdown of a sequel. Boring, cliche, and nothing we haven't seen before. I'm surprised it got the amount of positive reception that it did. Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 and 3, Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man and the Wasp are honestly better superhero movies than this.<br/><br/>The only reason I rate this a 1/10 is to bring the general user consensus down to a more reasonable score.

"srvtoyota","10","5","11","27 July 2018"," As good as the original
","I gotta say, back in the day I wasn't a big fan of The Incredibles. Maybe I was just too young to care about anything that wasn't a funny one-liner or an epic action set piece, and now, it's really weird to think of a time I didn't like the first film, because seeing it as a grown-up makes me reflect about the things that happen in it. Just because Syndrome is the villain doesn't mean he is straight up evil, it's not all black or white, but rather shades of grey. I think that that's what it means to grow up, bacause as a kid you would think of your friends as goods and your enemies as bad, but as you grow up you start to think about the motivations behind those two, and that's what captivated me about the first film. I really love that movie, it's not Pixar's best effort but it really has a place in my heart next to Toy story, Toy story 3, Inside Out, Up and the sequel to The Incredibles, and the latter is the one I'm gonna talk about today.
Hitting theaters 14 years after the first film and getting huge praise by critics and audiences around the world and breaking tons of records at the box office, the sequel to The Incredibles is real fun, packed with laugh-out-loud moments as well as thrilling action scenes, Incredibles 2 has almost everything for everyone, but -as in most Pixar films- the heart of the film is at its core. Mainly because it's about a family, one that is not perfect but rather incredible, since all of this characters are fully fleshed out and you really care about them, and that is mainly thanks to the first film. There are some flaws in this film too, it's not perfect by any means, for example the villain in this movie is not in the same level as Syndrome, and though his motivation was a little less impactful as the villain in this film, the execution of the villain was better portrayed in the first installment. In this one right off the bat you can tell who he / she is, the motivation is there but the execution is kind of all over the place, a little bit nonsensical to tell the truth but it's something you can let pass and that's what I did, because the rest was so much fun and entertaining that just a little plothole here and there is nothing you can't overlook. But that's not my only problem with this film, the other one is the intelligence of this film, don't get me wrong, this film is terrifically written but the shades of grey that were presented to everything the heroes did were replaced with good and bad, and the truth is nobody is a 100% good or a 100% bad, people are mostly in the middle, just like grey, and even though the villain had the motivation to do this, it's mainly vengeance the thing he / she is looking to achieve.
But now with the good stuff, this film has some of the best action you'll see all tear long, maybe Mission Imposible Fallout tops it but whenever there's a fight scene you just look at the screen, marveled at what Brad Bird and the people at Pixar could achieve. The animation is stellar, too, some of the environments looked photorealistic, for example the ocean or the streets. I mean, someone would think that at some point Pixar will reach maximum level of detail in their works but every year they just get better and better. Another thing I'd lile to point out is that the relationship between the family members is just so real, the script is written in such a way that you stop and think for a minute if it's a real conversation or not. But the best things about the film are Jack Jack, Violet, Elastigirl and Edna Mode, I mean they steal every scene they are in. In the first film Violet just seemed like a bland character to me, but now she has way more things to do and more layers that make her into a fully fleshed out character. Another thing that is exceptional is the comedy, not only the jokes or the lines charcters have to say, but the slapstick that reminds us of Tom amd Jerry and other cartoons like that.
All in all, this film is so good that I might watch it again tomorrow. If you have kids and you wanna take them to the movies, scratch that, if you are an adult and wanna go to the movies, Incredibles 2 might be the best pick, between that and Mission: Impossible Fallout.
Thanks for reading,
My rating is: 9.7/10 - A or A+ - 97% - 5/5 stars"

","I love the plot of the movie and I think it's true to the first movie and a worthy sequel but the extra superhero's we never heard of kind of takes us away from who we want to see.. the incredibles. They sort of steal the spotlight a bit and never really add anything to the movie and in my opinion it would of been better if they just didn't have them. Their look just didn't fit and it would of been nice to see the other heroes who went into hiding and were featured in the first film..."

The story, animation, everything's great. It's so perfect! I totally love it.<br/><br/>Although I love it, the only thing I don't like is the underminer thing. The Incredibles are dealing with that underminer guy, but they are just cut off. No more arresting that guy scene, no more. I want to see that guy has been arrested at the end of whenever in the middle of animation.<br/><br/>Except that little fact that makes me unsatisfied a little bit, everything looks great and the animation is perfect.

"clock_me","5","14","42","18 June 2018"," could have been alot better defently a movie for kids but not the old fans
","So here we are with the sequel of incredibles 2 right where the first one left off
now seeing the whole family back at it again trying to stop the underminer only for some strange reason they let him escape I mean thats not a bad thing but they could have surly saved the town from destruction but then again there wouldn't be a story for this movie if they had<br/><br/>after they get back to the hotel nothing really happens for about 20 mins or except for them moping and arguing and then after that we get a few minutes of suspense and some action i would say totally not even 25 min 
the stay at home dad thing was kinda funny but mostly kinda boring
Jack jack was the whole show he was the only reason i stayed watching it because of his humor and silliness<br/><br/>The villain in the film i noticed who it was right away and she really doesn't do much or then again you never see it since they don't show it
all you see is a flashing screen hypnotizing people
unlike Syndrome who in my opinion was a great villain really shows off how much of a bad ass he is but screen slayer is so boring it makes dr evil look like a genuise<br/><br/>and non of the family except elastic girl suit up until the last 20 minutes of the film you don't even get to see frozone in this he has so little time this film could have done without him
oh and when they say jack jack has 17 powers i didn't see 17 i saw mybe 8 but may have missed some
another thing how didn't the parents remember jacks powers when he used them on Syndrome in less they suffered amnesia 
an one more thing they should have done was shown more of the kids powers like how they have adjusted to them is there anything new to them but instead its the same oh same oh <br/><br/>this has a few laughs some decent special effects but not enough action of the combination in 14 years they could have perfected there art but instead were lazy and didn't put enough effort into what made the first one so great

","In Incredibles 2, how does writer/director Brad Bird make a family film that is adventure, thriller, and comedy? Well, he's had practice beginning with Iron Giant and Ratatouille and The Incredibles in between. With three distinct approaches to entertainment he has made a reputation of smart and fun and plain genius all over.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is super family fun as the family picks up where they left off, specifically leaving a track meet and pursuing The Underminer (John Ratzenberger), who is digging under the city with a giant corkscrew. The importance of this successful sequence is that it's the first time for the family to work as a team in public.<br/><br/>It's a regular family going through growing pains and a superhero family trying to reconcile its gifts with a society that the rules against them. That's right, super heroes have been outlawed because they're perceived as adding to the troubles. The answer lies in pursuing the law and changing it more than fighting a strange villain called The Screenslaver, who hypnotizes while you watch. <br/><br/>Obviously, a subtheme of this multilayered allegory is the enslavement of the populace to it screens. Yet, Bird does not enslave the audience to theme, e.g., a race sequence in which Elastigirl, Helen Parr (voice of Holly Hunter), chases a hover train taken over to head to destruction is as furious a ride on a motorcycle as you have ever seen.<br/><br/>Not all is heavy-duty: Baby Jack-Jack fights a raccoon, funny in himself, with baby showing hitherto unknown powers. The sequence is high humor using a baby as a rib-tickling comedian-hero. Add to this slapstick the light orchestration of composer Michael Giacchino and you have a sci-fi animation with soul.<br/><br/>That's the irony of this inspired animation and real life--sometimes even the good has to fight to be recognized, or to be legitimized: ""You know it's crazy, right? To help my family, I gotta leave it. To fix the law, I gotta break it."" (Helen Parr) Incredibles 2 is primarily about bringing back heroes to the public fold and figuring out how to break the law in order to fix it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what's a super mom to do when duty calls and she must leave the family under the untrained care of dad, Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson). Bird doesn't make Bob a boob (although there are laughs at his expense), but rather has the rest of the family pitch in to help with major challenge, baby Jack-Jack with hitherto unknown super powers.<br/><br/>Bird recognizes the need for dads to fit in the management of the house, for instance, as he tries to untangle a mess with daughter Violet's (Sarah Vowell) date, who discovers she's a superhero. He misses their date, and dad must do some intricate counseling of his head-strong daughter. Even for a superhero, that's a tough challenge.<br/><br/>But the super heroism most prominent is that of Mom, as good an example of the best of #MeToo that allows a woman to be empowered publicly and fulfilled privately, with a little help from her family. <br/><br/>One of the best films of the year and in the animation canon for all time."

"anthonyf94","7","2","3","9 October 2019"," Superheroes and superparents
","After fifteen years, Incredibles come back to show their powers and their familiar problems. In a world that doesn't accept superheroes (in the same way of X-Men), these incredible creatures have to hide themself and destroy their impulse to help society. The occasion that makes Elastigirl able to become again a great superheroine, and to obtain the rights' recognizing for superheroes, makes also Mr. Incredibile deal with his problematic children and with the most difficult superpowers: managing a family.<br/><br/>It is in these coordinates that the movie goes on, putting this family against a villain that use screens to influence people (a strong critic to modern society) but also against the risk of disintegration. Jack-Jack and his numerous powers isn't only an instruments for funny sketches, but also a kind of symbolism of difficulty of dealing with powers.<br/><br/>So, wonderful graphics and a story that's interesting for enlightenment of backstages of superheroes and their quotidian problems, make this movie appreciable, especially considering that's a sequel. Maybe it could be a little shorter and a little more precise in narrative evolution, but surely it deserves to be watched."

","This follows after the first movie. Superheroes continue to be banned. The family battles a supervillain causing havoc in the city. They become outcasts, unemployed, and penniless. The wealthy Deavor siblings, heads of the tech company Devtech, recruit Frozone and then the family to make superheroes great again. They convince Elastigirl to be the face of the revival while Mr. Incredible has to play Mr. Mom.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, this is fun. It's a solid superhero movie and a fine family adventure. There is one hilarious scene with Jack-Jack and a raccoon. The only misstep is wiping Tony's memories. It would be so much more compelling for Tony to know Violet's secret and have them deal with that. It would make the young romance much more powerful and more dangerous. He could be a damsel in distress or he could slip up with the secret. There are more possibilities with him knowing. I would like Dash to dial back the bratty kid act by a half level. This continues to be great for the loving family at its center. I love Mr. Incredible figuring out how to use Jack-Jack as a laser gun. It's a fun movie and a fun franchise."
"ajzeg","8","2","3","15 September 2019"," I really enjoyed this one.
","I haven't seen the original in forever (I know, I'm a bad Pixar fan), so I can't really compare it to the first movie, but from what I remember of it, this seemed to get across the same spirit. It had great comedy, great animation, great action, and a good story with good characters! It's very well-written and well-done overall, and I recommend it to anyone!"
"benm-41751","7","2","3","14 September 2019"," In some ways a perfect sequel, in other ways disappointing - but a slick and solid adventure either way
","The hesitancy to make a sequel to The Incredibles was understandable. While its on-the-nose cavalier suave wasn't for everyone, the first film was so well-paced and balanced between action and drama that planning out a worthy follow-up was almost impossible. The first film also did something incredible (pun intended) by balancing nostalgia for superheroes with a unique angle that made them very mortal beings and set it apart from other super movies.<br/><br/>In some ways, Incredibles 2 did the best job possible of leading where the other left off. Rather than kidding anyone by trying to step over the Underminer ending of the first film, it picks up and shows us the epic action sequence that we expected to see. With animation that is updated yet extremely faithful to the original, the movie maintains the fast-paced mix of intense action, stylish moves, and funny family drama. At moments it even captures that dazzling feeling of seeing the inventions of the Incredibles universe for the first time. Instead of trying too hard to go in a new direction, it almost acts like a ""next installment"" by keeping many of the plot elements of the first movie but reversing many of the roles. This makes it a wholly enjoyable watch that isn't missing many things we were hoping for.<br/><br/>At the same time, the by-the-numbers emulation of the first movie's greatness makes ever meeting or surpassing its greatness impossible. Incredibles 2 is, for all its efforts, essentially a repeat of the first story. Since it's not entering uncharted territory and stays in the comfy zone of predictability, the stakes feel much lower than they did in the first movie. What I found most disappointing, though, was that the maturity and subtlety levels went downward for this sequel, as most of the character development of the first movie was completely reset for the new movie. Bob and Helen Parr were almost acting like irritating caricatures of themselves rather than a couple who had gone through any major breakthough together, and the kids were back to bickering and whining for much of the movie before their maturity was allowed to return. While Jack Jack's antics were funny and inevitable, his prolonged presence on the screen felt like a band-aid for the unpredictability that was missing. I know it's not fair to hold Pixar up to a godly standard for each of its films, but some of the immaturity and the gimmicks of Incredibles 2 felt like the things that lesser-regarded studios would resort to rather than them.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 doesn't attempt nor come close to replacing its source movie, which is perhaps wise but also removes its capacity to be a great movie. We're still left with many of the great things that entertained and wowed us in the first movie - and the hopes that another installment isn't too far behind."

","I'll be quick and to-the-point. ""The Incredibles"" (2004) was simply the best and greatest animated film to come out in 2004. It was a love-labor to superhero lore, as well as a bold-faced SATIRE of superhero lore - done in animated form, by the one American animation studio to top them all off, Pixar. ""The Incredibles"" was a box office success and critical hit. So the question was, how could writer-director Brad Bird and his team of animators at Pixar follow it up?<br/><br/>We got that answer with 2018's ""Incredibles 2."" While not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it grips you from its opening moments and holds your attention for the entire duration of its 118-minute running time. This sequel is bigger, bolder, and more family-centered than the first one; but don't let that fool you, there are still plenty of thunderous action sequences and moments of laugh-out-loud comedy and genuinely heartfelt family times to keep you interested.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, and watch one of the most ""Incredible"" sequels ever made.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Here's my review of Incredibles 2. So the super family shows up 14 years after it's release and is directed by Brad bird ( I know it sounds like a superhero name ) the genius behind Ratatouille, Toy story and other Pixar classics. I liked how they continued right where the first movie left off and also continued using analog tech from then without switching to smartphones for the new movie. Before calling it a Pixar movie it's first a superhero movie and that calls for a good villain . Was there a good villain ? .... Kind of ...ish. when you're playing masked identity with the villain then you should make sure that there are many suspects like a Scooby Doo epsiode. So yeah , you find out who the big baddie is within the first few minutes and the reveal didn't come out as a surprise . And Jack jack , my God. This baby and his superpower experimenting is so cool and adorable to watch at the same time. No sooner will jack jack plushie dolls start hitting the market. I also liked how this movie was big in size as a sequel but also had a light hearted story than the first one. The action in this movie is amazing. and it shows how much difference cgi can make to a franchise 14 years later. In the end Incredibles 2 was what I expected , it's the most fun I've had with animated movies in recent years after zootopia. With great characters , an iconic soundtrack , family bonding , jack jack , and one exclusive clothing line from Edna mode which can give Gucci a run for it's money. ( With no capes of course .)"
"mckaymalcolm","6","2","3","23 June 2019"," Passable
","Thankfully I waited until I could stream in the house, if I'd actually taken the family to the cinema I'd have been quite miffed.
Pretty poor storyline tbh, and one or two laughs - but overlong, at nearly two hours. That's fine if it's fast, funny and engaging - but it definitely missed the mark on the last two points.
My daughter had never seen the original - wish I'd sat and watched that instead, as we all know how good that is, and Incredibles2 doesn't come close.
All in all the kids will enjoy - but the adults will zone out. Hope they don't make a 3rd."

With Brad Bird at the wheel, I had hopes it would be on level with the first movie, but instead we got a mixed bag with characters acting nothing like they did in the original. Dash was a brat, Bob was a selfish idiot and Jack-Jack filled up to much screen time without it adding to the story. However, Frozone and Violett acted how you would expect.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable and uninteresting but at least there were some cool action scenes.<br/><br/>All in all a very underwhelming and disappointing experience - would not recommend"

","I get why many people complain that this movie fell victim of the times that we live in, that it tries to be politically correct, being one of the aspects that make this movie bad. I disagree wholeheartedly, this movie could have been done ten years ago and still would have made a positive impact. Helen being given the spotlight makes it different, more dynamic. Sure, it is predictable, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. How it all flows to get to the climax is really entertaining. Plus, we see Jack Jack in action, talk about a highlight.<br/><br/>If Mr. Incredible is bad at domestic situations, it's because he never bothered dealing with them in the first place, it's the nature of the character not to worry about stuff like that, and just leave it to Helen. Sexist? Yes, but that's how the characters were built in the first movie, and that's how they were constructed as a family core, to be as traditional as it comes.<br/><br/>This film fell victim of the times we live in, because most folks feel that Helen being the main character in this movie is ""feminist propaganda"", just because
feminism is growing stronger by the day, so anything that involves a strong woman in the lead is ""feminist propaganda"". It's absolutely absurd, and I feel sorry for those people. This is a great movie, fun, entertaining, with a different dynamic. Watch it and see it for yourself."

This is what live action animation should look like : all CGI, but never distracting, overdone (within the movie's context) or mechanical. The story was just as brilliant and funny as part one. Layered, orginal, stylish, with action, comedy, suspense and drama perfectly dosed. To be completely honest the villain felt a tad less threatening because in the first movie this really came out of the blue. The reason why for being a villain was a little far fetched. Anyway, I was expecting the worst as I loved the first and this one is more in Disney's hands then part one was, and honestly... other superhero movies they made really went downhill with every sequel.

Something that Marvel has cherished in their movies (especially when it came to the Captain America and Iron Man feud or whatever you want to call it), is also present here.<br/><br/>But you also get a glimpse of how to deal with getting powers or rather how others deal with that (coming of age, parenting, whatever you want to call it). It's really well made and it is a worthy sequel. If you like your animation to also challenge you socially, while still being as entertaining as possible - look no further."
"leonblackwood","8","2","3","8 January 2019"," Brilliant movie for all ages! 8/10
","Review:
This is definitely one of my top movies of last year! The animation and the storyline were totally on point, and the witty script made it fun for all ages. There are loads of parenting elements, which a lot of people can relate to, and some of the face expressions cracked me up. Mr. Incredible, Jack Jack and Dash were superb, but I wasn't impressed with some of the new superheroes who turned out to be pretty useless. The porthole character, Voyd, wasn't too bad but she didn't know how to control her powers. She did turn out to be pretty important towards the end, even though she did bounce Elastigirl all over the place but she becomes an important asset to take out the villain of the piece, Evelyn Deavor. Another important asset was Frozone, who was pretty much the same as he was in the first movie but his superpowers, which is to form ice from humidity, helped the Incredibles to stop evil. Through the whole movie, Jack Jack proves to have more superpowers than the rest of his family, but we don't get to see them used to their full capacity in this film. If they decide to release a 3rd Incredibles movie, I can't wait to see what Jack Jack is fully capable of. I don't want to delve too much into the storyline because I don't want to spoil it for those people who haven't seen it, but after the collapse of Superhero Relocation Program, which funds the superheroes, Frozone informs Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl of an offer from Winston Deavor, a wealthy businessman. Winston and his sister, Evelyn, propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and published to regain public trust in superheroes. Due to Mr. Incredibles tendency to cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While she is away, Mr. Incredible struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent. Jack Jack wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers, so Mr. Incredible brings Jack Jack to Edna Mode, who develops a suit that controls his abilities. Meanwhile, Elastigirl captures the Screenslaver, a supervillain who projects hypnotic images using television screens. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realises that he was controlled by a pair of mind-control goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself as the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. She explains that she has hated superheroes since Gazerbeam and Fironic failed to rescue her father from being killed by burglars when she was a child. Her plan is to tarnish superheroes reputation, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. She manages to lure Mr. Incredible into a trap, by using Elastigirl as bait, and after putting the goggles on other superheroes, she attempts to get there children, but they escape with the help of Frozone, who also gets captured and placed under Evelyn's control. Without going into detail, the kids use their superpowers to save the day, by using their superpowers to take the goggles off their parents. Once they are released from Evelyn's power, they take the goggles off all the other superheroes, and they join forces to take out Evelyn. It's definitely packed full of action and comedy throughout, and the attention to detail is truly amazing. Since Pixar has moved to Disney, I haven't really been that impressed with there latest projects, like Cars 3 and the Good Dinosaur, but Brad Bird really did produce something special with this sequel. After watching the bonus material on the disk, he certainly pushed his staff to the limit, after the popularity of the first movie, and the Pixar shorts which are included on in the box, which includes BOA and Auntie Edna, are also amazing. In all, this is definitely worth a watch, and I can honestly say that you will end up watching more than once. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Brad Bird, who also brought you The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and the disappointing Tomorrowland: A World Beyond. With the Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom coming out in 2018, this movie didn't stand a chance in being the top film for that year, but it did come in 4th place, which it truly deserved. It's currently in 15th place for the biggest movie of all time, with the original movie at 131st place, so it certainly went down well with audiences worldwide. The film made $182.7million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film. As it takes so long to make an animation movie of this calibre, I doubt that we are going to see another Incredibles movie anytime soon, but the storyline is left open, especially with Jack Jack and his new found powers.<br/><br/>Budget: $200million
Worldwide Gross: $1.25Billion<br/><br/>Genre: Animation, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Sci-Fi
Cast: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Eli Fucile, Bob Odenkirk, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Bird, Isabella Rossellini, Jonathan Banks, and John Ratzenberger. 8/10"
"richardgeuter","6","2","3","11 November 2018"," Suffers from predictability, but the presentation is still very good.
","""Incredibles 2"" sees the Parr family split up: Helen 'Elastigirl' is now given the crimefighting to do, while her husband has to manage the family. If I recall correctly, their roles here are slightly reversed from the original, which is interesting because both parents get to show off facets of their characters that were not fully touched upon in the older movie. That's what a sequel is supposed to do, after all.<br/><br/>The necessary result of the split-up is that the film is divided into A-story (superhero shenanigans) and B-story (domestic stuff) that have to come together in the last act. Unfortunately, the A-story is rather predictable and underdeveloped, the B-story lacks structure, and the connection between the two feels a bit forced.<br/><br/>But before I get too down on this film, let me talk a bit about the good things, of which there are many: This is still a thoroughly entertaining film! I did not see it in its original language, so I can't comment on the voice acting (the German dub is pretty good, if anyone cares), but the animation is nice to look at; just detailed enough to make the world tangible, but never to the extent that the film forgets it's a cartoon. There are some very neatly designed environments and set-pieces that ensure the film never looks dull, and though there are funnier Pixar movies, they never go too long without cracking a joke or two. There are also a great number of visual jokes and clever camera angles. The only negative to the visual presentation of the film is that some of the action scenes don't follow any rules of physics, so there is very little tension to them.<br/><br/>What made me have a rather middling reception to the film (at least compared to the first one) had mostly to do with the way the story was told. In the first act, the movie touches upon some interesting themes (Do we have to follow the law if the law is unjust? etc.), but it never gets too far in developing them before throwing in the generic villain of the week. The conflicts between the family are generally well-developed, but their solution is forced due to the formulaic structure of the movie.<br/><br/>Another big issue to me was that the Helen-goes-crimefighting storyline was painfully predictable. Though it had some cool visual ideas, you can see almost all of the plot points coming from miles away. The family subplot was far more entertaining, mainly thanks to the larger number of jokes. None of the character arcs were too far out of the ordinary (Violet's crush doesn't like her back, Jack-Jack discovers his powers, Bob is in over his head being the stay-at-home dad), but from the storytelling in these scenes it is clear that Brad Bird and company cared more about the character interactions and dynamics than the story. As a result, some of the shifts between the family drama and the action-heavy fight against the villain are less than fluent, because the themes are so disparate.<br/><br/>Like many other kids' animation films, this movie feels like there are two stories that weren't strong enough to hold its audience's attention on their own, so they threw them together and tried to make that work. As a result, ""Incredibles 2"" is a disappointment, but a minor one and measured against its (great) predecessor. So it's still miles above the last couple ""Despicable Me"" movies or similar films. I wouldn't rush out to buy the blu-ray, but the next time I watch the original, I might just make it a double feature."
"classicsoncall","8","2","3","8 November 2018"," ""I eat thunder and crap lightning, baby!""
","I think I liked this one better than the original, but it's been a while since I've seen it so my memory is a little fuzzy. My summary line I believe, was originally uttered in slightly different form by Burgess Meredith in one of the 'Rocky' movies, but for kids today it's got to be a hoot coming from Mr. Incredible. I have to second his observation and share the sentiments about today's math; I think it teaches kids how to go the long way around getting to an answer.<br/><br/>The basic story idea here comes from Marvel Comics and The X-Men with the government shutting down 'The Supers', and the villainous 'Screenslaver' wanting to keep it that way. There's a personal vendetta she holds against super heroes for the death of her parents; Evelyn/Screenslaver's father died while relying on them to get his family out of a jam. Helen 'Elastigirl' Parr takes center stage for most of the story as the face of the rehabilitated super hero community, until Screenslaver's diabolical plot is set in motion to prove that they're not worthy of a revival. There's a bit of political and social commentary in Screenslaver's philosophy - ""People will trade quality for ease every time"". Only she wants to do something about it.<br/><br/>Well, this sequel was a long time in coming and I can't imagine why. ""The Incredibles"" came out in 2004, and here it's 2018 already, a long time to recall that the first picture ended with The Underminer rampage which opens this picture. With this one, youngest Parr sibling Jack-Jack is endowed with super powers of his own, and as a 'polymorph', he keeps you guessing with just exactly how many. As before, Edna Mode is a trip, and if it were up to me, she would be a good character to spin off into her own action flick. Whoever might decide on that, I hope it doesn't take another fourteen years to get around to it."

"movieMaoam","7","2","3","11 October 2018"," Felt like Finding Dory
","As a kid I was a really big fan of the Incredibles, creating my own Incredibles 2, wondering how the story could progress and what went on with the Underminer. Since today I think the first entry is one of the best movies Pixar ever made. Equally excited was I, when the first trailer for the sequel dropped, but I promised myself to let the old fantasies about this movie go, to get a proper and less biased view on the film.
Incredibles 2 courageously starts, where the first movie ended, which slingshots you right back into the action, the characters and incredibly cool early 60s vibe. You feel directly connected to the first film and can look at everything like a continuation of events.
So, you can sense new traits, problems and topics about every character of the Parr family. Especially the turnaround of the parents' rolls is interesting to watch. While Helen is as Elastigirl part of a superhero image campaign and rescues the citizen of Metroville, Bob stays at home, failing to convert his incredibleness over to householding and family business. These funny and entertaining family sequences are connected with intense action scenes, which are better than ever. Still the movie can't manage to give the plot a similar weight and strong message as the first one did. The story never reaches any heights or surprises you with twists; almost everything is form the beginning on clear to everyone, who doesn't fall into the 8-year old target audience. At the end it sadly all falls with the antagonist, which has disappointing motives, without any relatable reasons as Snydrome in the original had.
And how do I connect Incredibles 2 with Finding Dory? To me both movies knew their predecessors' strengths and could continue them in their sequel. The known characters are still full of heart, the Art Direction and Soundtrack even exceed Incredibles, becoming to the best one, Pixar ever created. Unfortunately, both, Finding Dory and Incredibles 2, couldn't follow the established, extremely high cleverness of their predecessor."

","Incredibles 2 had enormous expectations to meet and a does a pretty good job, but lacks the last bit to make it another masterpiece. The animation, though, is noticably more detailed and increases the rush of adrenaline we'll get whenever the action kicks in.<br/><br/>No doubts about my enjoyment watching this long awaited sequel, because I know of Brad Birds expertise. It had a whole lot of heart and humour put into it, but became rather predictable in terms of who the villain was. But Jack-Jack's antics while being with Bob at home was hilarious and pretty much stole the show.<br/><br/>The whole villain thing is actually the only really noticable problem with the movie, because of the lack of originality or surprise in the identity. Let's just say that you can figure it out pretty quickly. Syndrome is also a hard one to compete with in terms of memorability.<br/><br/>The movie manages to expand the world in which they live in and add some more of the superheroes we only got few glimpses of in the original. It was a nice addition, and who knows, maybe we'll get to see more of them in the future? <br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a worthy sequel, despite a weak villain."

"gareth_neal","10","2","3","29 July 2018"," I LOVED this film
","I created an IMDB account to write this review as a cannot believe the negativity. <br/><br/>1. I'll address the feminist BS. I have 2 daughters, I constantly show them examples of strong women, leading women. There is nothing 'wrong' here. I do not feel emasculated by anything here. Women are not inferior, showing them as leading any situation is not denigrating to men, it's just what happens sometimes. 50:50 in terms of Incredibles films seems about right to me. <br/><br/>When I had to be a stay at home Dad, I had to learn how to do it. And, some of that was funny. That's all that is being shown here. Substitute Bob for a 40-something childless anyone and the result would be the same. And there are plenty of points where Bob is clearly 'the man' they are just more subtle. And he does work it out and gets to connect with his daughter because of it. <br/><br/>Anyone who sees an agenda here is lost in their own insecurities. Which is the point the film makes I suppose. <br/><br/>2. The swearing and drinking. It happens in life, we drink, we swear, the film is a PG, not a U. That's parental guidance. Do a pre-screen, check out IMDB, but, if you went to a non-animated PG, you'd expect this. So, it's on you for not checking.<br/><br/>3. Why moan about things that aren't there? If you go into any movie with a preconception of what it should be, you will always be disappointed. The fact that Underminer wasn't explored......does it matter? Etc. Etc. <br/><br/>4. My review of the film. <br/><br/>Firstly, some of the animation and rendering in this film was breathtaking. I absolutely forgot I was watching an animation in points. The reflections from Underminer's machine were sublime. Until characters more like Megamind than Incredibles turned up. But I soon got over that.<br/><br/>The style was so good. So good that the setting was accepted totally. I didn't matter that the technology pushed the period of the film (much like the first). <br/><br/>The story was good enough, the jokes were, in places laugh out loud funny and both me and my six year old were high fiving because we were enjoying it so much. <br/><br/>Incredibles was in my top 5. This is in my Top 3. If I hadn't seen 1, then I can see how some of the characters are not built as well. But as it is a direct follow on in timeline terms, I can forgive this. <br/><br/>Jack-Jack. Brilliant. Comedy gold. A superhero baby that has unknown abilities. How far can this go?<br/><br/>Turns out, it can go some very funny and conceptually brilliant places. The raccoon scene was superb.<br/><br/>The new supers are a bit forced but do add to the film and again, some of Void's fight scenes are so imaginative. <br/><br/>The villain. Ah yes, the villain. It wasn't obvious, I thought it was the man first. Then as it became apparent it wasn't him, the dark side of the real villain came out. Showing that Woman can be as villainous as men as well (not supposed to be a good thing). <br/><br/>I could go on for a lot longer. <br/><br/>It's one of Pixar's greatest films and I LOVED it and I Loved that my daughter saw it too."

","I'm so glad they finally made a sequel to the original. It just starts at the end of the previous film, and continues the issues the same story line with the issue of being a superhero family where superheroes are banned. The plot is fairly straightforward and I was able to spot who the villain is about a quarter the way into the film. But for me, that was less important than the way in which the situation's resolved. I look forward to #3 which I hope isn't in 14 years time.<br/><br/>However, I had a major issue with certain scenes in the film that have STROBING. I have a history of EPILEPSY when I was young, and the strobe filled sequences induced a huge amount of anxiety in me as I felt like a seizure was coming on! The only way I could look at it was looking half away from the screen, and with my spectacles off. No warning about that at all. Did they not consider epilepsy?!"
"jboothmillard","7","2","3","19 July 2018"," Incredibles 2
","It had been fourteen years since the first Disney/Pixar computer animated movie, a month or two before the official release critics were being very positive about this sequel, I was really looking forward seeing to it, directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol). Basically it picks right up where it left off, three months after defeating Syndrome, the Parr family: father/husband Bob aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), mother/wife Helen aka Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), son Dashiell ""Dash"" (Huck Milner) and daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) work together, with fellow superhero Lucius Best/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), to try and stop The Underminer (John Ratzenberger). But as in the past, they only manage to cause more damage, meaning lawsuits, and the reputation of superheroes in Metroville, since the legal ban of them, has not been improved. Then Bob and Helen meet superhero fan Winston Deavor (Breaking Bad's Bob Odenkirk), owner of telecommunications corporation DevTech, he and his genius inventor sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) propose a series of publicity stunts to help regain public support and trust in Supers. Helen is chosen as the spearhead for this campaign, while the rest of the Parr family are given a new home. Bob is jealous of Helen getting superhero missions, while he has to be a stay-at-home dad, he is helping Dash with his complicated maths homework, Violet is mad at him after her crush Tony Rydinger (Michael Bird) had his memory erased by government agent Rick Dicker (Jonathan Banks) before a date they had arranged, and baby Jack-Jack is causing chaos with his multiple superpowers. While Bob gets super fashion designer Edna Mode (Brad Bird) to temporarily babysit Jack-Jack, and he helps out his other two kids, Elastigirl is constantly confronted by Screenslaver, a mysterious supervillain who projects hypnotic images through television screens. It is later revealed that Evelyn is Screenslaver, and has the power to control minds, including those of Supers, she plans to stop the government from ever changing the law of Supers existing in and serving society. Many Supers are captured and hypnotised to serve Evelyn, but Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape, and snapping their parents and Frozone out of the trance, they work together to stop a large plot publicity stunt that threatens the city. In the end, the city is saved, and Evelyn is arrested for her crimes, and Supers around the world regain full legal status, but of course, the Parrs cannot relax for long as another bad guy is being chased by the police. Also starring Sophia Bush as Karen/Voyd, Phil LaMarr as Krushauer and He-Lectrix, Paul Eiding as Gus Burns/Reflux, Isabella Rossellini as The Ambassador, Barry Bostwick as Mayor and Usher as Lucius Best's valet. The voice actors all do their parts well, the animation is fantastic, the story is interesting, it is exciting in the right moments, and it has some great laughs, the best and funniest scenes are with Jack-Jack, just about as enjoyable as the original, a terrific animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!"
"lasttimeisaw","7","2","3","2 July 2018"," there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity
","A 3D viewing of Pixar's 12th feature film, INCREDIBLES 2, an overdue sequel, 14 years after its 2004 blockbuster, a time even Bryan Singer's much maligned reboot SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) had yet to reach the silver screen, a very different picture from today's glut of superhero consumption.<br/><br/>INCREDIBLES 2's biggest challenge, save for treating its gaping generational shift with kid gloves (viz, drawing on the nostalgia of Generation Y and recruiting new kids who might have no inkling of its predecessor), comes to that daunting question, as an art-form, what animation could excel if its live-action counterpart can also achieve a similar if more captivating visual effects? especially when the storyboard is strictly human-based, on a general afterthought, nothing in this film seems to strictly require this treatment (the most demanding parts might be Elastigirl and baby Jack-Jack's psionic powers), and the answer to that question does not look rosy. <br/><br/>With Brad Bird returning to preside over the project after his live-action sorties in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL (2011) and TOMORROWLAND (2015), INCREDIBLES 2 grandly carries Pixar's torch in concocting a sagacious and innovative story-line out of the genre's default family-friendly tenet, here, we have an appreciable role-swapping borne out of USA's current climate's gender study, Elastigirl becomes the breadwinner while Mr. Incredible takes a back seat in attending to their kids, indeed it is the latter part that registers most fun and laughter, a stay-at-home dad's quagmire is brimful of hilarity and commiseration, tonally chimes in with its preceding short Domee Shi's BAO, depicting a typical empty nest phenomenon from a mother's angle, vamped up with an oriental touch.<br/><br/>What becomes problematic is the well-worn trope of saving the world from some evil intrigue, a very American clichÃ© Bird has no intention of steering away, although through the message from and the designation of its ostensible antagonist Screenslaver, the film manages to alert viewers of today's pandemic inertia and non-action that partly can be chalked up to a pernicious passivity hugely influenced by notion of waiting for a superhero, and an attention span deformed by our screen-gazing mentation, but that sounds too adult-minded, hence, its lucid cogitation about superpowers expectedly and frustratingly gives way to a conventional, business-as-usual denouement, which overall, renders the picture a few notches below Pixar's more esteemed titles.<br/><br/>Back to my initial question, the impact of its sleek strings of action set pieces ineluctably pales in comparison with the ones from its more visceral live-action cousins, as there are no eye-popping new characters or spectacles to deaden the over-familiarity, and admittedly, speaking from a personal perspective, the allure of animation and one's own age have been in inverse proportion ever since one reaches adolescence, if only that could be the sole legit excuse for one's mild disappointment of this case."

"Yedee","8","1","1","15 April 2020"," The sequel that delivered
","This film delivers in what it intends to do- entertain. For all the hype leading from our childhoods, the incredibles 2 gives us our super hero family facing obstacles both villains and their personal battles.<br/><br/>Similar to the previous plot, the incredibles 2 enhances the idea of normal civilians vs superheros. In fact the movie starts off with just that, a normal boy who couldn't believe his crush was the famous invisible girl on tv. He struggles to understand how he feels about this until ultimately succumbing to the memory erasure. We start seeing our heroes off with a bang- facing the underminer villain. By failing to stop the destruction however, this leads to their quick notoriety for being a burden to society and not letting the police force do their due dilligence. Constantly, this theme is enforced of the mythical heroes helping people in need while being held responsible for their actions. The bill to legalize super heroes is placed and the objective of the movie. This works well by introducing new heroes, while upholding the roots of the original film.<br/><br/>The good: The incredibles provides spotlight to FEMALE heroes. One of the rare movies that actually enforces women to fight their own battles, not be the damsel in distress. Elastigirl being the figurehead of heroes is awesome, she isn't just mr incredibles wife, shes independent, rational, intelligent and secure enough to fight her own battles just like she did before her husband. Violet having the unique power of being invisible would make fights difficult for her, but the producers do well in not showcasing this. She shows strong initiative along with Dash to take matters into her own hands and save her family. She isn't some moody teenager with a cliche teenage romance, she can dish it when she wants on top of that. Violet has great character development from the first movie thats just added on.<br/><br/>Scenes are amazing. The train chase-down with elastigirl on her motorcycle dodging fast roaming cars, her free crawling (ala spiderman) across the city, the building chasedown of screenslaver, the boat. They are all beautifully animated and different from on another. While the settings are different from the first movie and each other, each provides intense value and magnificence.<br/><br/>The main message of family first over everything is once again enforced in this movie. Its a clear heart-felt message for everyone- young and old that no matter how different people may be from others, or even each other, love is binding and important. The characters do comes to grips with this not just through fighting villains but ordinary activities like the growth of the children and Mr incredible playing the role of housewife.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious around all characters. It isn't just stupid funny, for a younger audience, but comedy is centered around the characters for mistakes and misunderstandings which even we could relate to. The film doesn't push this with longer scenes in a cringe like attempt to induce laughs, it times it perfectly well infused in this situation.<br/><br/>The bad-
Being an action movie, some of the fights are subpar. Take MR.Inc for instance- his only fights come from either the beginning of the movie or the end. These aren't truly satisfying fights either for the Father of the incredibles because he doesn't truly succeed- he doesn't get the miner and he doesn't stop screenslaver (his wife does). There should have been more fights featured for him being of the most important and arguable main character of the show. The climax is ruined not just for him, but everyone as there isn't a real menacing villain but a normal lady whose objective doesn't even make sense. (Outlawing heroes because her father died due to being unable to reach them isn't really a heroes fault.... ?)Villain aside, none of the heroes seem to be pushed to the brink of their effort aside from elastigirl who only seems to get the blunt force of this. It doesn't feel like a climax of a hit movie, just another day for the crew.<br/><br/>Through the whole movie Mr Incredible. plays the house wife. I get it, destroying gender norms by having the husband doing the wives work, however MR INC is shown to be incompetent and lazy at times. I think his character is somewhat butchered here because all he does is fail with Violet's romance, unable to understand Dash's basic math, and not even dependable to look after a toddler child. I'm not sure if they were going for the dumb meat head look but thats all Mr. Incredible seems to give off, unlike the previous film.<br/><br/>Dash is not a good character. I wish we could see more from him except the film only shows him being comedy relief, most of the time even just being plain annoying to the cast. He doesn't seem to grow at all except for the incredibile sequence of pushing a button. There should have been more fights for Dash or some sort of plot centered around him but his character seems to be neglected throughout the movie. In fact, his sole purpose of being comedy relief and the jester of the family seems to have gotten eclipsed by his younger brother. The one in diapers....<br/><br/>Overall, the film is great, myopic for being entertaining and flashy. There is critique here and there but being a film more on children, I don't think its fair to evaluate for things its not supposed to be. Unfortunately it doesn't deserve a perfect rating because of it's neglect on certain characters and a lackluster ending."

Being an animated film about superheros, nothing is out of the question when it comes to what you will see on screen.

","Thoroughly enjoyable, with (no surprise) astonishing animation, including a few sequences that manage to surpass the original. The increased focus on the Parr family's dynamics is handled with humour and restraint, and works far better than I'd feared. Jack-Jack is a complete delight, as of course is Edna Mode; and Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson manage to bring even more nuance to their characters---which were pretty damn good the first time round.<br/><br/>But. . . . The plot, compared with Incredibles #1, seemed sprawling. Not ridiculously complex, but it lacked the original's laser intensity and clarity. Still, my main disappointment came early on, when we are told who the villain is, before any hint that there even IS a mastermind villain. We're introduced to Evelyn Deavor, and it takes about a quarter of a second to translate that into ""Evil Endeavor."" That reveals most of the subsequent plot, and the end of any suspense.<br/><br/>I'll be watching the first ""Incredibles"" movie again, certainly, but not this one.

"Blazehgehg","6","1","1","19 April 2019"," The Next Episode
","There's honestly nothing really wrong with The Incredibles 2. If all you're looking for is a solid family movie, it's enjoyable enough, with lots of action and fun characters.<br/><br/>But I can't shake the feeling that there's something about it that's... ""off"" feeling. It took Pixar fourteen years to make a sequel that is, by all accounts, a little more than average. The original Incredibles was a breath of fresh air, and the best super hero movie in its time. It broke new ground for Pixar in every aspect.<br/><br/>This just feels like the next episode of a television series. Everyone is kind of settling in to a status quo and the adventures continue. I know it's a weird complaint for a movie that's not actually bad.<br/><br/>Part of that, I think, has to do with the film's themes. The first Incredibles had the villain Syndrome, who defined the whole movie's attitude toward super heroes. It touched on how fans interact with their idols, the reality of being a ""super"", and the very real reasons people may resent them for their enhanced abilities. Those elements anchored everything in something more thoughtful than just punching out the bad guys in a secret volcano lair.<br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 lacks that anchor. It hamfistedly gestures towards the topics of media consumption and gender equality, but ultimately chooses to say nothing about either issue. Instead, it fills most of the movie with very standard superhero antics punctuated by smaller slices of family dynamic. It's all still fun... but they just aren't as deeply rooted as the themes of that first movie.<br/><br/>Again, it's just The Incredibles, but more of it. And unlike some movie sequels that feel like they're trying to replicate the formula of the first movie, Incredibles 2 stands out as its own thing. It just doesn't breach any new subjects. Instead, it comfortably rests in the shadow of the original.<br/><br/>For most people, that's good enough. But I was hoping for something a little more incredible."

","After a 14 year wait Brad Bird showcases everything that makes him a master of animation by throwing us back into the wonderfully creative world of everyone favourite super family. Naturally there have been comparisons made to the 2004 original and I have to agree that the first movie is definitely the better of the two. However that does not mean that this is not an absurdly entertaining and well executed movie.<br/><br/>Bird leans into the Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic even more for this film than last time and his attitude of writing and directing action scenes as if it were for a high budget live-action film makes for some pulse racing moments serving as a good reminder for why Ghost Protical is the best Mission Impossible! There are also some really funny moments (a stand out scene comes to mind involving a raccoon) and all of the characters feel as relatable and fully realised as they did in 2004<br/><br/>.My one issue is that the villain subplot in 3rd act reveal are pretty weak, this is why I think people are so quick to compare the two films.

","""Incredibles 2"" (2018) is a professionally animated action adventure comedy that carries the loveable fun from ""The Incredibles"" (2004). In this sequel, the family is charged with changing the concept of ""supers"" through recorded hero actions with Helen, Elastigirl,"" voiced by Holly Hunter, taking the lead. I loved the role reversal with Helen being the desired hero to take the lead, but I think the added screen time for Jack Jack, voiced by Eli Fucile, was the biggest family favorite. Everything Jack Jack did in this film produced hysterical laughter in my family. I am usually very skeptical of sequels, but this film is just as good as the first one with exception to some heavy foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Brad Bird continues his reputation with character connections to the audience. Every character is identifiable in my own family and I just love that. The story is great, but anticipated, which makes the foreshadowing so difficult to avoid. To keep from spoiling the film, I would say the best way to have adjusted the undesired, would have been to make the bad guy a little less sketchy. This way it is a little less obvious that the bad guy is essentially broadcasted from the beginning. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and recommend a view if you enjoyed the first one, but once you have deciphered the ""evil one,"" keep it to yourself until the end and just enjoy the film."
"chasemykleby","9","1","1","9 March 2019"," After 14 years the Incredible's are back and in a sequel that, in many ways, surpasses the outstanding original.
","Review for ""Incredible's 2""
(9/10)<br/><br/>After 14 years the Incredible's are back and in a sequel that, in many ways, surpasses the outstanding original. Pixar's Incredibles 2 excels in its ability to balance the important and emotional familial aspects of the story with the exciting superhero antics moviegoers have come to expect in the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The interesting gender role themes that exist for the Parr family also resonate with the Deavors. Evelyn appears to be content with playing second-fiddle to her brother; however, when Helen starts working for Winston by moonlighting as a superhero, she encourages Evelyn to embrace her brilliance and be more outspoken. If Helen's story seems similar to Bob's adventures in the previous movie, don't worry; this time around, the Parrs are acting as a team from the very beginning.
Without going into spoilers, let's just say that Elastigirl's missions are fun to watch and when Dash, Violet, Bob, and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) get involved in the action, it feels like you're looking at an animated version of Avengers. Jack Jack steals every scene he's in, and he even gets a scene all to himself to let the audience know how many powers he has. Incredibles 2 also does a tremendous job of expanding its universe, but not at the expense of the Parr family story, which is always front and center.
Brad Bird's strong script and direction elevate this animated adventure to new heights. Instead of trying to copy or parody the superhero films of the past 14 years, Incredibles 2 embraces what made its first outing so memorable: The Parr family and their willingness to work together in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","1","1","8 March 2019"," A second outing for The Incredibles that comes a decade too late.
","Before we start, I have to say that The Incredibles (2004) is perhaps my favorite Pixar film. Back when superhero films were starting to become successful (albeit, not nearly as lucratively successful as the Marvel Cinematic Universe), The Incredibles artfully blended a superhero film with a family/midlife crisis plot that worked on so many levels. It is then no surprise that I was truly looking forward to its sequel, Incredibles 2 (2018). In the back of my head, I knew that most of Pixar's talent had switched over to Disney about eight years ago, but I hoped enough of the original team would be around to make this sequel something special.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, time seems to have worked against Incredibles 2. If this had come out ten years ago, it would have enjoyed some of the originality that comes with beating the Marvel behemoth out of the gate. As it is now, I'm not sure if Incredibles 2 is directly referencing these movies (like Watchmen (2009)), or if it's just stuck in the shadow of its predecessors (like Iron Man 3 (2013)). What's perhaps more disturbing is that the cartoony aesthetic for the characters established in the first film is now straddling that uncanny valley to the point that this movie almost looks like Dreamworks' Megamind (2010).<br/><br/>While all the neat bits from the first film made an encore in this movie, it's a little disappointing that they didn't build any character development into it. Sure, you could say the Mr. Mom (1983) bit was new, but it still centered around Mr. Incredible's (Craig T. Nelson) pride like the first film. There was a bit of re-balancing that was nice, including more action sequences and a spot-on score by Michael Giacchino that improves on the original. In the end, I wanted to like Incredibles 2 more, but perhaps my nostalgia is wearing off.<br/><br/>A second outing for The Incredibles that comes a decade too late, I give Incredibles 2 3.5 stars out of 5."
"HorrorFanatic4Life","10","1","1","3 March 2019"," Well worth the wait
","14 years was a long time to wait for a highly anticipated sequel, but it was so worth it. After reading the numerous negative reviews, I can't find a reason why this was so bad. It was funny and greatly animated. To say this film went too far with the feminism and made Mr. Incredible look weak is a terrible way to look at it. I loved that idea and the whole family dynamic. It really showed how much Mrs. Incredible really did for the family and let her husband get a little taste of the stay-at-home mom concept. Aside from that little tidbit, this movie did not disappoint on the animation and comedy (especially the much anticipated Jack-Jack). It really allowed for a better look into each character's personalities. The only disappointment for me was the lack of Edna's appearance - I had hoped that she would have been in it more since her character is so great!"
"TheHonestCritic","10","1","1","1 March 2019"," As Syndrome says in the first movie: ""15 years too late""! That's how long we've been waiting for a sequel! But, was it worth the wait?
","I just saw the movie: ""Incredibles 2"", written and directed by Brad Bird. Starring the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Samuel L. Jackson and more. All I have to say is; good news, they didn't screw it up! This movie is definitely a worthy follow up to the first movie ""The Incredibles"", back in 2004. The first ""Incredibles"" movie is my all-time favorite Pixar movie, so I had a lot of hope and expectation for this film. I can tell you, it definitely reached my expectations! In this movie, they kept a very similar scenario to the first one. The difference was, they switched character roles. They put Mr. Incredible at home, while Elastigirl did the hero work, they put Mr. Incredible in Edna Mode's demonstration room, etc. I don't want to say any more, because I don't want to risk spoiling the movie. Everything in this movie is great; the voice acting, the animation, the soundtrack, excellent. There were two different voice actors though. I was worried that they would make the characters voices too different and distracting from the original. For example: Huck Milner replaced Spencer Fox, who was the original voice of Dash. However, he did a great job with Dash's voice, it was pretty much identical. Also, they changed the voice actor for Rick Dicker. Instead of Bud Luckey, they had Jonathan Banks voice him, due to Bud Luckey's passing (R.I.P.) I think that Banks did a great job, there was a slight difference in the voice. But, his character was there for a short amount of time, so it was not that bad. Other that that, this movie is terrific! If the two different voice actors are my only nitpick, you know you have a great movie. I can't believe it took them nearly 15 years to produce a sequel. Ironically, that's the time period in the first movie where superheroes were illegal. (DID THEY WAIT THAT LONG ON PURPOSE?) Brad Bird even said he had begun developing ideas for ""Incredibles 2"" not long after the first one came out. He certainly made great use of his time! Watching this movie brought me right back to my childhood. I can't wait to see it again! It's not quite as good as the first movie, but it's definitely worth watching in theaters, and buying on DVD. I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Incredibles 2"" yet, you need to check it out. It was incredible! (NO PUN INTENDED). I hope they do make a third one. If they do, I hope it'll come out in less than 15 years this time!"

","Incredibles 2 is a decent, entertaining watch. It is not as good as the first but I don't think many people expected it to be. The animation is as great and the characters are engaging, as expected. The problem is that the story isn't as compelling as the original. It didn't feel like much was happening, honestly. Most of the family is doing normal stuff for most of the movie while Elastigirl and Jack Jack take center stage. The film doesn't take many risks and it suffers because of that. Clearly, there will be a third Incredibles movie but Pixar may have hurt future audiences' expectations by trying to not mess anything up with this sequel."

","This movie is absolutely delightful!!! It's visually stunning and has some of the best animation I've ever seen. This movie also has a simply brilliant script with tons of hilarious moments (often involving Jack-Jack), a fantastic old school, spy themed score from Michael Giachinno and a great voice cast bringing new, colourful characters to life. The action scenes are tremendous and it has an awesome climax. However, I think that the villain's motivation is quite vague and the plot is a little predictable. Despite this, this movie is a fun filled, action packed adventure and one of Pixar's finest.<br/><br/>One of, if not the best animated movie of the last 3 years!!"

The best moments were the parenting moments that I felt (not a spoiler, in the trailer) ""They changed math?"" and falling asleep reading to the baby. Of course the action and humour were there as well, and the highlight being Jack-Jack's rotating powers. I've loved and seen all of Pixar's movies and look forward to the next one."
"mifsudm-75748","8","1","1","11 February 2019"," FULL BREAKDOWN
","BREAKDOWN<br/><br/>Writing (Brad Bird): Here is where the film faults, unfortunately. It had a great foundation that is tripped up by the execution in the script. Making the Screenslaver reveal a big deal was fault #1 and could have been better if dramatic irony was used and we as an audience knew who Screenslaver was but Mrs. Incredible didn't due to her being caught up in her own ego. The dual storylines of Mrs. Incredible and Mr. Incredible were each necessary on their own, but the balance between the two felt off tonally and should have been mixed in a better way. Despite these faults, the allegories to immigration and media manipulation present in the script make this film much more enjoyable. Also, the writing of the new supers is fun and their powers are handled well. My biggest problem after watching this film a second time is the ending. I would have loved to see more fighting between the Incredibles + Frozone and the new supers. It seems the new supers were handled with such ease that they never seemed like a problem besides that first scene at the Incredi-House. Seeing a more prolonged fight would have been more enjoyable than them trying to stop the boat which they could have done while fighting the other supers and would have been more impressive. 5/10<br/><br/>Performances: Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter are perfect in their roles just like last time. The entire cast is fantastic, especially with the new addition of Bob Odenkirk who, once again, brings a character to life with a vibrant performance, this time through voice. 9/10<br/><br/>Cinematography (Mahyar Abousaeedi/Erik Smitt): This film is stunning visually with beautiful frames and smooth, long shots. The most stunning visual, in my opinion, is the fight with Screenslaver in his apartment and the room is flashing with the hypnosis. The animation combined with the excellent lighting and cinematography made it a jaw-dropping scene. 9/10<br/><br/>Editing (Stephen Schaffer): The editing here is amazing during action scenes but sub-par during down moments. It was clear it was tough balancing the two storylines through editing. Sometimes a tense moment with Elastigirl would be interrupted by a cut to what Bob was doing with Jack-Jack. However, it didn't happen enough to qualify a poor rating. 6/10<br/><br/>Visual Effects (Josh Holtsclaw): The animation is INCREDIBLE, pun intended, in this film. Miles ahead of its predecessor. Somehow they managed to make each scene even more stunning than the last through the animation alone. 10/10<br/><br/>Enjoyment: The fights in this film are a lot of fun. And I mean A LOT of fun. The only fight that could have used work was the fight against the new supers at the end. Making that the climax as opposed to the boat being diverted away from the city would have bumped up this rating. Also the poor balance during slow moments takes a hit here because sometimes it makes the movie boring or takes away from the tension. 7/10<br/><br/>Musical Score (Michael Giacchino): Michael Giacchino does it again and makes an exciting score that is perfect just on its own. After seeing this film the first time, I could not get enough of the score and would listen to it while doing chores and writing. Somehow they manage to add on to the excellent score from the first film. 10/10<br/><br/>Sound Mixing: The sound in this film is exciting and loud and mixed well, but we don't get enough atmospheric tone which could have enhanced the film. But with what it is now, it's still great and fits the overall tone of the flick. 8/10<br/><br/>Production Design (Ralph Eggleston): The production design of this film is amazing. Each set speaks for itself and says so much about the characters that own them while also providing excellent backdrops for fights or intimate scenes. 9/10<br/><br/>Summary: 'Incredibles 2' is a visual stunner with mostly exciting setpieces, but suffers in its downtime and its ending. However, it does not fail at providing an excellent allegory to the times we unfortunately live in. 8/10"

","Was waiting to watch this one and had low expectations because I enjoyed the original and figured the sequel couldn't compete with it. But, it was finally on Netflix and the kids wanted to see it, so here we are. I don't know if I've just seen too many movies now or if the writers are just running out of ideas, but this film is basically a paint by number of so many recent films. Within the first 20 minutes, you get an idea of where this is going and who the villians are, and the film follows suit. Sure, the characters are fun as usual, but the story weighs them down and makes the movie feel like its runtime is extremely unnecessary. The kid in me enjoyed the laughs and heroes, but the logical adult in me has seen this story too many times before."

","Very stylish and cool, great animation and some good jokes, it's a very fun romp with familiar characters that flies by really fast. But even without thinking too much, you are left feeling there is something missing.<br/><br/>The main problem is the characters' motivation, mostly the main villain's, which feels a bit hollow and unrealistic, and the problem is that the villain is very obvious from the beginning. The story is also not the best, specifically setting the ending on a boat doesn't make sense for a lot of reasons. Another problem is leaving some loose ends, such as the remote they get for Jack Jack or the first villain.<br/><br/>The ""camera work"" and editing however are great, as well as the photography & design, so the movie looks gorgeous & definitely invites a second viewing"

","Superheroes are still banned. Stopping crime (at least in superhero fashion) costs more than the crime itself, so justice is being delegated to the bean-counters. What little financial support ""The Incredibles"" have is drying up and a mundane existence looks imminent when hope comes in the guise of brother and sister media billionaires (Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener) who want to return superheroes to their rightful place as defenders of society. Unfortunately for Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), his wife, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is seen as more media-friendly and is chosen to be the first hero to get a public-relations makeover, leaving the hulking strongman to look after the kids, including baby Jack-Jack, whose powers are beginning to manifest. Just as Elastigirl's telegenic heroics begin to change attitudes, a new threat appears: a villain who can hypnotise us through the very screens to which we have become addicted. The clever story rolls along nicely, mixing Mr. Incredible's travails as a stay-at-home dad with his wife's enthusiastic stint as the family 'breadwinner' as the true nature of the threat is revealed. With a great script and voice talent, an imaginative story, and fun and fanciful imagery, the Incredibles 2 is a great follow-up to the excellent original."

During this battle they are also joined by the returning hero Frozone (Samuel L Jackson).<br/><br/>While our heroes try and save the day, the damage caused to their beloved city is rather significant. To make matter worse, at this point the city still classes all superheroes as illegal.<br/><br/>However! The Incredibles are soon invited to relaunch themselves afresh and re-attempt to win the public over, proving the world needs superheroes. The only catch is, in order to do this, Mr Incredible will need to be left home to care for the kids while Elastigirl will be the one out and about saving the world.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the original film, I'm thankful this sequel manages to change it up, making the film feel very different to the previous installment. The film also manages to maintain really good character development, including for Baby JackJack as we discover a greater understanding about his hidden powers. Overall, I was enjoying what our heroes delivered on screen once again. I will admit though that I was disappointed by the film's villain. Not only was this person very predictable, but the character alone was uninteresting and forgettable for a family film. Given the screen time this person gets, I just found myself more invested in the family development rather than wanting to understand the villain. Overall, the villain felt more forced rather than flowing with the theme of the sequel.<br/><br/>As one would expect for a Disney film, I have zero complaints about the film's audio and visual track. Hearing the classic Incredibles themes once again is a true delight and I found it brought back great memories of the original, 1st film. That being said, if I'm honest... I preferred the audio track on Incredibles 1 just a little more ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Overall, I feel The Incredibles 2 is a worthy, respectful sequel. As a plot, the film does manages to take a few unpredictable turns in regards to the family's overall character development, but as for the film's villain, this was a let down as it was predictable and forgettable. Nevertheless, I enjoyed seeing the family return and now I'm left curious, wondering what will be in store next for this fun and talented family.<br/><br/>8.4/10

","Picking up immediately after the first film, we find Bob, Helen and the kids still navigating the tricky waters of superhuman illegality, despite saving the world in a handful of very public conflicts. It's great to see the whole cast back again, from headliners Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson to supporting players like Samuel L. Jackson, and the effects have never looked better. Pixar almost always seems to one-up themselves in that respect, but it still bears mentioning - Incredibles 2 is a real sensory spectacle.<br/><br/>The primary story is a let-down, though, like something I'd expect to find in a filler issue between big events. After fourteen years away, I would've hoped for something with a bit more emotional punch, an adventure that feels more essential and complex. Instead, it loosely apes a few smaller subplots from the first film, swaps the headline roles, tosses in a few lazy, telegraphed twists and then wraps it all up on an empty happy note.<br/><br/>Visually dazzling, with a good sense of humor, but generally quite hollow and, sadly, almost completely missing the warm, witty commentary on classic superhero stereotypes that made the original work on so many levels. This felt like a B-team's admirable, but failed, effort to step up to the big leagues."

However, one negative thing about the movie is that i felt like it focused too much on Elastigirl and not enough on the other family members until towards the end of the movie. Overall it was still a pretty decent movie."

","Since 2010, Pixar, the one-time CG animation juggernaut, has been crippled by the sequel bug. The studio that for a solid decade plus made nothing but modern classics, has in recent years strained to imitate the formula that launched them into the animation stratosphere in 1995. The result of this effort? Sequels to nearly all of their most beloved films. Their latest, and possibly most anticipated, is Incredibles 2. The original Incredibles is one of the five most influential movies of my childhood, and a perfect action movie in its own right, yet I was firmly in the minority when it came to the possible sequel. I didn't want one, and I suspect its writer and director Brad Bird didn't either. Because after a 14-year hiatus, The Incredibles sequel arrives with all the action and humor of the original, but none of its passion.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 begins immediately where The Incredibles ended; with The Underminer on the verge of a high-profile bank heist, and the newly assembled Incredibles ready to take him down. After that rousing introductory action scene, we are introduced to our new characters, Evelyn and Winston Deavor (Catherine Keener and Bob Odenkirk), a brother and sister duo determined to legalize ""supers"". To do this, they recruit Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone, to take on a publicity tour of sorts, and create goodwill among the people. Elastigirl is given the biggest spotlight, leaving her husband at home with the superkids. So the story goes, with Helen Parr performing grand acts of heroism while tracking down the mysterious Screenslaver, and Bob struggling to keep up at home. Throw in a handful of quirky new superheroes, and some spy thriller elements, and you have a plot that differs enough from the first film, but never does quite enough to justify itself as a natural continuation of the story. The Screenslaver is an interesting villain, and the mystery plot unfolds in relatively surprising ways, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this story was simply one of hundreds of possible exploits for the Incredible family. It pulls you in, but only as much as a new episode of your favorite TV show might. For me, that was plenty, but for fans feverish over where the series might head, it may be a disappointment.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 matches the first film in most important measures. Particularly the action and pacing that made The Incredibles so much more than just another cartoon. Despite directing only two or three films that can be considered ""action movies"", Brad Bird has managed to position himself as one of the great action directors working. His work on Incredibles 2 once again proves why. Through several impossibly complex set-pieces, including an exceptional train rescue, Bird uses animation and action together like the maestro he is celebrated as. Because he's working within an animated comic book world, these action scenes always have something new up their sleeves. The various superpowers are utilized so deftly that it makes the Marvel and DC movies look like they're not even trying. Animation liberates great filmmakers, and if you needed more evidence that Brad Bird is indeed a great filmmaker, the truly rousing action scenes in Incredibles 2 should put that to bed. The film is also remarkably well paced. There are two distinctly different stories going on simultaneously, one a taut thriller and the other a family comedy, and it doesn't feel as if either is given too much or too little attention. That means the film moves steadily and purposefully, but still allows for laugh breaks and breathers. That doesn't mean both story threads are equally good, though. The home life stuff starts off as a pointedly funny look at superpowered parenting, before becoming a hit or miss sitcom by the end. If you like baby noises, boy is this for you! Me? I found Jack Jack's antics (involving his increasing number of powers) annoying. Baby giggles are low hanging fruit for a sequel whose predecessor was so naturally, and confidently clever in its humor. I was also struck by how off line the voice performances were. Craig T. Nelson sounds totally disinterested throughout, and the supporting characters are always pushing a little too hard for a laugh. Holly Hunter is the only one to recapture the casually natural sound that made the first movie special.<br/><br/>It all leads back to my initial hypothesis. I don't think Brad Bird really wanted to make this movie. Why else for the 14-year gap? It's not as if the script connected to the first in any meaningful way, or broke any new ground. It's simply a hunk of meat, thrown to the fans to shut them up. And at the same time, it's really good. Bird is the key player. He's a great filmmaker, and he keeps Incredibles 2 lively and fun. So a few gags failed to land, so what? The film works. The action scenes pop off the screen, the story moves along briskly, and there are good, hardy laughs along the way. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle. Incredibles 2 doesn't. But in terms of sequels, I can live with something that entertains and thrills heartily, even if it doesn't meet the original's passion.<br/><br/>76/100"

","It was a good enough watch but as i was watching it i started to think that i would have preferred to have spent my cinema money and time on something else.<br/><br/>It doesn't have that same all-encompassing magic and energy of other great Pixar films, it wasn't as fun, funny or wowing. The critics have overhyped this one, for me!<br/><br/>It feels a bit lifeless at times cus it doesn't possess the originality of other Pixar greats in regards to story, character, dialog and scenery. There are a few action sequences which are cool but just not enough to rate it any higher.<br/><br/>The family scenes are cliched, all too familiar, except for when the baby sporadically displays his powers like in the trailers.<br/><br/>The reveal/twist at the end is predictable and lazy.<br/><br/>It is no where near as good as most Marvel films and It's hard not to compare considering how they are equal in scale but this just isn't as fun, funny, engrossing or exciting as those.

"jantoniou-205-555937","7","1","1","16 July 2018"," Entertaining, but a vague re-hash of the firsr
","""The Incredibles"" was - and it remains - the gold standard of Pixar films. It was in many respects the high water mark of their team of creative visionaries - and it proved a prescient and brilliant move for them to bring in Brad Bird during a creative slump. Bird completely reenergized a major movie studio in the creative doldrums. <br/><br/>In fact after ""Cars"" I was genuinely concerned that they had lost their mojo - again. I wondered if they had reached their creative peak with ""The Incredibles"" and their best work was behind them. <br/><br/>""Toy Story 3"" - another sequel very long in the making - ""Inside Out"" and now ""Coco"" proved me wrong. While perhaps not quite as good as ""The Incredibles"" they were great, engaging and deeply emotional and creative films. I loved them and it was clear the team behind loved the material too.<br/><br/>I was concerned even before ""The Incredibles 2"" started. They - the film's principal voice actors - and Brad Bird himself (again helming as writer and director) came on screen to, one thank ""The Incredibles"" many many fans for being so patient, but also to assure those same fans that it would be well worth the wait - before we had seen one minute of film. <br/><br/>Such assurances felt gratuitous. A great film speaks for itself and stands on its own. There is no need to psyche us out and ""guarantee"" us that the sequel will be at least as equally good as the original. I was worried and it turns out I had good cause to be.<br/><br/>As it turns out ""The Incredibles 2"" is not only not as good as the original - far from it - but it feels somewhat like a retread of the original story - with far less engagement and emotional attachment than we had with the characters originally. <br/><br/>Yes there are innumerable great action sequences and superb animation (I would say the animated characters and scenes felt ""slicker"" and more 2D in the original whereas here everything feels slightly rounder, fuller, and more 3D - somewhat like you'd expect with modern Disney Studio digital animation) but there seemed to be a heavy reliance on the original including plenty of nearly word for word copying of some of the original dialog. It was somewhat eerie hearing the same dialogue and verbal cues when it didn't quite seem necessary. I get wanting to do something of an homage to the original but I heard the same cues so often it felt like it was overdone.<br/><br/>I won't recount the plot as others have done but it bears numerous similarities to the original including a central character who hates supers and wants revenge against them. <br/><br/>Elastigirl was much more the main character this time with Mr. Incredible and the kids playing almost in the background - though certainly they're all central to the story. Dash had a lot of screen time as did Jack-Jack but as a super felt almost completely unused. Interestingly Frozone had a great deal more screen time than the original and actually felt quite well used vs. the original. Frozone's talents seemed rather silly in the original (oooooh look he can throw up big walls of ice, whoopie) but I thought they did a super job of exploiting his capabilities in the sequel. <br/><br/>While the quality was there in ""The Incredibles 2"", the engagement was not. The love I felt for the original characters and story was not broadly in evidence. It turned out to be a big disappointment.<br/><br/>In retrospect I think it would have been wise for Bird to sit this one out. Just as George Lucas wisely brought in a great and highly competent director for the very first ""Star Wars"" sequel - The Empire Strikes Back (now widely considered the best of that series) - Bird and Pixar/Disney would have been wise to bring in a creative team with an almost reverent love for the original but also a fresh creative energy, especially when it became clear that in spirit and execution ""The Incredibles 2"" was becoming more like the competent but uninspired nearly straight to DVD sequel like ""Cars 2"" and ""Cars 3.""<br/><br/>While I think they made some very smart plot choices such as picking up right where the original left off I wish they had taken more creative risks. Again it just felt like they were taking it easy, slapping together a ton of great if somewhat uninteresting action sequences and relying more heavily then they needed to on the original. <br/><br/>Though they left the door open for a third film - and beyond - I think it would be sad to keep it going. Its huge financial success belies its many creative misses."
"patemsu","7","1","1","14 July 2018"," Not deserving of an 8
","The writing/story quality falls off quite noticeably in the 2nd half of the movie. 
The first half of the movie with Elsti-girl in the spotlight was amazing, with some of the best action sequences and a strong premise. And the writing was on par with the first film.
However, nearing the climax and final confrontation, all the events just got willy-nilly and lost the tight and cleverness the the first half, or the first movie.
One of the remarkable trait of the first movie was its tight writing and story through and through. This movie obviously doesn't have that, which is a real shame, and felt like they got lazy half way with story-boarding. 
The ending was also both stereotypical and cartoony, which really hurts the realistic societal backdrop this story usually offers."
"vandrist","7","1","1","9 July 2018"," A longtime in the making!!!
","It's been 14 years since the last Incredibles and this movie holds up to the hype. Overall a good superhero movie in a time where superhero movies are being released every other month. Packed with laugh out loud moments, the discovery of Jack Jack's powers are pretty hilarious. There isn't much time that passes from the original film, so there isn't much character progression, but just enough time changes where the world around them does. I would recommend this movie for all ages since it hits several generations. I would still say the first Incredibles is better, and I wouldn't put this in my top ten Disney films, but it is worth your time to watch. I gave this movie 7 out of 10, but that is a very modest rating."
"cfu-11514","7","1","1","6 July 2018"," Could Live Without
","Before the decision being made on whether to watch this movie, there's that faint yet very real fear a film lover experiences: a sequel to a fantastic film, unless set out as a trilogy from the get-go, almost unfailingly turns out to be worse than the original. Draw a snake and add feet to it is what the Chinese call it. Unfortunately, Incredibles 2 proved the feeling I had to be true once again.<br/><br/>Sometime last year, I saw the first trailer of this sequel. In one word, it felt safe, which is never a good sign. But one can't read too much into movie trailers these days considering it's pretty much a separate industry. It did however balanced my expectations, which otherwise would be so high that it would've inevitably ruined the experience. <br/><br/>Now moving to the actual film. Right off the bat, I was surprised they didn't do a time jump. It started exactly, I mean exactly, where it left off. 14 years ago. As if nothing has happened in this huge chunk of time. Imagine the last thing you did with someone was discussing how the weather was that day. And then, 14 years later, you see that person again and the first thing he says is, ""Hey, so the sun was so bright that day huh?"" How weird would that be? Eight years. Ten or fourteen years. Dash could be finishing high school yet still cocky. Maybe Violet is going to college and struggling to find her career path. Mom and dad dealing with their own age issues. Wouldn't anyone rather watch that story?<br/><br/>The second thing that can't be overlooked was the little changes made to the characters, specifically their facial features. I don't remember this being done in other Pixar franchises but I could be wrong. To me, their new faces looked somewhat strange and almost sinister. Mom's eyebrows were now hooked, and dad's jawline went from big to unproportionally humongous. Dash's hair and Frozone's ice did look cooler, though not really something to brag about. <br/><br/>Moving to the plots. Mom ventured into a new career path while dad dealt with domestic life. Kind of cliche but not necessarily bad. The execution was yet again sloppy. Generally speaking, the lack of creativity on the details made the middle part of the movie felt like time fillers rather than revelations of unexpected stories of characters' lives. In the first film, dad's ""training"" to get in shape and mom checking herself out in the mirror added a layer of self-deprecating humor that's crucial for adult viewers to emphasize with. I don't recall this kind of experience from watching the sequel. On top of that, mom still pulled the same parachute skill at least twice. Edna's presentation chairs moved the exact same way. All in all, there's more reminders than discoveries. The antagonist, which is the counter half of any hero, was also weakly designed. The tiny twist was that instead of it being the hero-worshipping brother, it was the sister. The dead giveaway was how close she was to Mom. Anyone with that much screen time is bound to be more than just a stock character. And with the real villain still missing, the circle really closed in only on her. <br/><br/>Not counting it being a Pixar movie and the sequel to one of the best animation from last decade, Incredibles 2 could've been an above average, stand-alone movie. However, since they decided to continue telling the story and naming it the sequel, the measuring stick just became significantly longer. <br/><br/>Seven out of ten."
"jmdjaraujo","7","1","1","4 July 2018"," Great movie, but will never top the first one
","A technically brilliant movie. Both animation and sound. Also, all of the characters struggles/fights happen mainly in their normal human lifes. Wich has a very funny side to it. In spite of that, it's still an action movie. So I would have liked to see more fight and struggle to overcome the 'bad guys'. It was too easy! Great movie, but will never top the first one."
"judeknicks","8","1","1","4 July 2018"," Funny and visual impressive, but direction is off
","So, it has been 14 years in the making and 14 years in the waiting. When I watched the original in theaters back in 2004, my little brother was a newborn. Now, he's a little brat who is going into high school, plays too much Fortnite, and gets mad easily. Talk about temper, you just have to meet my bro. Anyways, I definitely have been waiting a mighty long time for this sequel. As I abide by my philosophies, I did not check any reviews prior to watching the movie so that my expectations weren't sky high. Thank goodness, because then I would've been massively disappointed. Instead, I am only disappointed.<br/><br/>When I used to read movie reviews, I would lose focus after two sentences because the reviewer would keep going on with backstory and filibuster stuff. So I'll keep things short by summarizing my thoughts. The action and animation was slick, Frozone finally got to shine, and the music score was one of the best ever. However, I was disappointed by how quickly the movie moves without being cohesive. This is a knock on the direction. The scenes kept jumping back and forth between different settings, which removed any tension that was building up. Also, the villain and his motives were generic, especially when compared to Syndrome, the villain from the previous installment.<br/><br/>In the end, the film has more positive aspects than flaws, but based on its flaws, I can only give it a 7.5/10. That rating would translate to: worth your $12 but not your $20. Obviously, you will all see it in theaters because this is a long-awaited sequel. Do as you wish, because this is American and you don't want to be caught slipping up. Maybe my opinion will change when I see it again on Tuesday. Oh wait, I'm seeing Solo again, and that is a really good movie. That was another movie that I trashed the first time but enjoyed immensely the second, so things change and rearrange as so do I (J. Cole)."

","'INCREDIBLES 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Pixar and Disney's long anticipated sequel to their 2004 animated superhero blockbuster 'THE INCREDIBLES'. The plot follows the Parr family once again, as they battle a new enemy, who wants to turn the public against all 'supers', while they also try to deal with normal family life as well. The film was once again written and directed by Brad Bird, and it features returning voice cast members including Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson. Huck Milner, Catherine Keener, Bob Odenkirk, Sophia Bush and Bill Wise also join the cast this time. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like it's predecessor), and it's also expected to be a huge hit at the Box Office once again as well. I enjoyed it, but definitely not as much as the original. <br/><br/>The Parr family is still acting as the superhero team known as 'The Incredibles' when the authorities become too concerned about the damage being done during their battles with supervillains, and the team is ordered to halt their actions. Then they're contacted by a superhero fan named Winston Deavor (Odenkirk), and invited to his house for a proposition, along with their friend Frozone (Jackson). There Winston and his sister Evelyn (Keener) offer Helen Parr (Hunter) a superhero job fighting crime, in order to win back the support of the public. Helen accepts the job offer, and Bob Parr stays home to watch the kids while she works. Helen has to battle a new supervillain in the process, and Hank finds parenting even harder than crime fighting, especially when he learns their baby Jack-Jack has even greater superhero powers than they all do. <br/><br/>The movie is really well made once again, and always beautiful to watch. The action scenes are mostly exciting too, and the humor is clever and witty (all once again). It's also great how progressive these films are, especially this time having the wife superhero be the one fighting crime, while the husband stays home to watch the kids. Of course he also finds parenting to be even harder than crime fighting too. That's all great about this movie, but it still didn't live up to my very high expectations of matching the original (or even coming close to it). It doesn't capture the same magic, and after the original film was so refreshing and somewhat groundbreaking at the time of it's release, there wasn't much this sequel could do to live up to it of course. It's still really well made though, and entertaining enough."

Remember awe when they are having a hard time fighting syndrome and the mark 10 robot, and how clever the solution was?

","""Incredibles 2"" is definitely an enjoyable movie, filled with enough action, heart, and comedy to entertain anyone - if there's one thing I can say with confidence, it's that this movie will be a crowd pleaser. From beginning to end this movie is fun. The action scenes are incredible, no pun intended, and are directed beautifully. There's definitely a lot of humor and silliness to make you laugh, and laugh hard. And it's just plain entertaining to watch this family interact - in fact, the heart of these movies lies in the interaction between the family, but unfortunately, there really isn't all that much of it in this film. <br/><br/>The majority of the movie, when there aren't action scenes, is Mr. Incredible taking care of Jack-Jack, which does serve a purpose but in this reviewer's opinion made the film seem unbalanced. I get it, Jack-Jack is cute, he's adorable, and he makes the entire audience erupt in laughter, but where's the character progression and heart-to-heart moments with Dash and Violet? Yes, there are a few moments of sweetness and familial bonding between Mr. Incredible and his two other children (mostly with Violet, hardly any with Dash, and in fact Dash had absurdly little to do in this movie) but compared to the time the movie focuses on Mr. Incredible with Jack-Jack, his interaction with his other children feels minuscule. I mean, there was so, so much ""Incredibles 2"" could've done with Bob and Violet especially. Don't get me wrong, there are some very sweet moments between them, but the film could have and indeed should have explored many more aspects of the reality of what it is like for a father raising a teenage daughter that has to deal with liking boys, going through ""adolescence,"" as Dash calls it, and perhaps the thing that all fathers dread: being a superhero. <br/><br/>Instead, the movie focuses on two things, the first being Bob dealing with Jack-Jack and his newfound powers, and while this isn't ideal, I'll be damned if it didn't lead to some truly hilarious moments. The second thing the movie revolves around is Elastigirl as she works her new job, which results in a ton of action sequences. Now, these action sequences are slick and visually stunning, but action sequences were not what made the first movie great - what made the first movie great was the entire family interacting each other and dealing with real life problems while just happening to be superheroes, and this film doesn't seem to realize this, instead resorting to bombastic action sequences. And I'll say it again: the action is great, it's exciting, it's adrenaline inducing, but god damn it, did we need so much of it? It just feels like the ridiculous amount of action in this movie kind of cheapens the experience, at least in my opinion. Because what could've been a very mature movie like the first one was, turned into a movie that seemed much more childlike than it had any right to be. <br/><br/>Maturity, too, is another thing that this movie sacrifices. The first one dealt with very adult topics and this movie, well, doesn't. Sure, there is a truly amazing and I mean AMAZING monologue that the villain has, and once I heard it I got excited because I started thinking, ""wow, I can't believe they're taking this film in this mature direction, this is going to be great,"" because the monologue dealt with very real things and it seemed to even be pointing at the audience and blaming them, in a way. But after that monologue, those motivations go out the window and the ""true"" motivations are revealed, and it's just disappointing. They could've taken that initial idea so much further, but just like everything else, they resort to taking the easier, more digestible, choice. So the villain, initially someone with motives that we've literally never seen before in any superhero film, turns into someone whose motives are not only lazy, but predictable. <br/><br/>Now I know I might seem like I'm bashing the crap out of this film, but I'm not really. I enjoyed myself and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray to watch it again, but after 14 years, I'd say we deserve better."
"Neptune165","4","3","6","20 October 2019"," Movie was pretty forgettable tbh
","This movie was too long plus bad timing i fell asleep I just didn't care anymore unlike the first i loved it and cared so well too predictable. They took everything that was awesome about the first incredibles & dumbed it down. I legit knew the entire plot a half hour in the movie. Was so obvious the villain was going to be who it was. Sure the animation was good but that can only take the movie so far. To me this seemed like a dumbed down kids movie where as the first one was an epic adventure for all ages. It was boring and dash was really annoying it feels like they played more cliches in this movie. Had its moments with elastergirl having the spotlight she was just boring and could of made a more Interesting. whatever happened to the underminer? did he escape? he was such a big deal in the first movie. The new heroes like voyd? She is so annoying they're horrible looking they're not fun or funny to watch is just a bunch of big dumb dumbs and ugly designs wow. does anyone even remember their names? they were used pretty badly. now... the villain... Oh! the lamest villain of them all oh my!!! there was no master mind behind anything she didn't plan the plan of the century like they tried to make us believe. Heroes are illegal, she makes them legal so that she can make them illegal again ... wh... what? she gave up her plan by allowing heroes into her space in the first place she really isn't the smartest. It was terrible the movie didn't focus on any character"
"educallejero","5","3","6","16 July 2019"," A sequel from the Franchise that asks us to love the 1%
","(the better people) Smart presentation of the theme. With text and subtext. Almost everytime the movie talks about how special the superheroes are, we can replace that with the 1%.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie shows how fake is the reasoning that the superheroes help the rest with their existence (superheroes are the 1%) and they need rules for themselves. The villain says that we (normal people) don't experience life and give up our liberties, freedom and consume the real thing from the safety of our homes, watching the screens (All true in real life, and I'm as guilty as anybody), while the 1% makes the decisions, have power and do and experience for real whatever they want. . The villain is the one that doesn't like the 1% (superheroes).<br/><br/>While by text, the movie shows that all the superheroes (1%) want, is ""being treated fairly"". They want the rest to adapt to their exceptionalism ""for the betterment of the world"" (if nobody sees the ""don't put taxes on us and we would create jobs"", then what can I do? Because it is obvious to me).<br/><br/>Besides that, the problem with this movie is that is boring. The lead character was Elastigirl this time. But they didn't go all the way. In the first one, we saw mr Incredible sad and depressed. So the scenes that weren't funny, had a lot of weight, which translated to the story rather well once it picked up the pace.
Here, Elastigirl doesn't have much of an arc. She was a bit indecisive at times, but, just in a few scenes, and it didn't impact the movie. The story was clichÃ© as eff (the dad doesn't know how to do the mommy duties, while the mom was being held back by the antiquated stereotypes of having to stay home, but she's as good or better than the dad at everything).<br/><br/>It's so.... boring. Violet's arc was so teen angs lame. Dash didn't have an arc (not even a short one) in this one. Tooooooo much focus on the baby with a gazillion of pathetic jokes (I don't think I laugh/chuckle once in the entire movie).<br/><br/>So yeah, the animation improved and it was great, and the action was super fun. But what made the Incredibles better than the rest just wasn't there in this one."
"Semisonic","5","3","6","12 March 2019"," The Washed-Ups
","It is a clear sunny day boding nothing bad, and then suddenly a random guy bursts in on a giant drilling machine, robs a bank and literally sucks it dry, making off to an undetermined direction with his prize.<br/><br/>I can't help thinking that this is the best way to describe what Incredibles 2 did to its paying audience. I haven't paid a penny to see this film, but even I felt robbed, of my time, my hope for having a good taste in cinema, and - most importantly - my good memory of the first Incredibles.<br/><br/>It's been 15 years since the first film had been released, but instead of going forward the sequel seems to have gone back in time, to the fantasy 60's that only existed in the James Bond movies. The super family, however, had frozen in time and looks almost the same, but those real life years have indeed taken its toll - in the form of Holly Hunter's voice, which now sounds as if Elastigirl is an elderly lady not yet accustomed to her new dentures. And that is just the first of many more stark contrasts between look and feel Incredibles 2 aren't able to hide.<br/><br/>Another thing that deteriorated just as bad as Elastigirl's voice is the filmmakers' ability to distinguish quality and hollow filler. I don't remember all the details of the first film, it's been quite a while indeed, but I do remember that, despite intentionally goofy graphics, it felt real enough in terms of sincerity. That super family acted in a way that made you care, and the plot was a balance between keeping it reasonable and providing enough surprise factor.<br/><br/>This time, however, we get a clumsy mix of hollow action scenes, generic parent-child moments, really forced promotion of gender equality and a dystopian anti-brainwashing message more fitting the bleak Blade Runner universe instead of the colorful tech-happy retrofuture. Watching the kids do kid stuff is now more tiring than cute, and the little family quarrels from amusing become ridiculous. Just like the new villain's persona and motive.<br/><br/>Overall, Incredibles 2 made me realize once again that some things aren't meant to be remade or continued. Especially if you can't add anything new or fresh to what's been said and done earlier. And if you're not that good with creativity anymore, at least let your heroes grow up a bit. Because seeing kids not ageing a day in fifteen years makes one feel like John Nash from A Beautiful Mind, and that proved to be not the most healthy thing."

","A lot of other reviews criticise this film for its overt feminist/political messages or just due to the fact that it is a sequel. Both points have some validity but the worst part about this film is how incredibly boring it is. It is stuffed full of dull dialogue about political legislation and media image that makes it feel like you are watching the senate scenes in The Phantom Menace on loop. This is meant to be a kids film right? Please name one kid that would be interested in any of this.

The villain is weak and predictable, and didn't have an ounce of personality or any way to care about them like Syndrome did. Once you are introduced to her you can immediately tell she is the villain. I wanted to love it, and as a 20 year old who grew up watching the original film connecting to and loving these characters I was let down. Is it a fun film that made me chuckle.....yes.

This time, the supers find themselves in a position to come out of the shadows led by Elsatigirl.<br/><br/>Winston Deavor is the recruiter of the supers. Being a Disney/Pixar film, they gave him a Walt Disney (himself) look in a 1964 World's Fair Tomorrowland kind of way throughout his scenes and even in the monorail scene.<br/><br/>With Elastigirl off trying to 1) put the supers back on the public positive and 2) figure out who the Screenslaver (see the pun!); it was up to Mr. Incredible to become Michael Keaton's Mr. Mom. From teaching new math to Dash (which, the education system really has created new math somewhere in the past 20 years!), to fixing Violet's relationship to taming Jack-Jack, Bob Parr has officially met his match.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we are introduced to new supers along the way. Some with names, others, not so much. These events lead to a very predictable plot twist, but cool matchups of fight scenes.<br/><br/>Being a Pixar film, be on the lookout for a Hidden Mickey and the Pixar light!

"AhmedSpielberg99","7","4","10","19 June 2018"," Unoriginal!
","The original Incredibles is not only one of my favorite animated movies, but it's also one of my favorite superhero movies ever. So there's no doubt that this long-awaited sequel was one of my most anticipated movies of this year, especially before seeing the trailers! I didn't like the trailers, the first one in particular, because I predicted that this movie would lean heavily on a formula we got tired of. This formula includes two messages; the female empowerment, and ""taking care of your family is the true superheroic act"", and that's exactly what we got in this movie, especially the first message, it's a political issue, so .... why not? <br/><br/>This formula didn't just make everything in the movie looks like I've seen million times before, but it also made this movie feels outdated. Actually, the problem isn't only related to the messages, but the plot itself is formulaic and outdated for a superhero movie. Almost everything happens, every event, every element, every part in this movie is archetypal.
The developments of the story are typical. 
The characters are slightly developed, but also in away that doesn't feel authentic or original by any means.
The villain, Screenslaver, is stereotypical and feels if he comes from an old cheesy superhero movie, or an animated movie from any animation studio except Pixar. This villain even acts like The Joker, so that's saying something. Even his motives are well-worn, and he revealed them in a single monologue. Yes, this very monologue that Syndrome mocked in the original movie. So don't expect a villain like Syndrome. So don't expect to see a villain like Syndrome. And of course, we have a plot twist in this movie but I saw it coming from far away, so it definitely didn't work. Also, what leads us to the ending is rushed and quite absurd. Nevertheless, there are some subtle plot details in the part when Elastigirl was fighting crime. <br/><br/>They leaned so heavily on the humor in this sequel. The humor wasn't bad at first. In fact, almost every joke that is related to Jack-Jack worked, and I couldn't help but burst out in laughter almost every time he made a single noise. But the jokes became repetitive, so they lost all their sharpness. Also, the timing of the humor was very bad at the third act. What's worse, at least for me, is that they made Bob Parr a total moron so he can be the comic relief while making Elastigirl the real heroine of the movie. <br/><br/>Now, Dash is my favorite Incredible! What a likable character he is! He is very cool, and all his actions are fit for his age. That gave this character a sense of reality. In fact, all the characters act if they were real. When they interact with each other, when they get tired, when they become happy, when they laugh, even when they breathe they feel if they were actual people, if they were humans, and that's really INCREDIBLE! <br/><br/>All the cast is great, as usual. But Holly Hunter who shines in this sequel. She gave even more energy Helen Parr/Elastigirl.
I was worried because they replaced Spencer Fox, the original actor who voiced Dash, but I think Huck Milner is even better! 
Frozone had much more time in this sequel, and that made this character seems much more like Samuel L. Jackson, and of course this is a bonus! 
Jack Jack's new abilities are basically perfect, both in what his powers are and in how they are revealed. <br/><br/>Michael Giacchino's score is gold, and well-used. The animation is top-notch and seamless. But it's the action in this movie that should have a fair share of praise. Incredibles 2 has some of the most thrilling and exhilarating action sequences ever in an animated movie, if not memorable enough. The movie full of flashing lights that aren't just annoying, but they really can be harmful to the eyes, especially if you watched the movie in 3D. <br/><br/>I'm sorely disappointed, but I'll try as much as I can not to make my let-down affect my rating, especially because most of the issues I've with this movie are related to one thing, the triteness that I, as a Disney/Pixar fan, didn't get used to. <br/><br/>(7/10)"

I can't say it's a complete disaster (compared to Escape Plan 2 - see it yourself at your own risk). I did enjoy the motorcycle chase, Jack Jack parts and Violet's emo little drama with her crush.

Bottom line I enjoyed this film. I have seen the original a very long time ago and I have it forgotten. My mom thought it was okay and my brother liked it. The only issue I had was someone in the cinema a little girl spoilt it for me and the film itself focused more on Elasticgirl's popularity than the rest of the characters.

","Director Brad Bird has admitted that we may be super-hero'd out which was his explanation as to why it took 14 years to launch this to screen. I agree with him. This movie takes every trope and...well, it does the best it can.<br/><br/>Funny how not a single reviewer has mentioned the opening starts the same as ""Batman v. Superman"" We are thrusted back into where the last one ended. But this time from a different perspective. And much like the Warner Bros. tentpole film, the destruction of the city has created a ban of superhero once again.<br/><br/>It seems many people had forgotten the first film. Where superhero become...domesticated. They do so as both a ban and as a remedy for decades of fighting the bad guys. The Parr Family...is now homeless and desperate for any work. Bob HATES the thought of going back to insurance work. He understands the monotony but also...because he got a taste for heroism again. A topic that isn't tackled or mined as you would hope. Instead, a mysterious corporation led by a brother and sister duo (think ""Rampage"" here) want to bring back superheroes. Yawn.<br/><br/>Yes, we're back to where we started. BUT, to give the new movement a prettier face, they elect Elastigirl to be the new face of heroism. Now 60, Holly Hunter (""Batman v. Superman"") has lost some pep in her step as a mother of a teenage daughter, son and baby. At one point blaming the curse of superpowers but nearly seconds later, embracing the idea that it's a better option than Bob going back to the drudgery of regular employment at something he hates.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie seems...flat. Fun at points, a few laughs, but it seemed like a thinner, slightly less joy of the first one. Even Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is given so little moments of being Mr. Incredible's friend, it just seemed we're going over very tired ground.<br/><br/>Is it fun? Yes. For the most part. But it feels like a diversion or worse, something done because Brad Bird had nothing better to do. I sincerely hope they make a third one.

That being said - it's almost worth the entry fee to see the short film at the start, 'Bao' - it's also hilarious, and poignant.<br/><br/>It's like putting on an old shirt - it's familiar, but comforting and not tired.

Odenkirk's voice is so recognisable and his character even looks like a young Saul Goodman! <br/><br/>As well as being a bit of a pastiche of comic book films - you basically have Superman, Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Flash and Iceman - 'Incredibles 2' transcends the parody, and plays as an exceptional superhero film in it's own right, with the set-up, early victory, apparent loss and inevitable triumph due to teamwork.

He cautions his older daughter Violet, voiced by Sarah Vowell, and her younger brother Dash, voiced by Huck Milner, while playing with their brother, ""Don't fire the baby!"" Now, you won't hear that in movies. I'll even go out on a limb here.<br/><br/>That's the signature humor and inventiveness of Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""Incredibles 2"". ""Incredibles 2"" is really incredible, too. ""2"" is the sequel 14 years in the making. The technological advance in state-of-the art animation since astounds. In the visual high speed chase Helen's Elastic Girl, voiced with down home charm and common sense by Holly Hunter, swerves her motorcycle as she rescues the out-of-control monorail train. In the stunning night skyline Elastic Girl hops between helicopters with her rubber-like arms to save the Ambassador. <br/><br/>Still with Bird flexing his formidable CGI might, he touches when Bob confesses to daughter Violet, ""I just want to be a good Dad.""

Violet is devastated when Tony forgets their movie date. Yeah, Dad and Mom using their super strength and elastic powers stopped the villainous Underminer, comical John Ratzenberger, and his hulking drilling machine. Bob messed up big time where it also counted, with family. Family and heart ultimately save the day in ""Incredibles 2"". <br/><br/>""Incredibles 2"" is hysterical in its cool self-awareness and irreverence.

Well, just shows my age. <br/><br/>""Supers"" or Superheroes are still outlawed in the world of ""Incredibles 2"". The movie literally opens where we left off 14 years ago as the Incredibles battle the Underminer determined to destroy the City. Emerging victorious the Family is forced back into seclusion. <br/><br/>Brother and sister Winston and Evelyn of high-technology Dev Tech, voiced by slick Bob Odenkirk and sublime Catherine Keener, offer the Parr's their proposal. Winston and Evelyn seek to overturn the ban on Supers. Their late Father was the Supers greatest advocate. Both parents were tragically murdered when Supers were unable to save them from a home robbery. <br/><br/>Marketing expert Winston wants to leverage Elastic Girl in the TV PR campaign to overturn the law. It's kind of like Reality TV for the good cause. Well, kind of. Swallowing his ego, because they opted out Mr. Incredible, Bob agrees that Helen should be the Star. Near half-way through the movie you get the telegraph that all is not what it seems. Perhaps, that's the only downside of Writer Bird's incredible narrative. <br/><br/>Director Bird does provide the brilliant upside in the return of diminutive Supers costume designer extraordinaire Edna Mode or E. E graciously babysits and costumes Jack-Jack leashing and tracking some of his emergent powers. Bird is genuinely hysterical voicing E. And ""Incredibles 2"" is absolutely hysterical with endearing sweetness.<br/><br/>At times action movie overload occurs, particularly near the end. The amazing CGI tends to overwhelm a bit. Yet, when Helen tells her children how proud she is of them that resonates home. Because when it comes down to it: Love makes you Super. I just hope Bird, Disney and Pixar don't wait another 14 years to tell another ""Incredibles"" story about love and family."

","It'd be an understatement to say I've been patiently waiting for this movie for over a decade. Incredibles 2 brings us back to the world set up by its amazing predecessor from 14 years ago. This one picks up right where the last left off and away it goes into a new adventure. The Parr's are just as fun as ever and we get to see them through an even closer lens this time.<br/><br/>These characters are simply awesome. Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack are all back and better than ever. Seeing them again made me realize how much I've missed this lovely family in action and even inside the house. Jack Jack is just precious in this one. While the first film deepens the relationship between the mother and the kids, the sequel instead does so with the father, and it's just as satisfying. Frozone and Edna are back too!<br/><br/>What Incredibles 2 does that is so praiseworthy is that it maintains who these characters are so well. Even after all these years, our heroes feel like themselves. The way they think, talk, and conduct themselves feels so natural. Also, the action is toned way up from the first and I loved it.<br/><br/>Where the movie falters a bit for me is with the villain. The way the villain ultimately reveals him/herself and his/her plan is unfortunately just too predictable from the start. I thought the script could have gone in certain directions to make the antagonist more compelling but it did not. The villain, however, does end up being very formidable, just like Syndrome. <br/><br/>Overall, Incredibles 2 proves to be a solid sequel and another blast to watch for all families. The characters don't seem to miss a beat and the action is simply great for an animated movie. No, it is not as good as The Incredibles from 2004 but it does have just as much heart, which is what is most important.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 gets an A-."
"Neptune165","4","2","4","18 October 2019"," it was too long and sucked
","Fun, but stupid writing. i was so disappointed, i watched the first movie just to compare and it definitely isn't better than the first one. I felt like I was always waiting for the main story to begin but it seemed like it never did and felt cliche. This movie was really bad in my opinion. love the characters, love the animation, the plot sucks & doesn't make much sense considering the first film. if u watch the first than the second you will be like ""wait what? why r they complaining about supers being illegal??"" the first film already fleshed out that idea, yet this movie pretends as if it didn't. In about the first hour i lost interest i just didn't care anymore the first one was classic and waited to long to make a 2nd. Not gonna lie i felt they went a little to hard on the feminist stuff. AND I SUPPORT LEAD FEMALE ROLES. In the first one bob leaves and does what he has to do but in the movie the women comes and saves him. See? The first movie was perfect. However in this one bob suffers with the kids. Kinda like oh idk the implication that a man can't do it like a woman can. Kinda sucks but I hope the 3rd one can fix and kinda ""battle of the sexes"" bs however cool that bob kept It together. just let me enjoy an animated movie about superheroes without throwing that feminist stuff in my face every 2 seconds. If I watch superheroes I want to see them having adventures, that's the point. if I wanted to see ""family problems"" ""parents taking care of the kids"" and all that."

"iguth","5","2","4","7 May 2019"," Doesn't live up to the hype
","Incredibles 2 is a sequel too late. Of course it will be hard to make a sequel that lives up to the original and they didn't quite overcome that challenge. The movie picks up right where the first left off but it seems as if the previous movie didn't happen. Character growth from the previous film is pretty much not there and the Tony bit throughout the film is awkward. The humor is lost on me, I don't find much of it funny but maybe some do. The graphics, upgraded clearly to stay competitive in today's market, but it differs so far from the original that it feels out of place. I enjoy the twist of seeing Helen doing the work and getting to see Bob bond with his kids while supporting his wife. Edna is just as good and the suit rundown is just like before (which is a good thing). The big problems with this movie come from the new characters, villain, and climax. First the new heroes look very weird; they look inhuman. Winston Deaver is the only charming newly introduced character to me. The villain is not good. Dull, predictable, and trying to fulfill a poorly thought out plan are all ways I'd describe the villain. Finally the climax of the film. Why is there a hydrofoil? There is not reason for there to be a hydrofoil. Overall I have some huge issues with the plot but the action sequences are all great and the humor probably appeals to people that aren't me."

I watch movies to get away from all this, to have fun. Intense action doesn't always equal fun, when there's so much going on you can't follow.

"Lejink","3","2","4","9 February 2019"," The Inedibles
","I loved the first ""The Incredibles"" and remember wondering why a follow-up hadn't been made soon after its success. Better late than never you might say but personally after watching this 14-years later sequel, I'm tending to better never than late. Somehow, for me, the movie just fell flat and didn't please me to anything like the degree of its predecessor.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the Pixar animation is fantastic as always, but somewhere along the line, the story, characters and humour lack something. The outlawed super-heroes / aliens / mutants theme has been done to death, from the X-Men to the Marvel Civil War right up to the current Supergirl TV series, likewise the husband and wife role-reversal with Mr Incredible's turn as three super-babies and a super-dad again seemed old-hat while Elastigirl's elevation to solo superstardom also felt a little like a forced and belated concession to PC-dom.<br/><br/>I'm trying now to remember a really funny, laugh-out-loud line or memorable eye-popping sequence and I find I can't. The sub-plot of Violet and her young beau reminded me of any number of ""Married With Children"" episodes with like I said, a lack of good gags, plus Dash's characterisation was just irritating and new shape-shifting baby Jack-Jack (what kind of name is that?) even more so.<br/><br/>For me, I found the film really dragged in places with its too predictable villain and unmemorable climax which no amount of flashy graphics could disguise. In truth I think that this sort of thing was done way better in ""Megamind"", ""Despicable Me"" and of course the first Incredibles feature.<br/><br/>At leat I can't accuse it of being a quick cash-in but really this is one set of retired super-heroes which should have remained on the shelf."

The plot was a rehash of the first and the villain was apparent from the moment she stepped onto the screen. The film also felt disjointed and they turned the kids into brats that contributed nothing. The ending didn't make any sense either. Why were the people cheering for the supers when the last broadcast they saw was the supers saying they were going to destroy them. The citizens didn't know that the supers were being controlled so their cheering made no sense... Sadly this is the first Pixar movie that I really disliked."

It was nice that the fate of everyone was in the hands of the kids for the change and they pulled their weight and saved the day.<br/><br/>When you hear Odenkirk speak you are sure a con is coming your way because you can't think otherwise, since let's face it you can't blindly trust Saul but this time he is a legit good guy. The wife has a defining role in this part and the villain is what you expect him/her to be.

Evelyn was obviously the villain (Screenslaver) the second she showed up on screen. The way she talked about heroes and how she was upset about their parent's death just made it so very obvious. Also where did Underminer go? He got away and that was it.

","What happened ?<br/><br/>The first volet was nice and complex, pleasing both adults and children and this is just an explosion of bright color to please families who bring their kids.
Basically this movie is for kids.
All characters are void, every scene is a Superhero fight and it's messy and annoying. Gimme a break from casting superpowers. The very first scene is a crazy attack by a supervilain and every else follows as a fast-paced nonsense.
There is no breaks, transitions, just an endless flow of CGI like Disney knows how to do now. I guess the magic from 2D Disney movies is just dead.<br/><br/>Another problem : they casted the guy from Better Call Saul to play...some kind of lawyer. They basically extracted this character from Breaking Bad and put him, and his voice, in the movie. This is what you do when you have no ideas about character design and character develpment.<br/><br/>I don't buy that the sister fights crime at the end and leaves her boyfriend alone like an old sock, and does the most moral, responsible choice. Like hell she does, at her teenager age.<br/><br/>Characters just show off their abilities without any interesting plot or development. This movie is an incredible failure.

"WooderIce64","8","2","4","25 October 2018"," 14 Years Later, Pixar Delivers
","This was a long time coming. It was 14 years between the original Incredibles and the long-anticipated sequel. Who would have thought back then that Finding Nemo would have a sequel before the Incredibles? Heck, the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series before Incredibles 2 came out. What makes the wait especially bad is that Incredibles ends with a cliffhanger. For 14 years, we were anticipating this movie. Pixar's standards are as high as they can be for one studio. To that extent, Incredibles 2 is a good movie, but it's far from Pixar's best. It's not as good as the first movie. It's not as good as Coco or Inside Out either. But it's still a very good movie.<br/><br/>Most of the new characters from the first movie returned. Here, Elastigirl goes out to save the world while Mr. Incredible stays home with the kids. It's pretty much the first movie, but with the roles reversed. And because of that, it often leads into territory where characters feel more like stereotypes than anything else. This is most evident with Violet and Dash, who fall into middle/high school stereotypes, whether it be bad grades or an upcoming first date. However, Elastigirl makes up for it by being a solid protagonist. She finds herself at crossroads, torn between parental duty and the superhero life. It's also interesting because she does begin to enjoy being a superhero again, which she actively spoke against in the first movie. Perhaps the most notable character is Jack Jack, who has dozens of powers, which he gained at the beginning of the first movie. However, he's still a baby. That being said, his few action scenes evoke classic cartoons, which is welcome in a modern movie. For instance, the Jack Jack/Racoon scene is very reminiscent of the Snoopy/chair scene from A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Edna Mode returns, and she remains the fan favorite she was before. I'm not even sure what makes her such a good character. She's just Edna Mode. We also see the return of Frozone, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who's just as hilariously lovable as before. There are a whole host of new superheroes, most of which aren't particularly memorable, aside from their powers. The most notable is Void, who's essentially Syndrome, only not evil.<br/><br/>Speaking of villains, Screenslaver was a bad villain. Disney/Pixar really needs to stop with the whole ""surprise villain"" trend. It worked in Frozen because no one saw it coming. However, by my count, they've done it 3 additional times (Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Coco) between Frozen and now, so we've come to expect it. It happens more often than it doesn't now, and it's more of a game of figuring it out first. I figured out Screenslaver's identity almost immediately. Disney villains aren't as good as they used to be. Old Disney villains like Hades, Frollo, and Maleficent, to name a few, worked because they were fully developed characters. We don't really have those in Disney movies anymore. Speaking of villains, what happens to the Underminer? He just vanishes.<br/><br/>As you would expect from Pixar, the animation is immaculate. Obviously, the best looking parts are the action scenes, with the variety of characters and their abilities. Since its animated, the action scenes can be much more fast paced than a live action superhero movie. The film's climax worked so well because of the way individual superheroes teamed up and used their powers cooperatively. But even still, the animation has even noticeably improved from the first movie. Pixar, in terms of animation, is the industry standard, and they've earned that title for a reason."

The entire movie stayed true to how the persons were. And superheroes being illegal still and the mother went into the fight to show they should be made legal again makes perfect sense.
But ofc. the way to go around reviewing stuff today is more about bashing everything possible. Feminism is at the largest today ofc, just cause this movie shows the mother in action ( previous one with the father ) we should dislike it.

For me they are INCREDIBLE because what they love the most is their family and the experiences they live together. They love each other, protect each other, learn together and laugh together. It is definitely one of my favorite movies because we live in a world where everything makes you believe that other things are more important or ""cooler"": your friends, jobs, money, adventures, etc. But what matter the most is your family and having principles that nothing can break or bend.

""It's the same plot!"" ""Disney just did the same thing again!""<br/><br/>It's the Incredibles. A super hero movie by Disney and Pixar. It is also a sequel. What did the Russian bots expect? Super Bambi?<br/><br/>Bird said he didn't want to do Incredibles 2 unless there was a good script behind it. Was the script out of this world ludicrously good? Not necessarily. <br/><br/>Incredibles 2 retains the same jazzy 60s style of comic book presentation that caught my eye 14 years ago. Taking off from the ending of the original the super family once again finds itself out of sorts. <br/><br/>In a great action sequence it becomes clear that being super doesn't solve all your problems, worse still having powers can inflict tons of financial and monetary damage. <br/><br/>While the stage is set to present once again super power people as a threat and they need to go into hiding the film suddenly takes a slight deviation. Perception. Marketing. Selling. <br/><br/>Interestingly it becomes the subtext to the entire film. Peoples perceptions on a large scale, and small scale alter the truth. <br/><br/>While some rile on radical feminism ruining movies, I loved the constant play between father, daughter, babysitter, hero, mother, and son that went on. Which role is more important? Who is suited for what role? Why a women here? Oh wait can't be stereotypical there.. but nevermind they are stereotypical and it works!<br/><br/>Regardless the plot is simple, the screenplay is what you'd expect for an Incredibles sequel and that's not bad. Because I went in for good animation and plenty of good moments and Incredibles 2 served that up in spades. <br/><br/>First of all. The animation and surround sound work. Wow. Just wow. Top notch. <br/><br/>As for moments there were plenty of laughs and some quick unexpected tender moments. Along with memorable action sequences and some dull whatever ones (no movie is perfect). <br/><br/>Incredibles 2 accomplishes what it should have accomplished elevate the successes of its original, while maintaining true to its theme, style, and characters.

Being parents of two children of a similar age to Violet and Dash we enjoyed the dynamic between the two. <br/><br/>Yes, as an adult, you can probably work out who the antagonist is quite quickly but it's a FAMILY film, designed to be suitable for 3 to 100 year olds - there will be some predictability!

"lmpuyen","10","2","4","23 June 2018"," I have nothing to complain about this perfect sequel
","Okay I admit, I am quite an easy-going consumer, but when it comes to ""Incredibles 2', it convincingly earns my 10 stars. <br/><br/>The first thing that we have to talk about is the plot. The movie is nearly 2 hours long but it is so well written and skillfully paced that it barely feels like 30 minutes. I feel like though every scene is planned perfectly, nothing drags on for too long, nothing seems unnecessary, nothing is under-explained. Somehow ""Incredibles 2"" managed to be action packed but not shallow and quick paced but not rushed. Also regarding the plot twist, I like how it is predictable but it still leaves room for debate. I personally like movies where you feel like you know the answer, but then there'll be moments where you are not too sure, which in my opinion is more fun than movies that leaves you in the dark completely or those that are just too easy to guess. To sum up the point, if you like a movie that is exciting, lets you speculate a little and have some light humor thrown in here and there to make you smile, then the ""Incredibles 2""'s plot is just perfect for you.<br/><br/>The thing that I must say I love most about this movie though is the portrayal of the characters. I did not re-watch ""The Incredibles"" before seeing this sequel in cinema, so I expected to have a hard time reconnecting with the characters, but somehow this movie has me fond of them within the first 15 minutes. The characters were all unique and in my opinion accurately presented. Violet did not follow the ""typical moody/angsty teenage girl"" cliche nor was she so mature that she couldn't possibly be a teenager. She was smart, cool, real and honestly very likable. Dash is crazy, no discussion. Bob is not perfect, a little too prideful sometimes but he tries his best for his family, like all good fathers. Helen honestly reminds me so much of my mom, and I like that because I think it is in a way more realistic. A lot of the time movies make us think that for a female to be ""strong"" she has to be emotionally detached and most ""strong female figures"" in popular movies don't seem to have any desire to start a family or contribute to one, and the ones that do are often the damsel in distress and never the star. I don't know about you, but most of the ladies that I know and love wants to become a mother and have their own family, and they are strong but also soft and caring at times. I like movies that show that ladies can be successful without having to lose certain traits that makes them compassionate human beings and ""Incredibles 2"" does a great job at this.<br/><br/>All in all, I love this movie and I would recommend it to almost anyone."

The interplay between him and Bob is always good.<br/><br/>Violet gets a little annoying after a while.<br/><br/>The final confrontation was a little ""busy.""<br/><br/>So, overall the one rule I have for determining if a sequel is effective is whether it stands on its own, and this one does.

In the fight Winston, the head of a telecommunications company, sees how they fight and looks for a way to make these come back, because, although we saw that in the first movie the Super had been congratulated for protecting the city of Sindrome, they are never they became legalized.
I think the expectations that a second part is excellent and can surpass the first are always standing. However, the story in this case although it comes to sound on very interesting paper and that the villain will be just as amazing as in the first, unfortunately it was not so.
In spite of this, the story fulfills, therefore, from the beginning we were told that this second installment was going to be as such a continuation of what happened with the ""Under Miner"".
The story continues as it should, resolves some questions that remained from the first. Since there were more Super's in the world or only the two of them were left.
All this because in the first film we had seen that most famous Super's had been eliminated by Sindrome.
Therefore, the film fulfills resolving doubts and giving a continuation to the story that had been left pending in the first one.
Even so, the story of the film was not meant to make a deep story as it was its creator. But the story is fine and it fulfills.
Now, the characters.
In the first movie we could see a great interaction between characters. From the villain and how it was created, to how the society reacted to the Super's as a great and magnificent interaction between the family and how it touched on deep themes.
In this second installment there was a bit more character development, in this case we could see the father part of Bob, we understood that even a Super like Mr. Increible can get tired in situations of controlling a baby, with the puberty of a girl and a child's biggest problems. The maths.<br/><br/>In the case of Helen we could see how she develops in her heroine role. Which seems to be doing cleaner jobs, and well, this kind of thing is explained by the movie itself.
In case of Dash and Violet we see part of the stage in which they live.
Violet even being a girl in puberty who tries to be locked in her room and throwing all her life in the trash because the boy who liked her so much does not talk anymore.
And well, Dash is a child who is maturing little by little, although we did not really see much of him.
But here goes one of the problems that this movie had and it was the villain, the new heroes and someone who was not mentioning, Jack Jack.
The villain, I will be honest, was interesting though, it was too predictable to know who he was and how he was defeated, well, I just think it could be done in many different and faster ways.
The new heroes really if they appeared or it would not have given equal, I do not feel that they contributed something to the plot, only the answer if there were more Supers and such. So the only option for which included them I think it was to answer the question and sell toys ... more toys.
Jack Jack ... No, I do not mean that he was a bad character, however I think he was too exaggerated to the point of being absurd.
And yes, I see many unique and different saying: ""Oh, but the character was very cute and tender.""
Agh, I do not think I should answer them because that's too stupid.
Quickly we go to the visual section.
It's that easy, 14 years apart they look ENOUGH. Just compare many scenes and textures of the first movie against this first film and you will know that Disney did a great job.<br/><br/>Finally the sound section.
The usual, Michael Giachino doing works of art and the effects of wonder.
This last point that I am about to say I do not take it for the final grade, but it is something I wanted to say.
I know that Memo Aponte, the person who made the voice of Dash was no longer able to make the voice, but in truth that in the Latin dubbing the voice that opted is quite annoying. Although I do not know if it was his voice or the attitude of the character, but it was simply unbearable.<br/><br/>
The film is a continuation of what was left in the first, but nothing more.
The story is simple and simple as if it were a The Incredibles 1.5, it feels that something is missing to be able to call as part 2. Even so, it is a film that will not disappoint someone who needed answers to some things that were incomplete in the end of the first movie.
The Incredibles 2 is a movie that you must see because it is good, fun and fulfills what it promises. It is not excellent, it is what it is, a good continuation."

","It took them 14 years to make it, but alas the sequel to the mega Pixar hit has arrived. I actually re-watched the original film the other day to refresh my memory. I have my favorite films from Pixar and while The Incredibles isn't one of them its still a very fun film with an interesting spin on the superhero genre. Brad Bird and most of the voice cast return and the sequel is already a massive box office hit for Disney. While the sequel isn't exactly necessary, its worthy enough and a fun time and is actually close in quality to the first.<br/><br/>The film picks up exactly where the original left off. Superheros are still banned, but a new initiative attempts to get superheros widely accepted again. This means that Elastigirl is out fighting crime while Mr. Incredible has to take care of the family and attend to homely duties. However, troubles arise when a mysterious foe named Screenslaver attempts to control people to push a dangerous anti-superhero agenda. Its once again up to the family to save the day.<br/><br/>Sequels that wait too long usually show age and don't work as well. Take Super Troopers 2 and Dumb and Dumber Too for example. There isn't really a discernible drop in quality with Incredibles 2. It hasn't missed a beat. Part of what makes this film fun is the MVP of it all, Baby Jack-Jack. His newly discovered range of powers are fun to watch and clearly provide the most laughs in the film. This was an excellent touch.<br/><br/>Something that makes the Incredibles endearing is the focal family. They have individual quirks and personality which are fun to watch. We have superhero fatigue at times in Hollywood yet Brad Bird and Pixar makes it feel fresh. It took a while to make but there aren't too many complaints. The film brings fantastic visuals of action and a bunch of hero v. hero action. Its a worthy sequel from Pixar that does justice to its predecessor (something you can't really say about Cars). A fun time will be had for all.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"TheOvereducated","10","0","0","5 July 2020"," The trailer is doing the film injustice!
","I am a fan of the first film. So when I saw that a sequel is coming to cinemas, I got excited! Then I watched the trailer... and I was disappointed. The story seemed pretty bland, almost non-existent. I actually got so unexcited, that I decided not to go to the cinema.<br/><br/>Then one day, recently, I said Ok, let's try to watch it on Disney+ and see... I really liked it! The story is intriguing - the trailer is definitely doing the film injustice - and the film's overall indeed entertaining. It even made re-watch the 1st one afterwards, 'cause I wanted more and didn't remember that a lot anyways. Oh, and it's action packed! There are some action scenes where I got very excited, I was like ""I've never seen THAT in an animated series!"""

","I'm a total Disney freak and always biased to it, but when it comes to sequels you can't help but compare.
Saying it was better than the original might be 'controversial' to some people, but in my opinion it's the case. EVEN IF we put the flawless animation, the special effects and the amazing layout aside. we still have a VERY successful (even if a bit predictable) storyline with an actual good comedy, not kids comedy, but all ages comedy.
The movie was fast paced, witty, suspenseful and just overall enjoyable with not a moment of boredom. And if some people have a problem with the 'feminist' plot line then i say you missed the entire point of the movie.
Can't wait to watch it again."

"sirwillisiv","9","6","20","16 June 2018"," An INCREDIBLE sequel...
","Like a good sequel should, Incredibles 2 continues the story with fresh ideas and dilemmas for each character. What it does better than the original is its focus on the entire Parr family and how they juggle both hero and civilian life. I adore the first Incredibles, but most of the focus was centered on Mr. Incredible and his personal crisis of reliving the glory days. In the sequel, we not only follow Elastigirl's action-packed new job, but we also explore Mr. Incredible trying to connect closer with his children who he hardly interacted with in the first film. Not only does he need to tame Jack-Jack and his chaotic new abilities, but he must also console his teenage daughter Violet as she endures boy troubles, and help his son Dash who is struggling with his schoolwork. This is new territory for Mr. Incredible and it results in some genuinely funny and touching chemistry, and I personally think its where the film soars at its highest. The movie is called The Incredibles, which suggests the movie is about all of them, therefore featuring a strong family connection is essential, and the sequel does a better job at that. <br/><br/>With each viewing of the original film, I found myself more and more impressed with the subtle lore that The Incredibles' universe possesses. Their world is set in a supremely anachronistic 1960s era where technology has rapidly heightened. Incredibles 2 doesn't ignore this mythology and expands it with blinding creativity. From the architecture, to the clothing, to the machinery, the film is absolutely dripping with a retro-futuristic imagery. The mythos regarding superheroes is a charming call back to the golden age of superhero comics and cartoons, with the colorful suits, flashy names, and a diverse array of abilities that opens the door for tons of fast-paced inventiveness during the action sequences. It's an engrossing and smartly-designed world, yet Brad Bird keeps the focus where it should be: On the family and their story. The imagery and lore has a casual but unique and dazzling prescience that requires more than one viewing to fully absorb. <br/><br/>The original film, however, does one element a lot better than the sequel, and that's the main antagonist. Screenslaver, despite a clever title, is nothing remarkable and his promise is sort of squandered. There's a twist surrounding this villain that is quite foreseeable and the pay off isn't very memorable at all. In fact, the ""surprise villain"" trope is getting very tired, especially in Disney. It was there in Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, Zootopia, and Coco. GIVE IT A REST. On better terms, this allows the aforementioned family dynamic to shine more. The fact of the matter is: Screenslaver is no Syndrome, who was by all outward appearances a more interesting, outright adversary, and perhaps one of the Disney's greatest baddies. He was intelligent and charismatic, but also ruthlessly cruel and murderous; a loser who was motivated from years of jealousy and neglect. With that aside, I did enjoy the new characters. Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul fame really captured Winston Deavor's suave and idealistic charm, and I'm happy the actor is receiving more high profile work. The new band of superheroes that Elastigirl meets, despite their minimal screentime, are likable and serve an extravagant purpose during the climax. I must praise Michael Giacchino's musical score. It's jazzy, thematic, and exploding with adrenaline. Excellent range overall, his scores never disappoint. <br/><br/>The animation, compared to the original film, has skyrocketed in quality. The character designs are more brisk and expressive, similar to Brad Bird's traditionally-animated masterpiece The Iron Giant, where many characters displayed a wide range of evocative reactions. There is one scene where Jack-Jack battles a raccoon, and the critter's movements are brilliantly animated. Snappy and comedic, yet not ignoring its natural, reactive behavior. The entire scene reminded me of a Chuck Jones cartoon, it was very slapstick but didn't feel out of place. Additionally, there's a scene where Violet encounters his crush Tony Rydinger at a restaurant and she sprays water out of her nose in surprise. Kinda gross in theory, but the exaggerated, cartoony expression on her face as it happened really sold the moment as pure comedy. It came out of nowhere and I was laughing hard, probably harder than I ever have in my history of seeing movies in the theater. I also appreciate how Tony Rydinger looks more boyish than he did in the original, almost resembling Hogarth Hughes from The Iron Giant. His look in the first film didn't seem right, he more resembled a man in his early 20s. Major props to the improved animation. It not only supported the action, but the humor as well.<br/><br/>To conclude, Incredibles 2 is a mighty fine sequel. The family has a strong and amusing chemistry, and the action is fast-paced and stylish. It shows Brad Bird still carries a gift for telling effectively character-driven stories without sacrificing thrills. The only thing hampering the film down is its weak and predictable villain. It was great seeing these characters on the big screen again after 14 years. Suit up and prepare for an excellent blast to the past."
"deniellemontoya","9","6","20","16 June 2018"," IT WAS SO GOOOOOOOOOD AND SO MUCH FUNNNN!
","I made a review on how this would be so much better then Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom; and boy was I right! I loved the movie! It was obviously well crafted. I loved the fact that each of the main characters had their own great funny moments. Jack-Jack definitely stole the show. It's one of those movies I would love to watch again. Watch it! You'll love it. The animation looked so good. I've watched two sequels (Deadpool 2 and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) prior to this film; both were disappointing and so to have a sequel that actually, to me, is better the first one, is really really refreshing. I couldn't stop smiling after the movie. It really was an Incredible film.<br/><br/>Now, I put in 9 because I don't think there's a perfect movie ever. But I definitely 30/10 recommend this movie."

"rgkarim","8","5","16","15 June 2018"," Incredible Follow Up
","It's another weekend and with it comes another attempt for Disney to sweep the box office with another ""masterpiece"" to win the hearts of many. After 14 years (according to the pre-movie showing), my favorite Pixar movie comes back to bay with the sequel to hopefully bring spectacular adventure back to bay. Incredibles 2 is promising to be a lot of fun, but we never know what the studios of Disney will put into a movie to meet the expectations. Robbie K here back with another review, to help guide your movie watching pleasures. So, let's get started. <br/><br/>Movie: Incredibles 2 (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
 Brad Bird
Writer:
 Brad Bird
Stars:
 Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>Cute: If the trailers didn't paint this picture, take it from the reviewer that Incredibles 2 is chock full of adorable features to woo the hearts of many. Both young and old are going to find something to hook onto in the Super family's drama, whether it be the pint-sized baby or the warm feeling one gets of the strong morals of family, and it absolutely accomplishes the family friendly atmosphere. <br/><br/>Balanced First Act: Pixar's team showed much promise of matching the first movie in regards to all the balancing it did long ago. The Incredibles 2's first half is beautifully crafted to include action, story, comedy, and morals into an engaging tale that accomplishes the goal of setting up for an epic conclusion. It's primarily run by splitting the story between the two plots of Elastigril (Holly Hunter) working to uncover the mystery of the ScreenSlaver and Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) trying to a parent, making sure to give each section their due focus and efficiently switching between arcs. <br/><br/>Relevant: While I can't relate to some parts of the movie, I applaud Disney/Pixar doing everything it can to craft a tale that is relevant to so many people. For comic book fans like me, the dilemmas of heroes doing their job despite the prejudice of society speaks strong in terms of your values challenging others. Others will cope well with the girl power motif that Elastigirl's arc portrays, keeping it mostly on the down low, yet hitting hard where it needs to be. Yet, there will be many who will grip tightly to family moments and the challenges modern parents face given a changing society. By broadening this cope, Incredibles II is going to rope in a lot of fans of varying ages, all once again getting captivated by the arcs in store. <br/><br/>Animation/Action: The movie is well animated, no surprise there from the masters of CGI storytelling. While Pixar always gets points for their world building, character design, and fluid motion, Incredibles 2 amps up the ante by including action sequences into the mix. Fortunately, they accomplish the goal of adrenaline pumping stunts, comic like combat, and making sure it remained pertinent to the story so as not to appear random. Your little one will be able to handle much of the stunts thrown in and become super impressed by all that comes with Pixar's approach to action. <br/><br/>Comedy: Of course, you want to laugh in a movie, and the Pixar group is happy to deliver a variety of laughs to the mix. The first Incredibles have a number of inside jokes revisited in this installment, primarily in the obsessions of the characters. In addition, some of the melodramatic moments are going to be relevant to some, causing the age groups that relate to it to get the most laughs. Jack-Jack's cute levels are going to appeal to most of the bunch, as the baby with no limits defies just about everything to bring his high-pitched laughter out in full. My favorite though...Edna Mode whose attitude and mannerisms are back in full force, with little to hold back the Dahlings. <br/><br/>
DISLIKES: <br/><br/>Predictable: The mystery of Screen Slaver is certainly the factor to keep you guessing, until you figure out the twist a mile away. Incredibles 2 doesn't do a good job of hiding the identify well, using some of the blatantly obvious dialogue to drop the hints long before the big reveal. In addition, the way they take obvious detours with some of the characters paints a bullseye on the back. It would have been nice to have a bigger twist, but sadly all the other antics took precedence in this movie. <br/><br/>Inconsistencies in Story Components: The movie certainly establishes a lot of super powers to come in, but some of the gifted characters may have a little more power than one expects. During some of the action scenes in this film, a few of the characters could have easily solved things with these overpowered components. No limits are established to explain these components, and certainly that takes away from the suspense when you realize how easily they could have solved it. Most won't care about this dislike, but eventually as people rewatch it and tear it apart, you'll start to realize these moments. At this point, I'll state that some of the new characters didn't have the best utilization of the new characters, showing off some abilities, but never the extent of warranting inclusion, with the exception of one. <br/><br/>Jack-Jack Balance: The first act broke the balance the first established, in order to bring more screen time to Jack-Jack's antics. Merchandising is going to have a field day with the pint sized hero, utilizing all his new modes portrayed in the movie for toys, books, and whatever else you can think of. The movie focuses so much attention on the little guy, that it soon started to go overboard for me. In addition, the trailers only show you a fragment of the little guys power, and despite the attempt to explain his abilities, Jack's-Jack's power is insanely overdone to the point he is almost like a deity. I said there were a few broken parts and this is the example. <br/><br/>Anti-climactic finish: Remember the end of the first movie where you were on the edge of your seat as the family fought that giant Robot that held no qualms with destruction? Me too! Incredibles had done a nice job building up the giant antagonist and covering their bases to design a challenging, but doable end fight. The second installment however, resorted to some cheaper tactics that diluted what was supposed to be the most exciting moments of the movie. Part of it came from the predictability of the story, another part came from the focus on the comedy instead of the action/story. Yet for me, the action scenes seemed much shorter and simpler, not bringing the heroes to a conducive dynamic that the first one shined with. Why there could not have been more excitement infused in, I don't know, but I was hoping for a repeat ending that I saw all those years ago. <br/><br/>
THE VERDICT:<br/><br/> Incredibles 2 accomplished much of the goals set out since the sparks of the first trailer showed up on the screen. It's a family friendly movie that appeals to both generations, the first part in particular absolutely accomplishing the level of quality the first had. With the balance of comedy, story, animation, and relevant plot elements it is going to appeal to so many and hook you into the film. However, the movie still didn't quite strike the chords the first one did as the plot was predictable, the power levels inconsistent, and the merchandising approach of the baby it just didn't maintain that balance I loved. Plus, the finish could have used a little more work to help pull everything together in a satisfying way. Still, this movie warrants a visit to the theater, and YES kids should have no problem handling this movie, though gauge their responses to loud noises, darker shadows, and one darker element of the plot about 45 minutes in. Well done Pixar for managing to craft something well, now just strive for the balance again and you have it down to a perfect. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Over a decade after their last big screen adventure, the Parr family, headed by dad Bob (Craig T. Nelson) and mom Helen (Holly Hunter) are performing their heroic deeds as their super-hero alter-egos Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, along with their kids Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dashiell (Huck Milner), as well as baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile.) But their activities are still illegal, and their exploits have caused yet another public calamity. All seems lost, until millionaire Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), launches a campaign to make superheroes legal again, along with his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener.) But a mysterious villain called The Screen-slaver plunges The Incredibles, and their cohort Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) into a battle where no one is who they appear to be...<br/><br/>We seem to be under attack from a barrage of sequels lately, some to fairly recent films and others to films from a while back that never got their follow up when they were flavour of the month, such as this sequel to the animated 2004 superhero satire The Incredibles. That said, they will only ever make sequels to films that were in any way a success, and so the comparatively lukewarm fanfare this sequel received was telling in itself. I certainly took my time going to see it, even after being very impressed with the first one, not least because I didn't relish sitting in an auditorium on my own packed with noisy, screaming kids. So, of course, I went to see it yesterday on a Bank Holiday Monday, thinking it wouldn't be so bad because it had been out a while and the showtimes were less frequent (bad luck!!!) Sadly, I wish I hadn't bothered...<br/><br/>The animation, special effects and action sequences are, of course, as amazing and impressive as ever, and will certainly bring spark and joy to the average young person (no gender stereotyping!), who will be dazzled by all of that without thinking of anything else. But whilst older, more demanding viewers will still enjoy the in-jokes and references to modern pop culture and social issues, they will be less impressed with a far less engaging or coherent plot than the original, as well as a really obvious villain you can see from a mile off. As many others have noted, there seems to be some really obvious interference from the female empowerment lobby in the proceedings, with Mr Incredible as the 'stay at home dad', while Mrs Incredible is off saving the world like a superhero should throughout, in a reversal of how it's been throughout the years.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why this got made, other than as a cheap and easy way to make some cash. Original director Brad Bird has doodooed all over his original masterpiece with this pointless and flat offering, that came out of nowhere like a thief in the night, with no Incredibles to stop it. **"

"niko2895","10","3","8","20 June 2018"," A more family driven plot line then a superhero and villain plot line.
","So this movie compared to the first deals with more with family issues then villain issues. The first movie you have a main villain you already know who it is, family teams up and bam, great super hero movie and ending. This movie is a bit different. You dont know who the villain is, so now it becomes a mystery super hero movie. The issue with it which EVERYONE talks about is not an issue at all. How can a movie have a predictable plot line if its meant for children. In every episode of any kids cartoon you always know the bad guy is because its predictable. <br/><br/>Next, the movie focuses on the family more. The father is trying to help raise all 3 children why mommy is out for work. More family bonding time then the first for sure and thats what i like about the movie. It shows you what its like to be a super hero movie. <br/><br/>One complaint i do have is that i do wish there was more comedy from Dash. The first one was a bit more entertaining with him because he was all hyped up and excited. Thats ok thouhg because i still did enjoy his lines."
"Animated_Antic","10","3","8","19 June 2018"," An exciting sequel well worth the wait.
","I don't think I will ever see an animated movie sequel as highly anticipated as ""Incredibles 2"". Since the release of the first film back in 2004, people have been begging Pixar and director Brad Bird to make a follow up to the fantastic first movie. In fact, if I had a quarter for every time I saw someone on the Internet state that they wanted an Incredibles sequel, I'd be rich. Now here we are. The movie that fans have been waiting for fourteen years is finally out. And it honestly might be even better than the original. I'm not exaggerating everyone. This film was well worth the wait and it was just awesome.<br/><br/>It's been three months since Syndrome's defeat, and the Parr family - Bob (Craig T. Nelson), Helen (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell) Dash (Huck Milner) and Jack Jack - are still struggling to live their lives as everyday people when superheroes are still illegal by the government. Not only that, they've been living in a motel and the government is shutting down the Super Relocation program which has kept their identities secret for over fifteen years and has erased memories to keep it that way. However, their luck seems to change when a wealthy tycoon named Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) call Helen to be in a new program that is hoping to make superheroes legal again. What happens next is Helen saving citizens and investigating a new super villain known as the Screensaver and Bob having to deal with Dash and Violet along with Jack Jack who has started to develop superpowers.<br/><br/>Before the movie, a little snippet featuring Nelson, Hunter, Samual L. Jackson, and Brad Bird appeared where they said that they knew that it was a long wait and promised that it was worth it. That promise was certainly kept. Everything that was great about the first movie has been stepped up to the next level in this movie. The story was actually more mature than I expected it to be. This movie was certainly made for the fans as it actually did have some mild swearing in it, but all the better for it. Not only that, it's extremely funny. This film has a lot great laughs mostly coming from Jack Jack and his powers which included a really funny scene involving a raccoon that I certainly won't spoil here. This is definitely yet another fantastic movie script written by Bird that might have been better than his Oscar nominated original. The animation was also pristine. Pixar really stepped up the animation from the first film as it looks so detailed and realistic that it's amazing how far along they've come since the early days. The action scenes were an exciting highlight of the animation. They were so tense and thrilling that it definitely led to a great climax. The old characters still have the charm from the first movie and even the new characters were great. It was so cool to see new superheroes in this world as we only got to see the Parr family and Frozone while everyone was either mentioned or briefly seen in flashback. They definitely had some unique abilities and powers, but their personalities were also strong. I think my only minor flaw I have with this film is that the villain, while still fantastic, is not as good as Syndrome. Then again, that was a really hard act to follow though I think the villain here is still pretty great.<br/><br/>What can I say folks? ""Incredibles 2"" is a fantastic animated movie sequel that was well worth the fourteen year wait. Everything in this movie was improved from the last one and it was certainly a lot of fun to watch. I can't wait to see what Brad Bird has up his sleeves next in terms on animated movies. I just hope it won't have to be a long wait."

","Going into the theater, I honestly wasn't expecting much, but, my god, this film is amazing. I don't know how Pixar is doing it, but they are making sequels that are almost, if not just as good as the first movie. Finding Dory and Cars 3 to name a few. This movie continues that and then some, because I honestly might love this movie just as much as the first one. The animation in this movie is fantastic. The visuals and animation are so great that they almost look like real life. It is truly amazing to see how much work was put in to the visuals in this movie. The story in this movie is surprisingly fantastic. I was expecting it to be bland and predictable, but there were many times in this movie in which I was surprised. Not to spoil anything, but the villain reveal is one of the biggest shocks of the film in my opinion. I heard that the reason this movie took so long to make is because of Brad Bird trying to make the perfect story for the sequel. And you know what? I think it really is works. This film is just fantastic and I think it is worth the 14 year wait. I can't recommend this enough for those who love the first movie, as it's action packed, funny, thought-provoking, and gorgeous to look at just like the first one. Overall, I couldn't be happier with how this film turned out, as it is a truly incredible sequel."

"brightbrumby","10","3","8","18 June 2018"," I thought it was Incredible 2!
","Being a 16-year-old, the Incredibles was a movie I grew up with. I watched it countless times, and when I saw this movie with my parents on Saturday, I was amazed by how good it was! I figured I simply must review it.
Obviously, the Incredibles 2 is a sequel and I usually have my doubts about sequels because it is very rare that they manage to be as good as the first movie. But, this sequel was almost as good as the original movie, if not, just as good as! Or maybe, just maybe even better. Wow! I was mindblown. 
There are only two good animated sequels I can think of besides this one that are just as good as, if not better than their original, and they are: How to Train your Dragon 2 and Toy Story 2. 
As mentioned before, I grew up watching the Incredibles and I would've been thoroughly disappointed to see a weak sequel to this film, and I was worried that could potentially happen after watching weak sequels Cars 2 and Cars 3 which were honestly... the worst of Pixar.
Not only does this movie have you sitting on the edge of your seat in suspense, it is also charming as it has great family messages and is funny at all the right moments. 
(WARNING: Big spoiler for this next part) I think that the new villain Evelyn Deavor/Screenslaver is very evil and mysterious, which is a good thing, of course. She has an interesting motive as well: trying to make sure supers stay illegal because the public reply too much on them, which is how her parents died. I personally loved that plot twist! 
What I also found very cool and different was that Evelyn used her very advanced techno-skills to create Screenslaver and a hypnosis effect that can ""enslave"" anyone, including supers. The black and white strobing make these scenes extra intense to watch in the dark cinema (which I would not recommend to people with epilepsy and seizures). 
It was something different to put Helen/Elastigirl in the spotlight for this movie, and it was cool to see it. The family moments in this movie were charming as well as funny. Violet is having relationship issues with her almost-boyfriend, Tony Rydenger, after Rick Dicker erased his memory of seeing her in her super suit out of fear that her and her family's cover was blown. While dealing with this, Bob also has to help Dash with his homework while Helen is, of course, out saving the world. On top of this, Bob discovers that Jack-Jack has powers, and several of them, too. That baby has plenty of screentime and he deserves it, too. The people in the cinema loved it. 
Overall, Incredibles 2 is just as super and incredible as the original, maybe even more so! It's a little more dark, intense and mature than the first movie, but still charming and funny. I agree with the reviews: It was worth the 14-year-wait. 
Pixar, you've done it again!"

"stevendbeard","8","3","8","17 June 2018"," If You Liked The Original...
","I saw ""Incredibles 2"", starring the voices of Craig T. Nelson-Book Club, Turner & Hooch; Holly Hunter-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Raising Arizona; Bob Odenkirk-Better Call Saul_tv, Let's Go to Prison; Catherine Keener-Get Out, Captain Phillips and Samuel L. Jackson-The Hitman's Bodyguard, Changing Lanes.
This is a sequel to the 2014 hit and it takes place right after the first one ended-you can also tell that it takes place in the 1960's because of tv shows Johnny Quest & Outer Limits being seen on tvs. If you liked the original movie, then you should enjoy this one, too. Super heroes are not in favor. In fact, it's against the law to be super heroing in public. Craig, Holly and their friend Samuel-as well as Craig & Holly's kids-have to perform their super deeds from the sidelines, at the risk of going to jail. That's when Bob and his sister Catherine come to them with a plan to legalize super heroes again. The only problem is that it involves just Holly working alone-until the public's trust is won back-and Craig has to become a stay-at-home dad, watching the kids. Their new baby, Jack-Jack, is also developing his own set of powers and it becomes a handful for Craig. The main villain is called Screenslaver because they use hypnotism to enslave people. There is a minor villain called The Underminer that is seen at the beginning of the movie-he digs underground using a machine shaped like a rocket with a spiraling cone. In fact, after the end credits, there is a quick scene of The Underminer digging up from the bottom of the screen.
It's rated ""PG"" for action and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","This week I chose to watch The Incredibles 2 (2018). The logline reads ""Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for Jack-Jack while Helen (Elastigirl) is out saving the world."" For 14 years the world waited for a sequel and the world got what it wanted. Pixar did a great job with setting up the trailer and giving the viewer enough information without revealing the plot twist. Absolutely nothing about the movie was a disappointment. The storyline was great and all of the action was well thought out. Nothing felt odd or out of place. All story elements were executed well and as per usual Pixar gave us dazzling visual effects. It is astounding to watch the beautiful elements come together in harmony to grace us with such delight. The story felt like classic Incredibles and stayed true to all of its elements. The characters also remained true to themselves. This is definitely a sequel that has earned its place as one that exceeds its prequel. All in all, I would have to say that this movie surpassed expectations. I believe that this is partly due to the fact that Pixar kept Brad Bird as writer and director. This does a lot for story continuity. This is a special movie and deserves it's box office smashing numbers."

"djkimtech","4","5","17","18 August 2018"," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","TL;DR While this film is visually and aurally appealing in Pixar standards, this film drops a lot of the aspects that made the original Incredibles unique in favor of a more box office friendly approach.<br/><br/>As a preface, I adored the first Incredibles growing up, and after re-watching it in preparation for this film, I still adore it. So, this review will carry some bias, because I think the Incredibles 2 is a perfectly OK film by itself. <br/><br/>What this film has going is its updated visuals, interesting and engaging action scenes, and music; or in general its aesthetic. Originally Director Brad Bird wanted the visuals of the Incredibles to mimic that of those Golden Age-Superhero posters back in the 50s/60s, and while the first film did a great job in context to what technology was available, this sequel nails it. The skyscrapers were massive and follow the simple geometry of modernist architecture, the trains, cars, and other vehicles were all futuristic in a modernist sense (again), the music while not so different from the original film was still magnificent and brassy, and the action was very impressive and flashy whereas the original film didn't have too many opportunities to show off this sort of choreography. And while the plot, characters, and script were meh, without the context of the original this film is a perfectly OK 5/10 and a perfect rental if you want to appreciate the high quality artistic direction that Pixar produces.<br/><br/>Now that being said, this film loses almost all the magic the original had. To keep this readable, I'll just mention two of the most annoying aspects of the film but be sure I had other qualms with this film and you can find most of them in other reviews.<br/><br/>The first aspect is line delivery. In re-watching the original, I noticed how snappy, quick, and sticky the dialogue was. Most people I know have at least memorized 2 scenes from the original and I can almost guarantee YOU the reader know the super suit scene by heart. Now how many lines from the Incredibles 2 can you recite? Maybe the ""Math is Math"" line but that might be it. One part of why this is because the voice actors who weren't in the original did not follow the cadence and speed that original voice actors, the most blatant violator being the voice actor for Void. Instead of sounding like someone who is a part of this 50s/60s-quick talking world, her nervous west coast girl delivery sounds sorely out of place like the picture of the time-travelling hipster. The closest voice actor to get to the delivery was Bob Odenkirk, but even he would sound out of place if he was casted in the original film and kept the same delivery. This aspect is hard to explain in words and this is more of guttural reaction to the dialogue, but hopefully if you re-watch the original you can tell too. The other aspect was how much this film just felt so standard. It has X number of action scenes, it has Y number of funny scenes, it needed to have 5 Jack Jack scenes, etc etc. The magic of the first film was how reserved the animation was to let the character designs, subtle facial animation, and dialogue shine. It is amazing how re-watchable the First Act is being it was primarily in a gray office building. There are so many scenes in the original Incredibles that were shot-reverse shot. A true sign of a director following an inspired vision to the end. What about the Incredibles 2? It relies heavily on a compilation of scenes that halt the progress of the plot to produce oohs, aahs, and laughter (talking to you Jack Jack, raccoon, and Edna) instead of quality scenes that can do the same (albeit less flashy) and give us insight into characters and conflicts.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot discredit the Incredibles 2 too much for these aspects because these aspects are what I got from the original, me alone. If you want to watch a 3D animated movie with your family, go ahead and pop this on your living room screen, but if you want to watch a movie like the Incredibles, you will probably be disappointed."

","SPOILER: I got to see this movie as part of a double feature on Wed, June 13, 2018 and I was hit with all the nostalgia. This movie brought me back to when I was 10 and watching The Incredibles for the first time at the theatre! <br/><br/>Perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I actually liked this movie more than the first for one simple reason: The Incredibles 2 included the entire family, throughout the film (for what seemed like a more equal screen time between the Parr family). Sure, I like the first movie too, but it relied heavily on Mr. Incredible for a great chunk of the movie; it isn't until about halfway through that Mrs. Incredible, Violet and Dash actually get in on the action. Not to mention, Jack-Jack doesn't do a whole lot to add to the film (not until the very end or in the short). <br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 uses all 5 members of the Parr family to create a movie that is funny, heart warming and super, from start to finish.

"jzbussey","6","7","28","15 June 2018"," Its alright, I guess...
","There are a lot of things this film does right. It takes notes from the original and feels like a sequel, its action packed, and its family fun. However, to me the best part about the original film was in its subtlety and this film throws subtlety out of the window and just tells you everything, making it more childish in my opinion. For example in the original film Mr. Incredible works for an insurance company and while on the surface it just seems like a job, in the background he actually has this job because he wants to help and save people. So like if there was a robbery he wanted to be there to help that person in need like the old days. Things like that make that movie easy to revisit, and i have at least over 20 times. Bottom-line, while it takes some of the best things from the film, it leaves out the part that makes the first Incredibles film more than a normal pixar family movie, in fact more than a movie. And thats the subtext and the social commentary under the hood, rather than on top like this film."

Brad Bird has not lost his touch thank goodness, I got a little worried after his last film Tomorrowland. Just to get the negative stuff out of the way, it's not as good as the first movie. The story isn't quite as tight, and the villain isn't quite as memorable as Syndrome. As far as a Pixar sequel I liked it more than Finding Dory, but not as much as Toy Story 2 and 3. Other than that, this movie is a FUN time. That's all you can really ask from a sequel to Incredibles, it honors the original and takes the characters to great heights. Especially Jack Jack, he freaking steals the show. He had me laughing so hard I cried. The movie displays stunning animation and it was very noticeable jumping from the first movie right into the new one. Overall Incredibles 2 is great fun. It's action packed, funny, and still has the heart of a Pixar film. People are gonna love it, and I'll definitely be seeing it again. -8.5/10."

Dialogue, characters, action, comedy, drama, realism (weird in an animated movie, but some parts felt really... real somehow). We see current themes being explored (like the dad staying at home with the kids while the wife makes the big bucks), we see a well made villain with actual motivation and good dialogue (not monologue).<br/><br/>The use of everyone's powers was pretty good too (maybe Dash felt a bit underused in the movie).

"Randy_Dreammaker","5","2","5","11 December 2018"," Almost Incredible
","I have to agree with other reviewers, the beginning of the movie started out with the same energy, look and sound as the original which was an excellent movie. Unfortunately, the new look of this film using 3D computer rendering doesn't have the same flare or look as The Incredibles. Instead it looks a little old and the rendering isn't the best quality. This film would have looked a lot better if it had stuck with the more legendary cartoon animation look.<br/><br/>Vocally, the characters like the energy and quality of the original. I guess fourteen years really makes a big difference, that makes sense.
Again, the beginning of the film, before it switched over the to this new older style of 3D rendered animation has the punch and original sound quality, but loses it the moment the shift occurs. My best assumption is the first few minutes were created much earlier.<br/><br/>Additionally, Elastigirl sounds like she has a lisp, that was present in the original version - again probably due to the length of time that has passed for the voice actors.<br/><br/>Audio is also the result of lower quality recording production.<br/><br/>The storyline following other in the steps of other movies like Fast and Furious and Ghost Busters III which effeminate films which were originally not written or developed around that theme, diminishes the overall quality of the series.<br/><br/>Seeing worn out, lack luster Mr. Incredible with occasionally clips sitting at home baby sitting and the kids doing nothing other than whining and complaining at home, is really disappointing.<br/><br/>Not even a nice try."

The special effects for Frozone were fantastic, but.... yay. There wasn't anything different or even additional to his character. Jack-Jack was funny, but in a 2-plus-hour movie, there needed to be more laughs. Slow, boring, and nothing new. Maybe it's because I was expecting so much that I was so disappointed."

"aydengex","6","2","5","19 July 2018"," 'Incredibles 2' Thoughts and Opinions.
","I see people criticizing The Incredibles 2 for it's apparent ""foul language"" and for how ""it's not suitable for smaller children."" In the first movie we literally see a man jump from a 10+ story, city building with the intent of taking his own life, for some reason that's better for your children than them hearing some characters using words like ""damn"" and ""hell"" in commonly used phrases; or the parents becoming so called ""zombies"" for a short time.
Are you kidding me? That is the most absurd criticism I ever heard and really goes to show how much people are sheltering their children nowadays.
I wouldn't even say this movie was ""darker"" than the first movie. If you go back and look at the fist films plot, it's about how superheros can't do what is morally right because of corporate heads who only care about money. This is dark in of itself.<br/><br/>The start of this movie was almost the same as the first. Superheros who cant do their jobs get a random invitation to do superhero stuff again. This time, instead of Mr. Incredible doing all the superhero stuff Elastigirl gets the spotlight, while Mr. Incredible is at home babysitting the kids. The villain in this film is much weaker than Syndrome from the first movie. Syndrome had a pretty okay reason for wanting to do the bad stuff he did. Unlike the villain in this movie, who just came off very petty and pathetic.<br/><br/>Even the new superheros who were introduced didn't not play a well enough role in the movie. We barely saw them, let alone saw their powers used in a well enough fashion for them to be considered cool superhero characters like they should be.<br/><br/>I'd honestly say the best parts in this movie were when Mr. Incredible was trying to be the best dad he could be, by trying to fix his daughters relationship and taking care of Jack Jack.<br/><br/>The animation, colours, and everything visually was far, far superior of course but, unfortunately that was the only thing better about this than the first. That being said, was this a bad movie? No. Was it entertaining? Yes. I'm simply comparing it to the crazy standards the first movie was able to set and I don't think this movie was original enough or innovative enough to exceed those standards."

I love the uniqueness of Holly Hunter's voice, but it doesn't suit the character of a superhero mother. Same goes for the voice of Violet. It's sort of off-putting for me. To have an animated film be perfect, I believe its imperative to have the voice match the character. Other than that, the film is great. It was well worth the wait for this one. Very action-packed.

","Ever since I saw the first Incredibles, I have been hoping and waiting for a sequel. The first Incredibles leaves a hint for a sequel, and it seemed like a good enough movie for a sequel. After almost 14-years they finally did a sequel. This sequel starts where the last one left off. Despite years having passed since the first movie came out, the cast hasn't aged. This movie also has good direction and writing, as I've seen sequels that seem off from their predecessors, however this movie seems to flow in the same direction as The Incredibles. It will feel like a good continuation of the story. It will be nice to see a Super Hero family we remember so well from 14-years ago, and a family that is like as iconic as The Simpsons, (also a family that doesn't age), on screen again in action. I'm sure you'll be very entertained by the action!!<br/><br/>I ought to say that the baby Jack Jack has more of a role in this movie. What I think is probably the most memorable scene from the original movie, would probably be the bonus scene on the menu, ""Jack Jack Attack"" with Jack Jack and the babysitter, Kari. You'll remember that scene with Jack Jack in this movie.<br/><br/>I felt like this movie had a better plot and better direction than the original Incredibles. You'll feel for the characters and The Incredibles do a great job in presenting a super hero family that also at times tries to be normal, and has certain normal things to work out which can seem like real life.<br/><br/>If you liked the first Incredibles, definitely watch this one. I'm sure you'll be entertained by the action. You probably would agree with me that unlike a lot of other sequels this movie seems On Parr with the first one. Get it On Parr? The Incredibles last name is Parr. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I'm hoping for an Incredibles 3!! Of all the Pixar characters, I feel like they are the most worthy characters for a sequel. I give it a 10/10!!"

There is no doubt that the writers, animators, and voice talent enjoyed every moment working with this film - and it was a joy for them to share their work once again with the audience.<br/><br/>In fact, the cast goes so far as to thank the audience for sharing in their work rather than denigrating them.

","Apart from vintage Disney - Snow White, Bambi - I tend not to watch animation but I was struck by the way several critics in National newspapers lauded this title and laboured the point that it was as entertaining for adults as it was for children, if not more so. On that basis I gave it a whirl. Not having watched the first title I had no idea of who was who, if there were any recurring villains etc.
I didn't even know that - like Superman - they were only part-time super heroes, a typical suburban family who, in times of trouble, are able to assume powere beyond the reach of ordinary citizens. There seemed to be some mileage in a storyline that had the matriarch saving the world whilst the patriarch stayed home and played house husband. I can't say that I was moved to dash out in search of other Pixar titles but I did watch to the end."
"jwwalrath-227-85487","10","3","10","18 June 2018"," Almost as good as the first one
","Being a sequel, I had my expectations in check. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. Funny thing is a fair portion of the film in theory shouldn't have been as good as it is. The part of the plot mimes Mr. Mom, they basically just switched Mr. Impossible and Elastigirl's roles, and the same major issue about the superheroes being illegal is rehashed. Yet, the dialogue, humor, and character work is so good in this that it doesn't really matter. The animation is Pixar's best work yet and the action is utterly fantastic. <br/><br/>A lot of people have complained that the villain wasn't good enough. I didn't see that. Yeah, Screenslaver is no Syndrome in turns of personality, but the villain had a decent motivation and his mind control technology was appropriately eerie and menacing.<br/><br/>Also, be forewarned that this may not be a movie for younger children.

"shawneofthedead","9","3","11","17 June 2018"," Brilliant in both execution and enjoyment, Incredibles 2 is worth the wait.
","A sequel to The Incredibles has a lot to live up to. Pixar's fresh, funny look at an ordinary family with extraordinary powers became an instant classic when it was released in 2004 - for very good reason. Writer-director Brad Bird struck a sublime balance between domestic drama and tongue-in-cheek satire - celebrating and sending up superheroes in equal measure. So, 14 years on, is Incredibles 2 worth the wait? Fortunately... yes. It doesn't quite redefine or revitalise the genre, the way its predecessor did, but it's still brilliantly funny, thoughtful and a pure joy to watch.<br/><br/>The film picks up exactly where The Incredibles left off - revealing that, as in often the case in real life, the happy ending was neither entirely 'happy' nor an 'ending'. When we meet the superpowered Parrs again, they're trying to figure out how to fight crime - not just as a team, but as a family. It's more complicated and frustrating than any of them expects, especially when a botched mission yields catastrophic results... and a ban on superheroes. <br/><br/>This turn of events allows Bird to capitalise on the one element of Incredibles 2 that remains unique even in these superhero-obsessed times: the fact that the Parrs are a proper family, bound together by blood, love, duty and responsibility. That dynamic - anchored by the profoundly relatable tensions between husband and wife, parent and child, brother and sister - was what made the first film such a delight to begin with.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 builds on this with even greater warmth, sensitivity and insight. When she's called upon to front a pro-superhero publicity campaign, we watch Helen/Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) struggle with the demands of being a working mom. Left to take care of the children, Bob/Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is forced to come to terms with his own roles and responsibilities as a father. And the kids are experiencing growing pains of their own: Violet (Sarah Vowell) freaks out over a forgotten first date; Dash (Huck Milner) does battle with his homework; and baby Jack-Jack tests out his burgeoning powers on an unfortunate nemesis. <br/><br/>Speaking of Jack-Jack - the youngest member of the Parr family steals the entire film - and will run away with your heart too. It's no spoiler to say that he starts randomly unleashing one superpower after another: his abilities manifested in Pixar's 2005 short film, Jack-Jack Attack, and are on full display in every trailer for Incredibles 2. But it's impossible to adequately express just how delightful Jack-Jack is in this film - even as he shoots laser beams from his eyes, spontaneously combusts (""It means fire, Robert!"") and morphs into a rampaging mini-demon. His kinetic showdown with a hapless raccoon is one of the film's best scenes: at once howlingly funny and gorgeously animated.<br/><br/>Jack-Jack is the easy standout, but similar care has been invested into exploring the potential and implications of his family's powers. In particular, there's a thrill of imaginative fluidity that runs throughout every one of Elastigirl's scenes, given freer rein by 14 years of technological improvements. Her ability to stretch herself thin - a canny metaphor for the myriad demands of motherhood - allows her to slip through cracks, soar through the air and stop a runaway train in visually arresting ways. <br/><br/>In fact, it all looks so spectacular that you'll find yourself gaining a renewed appreciation for the pure magic of animated movies. We're living at a time when CGI and special effects can pull off just about anything on screen. And yet, Incredibles 2 proves with its every frame and action sequence that there are some ideas that just won't work as well in live action. (That's a lesson Disney might want to take to heart, by the way.) Edna Mode - genius fashion designer and undying fan favourite - proves it whenever she slices through a scene, radiating a cutting charisma as huge as she is tiny.<br/><br/>It's fair to say, however, that not everything about Incredibles 2 feels quite as effortless as it did for its predecessor. This time around, Bird's screenplay isn't as light and nimble in its examination of superheroes and the people who help and hinder them. The characters of Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and Evelyn Deaver (Catherine Keener) are more grounded, for example, but also less interesting than the likes of supervillain Syndrome and super-sidekick Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson). The biting meta commentary of the first film is sorely missed. Some of the characters aren't given much space to grow, either - Dash moves the fastest of them all, but feels like he doesn't really go anywhere. <br/><br/>14 years on, you'd be perfectly justified to ask if there's any point to Incredibles 2. After all, we now live in a cinematic era in which the superhero genre has established itself firmly in Hollywood. We're intensely familiar with tales of ordinary people living and grappling with extraordinary powers. In the decade and a half(ish) that has passed since, Pixar has also released a bunch of sequels to films that didn't require or deserve them (*cough*Cars*cough*). It's enough to make you doubt if the Parrs have anything left to say - and if it would be said well. Thankfully, the wit and wonder of Incredibles 2 proves that good things do indeed come to those who wait - and that we'd be happy to wait for even more."

Character development is important in this movie. Elasti-girl is one of the best heroine ever. The action sequences were fantastic. I do however enjoy Jack-Jack because he steals the show. Him vs. the Raccoon was hilarious and great. The villain was a bit weak but truly a terrifying villain. I did like the concept of Mr. Incredible being a Dad to his kids. It was very touching.

","SPOILER: Let me get this out of the way: Incredibles 2 is a very enjoyable and fun film that will entertain both young and old, and you should go see it.<br/><br/>Having said that, I can't help but dwell on the fact that this film somehow doesn't feel as special as the original.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's because when I saw the first Incredibles film, I was 11 years old, and the superhero phenomenon was just beginning to gain steam (Spider-Man 2 came out in the same year, 2004). But now, I'm 25, have seen way, way more superhero films, and Incredibles 2 just feels like one more good superhero film. It's good, but the original was special, and this doesn't feel very special anymore.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film has been overhyped in my mind. It's been 14 years between films, a long time to wait. They even did an intro video with Brad Bird, Craig T. Nelson, Helen Hunt, and Samuel L. Jackson, saying ""We get it, 14 years is a long time, but trust us, it was worth the wait."" <br/><br/>Was it, though?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: it was very fun to see Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack together on the big screen again. Plus, we got to see what happened with the Underminer!<br/><br/>But, this film's marketing was heavily based on Jack Jack, and the discovery of his new powers. In that, they did a good job, and Jack Jack was pretty much the best thing in the film (in a good way). However, we say this 14 years ago in the short film ""Jack-Jack Attack"" with babysitter Karli, and to be honest I would much rather watch that than Incredibles 2, if given the choice.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this film, from its heroes to its villain, whom you see coming a mile away but it's fun to guess just how and when our heroes will figure it out and how they'll stop said villain. Nevertheless, I think this film will be more special to those who can see these films back to back with a young eye. There's plenty for parents to enjoy here too, but for those of us who were kids when the first one was released and had to wait those 14 long years, I think we should temper our expectations and just enjoy the ride (speaking of awesome rides...)"

When people use those devices, they act just like they are hypnotized! People don't even think about what the politicians or manipulators describe and take it as their own opinion.
Not all the villains have to be strong in strength or destructive. They may be a hypnotist just like Screenslaver. And, this animation is not about feminism. The director has made the stance in the interview which about changing the gender roles to let both sides see each other. Moms don't have to stay at home. Dads don't have to go outside to earn money. They can switch their characters and do the different things. But, what you choose has its consequences or results. Like elastic girl said at the last.

","After 14 years, Disney decided to make the sequel to their Oscar-winning superhero animation (it was that or Shrek 2 so there was barely a choice). I have to say that Incredibles never stole my heart, even when I was a kid. It was a fun film, I even had a VHS (I am old, I know). Nonetheless, I barely remember it and it didn't give me the excitement plenty of people are expressing now. It wasn't my superhero debut nor I fell with any character or the story. Sure, there is Frozone but who does not love Frozone.
And with this more or less bitter taste, let's return to the sequel. I watched it because I had no strength to see anything more complex that day. Just for fun. So don't tell me I had any expectations at all. Leaving the cinema, I was content, not excited nor pissed, I was ""okay"". It basically does not say anything good about the film. Recent fashion of reboots and sequels of everything that 90's kids loved slowly drives me crazy. And here we are again. It might be the problem I had with that. Disney probably wanted to make money from reselling the goods to the new generation. I wouldn't be surprised.
About the film itself, it catches when the previous one left off and to be honest I'm not sure if it was a good idea. Because as a viewer I could feel the difference. Not sure if it was because I am more mature or because I saw it ages ago or there was indeed some difference in character writing. No damn idea. But I felt like all of them are older although they allegedly haven't aged a day. The main focus however continued. The lawsuit against superheroes is still on and the whole family got blamed for all the disastrous crap that happened because of Underminer. And the story goes, of course, someone wants supers to return. Who would have thought, eh?
The idea of the plot wasn't so bad, but the whole plot twist was so obvious. It was Pixar, after all, and their films aren't usually crappy. And Incredibles 2 wasn't crappy, too. It was just a content type which may be exciting that 14 years ago but is not anymore. I loved that they kept the original design ideas. I loved that Edna hasn't changed (but had barely one scene, sadly). There was no magic I usually feel while watching such films. It was lost somewhere in that 14 years and Brad Bird couldn't have found it.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed the most was the whole daddy story. It was a classic thing, no surprises or anything, but it stole me. And the racoon, too. Jack-Jack was supposed to be the new hit and I believe my problems with him was simply because of the hype. But come on, a baby with like 10 powers. No wonder they wanted to extend that idea. Furthermore, I really appreciate all of the ""new"" superpowers. It was smart and to be honest I didn't expect they would go that far with these. Oh, and there's also Screenslaver. This name is neat. I don't mean the guy, I mean the name itself. ScreensLaver. Amazing."

","This film is a continuation of the first Incredibles film. Following on from the underminer attack, a wealthy businessman sees the opportunity to legalize superheroes again. The wealthy businessman picks Elastigirl to be the symbol of the superhero movement, whilst Mr. Incredible stays home, to look after the kids.<br/><br/>This film is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles).

"mrwickedproductions","8","2","6","24 July 2018"," Are the Incredibles still, well... incredible?
","It's a hard question to answer right off the bat. They're super, that's for sure, but incredible? Perhaps if Incredibles 2 was released 10 years ago they'd still be. But in today's popular culture, while the woman power message is relevant, the story has missed it's timing-by a decade or so.<br/><br/>The first movie, The Incredibles, was the movie that solidified my fascination with Pixar. And frankly, it wasn't a difficult thing to do. The 2004 animation has everything needed to captivate a 14-year-old boy in a world of supers while keeping that fascination grounded with everyday family matters. It is a well rounded adventure, truly for the whole family to enjoy and come back to. At that young age, I was inclined to follow Violet's point of view of beginning to experience teenage angst and worries. I'm not at all embarrassed to admit that I had a bit of a crush on the socially awkward character.<br/><br/>Of course, now that admission would be wrong to reaffirm, considering I'm 14 years older now than I was back then, while the Parr family picks up literally right where they left off at the end of the last movie. In my initial viewing of Incredibles 2, it was thrilling to see the super family and Frozone take on the Underminer. That conflict had 14 years of anticipation to satisfy, and it does fairly well with mildly interesting action paired with top-of-the-line animation. I should state right now that none of the action in Incredibles 2 comes close to the release of pure excitement that the first movie brings, particularly with Dash figuring out that he can run on water, chortling as he does so with the soundtrack silencing and crescendoing back in. There are plenty of fights in the sequel, but sadly no scene is as iconic and memorable.<br/><br/>As an older boy, I find myself relating more with Elastigirl this time around, who spends a majority of the movie out of the home purposely seeking danger in order to show a super's perspective to the world. While the movie focusing on a female protagonist is the new thing in America (not sure if ""new"" is appropriate considering it's been done many times in recent years with a wink and a nod) many of the plot devices and story elements have been done before, surprisingly enough even in the first movie! In both films, the protagonist is approached by a wealthy, eccentric billionaire claiming to be sympathetic towards supers and wants to give them a chance, despite supers being illegal. The protagonist, through their new employer, carries out hero work, unbeknownst to them that the one behind the villainous strings is the one who hired them. In the end, the villain attempts to use the protagonist to carry out their own agenda to demean the existence of supers.<br/><br/>Syndrome's classic line from the first movie is ""And when everyone's super, no one will be.""<br/><br/>The Screenslaver says something along the lines of ""Make supers illegal permanently.""<br/><br/>Both villains are backed by reasonable and heartfelt stories, but Syndrome's boyhood dream of wanting to become a super along with his past connection with Mr. Incredible makes him a far more complex antagonist. Mr. Incredible essentially made the villain Syndrome, while the Screenslaver is more of a female villain in a female lead adventure. It's the classic, the protagonist is a woman, so let's make the antagonist a woman as well! It's cool, but nothing personal is going on between Helen Parr and Evelyn Deavor, besides the awkward nods of acknowledgement tossed back and forth between the two. When Evelyn reveals herself to be ""the mastermind behind the mastermind,"" and Elastigirl says, ""I trusted you!"" I couldn't help but think, Why, at the same time Evelyn replies with the exact same thought. Just because she's a woman? Just because you gave her a nod and she gave you one back? That revelation was not an enjoyable scene. In fact, I'll label it as the worst scene in the movie. It didn't help that the true identity of the villain was more predictable than the twists in Ocean's 8.<br/><br/>But at least, like its predecessor, Incredibles 2 allows the rest of the characters an opportunity to shine. Jack-Jack gets a bit of a long sequence showcasing some of his new and old powers while fighting a raccoon. Fun, but again, a bit long. Edna Mode seems to steal the show for some people with her unique characteristics and manner of speech. And Violet and Dash provide the everyday family problems of boy trouble and math respectively (you never know, it's 2018). You'd imagine that there would be plenty of laughs to be had with Mr. Incredible struggling to fulfill the role as a stay-at-home dad, but most of the situational setups procure sweet, tender moments instead, which is typical of Pixar. However, there are no tearjerker scenes. (The Incredibles franchise hasn't come to that yet.)<br/><br/>Either way, through empathy or humor, the latest Pixar film with leave you smiling. It won't be an incredible smile like Frozone's, but something along the lines of super."

"ThomasDrufke","6","2","6","21 June 2018"," Carbon Copy of the First, With Some Great Action Mixed In
","It took 14 years for an Incredibles sequel, and for some, that was far too long. I spend a good chunk of my time online reading articles and watching videos related to movies and television. I can't think of a single movie that people clamored more for than another Incredibles adventure. I like the first movie, but it would fall very far down the list of Pixar movies for me. So when they finally announced a sequel a few years ago, my reaction was pretty much nothing. Really, I just needed reassurance that if you're going to make a sequel 14 years after the original, there better be a darn good reason to do it. Well, after seeing the end result, I can't really think of a good reason why Pixar pulled the trigger on this one (other than the obvious - money). Is there anything overtly refreshing about Incredibles 2? Nope. It's predictable, unorginal, and uninspired. What I will say is that there are some very impressive action sequences and it was nice to see Elastigirl take center stage. Watching Jack Jack do his superhero-y things is also a joy to watch. However, the first film had a sharp script with just as much laughs as it did heart, and an obscure villain that somehow worked. I can't necessarily say the same about Incredibles 2, which falls into the trap of a rehashed script and a horrendously botched villain. Is the film entertaining and worth a glance? Perhaps, but if you're looking for something that improves on its predecessor, you should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

","1st watched 8/12/2018 :
Action-based CGI entry from Pixar doesn't have much more than this, and therefore disappoints. In this sequel, the movie starts with ""Super Heroes"" being against the law, and the family trying to hang as ""just"" a family. A high-falooting business man has an idea to bring them back in the fold and hires the mom(because she destroys less stuff) to do some work to help turn the tides on the idea of bringing them back. Therefore dad has to do some of the normal mom stuff like taking care of a baby who has newfound powers. For some reason - Pixar added very little humor to this movie. The baby did some funny things, but that was about it. There was some unique animation(including one seen with the evil character) which could invoke seizures in some, but sorry that's not enough for a good movie. I have seen a lot of action scenes, and pretty much anything can be done in computer animation so it's ho-hum if there is not a story you want to follow and characters you care about. This had neither. A lot of time and effort was put into creating this sequel, but in my eyes it wasn't worth it."

"kermitkid","7","1","2","31 March 2020"," I waited 14 years for this?!
","Although the plot is not as good as the first one, it is still worth the 14 year wait. The first half could have been improved immensely though, because for the first hour or so it feels like a gender-swapped rehash of the first one, and plays more like a direct-to-video sequel like the ones Disney used to put out. The first half still has its moments though, particularity the ones with Jack-Jack and the trouble he gets into. A lot of the humor in the first half does come from those scenes, and is more visual based. After the first hour, the plot definitely picks up and reaches a satisfying conclusion. There is still plenty of great action, and the villain, while not as good as Syndrome from the first movie, does deliver a pretty great monologue that makes you think for a moment that their goal isn't so bad, but simply the methods they are using to reach that goal. When it finally is revealed who the villain is though, it does feel stolen from a certain Marvel movie that shall remain unnamed so as to avoid spoilers. The animation is still gorgeous, (though the character of a newscaster does look like an animated caricature like the ones you would get drawn of yourself at a carnival and he just looks creepy), and some of the best voice acting is from Bob Odenkirk. He is one of the best characters in the film. It is disappointing that the film, in terms of plot and character development, had to take a bit of a step backward. What made the first film so unique was seeing the family dynamic and the family using their powers to help each other out. Here, we get very little of that. It has the typical ""The dad is stupid and hapless and needs the mom to fix all his mistakes, har dee har"" stuff that's done to death in just about every sitcom on tv, and that's disappointing, especially from a so-called ""family"" company like Disney. Haven't we as a society moved past this? In a world where everyone is crying for ""equal rights and representation"", shouldn't we get true equality? Equality does not mean superiority at the so-called ""privileged"" individual or party's expense,and that's disappointing to see here. It also had some unnecessary (albeit mild) profanity, which was also disappointing. (Again, ""family"" company) Overall, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect it to be as thrilling as the first one.
Grade: C 7/10 3.5/5 stars"
"CybJubal","4","1","2","22 February 2020"," Watch the first one
","--Skip to Section 4 for my final opinion--<br/><br/>This movie, in my opinion, is just a cash grab banking in on the Incredibles' name. It's a bit like all the new Disney live action remakes, just there to make money off of our nostalgia. I watched this film in cinema when it came out, it was a waste of my money.<br/><br/>The first film is a classic, an example of family entertainment done right. This film, however, pales in comparison to it's predecessor. Now I've been quite vague during this review, so SPOILER WARNING:<br/><br/>1. Villain is terribly written.
The villain in this film, Screenslaver (real name Evelyn Deavor), is TERRIBLE. Compared to Syndrome (the villain of Incredibles 1), who had a legitimate reason to hate superheroes and (more specifically) Mr. Incredible, it took me a while to figure out what the hell Screenslaver's motives were. A VILLAIN'S MOTIVES SHOULD BE CLEAR AND MAKE SENSE FOR THEIR SITUATION.<br/><br/>Screenslaver's motives are that her father was killed by a robber and the superheroes, who had been OUTLAWED, and couldn't save him. That makes NO SENSE, either her father was a complete moron or the writers couldn't think of an original motive.<br/><br/>2. The plot is... bad.
This film has one of the most predictable and terribly written plots I have seen in recent films and I've watched the Secret Life of Pets. It's just the hero's journey with a bit of a super twist.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film, which had nuance, humour, action and emotion all in one film, I felt NOTHING whilst watching the sequel. A GOOD FILM MAKES YOU FEEL.<br/><br/>3. The positives.
The graphics are amazing, as expected from Disney-Pixar in 2018, and there was an hilarious sub-plot with Jack-Jack developing his powers, it had me and a lot of other people in my local cinema laughing.<br/><br/>Do the positives outweigh the negatives? I don't think so.<br/><br/>4. Final words.
Just watch the first one, the second one is sub-par, barely entertaining enough for a baby film. Skip this film, watch the other Pixar classics."

But I was disappointed with it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that too much time is spent with Helen doing all the hero work while Bob stays home doing nothing besides trying to take care of the kids. This isn't a bad story line, but it goes on for much too long. Bob eventually gets involved, but there's not a lot of times when he gets to use his super strength. There's not a lot of times when Dash gets to use his super speed either. I also thought it was annoying how rude Violet acts. I also didn't like it that Jack Jack has a whole bunch of powers and constantly causes problems. I can see why lots of people would like this, but I liked it much better when he wasn't around. Furthermore, his numerous powers make the lead characters seem a lot less special. The presence of numerous new super heroes further adds to this.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, I did enjoy some of it, but it's just too unbalanced, I thought it felt sort of like a really long version of one of those minor sequels (like ""Jack Jack Attack"", ""Frozen Fever"" etc.).

Switching the rolls of the parents for Helen & Bob Parr does well to introduce a new family dynamic, along with new conflicts to deal with (say Jack Jack's 17 distinct powers). As shown in a brief sibling argument in the 1st act, Evelyn Deavor's aggression towards Winston's post traumatic stress adds simple backstory to the main villain.

","I still remember watching the first Incredibles film and liking it for what it was, rather than what it had been marketed as. I liked its darkness, and how much of the character and plotting seemed aimed at someone much, much older than the marketing had suggested. By contrast, Incredibles 2 seems much more interested in keeping things light and fun. This makes it a slightly 'lesser' film in terms of the detail and observational elements but does make it easy viewing. The plot sort of follows a journey for Mrs Incredible, but it doesn't really build it so much as use it - likewise any emotional knock-on for the other characters is the same. In terms of what plot it uses to get with this, it is obvious enough in terms of twists and direction, but it does the job.<br/><br/>That job is producing plenty of enjoyable action and funny moments, and does so for most viewers of most ages. The lack of darkness helps this slickness, and the 1960's vision of the future design adds to the sense of fun with its nostalgic references and look. The voice cast are all solid, even if several of them are essentially doing what they are famous for (Jackson, Odenkirk). As a whole there is much to enjoy in terms of spectacle and laughs, but it doesn't run much deeper than that, making it a lesser film, but probably one good enough that you'll not feel the impact of that till you reflect back on it."

","Incredibles 2 (2018). Yes, this Disney Pixar production broke the box office record for animated feature, amassing $180 millions its first weekend out. As expected, this full feature animated film contains the emotional buttons that rivet the audience to self-reflection on issues of parenting, self-determination, responsibility, adolescent relationships, family, ostracization, and technological manipulation. The humor is well placed and potent. The 3-D animation substantially enhances the visual experience, unlike most real live action films in which the technology still hasn't quite caught up with reality. While the movie's plot is potentially predictable for an astute, careful observe, it actually serves to reduce the negative angst of the movie to promote the summer entertainment quotient of the movie in a most successful way. The only two weaknesses that seem to arise occur earlier in the movie with the sustained action pack opening sequence while engaging its audience veers the movie more towards a series of action montages that resemble more action thriller block blusters and there's an over-extended scene reminiscent of chipmunks and acorns from Ice Age."

","Better than the first Incredibles movie. I mean I watched Fantastic Four at that time and both movies resemble a lot when it comes to super-powers.
Although there was a forced-feminism act and lots of Helen Parr / Elastigirl's buttock view, the outing seemed nice. Personal issues and Superhero egoism always comes into play.

","Why are people constantly saying it's too politically correct? It's like you can't have a female lead without being called too feminist now a days. Elastigirl was chosen for the missions because unlike Mr. Incredible, she doesn't create millions of dollars worth of damage when she saves people. It wasn't simply because she's a girl. I know SJW content is constantly in today's movies (like the latest Star Wars films). It's annoyingly common but definitely isn't in this movie. Everyone calm down.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was done incredibly well with the same amount of enjoyability as the first one. However why it took so long to come out is pretty ridiculous. The plot is literally exactly the same as the first one.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>The film opens with the Incredibles performing heroic acts and getting chastised when something goes wrong. Obviously they still want back in the game finding everyday life not suitable and are contacted by a somewhat mysterious organization that focuses on promoting one character (Mr Incredible in the original, Elastigirl in the sequel). The assignment is take down a staged villain (The Robot in The Incredibles and ScreenSlaver in The Incredibles 2) while the real villains turn out to be the ones behind the organization. The villain is incredibly tech smart and has a backstory where a super didn't meet their expectations and therefore become their enemy. To take down this enemy the focus hero decides they can't take the villain alone and teams up with those they left out of the hero work during the first half of the movie. Yeah it's the exact same story.<br/><br/>I praise this movie because it's written well and very enjoyable. The characters are just as intriguing and the plot is perfect for the adults who watched the original. Pretty much every Marvel movie has the same plot so I'm not going to throw a fit over this. Watch the movie if you get the chance. Also possibly the most important thing I must add... Elastigirl is thicc af"

","First off, this movie needs a huge epilepsy disclaimer because there are several scenes that are very likely to give people problems.<br/><br/>Though the movie was still very good, it didn't come close to matching the expectations set by the first movie. My biggest problem with this sequel was that the family did not seem to work as a team. In the first movie, the whole family was continually using their powers to complement each other. This movie had each Incredible acting largely on their own; all working towards the same cause, but usually not directly interacting with each other. This appears to be standard for modern superhero films, but the first Incredibles had lead me to expect more out of this sequel."

"tomgillespie2002","8","1","2","17 November 2018"," Will surely win over a whole new generation of fans
","The superhero genre has changed massively in the 14 years since Pixar and Brad Bird's spectacular The Incredibles. We now live in a world where a talking raccoon and sentient tree can make their way into the general audience's hearts and an African king can rake in over $1 billion at the box-office. The genre arguably reached its peak in terms of ambition, scope and pure spectacle earlier this year with Avengers: Infinity War, so a sequel to Bird's excellent and heartfelt 2004 romp was becoming increasingly unlikely - and unnecessary - as the years rolled by. Whether the creatives had a change of heart or Disney simply insisted, Incredibles 2 has finally arrived to try and prove that it's still relevant in a time when it feels like we get another superhero movie every month. With a heavy dose of visual pizzazz and a ton of heart, Incredibles 2 certainly hits the mark while naturally paling in comparison to its relatively flawless predecessor.<br/><br/>Completely ignoring the 14 years that have gone by in real time, this sequel picks up immediately after the climax of the first film, with the suited-up Parr family - Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) - facing off with the newest villain in town, The Underminer (John Ratzenberger). Their scuffle with the burrowing thief causes collateral damage throughout the city, and in response the government shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs homeless and without financial support. They are offered a glimmer of hope when CEO and superhero fan Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) reveals his desire to put the crime-fighters back in the public eye and remind the world of their importance. Helped by his tech genius sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener), Winston favours the clinical elegance of Elastigirl's powers over Mr. Incredible's destructive brute strength, so while she is out battling a mysterious new criminal called Screenslaver, he is tasked with tending to the kids.<br/><br/>Splitting up the central characters is a popular approach for many sequels, and here it seems like a natural way to further explore the themes of family bonds and individuality of the first film. Elastigirl savours her chance to shine, demonstrating a range of formidable powers which allow for some spectacular and beautifully-rendered action sequences. Most of the biggest laughs come from Mr. Incredible's struggle to handle his new responsibilities, as his face becomes increasingly haggard and grey with stubble. Dash needs help with his maths homework and Violet has boy troubles, but his biggest obstacle is ensuring Jack-Jack doesn't cause accidental mass destruction with his combination of laser vision, dimension-hopping and morphing into a literal flaming devil. Jack-Jack is usually the kind of animated character that has adults rolling their eyes, but his combination of wide-eyed innocence and clumsy displays of limitless power is utterly charming, in particular his encounter with a hungry (and soon to be sorry) raccoon. Incredibles 2 doesn't offer anything new to the genre or anything in the way of surprise, but it does its thing with style and care, allowing every character - including the returning Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone - their moment in the spotlight. 14 years after thrilling one generation, this sequel is sure to bring the next one on board."

"blrnani","8","1","2","8 November 2018"," Almost a 9!
","Whatever, this is a very welcome and long overdue sequel to the wonderful first film that is still 2nd among my favourite animations.
As a very good sequel, it loses in freshness but gains in familiarity. Jack-Jack adds much to the hilarity - his encounter with a raccoon is a high spot of the film. The only downside is Dash's hyper behaviour with gadget remote controls, which is both irresponsible and downright disrespectful (when he keeps snatching one out of his father's hand - one longs for some parental discipline there, so the irritation outweighs the humour).
I've seen criticism of the villain as being weak, but I think that's missing the point of the subtlety here. She's not an evil person, but a potentially very decent person whose attitudes have been distorted by resentment over the loss of her parents, which she attributes to the superheroes having abandoned them (whereas their activities had actually just been made illegal, thus taking them out of commission).
Another subtle element addressed in the film is to what extent a dependence on being rescued by superheroes has made ordinary people passive and less able to take care of themselves. It's clearly a Republican message about overdependence on government, but no less valid a question for all that.
Now I'm looking forward to The Incredibles 3 and hope I won't have to wait another 13 years!"

"catimeup","8","1","2","5 November 2018"," Solid, but not like the first
","The first movie was amazing, the second (aka this one) was still pretty good, but not as good as the first.
Part of it had to do with the first being more of a groundbreaking movie. A more serious superhero animation movie without being out of the PG realm. Great art, great story, and for a Pixar movie I felt it introduces a new concept of realism to the superhero fitting into society.<br/><br/>While this movie has the same elements, I felt there was 2 aspects different.
1. It didn't have the same hit as the first because it wasn't new, and therefore had big shoes to fill because the first was great, so our expectations were shifted higher.
2. while the first had the aspect of everything working out in the end, this movie had the same but with the added bonus of everything about superheros being legal again. While it made sense to have a movie resolving this issue in the narrative, I felt that it being illegal was part of what made the first movie great.<br/><br/>There wasn't as much plot-wise in this movie, although that was a lot to do with discovering Jack Jack's powers and while it was adorable I think it took up much of the time that could have been spent delving into the unveiling and backstory development of the villain.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was good, could have been better, but to be honest I still felt it was enjoyable to watch."

"elgsdyr","7","1","2","3 November 2018"," Good but not {insert movie title here -s}
","The first instalment is probably my all-time favourite Pixar film (together with Wall-e) so this follow-up had huge shoes to fill. What made the first one so great was the surprising new way it managed to mix up somewhat traditional super heroes with familiar family challenges in a creative, intelligent and highly entertaining way - all in a perfect setting and atmosphere of the classic spy films and shows.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 succeed with a generally decent story and several funny and entertaining moments building fairly well on top of the first one. Where it doesn't succeed is in most areas that made the first one spectacular. Major ""surprise"" elements in the story where incredibly predictable, so when they were revealed I couldn't help shouting ""Finally!"". The gender role swapping and themes were clumsy and cliched and felt like something belonging in a 70s film and definitely not like something targeted the audience of today. But then again, this is an American film while I'm from Denmark, so things may look different across ""the pond""... Also, the themes in the film generally seem very adult so I doubt that kids may enjoy it that much.<br/><br/>So all-in-all worth watching but sadly lacking the brilliance and sophistication of the first one."

The main plot is just as the first one, but with at least some (predictable) twists. So don't expect any greatness from that, but still do expect enjoying the movie, because it's not bad.<br/><br/>I liked the familiar characters with more life to their style due evolved CGI, I liked the odd jokes here and there, and also the character developement was done well.

"Noah_Biondi","8","1","2","29 October 2018"," Almost incredible
","To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of what Incredibles 2 had to offer. I mean, it's definitely a well put together film, but it's lacking what made the first Incredibles movie so, well, incredible. Can I find out what it's missing? Well, let's find out, I guess!<br/><br/>What's the story? Everyone's favorite family of superheroes is back, but this time Helen is in the spotlight, leaving Bob at home with Violet and Dash to navigate the day-to-day heroics of ""normal"" life. It's a tough transition for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack's emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone must find a way to work together again-which is easier said than done, even when they're all Incredible.<br/><br/>So what is it that I think is inferior to the first film? Well, I'm just gonna get the elephant in the room out of the way first by talking about the villain. Yeah, even if you DID like this one better than the first film, I think we can all agree that the villain is total garbage compared to the first one. The Screenslaver, while having interesting powers and a lot of potential, is also extremely disappointing when you truly find out who's really the Screenslaver. I'm not gonna spoil anything in case you haven't seen it yet, but it's just extremely obvious and stupid. The reason why Syndrome was a much better villain is because that not only was he a great representation of today's pop culture, but it was legitimately interesting and compelling when you found out that it was actually Buddy (oh yeah, spoiler from the first film even though you've all probably seen it before) because the film expected you to remember him from the beginning, proving that a minor character could also be an important one. With the Screenslaver's ""big reveal"", on the other hand, it's not very exciting and the writers weren't even trying to put any sort of effort on the character. Also, the entire story itself on this film is that it's a ripoff of the first film, except with a gender swap. So what that means is that now Elastigirl is doing the hero stuff while Mr. Incredible gets to watch the kids. I'll admit that Jack-Jack's side of the story is hilarious (especially the fight scene with the raccoon), but none of the other side stories really appealed to me. Sure, they could be funny, like Mr. Incredible suffering with Dash's math homework, and plus, Frozone gets a lot of screen time as well, but other than that, there's not much that really stood out, and Violet's side of the story was a bit unnecessary. Okay, enough bashing things, it's time to talk about the good stuff. The animation looks a LOT better than its predecessor. I understand that technology evolves as time moves on, but they updated the animation so it looks a lot better. There's a lot more colors, detail, and the action scenes are a lot cooler. Plus, the textures are just AMAZING and they rendered MUCH better than the first film. For example, compare Frozone's ice from the first Incredibles to this one. Doesn't it look a lot better and more solid in the first film? Not to say the first film's animation was BAD or anything, it still looks impressive, but THIS is even better. Also, the family gets a lot of screen time in this film, so it actually feels like the Incredibles and not just focusing on one character throughout the entire film. One last thing I'd like to mention is that while the score in the first film was outstanding, it feels a lot more complete in this film because it uses a variety of different instruments and has a much more dramatic tone to it, and it also slows down the music to make it feel more complete. I think the scores are equally as good, however, but the first film's soundtrack is a lot more memorable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Incredibles 2 may not be as amazing as its predecessor, but it's still an enjoyable and fun film with cool action, great animation, a very good soundtrack and tons of focus on all of the characters. Even if the villain is abysmal and the script just feels like it was copy and pasted off of the first film but with a gender swap, it's still very fun and colorful. Now onto the big question: was it worth the wait? Well, sort of. It could have been better, but I was satisfied with what I got out of this film. Brad Bird, you've done it again! Keep delighting audiences with your awesome films."

I thought they were a cool idea and not a descent villain, but Syndrome was much better in my opinion. The motive were clear for the villain but they just didn't seem to be that great. The reveal for the villain was super predictable. Literally everyone in the theater called it from the start. The movie overall was mostly predictable which I was expecting just a little bit more surprise and something new. Some new characters were introduced which I thought weren't needed. They also didn't have much depth. The movie was funny. Everybody was laughing and having a fun time. I think everybody who watches this movie will have a great time.

a) A media organisation using the go-pros style 1st person perspective recordings from the hero suits to create a serialised media event demonstrating crime in action.
b) A political movement to present those recordings as proof of the decline of society. Encouraging public opinion to support a stronger, totalitarian system of government and state control.

","A reliably entertaining and charming sequel - and in many ways, well worth the 14-year long wait. <br/><br/>Sure, it falls short compared to the classic brilliance of the original ; the central conflict and villain(s) aren't as interesting, and the plot plays it safer and more predictable. Much of the sophisticated noir-ish tone - partly what makes the first movie so special - is also sacrificed for a slightly more conventional animated/superhero movie take.<br/><br/>But what may be lacking in narrative heft makes it up for pure, breezy entertainment. Being made 14 years since the original, the animation comes off as spectacular, paying homage to classic '30s superhero capers and vibrant with popping colors and visuals. The brilliantly inventive action sequences themselves are some of the best Pixar has done (the now-iconic raccoon chase and Mrs. Incredible's fight against the Screenslaver) - even rivaling some of the best action in superhero movies nowadays. Director Brad Bird - ever-reliable as an entertaining movie auteur, stages these set-pieces with such a masterful touch that (for the most part), the movie is a pure breeze to go through.<br/><br/>While the movie plays it safe with conventional superhero and family drama tropes, its social commentary regarding media and modern feminism is commendable. And Bird clearly understands the core themes that makes The Incredibles great: the central family dynamics, in which he helms with an effortless grace.<br/><br/>While Incredibles 2 has a lot going against it as a long-awaited follow-up to a classic masterpiece, and while it does fall short against massive expectations, it remains reliable as an animated and superhero film, worthy of the 14-year long wait."

","A sequel to one of Pixar's most beloved films, Incredibles 2 delivers in almost every way - and even when it falters, you're having too much fun to notice.<br/><br/>Pixar's track record with sequels is somewhat mixed. In the case of Toy Story, the trilogy has proved a resounding success. With the likes of Finding Dory, however, the result proved somewhat lacklustre, and the less said about Cars 2 the better. Learning that Disney planned a sequel to the hugely popular Incredibles (14 years after its original release), I approached it with a slight skepticism. Would the characters be able to bear the weight of a sequel? Could they maintain the stylish and fresh atmosphere of the original? Would the film collapse under its own hype, leaving everyone extremely disappointed? Yet, as soon as Michael Giacchino's classic score roared into the cinema, my fears were soon put to rest.<br/><br/>Following directly on from the events of the first film, Incredibles 2 picks up with the Underminer's attack on the Metroville Bank. The sequence, perhaps one of the finest action scenes in animation history, is dizzyingly fun, giving each of the family a chance to showcase the superpowers that we all know and love (save perhaps Jack-Jack, but more on that later). After this, the main plot kicks in, with Bob, Helen and Frozone recruited by a business tycoon hoping to make superheroes legal once again. What follows sees a twist to the original, with Elastagirl taking on the crime-fighting responsibilities, with Bob left at home to deal with Violet's mood swings, Dash's homework - and the discovery of Jack-Jack's many, MANY powers.<br/><br/>If there is one true strength to the film, Incredibles 2 is constantly hilarious. Whether it be a set-piece battle between Jack-Jack and a racoon (a real highlight) or just throw-away lines, the script maintains an energy and buoyancy throughout. The film, as one would expect, is beautifully animated, and highlights a clear technological advancement since it's predecessor. It's hard to imagine some of the impressive showdowns of super-heroics in the final act to be carried out with the same gravitas back in 2004. Indeed, this sequel has advanced with the modern world in a number of ways, with Elastagirl's more central role fully embracing female empowerment. The film is not inherently political, but rather embraces more current sensibilities, even within it's 60s-inspired narrative framework.<br/><br/>If there is one gripe that I had with the film, then it's the villain. The Screenslaver lacks the particular menace or motivations in the early section of the film, and their true identity (which I will not divulge here) is somewhat expected. This is particularly infuriating in comparison to Syndrome, Mr. Incredible's ""Number One Fan"" from the original, who had considerable depth and a strong personal connection to Bob. But it's hard to let this detail drag you down when the rest of the cast is so strong. Craig T. Nelson brings incredible comic potential to Mr. Incredible, while Holly Hunter provides a grounded and relatable presence. The return of Edna Mode is always welcome, and Jack-Jack steals absolutely every scene that he's in.<br/><br/>Witty, fast-paced and surprisingly relevant, Incredibles 2 is a worthy sequel to its classic counterpart, and proves that good things really do come to those who wait. Even if it's 14 years."

","Maybe not quite as good as the original, but still a lot of fun and just as well as they appear to be setting up a franchise (another one). It looks great of course, it's well written, lots of snappy action. The comedy is quite quirky though, aimed as much if not more so at the adults than the kids. Disney are clearly putting their moral stamp on things, equally opportunities, digital dependence, accepting all cultures, but hey that's all very good and it's delivered well. Certainly our kids got the message and were happy to explain it to me as the credits rolled. They also laughed uncontrollably at Jack-Jacks antics, we all did! Not quite Pixar at its very best, but very very close!"

Great kids movie and even dark at points made by the villain that I would now side with on a darker day of adulthood. Animation is perfect. Humor is excellent. Genuinely laughed pretty hard at more than a few sequences. All in all. Great sequal. Just hard to not see things coming as an adult trying to relive childhood nostalgia."
"hauensteinkelsey","9","1","2","11 August 2018"," Jack Jack to the Rescue
","After waiting years for this film, I wasn't even sure if I was truly wanting to spend money on seeing it. Sure it looked cute and I liked the first one but it was never my favorite Disney film. But as soon as I walked out of the theatre all I could think about was how great this film truly was and how Jack Jack was the next pop funko figurine I was going to buy. 
With a strong female lead, a honest story line about a man who is feeling less because he is left to do what women are always stuck doing and a great new class of incredible supers, the next installment, if there is one, will sure be a show stopper too. 
If you liked the first one, I don't think you'd be disappointed with this movie and if you didn't like the first one, well, either try again or don't watch Disney movies. They probably don't deserve you and your cold heart.<br/><br/>This film is a fun time. Be careful about people prone to seizures and keep super small children away, there are some intense moment that have a few jump scares, it might frighten those under 3 who haven't seen the first one. <br/><br/>Jack Jack is my personal favorite. He's just a hoot."
"quiqueperezsoler","8","1","2","10 August 2018"," Besides the couple of woke scenes, an awesome action movie and worthy sequel!
","I've read a lot of user reviews in IMDb and have seen the backlash the movie has generated among the familiar audience and fans of the original movie.<br/><br/>It's impossible to deny the elephants in the room: yes, it's clear the movie had failled to hide the forced woman empowerment in an attempt to content the audiences of today; the movie has difficulties choosing a range of age for its rating as swearing and alcohol are present while at times the simplicity of the plot and the almost one-dimensional characters make for a bland, potential dull kid-friendly-only movie. Yes, the villain's twist could be spotted as soon as the backstory of the two siblings is shown and even the overall signals, including the design, of some characters also gave it away if payed close attention to.<br/><br/>I must add then that in defense of the original creator Brad Bird and the creative team, it has indeed, passed 14 years since the release of the first movie and irretrievably the fresh and original vision there once was of that project must have dried out a little with time and the changes could have been influenced by the unfolding of the events ever since like fashion, trends and overall way of thinking of the public. To this aspect, I must add that the movie is, in a way, exempt of portraying realistic and un-cliche plot, subplots, expressions and character developments as from the very beginning the movie's aesthetic is inspired in the spies and campy superhero classic tropes of the 60s. Hence, the designs of various objects like furniture, TVs, supersuits, architecture and soundtrack. In a way, that's what made the movie so appealing in the first place: by reaching for the nostalgia effect for some and a fresh and innovative aesthetic to others.<br/><br/>Once that's clear, my personal opinion about this movie i would sum it up by saying this movie is a great example of a well done sequel, maintaining much of the tropes and themes of the first one, addressing more of the backstories of our original characters therefore enriching them, maintaining also and even exploiting more of that 60s aesthetic so characteristic about this franchise and innovating thanks to the addition of the advancements of new animation engines and improvements allowing the movie to create some of the best fast-pace action scenes and gorgeous animation ever achieved to date.<br/><br/>The animation of this movie was one of the best things to bring to the table, not only was the action breath-taking and natural elements like hair were realisticaly rendered and improved, but at the same time it was clever in many ways and astoundingly creative. Making a good use of physics in many scenes.<br/><br/>Brad Bird, writter and director of other master pieces like The Iron Giant and Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, without a doubt kept with his writting and directive style by giving importance to the family and giving each character their own problems but never overwhelming us. He tried to add more to the Increibles Universe with new unfortunately poorly designed superhero characters, new backstory insight and new cities and landscapes but never forgetting where it came from. Making more use of all the elements and characters from the first one and therefore keeping it closer to us.<br/><br/>The best and most surprising fact is that the ending leaves it open for new stories to be told. In a way that maybe mean that Disney will try to benefit from this by planning more and unintentionally rushed sequels in the future. But, on the upside, we will have more Incredibles!<br/><br/>I'll conclude by saying it has been a while since I saw such an amazing action-packed, funny-humor, classic-superhero, well-character-developed and well-designed movie. It's not as original as the first one (like with all movies) but it definitey lives up to the expectations I had (it could have gone in a very different and wrong direction)"
"scottshak_111","8","1","2","10 August 2018"," 14 Years of Punishing Wait is Over
","The sequel to Incredibles is finally here after 14 years and it's hard not to go gaga over it. Incredibles 2 movie is exactly what we expected it to be - extremely entertaining! In terms of its story, it is almost like its prequel and more, as the creators let it take a natural form taking things forward right from where it left off. Like the presence of Jack-Jack automatically dabbing the throttle on one of its major sub-plot.
The CGI is simply breathtaking which is exactly what you expect from a Disney Pixar creation. Brad Bird has done an outstanding job yet again with the tightly packed chemistry of the family that works so well when they are together. There are plenty of lessons to be learned from the Incredibles 2 movie as you go on a mind-racking joyride that features a villain that would literally dip you into horrific waters and then suck out all hope.
The Long Wait
It was a constant follow up right from the point - ""Why are we not developing a sequel to a truly deserving movie?"" to ""We have finally found a story"" and the news that Brad was all over it flung us into euphoria. That Brad was going to see things through once again, put back the promise in its place, the promise that the movie wasn't going to suck. And it doesn't.
It's time to make wrong things right.
What makes the movie admirable at once is the nostalgia that comes right back with Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) trying hard to get back the reins of Mr. Incredible. Holly Hunter's incredible southern accent that literally resuscitates her character of Helen Parr / Elastigirl again. While they changed Dash's voice this time done by Eli Fucile owing to age issues, Sarah Vowell got in the vocal chords of Violet Parr once again bringing back a sudden gush of reminiscence to the shore.
Then we have Frozone back in Incredibles 2 movie again reprised by Samuel L. Jackson's next to perfect voice. His presence felt quite satisfying and he has a pretty good role in here as well. How can we forget Edna Mode? Voiced once again by Brad Bird to perfection, she serves as a worried nanny in this one, who at once takes interest in Jack Jack's power and abilities and gives him a suit he deserves.
It is almost like the entire family of superheroes and all the related people we saw in the prequel ending up having a reunion.
Other Important Characters
What adds spices to the already outstanding plot of Incredibles 2 movie was the inclusion of Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener) and Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) into the storyline. They take the story forward by bringing that mysterious undertone that was there in the prequel as well. You don't accept people to be good. With Winston and Evelyn giving Elastigirl a chance of her lifetime, a similar plot takes shape.
To help my family I gotta leave it. To fix the law I gotta break it.
The Screenslaver
The Screenslaver is one of those mysterious villains that ends up being a rare match. His confounded theories will make you wonder that like every genius nemesis, he is right on a lot of points. Of course, as to his real identity, who he is, you will find out once you watch the movie. I am not going to spoil it further.
Just going to put this brilliant quote right here untended:
The Screenslaver interrupts this program for an important announcement. Don't bother watching the rest. Elastigirl doesn't save the day; she only postpones her defeat. And while she postpones her defeat, you eat chips and watch her invert problems that you are too lazy to deal with.
Superheroes are part of a brainless desire to replace true experience with simulation. You don't talk, you watch talk shows. You don't play games, you watch game shows. Travel, relationships, risk; every meaningful experience must be packaged and delivered to you to watch at a distance so that you can remain ever-sheltered, ever-passive, ever-ravenous consumers who can't free themselves to rise from their couches to break a sweat, never anticipate new life. You want superheroes to protect you, and make yourselves ever more powerless in the process. Well, you tell yourselves you're being ""looked after"". That you're inches from being served and your rights are being upheld. So that the system can keep stealing from you, smiling at you all the while.
Go ahead, send your supers to stop me. Grab your snacks, watch your screens, and see what happens. You are no longer in control. I am.
Stunning CGI
It is hard not to talk about the movie's stunning CGI. Whilst it is something people often tend to overlook owing to how invested they are in the story, and you barely get time to notice minutiae that comprise it, but if you pay enough attention to every character's expressions, of things that are lingering alongside them, the artwork that goes behind in the backdrop, you realize how painstakingly everything has been built. You know it's grandeur written in every frame. So much of work that has gone in it"

","14 years is a long time between sequels, and unsurprisingly it's meant that the first Incredibles has - very rightly so - cemented its place as one of the all time animated greats. Living up to that is just never going to work.<br/><br/>Thankfully, The Incredibles 2 doesn't do that, coming across more as an episode in the Parr family story. <br/><br/>It's a lot less nuanced than the original, and the pacing felt needlessly jumpy at points. Fast paced is certainly the right phrase to use, though that certainly didn't stop it from being seriously good fun to watch.<br/><br/>In particular, it's the action scenes that stood out most. They're so fluid and dynamic, and are benefited by fantastic cinematography and sound work. They make up for the predictable story and some of the more forced elements of the film.<br/><br/>In saying that, both of the storylines were balanced well, and tied in well, even if the ending felt rushed. Bob's arc felt more like the comic relief to Helen's classic action hero-esque storyline, though both managed to tread carefully and avoid too many cliches. It's simple, and less interesting than the first one, but it doesn't stop every minute of the film being a lot of fun.<br/><br/>It also doesn't dwell too long on references to the original, a particular strong point in my book. This isn't a whistle-stop nostalgia tour as I had feared it might become. Particularly in the opening scene with the Underminer, the way they just jumped into the action sequence felt so refreshing - straight into the new, never stopping once to reference the old.<br/><br/>Less nuanced and less interesting than the titanic first film, but no less fun to watch. Not so much a sequel, but rather a new installment in The Incredibles story. Perhaps it's that laid back approach that makes it such good fun."
"andrewroy-04316","7","1","2","1 August 2018"," Like its predecessor, Incredibles 2 delivers in action, humor, themes, and pure fun
","It really was worth the wait - Incredibles 2 has all the fun and broad appeal we've come to expect from the best Pixar movies. Despite juggling a surprising number of topics and themes (parenting, feminism, digitization, the relationship between power and laws controlling power, and many more) it never felt overwhelming. It's such a difficult balance to strike, but it did feel like a movie that functions effectively as a simple exciting kids movie and a more thoughtful character and superhero movie at the same time. <br/><br/>For me, Elastigirl and her interactions with Screenslaver were the highlights of the movie (though Bob's parenting struggles and JackJack's humor come in close behind). Elastigirl's interactions were fascinating evaluations of societal power structures as well as the cat and mouse game with Screenslaver protecting her identity. Everything unraveled a bit too easily at the end, after Screenslaver bringing so many powerful supers to her side. Regardless, it felt like one of the most unadulterated, joyful movies I've watched while also managing very real and threatening conflict, a movie everyone can be very happy that it exists."

","Just noticed that it is 14 years since the first Incredibles movie came out. A lot has happened in movies, since the original. The superhero movies dominate the box office even more nowadays. The second Incredibles movie is great fun though although undoubtedly more targeted at the adult audience.<br/><br/>The movie sees the attempts of brother and sister duo Eleanor and Winston Deavor to make Super Heroes legal again. They decide that Elastigirl (Helen Parr) is the best super hero to do this which leaves Bob Parr(Mr Incredible) to look after the family. Most of the funniest parts of the movie concern the new powers of the baby Jack-Jack. The movie explores a lot of the modern day tensions of family life and is really engaging throughout. The subject matter and the length of the film may be challenging for younger children. Great movie though and hope it isn't another 14 years before we get the 3rd film."

"lawrencestevens-58369","8","1","2","17 July 2018"," Nice fun animated movie but not as good as the first in my opinion.
","This movie was great fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it despite not being in the target market. The first one was one of my favourite movies as a child and I watched it a lot, and this one did not disappoint but also did not exceed my expectations. The animation expectedly has improved drastically and looks amazing, some of the best lighting I've seen in from a Pixar movie. The voice acting is strong again, with the main cast sounding very similar to what they did 14 years ago (I think the dash voice actor changed and they used sound clips from the first one for jack jack), and it blends very well seeming like it picks right after the first one. I liked the parr family again, as well as frozen. None of the new characters really stood out for me. The main downside I have with the film is the villain, it was incredibly predictable from the start and is not a scratch on the first villain, syndrome. I could also pick up on the underlying agenda that is forced throughout, in wake of me too etc and that can be a bit forced and not to my personal liking, but it is not excessive to the point of ruining the quality of the film. I think the pacing was good and the action is significantly better and more memorable, leading to some clever sequence involving heroes' powers. I think the highlight of the film was jack jack and his variety of powers and his charade with mr incredible. That provided the best laughs and uncontrollable smiles. I think a little more could have been done with mr incredible as he was a bit too much on the sideline and wasn't given much to do, same with dash. Overall I highly recommend this film, especially if you enjoyed the first. This will be great fun for kids, but for adults as well as it has some interesting debates about politics and jokes about parenthood etc which should keep the parents entertained as well. Good film, but not as iconic and as memorable as the first. I hope there's a third one, and we don't have to wait another 14 years!!"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","9","1","2","16 July 2018"," Probably just as entertaining as the original Incredibles.
","14-years in the making, and it's not bad. Dare I say, Incredible stuff? Okay, puns aside, Pixar takes time and effort into making its sequels (except for the Cars sequels) and it shows. Incredibles 2 is natural-feeling continuation of what the original movie built-up: and I love seeing this 60s-styled universe explored further and utilized to explore its already lovable characters. The Incredibles are back, and they still kick-ass in a post-MCU-and-Dark-Knight-Trilogy-world of cinema.<br/><br/>Pixar's still got it in delivering the goods when it comes to computer-animated entertainment; they always make it feel like it's on another cinematic plain of reality that few can accomplish. Sure there are a few problems in the story (the villain this time around ain't no Syndrome) and there are unnecessary extra-heroes that don't really add much to the story besides being plot tools, but it's still just as good and as fun as the original Incredibles; at least for me it is.<br/><br/>Overall it's entertaining and a great superhero flick through and through, and it easily competes with the films from MARVEL Studios. 4.5/5 stars."

"rustonreviews","7","1","2","15 July 2018"," Fourteen years later, and the Incredibles are as charming as ever.
","Brad Birds The Incredibles (2004) is a film deeply embedded in my childhood. During a time in which my interest in superhero comics and cartoons was reaching its peak, it felt as though The Incredibles had arrived at the perfect time, resulting in becoming one of my very favourite Pixar films. It still is, in fact. With the original being held in such high regard by many, it was always going to be risky business releasing a long-awaited sequel fourteen years later. As far as Pixar sequels and prequels go (Finding Dory in 2016 and Monsters University in 2013), I'm not particularly a fan, except for the stellar Toy Story (1995-2010) trilogy. Brad Bird had promised that a sequel to his breakout hit would never be made unless the script was right. And now here we are, fourteen years later, hearing the campy, silver age style villain monologue ""Behold, the Underminer!"" once again. At last, the story continues, precisely where the original film left off. <br/><br/>Opening with a fantastic confrontation between the Parr family and the Mole-Man inspired Underminer (a battle I never thought I'd see), Bird swiftly returns us to a cheap motel in which the Parr's currently reside due to Syndrome's burning ship destroying their home three months prior. As it stands, superheroes are still illegal, a law Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is adamant needs changing. Down on their luck and running out of options, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) drops them a tip that they may have a chance to amend the banishment of superheroes law forever. Keeping Violet and Dash in the dark about the opportunity on the horizon, Frozone leads Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl (Hunter) to DevTech, a telecommunications company led by brother-sister duo Winston and Evelyn Deavor. Working towards bringing superheroes back into the limelight, they propose Elastigirl be the face of their campaign, much to Mr. Incredibles bemusement. As Elastigirl is away uncovering the mystery of new supervillain Screenslaver, Mr. Incredible is left to watch over Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack, who's assortment of powers become increasingly hard to keep under control (displayed in a wonderful sequence in which Jack-Jack faces off with a raccoon). <br/><br/>Just like the original film, Incredibles 2 is packed full of exciting action sequences, many of which even improve on those from the first film. They're breath-taking to watch, and the scope of the film, in general, feels much larger this time round. Whereas the first film belonged to Mr. Incredible, this film is most definitely owned by Elastigirl. Elastigirl's mission is more rooted in mystery (compared to Mr. Incredibles rock 'em sock 'em assignments from the original) as she quickly discovers an adversary in Screenslaver, who uses hypnotising technology to brainwash all those who are exposed to it. Whilst still an interesting villain with believable motivations, Screenslaver never quite measures up to the menace of Syndrome from the first film, and the reveal was particularly predictable. It's refreshing to see Elastigirl taking the lead here as she features in some of the most well-constructed action sequences in recent movies, be it animation or live action. <br/><br/>Taking a break from the action, Mr. Incredible tries his best to navigate his way through his kid's problems as a stay at home father; Violet is struggling with boy problems whilst Dash can't quite figure out his Maths homework, and Jack-Jack gleefully causes mayhem by shooting lasers from his eyes and rapidly multiplying, with small bursts of mutating into a red monster baby (glimpsed first in the original films finale). It's a sweet subplot, and reinforces the fact that parenting is an act of heroism in its own right. <br/><br/>In the one of the original films darker moments, it is revealed to us that Syndrome had murdered just about every superhero from the glory days of supers. With this film working towards bringing them back into the spotlight, we're introduced to several new heroes who unfortunately don't quite get the time to distinguish themselves as memorable characters and fail to make any real impact to Elastigirl and her mission, with the possible exception for Voyd, who can conjure voids reminiscent of those from the Portal video game. Nevertheless, they never truly come across as dead weight and don't drag the film down.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Incredibles 2 is a sequel that feels like it was worth the wait. With stunning action, more humour and a great lead in Elastigirl, Brad Bird delivers a sequel that will please long-time fans of his original film. Nostalgia goggles are unavoidable here, and there are certainly glimpses of fan service throughout, but Incredibles 2 is strong enough to stand on its own. Although it doesn't quite measure up to the heights of the first film, it's certainly a fun time at the movies."

","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>Stands out amongst other superhero films</li><li>Weaker villain - as is plan and motivations</li><li>Fewer messages than the first</li><li>Elastigirl demonstrates stronger female agency - Disney/ Pixar is doing things right!</li><li>We see more of the characters</li><li>Good humour</li><li>Its style is still unique and enjoyable - blend of 60s Bond films and superhero genre works brilliantly</li><li>A sequel worth waiting for</li></ul><br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Nowadays we expect superhero films at the cinema (can anyone remember a time when there wasn't at least one being shown?!). But in a time dominated by Marvel (or DC and Fox trying desperately to keep up) it's refreshing to have a superhero film that a.) isn't based off a comic book, b.) isn't from the usual Marvel, DC etc. and c.) is animated (although that's bound to change with the upcoming Teen Titans Go! To the Movies and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). Not that Incredibles 2 is completely original - the ""2"" makes its sequel status clear, but it's been a long 14 year wait since the first... Back in 2004 the only superhero movies we really cared about were Raimi's Spider-Man films... So how does Incredibles 2 fare in an age already saturated with superhero films?<br/><br/>There was something undeniably special about the first film's plot - it had moral messages both explicit and implicit that pleased countless audiences. Many went away with Syndrome's line ringing in their ears - ""When everyone is super, no one will be."" Ultimately the villain's plot and motivations in Incredibles 2 pale in comparison to Syndrome, as does the character itself. It all makes sense during the film, but after it feels forgettable and devoid of a powerful message. Additionally, I can't help but feel robbed of a large final encounter - but maybe we've become accustomed to Marvel's structure...<br/><br/>On the other hand, it's impossible to walk out of Incredibles 2 without noticing some of the powerful messages conveyed; specifically it's brilliantly relevant and timely feminist message. Let's face it - Elastigirl is a better hero than Mr. Incredible; he's basically a non-green Hulk who hits things hard whereas there's no limit to what Elastigirl can do by contorting her body - she absolutely deserves the spotlight in this sequel. But more than that, Elastigirl's role in this film demonstrates another sense of female empowerment that Disney is doing so well at the moment. Not that Helen Parr is ready to stand up to the likes of Elsa and Moana, but it's definitely a step in the right direction and a good female role model for the young audience.<br/><br/>The sequel also gives us an opportunity to enjoy more of the family dynamics within the Parr family. Although edging on the patronising side, seeing Bob cope with the reversal of the traditional roles adds in a nice bit of comedy, particularly his exhausted face as he deals with Jack-Jack's refusal to sleep and his rising frustration in the face of Math he was never taught. Incredibles 2 allows more of a focus on the family itself, giving the film a more unique feel to the original. As a result, we see a little more of each character; we see more of Violet and her effort to deal with her teenage angst; we see much more of Frozone; and we even see a more maternal side to Edna... It's even better to see more of Jack-Jack, a character who was noticeably side-lined for most of the original.<br/><br/>However the best returning aspect is the style itself. As with the first film, Incredibles 2 marries the 60s era James Bond style with the superhero genre - a beautiful match made in heaven; Michael Giacchino's rollicking brass-dominated score is stronger than ever, strongly evocative of the old Bonds, and the set design is impeccable. I don't know if it was just me, but on top of everything else the music and aesthetic was one of my favourite parts of The Incredibles and I'm just happy it's as good in the sequel as it was back in 2004.<br/><br/>Waiting for sequels (whether we know they're coming or not) is not unusual; after all there were over 30 years between the two Top Gun and Blade Runner films and more than 50 years in between the two Mary Poppins outings, not to mention the countless gaps between Star Wars and James Bond films... even Finding Dory came out 13 years after Finding Nemo. On the whole, I think it's safe to say that the sequels we wait for are worth waiting for (let's forget Godfather: Part III and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull for now...).<br/><br/>It may be 14 years since the original but Incredibles 2 is just as enjoyable as the first. Though it may lack the bold heart and strong messages of the first, the characters are out in full force, kicking ass and making audiences laugh in style. This is the sequel we wanted - able to stand proudly amongst other superhero films that have come out in the meantime. As was integral to the film itself, Incredibles 2 is proof that we need more of Pixar's Supers!<br/><br/>P.S. The Pixar short film before the film starts is just as adorable as ever (especially once you get to the end)."
"anselmdaniel","8","1","2","14 July 2018"," Exciting and riveting but not as fresh
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is the sequel to 2004's The Incredibles. The movie is directed by Brad Bird and stars the same main cast as the first movie. The movie picks up where The Incredibles left off with the Underminer robbing a bank, and the Parr family trying to stop him.<br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 is a great family movie that is fun and engaging for all audiences. Every frame and second of the movie is well animated and has great sound effects that the audiences has come to expect from Pixar. A warning for some audiences is that the movie should have a seizure warning as some scenes have rapid strobe lights.<br/><br/>The voice actors all do a great job. Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Frozone. Holly Hunter continues as Elastigirl. Craig T. Nelson is Mr. Incredible. Bob Odenkirk plays a superhero fan in Winston Deavor. There is not a weak link in the voice acting ensemble for this movie.<br/><br/>The plot however is the weak point and it felt obvious that something else was going on in Winston Deavor's company. Like the movie before it, this sequel re-uses that same twist that happened with Syndrome but with different reasons. Evelyn Deavor wants to be rid of superheroes so she creates the screenslaver to discredit superheroes forever. This felt strange as much of the conflict was created by Evelyn. When Winston wanted to improve superhero relations, he looked for big targets that would be hit. These targets were actually created by Evelyn. It seemed that her plan would have been fine if the screenslaver never existed. Superheroes are not needed to stop normal crime.<br/><br/>The other problem in the story is the Underminer not being referenced again. After the opening sequence, the Underminer disappears and is never apprehended. I had imagined that the Underminer would play a bigger role in the sequel and this is not the case.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend the Incredibles 2. The movie is a solid animated summer action movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","2","14 July 2018"," Incredibles 2 retains the incredible status of the original and acts as a heroic continuation.
","14 years! I've patiently waited for over a decade to witness the aftermath of ""The Underminer"". Was it worth the wait? You betcha superhero mask it was! I am absolutely relieved to say that this is a worthy successor, in every sense. Elastigirl is hired by a private investor in an attempt to make superheroes legal again, whilst Mr Incredible is tasked with staying at home and looking after the children. The parenting role reversal makes for a refreshing narrative change that naturally injects family humour into the political commentary of the story. The eternal struggles of school mathematics, angsty boyfriend trouble and a baby who has atleast seventeen different powers. The abrupt tonal shifts between the sharp action of crime fighting and the frequently hilarious shenanigans at home were seamless. Yet, the dialogue really shines when the whole family are brought together. A casual midnight takeaway allows the natural banter and personalities of each family member to shine through. Conceptualising the realisation that a family will always work well together as a unit. Bird's astute direction, accompanied with Pixar's wondrous updated computer generated animation, ensures that it acts as a full continuation as opposed to a separate film. Complete with memorable characters and quotes, particularly Jack Jack and Edna who stole the film singlehandedly. The orchestrated musical score is as harmonious as ever and complemented the frantic set pieces beautifully. The villain was underdeveloped, with their motives more opaque than transparent, which unfortunately also made for a rushed conclusion. The plot is somewhat formulaic, with one twist being incredibly predictable, which does insinuate how safe this sequel is with no vast amendments to the plot's structure. However, as a family film and a sequel to my second favourite animation of all time, it quenched my thirst and then some. Amusing, action packed and absolutely incredible. Don't make me wait another 14 years for a third chapter..."
"michaelRokeefe","7","1","2","13 July 2018"," Probably best animated feature of the season
","It has been fourteen years since the first film and the wait is well worth it. Pixar makes beautiful animated features. A campaign is started to bring Supers back into society in order to change people's attitudes toward superheroes. It is decided that Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), better known as Elastigirl is deemed the best to promote. Bob Parr, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is forced to be satisfied with being a househusband and taking care of the children...Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Dash (Huck Milner). A new character is introduced; the Parr baby Jack-Jack, whose special powers is just being brought to light. A new villain surfaces and it will take the whole incredible family to turn chaos into peace. I've made up my mind that Elastigirl should have her own movie.<br/><br/>This is a no-miss written and directed by Brad Bird, who also voices a character. Other voices giving life to the animation: Samuel L. Jackson, Catherine Keener, Phil LaMarr, Isabella Rossellinii, Barry Bostwick, John Ratzenberger and Michael Bird."
"El-Dod","9","1","2","13 July 2018"," The Incredibles are back after 14 years and they successfully could have a new unique style as we hoped!
","First, This is one of the most entertaining, funny , comedy and creative animation movie and sequel ever made. The animation is so unique and the very creative action scenes and the innovative super powers of Jack Jack and his very unique awesome comedy which was the hero of the movie and depended on it a lot with the cuteness and sweetness of that beautiful baby. Our heroes and their superpowers appeared on screen very entertaining and beautiful but for Mr. Inrcedible whom I think was mistreated and Marginalized. Also the very obvious plot wasn't a good idea but I don't now whether the movie meant it or not. Some people might find a problem with the developed animation of our heroes and looking a little diffrent but you really should get over it cause we are talking about a 14 year gab and enjoy that awesome experience at the cinema. The ending was good but wasn't convenient for the rest of the movie and it's awesomeness and even some problems appeared in the end. But in the end the movie stands as one of 2018's best movies and best animated movies ever made with lot's of details and fun. Not better than the first cause it's modern with the new styles today but had much of it's original feeling in it and was absolutely by today's ratings a very professional and well made movie with a beautiful story. Don't miss it."

","Mr. Incredible is actually incredible.. unless we're talking about leg day. I mean look at the mans body.

It looks like the dude is pushing 600 pounds on bench press but barely getting 135 off the squat rack. And listen if I was a real man I'd be discouraging this, but to be completely honest this is guy has dream physique of mine and I totally promote this movie!"

","This movie starts off from here it ended and it exeded expectations but not as good as the first one. it starts off to show the characters of the film it had great action scenes and great characters. it starts with bob taking care of the kids instead of the mom like a typical sequel but it does it good. elastic girl was great in this film. she showed off more in this film. dash had less major stuff in this is a disappointment but he was very funny. violet was very good as well. 
we all knew coming in to this that Jack Jack was going to steal the show with the powers that he has. he showed it off well in this film. their was more secondary characters in this film. more frozen in this film. he doesn't have as much classic lines but he gets more screen time in this film. Edna is back and she is great again. she does not have a huge role but is great. the main weakness is easily the villain of this film it is not the hardest to predict and kill when you think about it.
compared to syndrome it is a joke of a villain. the villain makes them struggle but it doesn't make scene how a villain like this could do that as they say a movie is only as good as its villain which they try to not do because other than the villain this movie is great. overall its a must see if you love the first incredibles and superhero movies or just love pixar movies its a great."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","2","9 July 2018"," Respectable return with somewhat predictable story
","When Pixar released The Incredibles (2004), the thought of super hero movies being as big as they are today was certainly not as popular. However, several aspects to the original film made it so that it stood out from the norm. Yet sometimes even greatness proves to be a challenge when it comes to a proper follow up. For director Brad Bird, that was exactly his dilemma. The first film was so well received that it was not easy for him and the rest of the film crew to determine what would make an adequate sequel. Thankfully, the time came where Bird and everyone else felt that what the story at hand was ready to be put into action. To some extent, everyone was right, but even so there's still one noticeable element to the story that feels less creative than it should have been. However, if anything else had changed this sequel would not have been as good as it is.<br/><br/>The plot picks up right after the events of the first movie where the Parr family (the incredibles) decide to take on the Underminer. Unfortunately they fail at foiling his plan and because super heroes were still illegal, they get forced into hiding again. That is until Lucius AKA Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) comes to them with a new proposition. The proposal is to reinvent the image of super heroes led by billionaire tycoon Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister Evelyn Deavor (Catherine Keener). Together they push Helen Parr AKA Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) to the forefront while Bob Parr AKA Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) becomes a stay at home dad watching over Dash (Huck Milner), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and Jack-Jack. As this goes on, a sinister individual known as the Screenslaver begins to make their move on the public, looking to permanently damage the image of supers.<br/><br/>For a movie directed and written solely by Brad Bird and who also voiced Edna Mode, it's impressive with how well the execution made out. Doing all of these is not easy but for the most part everything turned out rather well. Within the running time, the main characters experience much development. Helen Parr becoming the breadwinner of sorts for the family is typically unheard of in modern society, while Bob Parr acting as a stay at home dad is also not a very typical occupation for most fathers. Violet also goes through a series of emotions dealing with her confidence and being able to talk to her crush from school. There's even a history as to why the Deavor siblings are so passionate about helping out the Parr family and all other super heroes. Lastly Jack-Jack gets a chance to show off more of what was missed during the first film while he was being baby sat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the script does miss some things. One of them being that Dash and Frozone do not really get much of any time to do something out of the ordinary. Dash still runs fast but doesn't learn something new about his abilities or his relative behavior. Frozone, who suggests the Deavors to the incredibles is not as involved as one might think either, which is kind of misleading. The biggest problem though is the premise for the script. The similarities to how everything is set up feels very much like the first movie, with somebody making a very special and secret deal, when behind the scenes, there's more going on. Or at least, so it seems. On top of that, these offers would seem rather obvious being that these stories take place pretty much back to back from each other. Wouldn't one be skeptical after coming across such an incident so recently?<br/><br/>Aside from this though, the final bits to this feature film are well done. As to what Mahyar Abousaeedi and Erik Smitt contributed to this movie with cinematography, it's possible to say they did a good job. But there would need to be more information on the matter because this was an animated movie. For that, the animation was great. The details to various objects are much more profound now and the movements among characters and other things are much more fluid. As for music, the score composed again by Michael Giacchino was just as competent as the first score he created for the original movie. With jazz instruments livening up the mood and energy, the tunes played throughout most of the scenes will engage the viewer quite easily. And of course without the signature cue for the Parr family, the music would not be as incredible or memorable.<br/><br/>While the script suffers from a couple developmental flaws and fails to set up the plot any differently from that of the original, it still manages to entertain and perform well as a sequel. The main characters are fun to watch, the action is cool, the music remains bombastic and the animation is even more profound."

","The Good Stuff<br/><br/><ul><li>Fantastic animation (No surprise here).</li><li>Great and creative fight scenes. </li><li>Voice acting was good for the most part. Elasti-Girl sounded a bit weird compared to her original debut and Mr. Incredible sounds like an old man now.

It develops the characters and narrative further so it will be easier for when and if they release another sequel. </li><li>Incredibly predictable plot. I know it's a kids movie but not all kids are stupid. You can see it from a mile away. They try to trick you at first but it lasts no longer than 5 minutes. </li><li>The villain, ScreenSlaver, is kinda dumb when you think about it. Why go through an elaborate ruse to gather all heroes to make them illegal when they are already illegal?!? What was the villain trying to accomplish? Why not work behind the scenes and keep them illegal? If the villain wanted to kill all heroes she had the perfect tool and most likely would have been successful if that's all she wanted to do. Also her reason for becoming a villain is stupid as hell. Her parents got killed by bad guys and the heroes didn't show up. That happens because heroes were illegal at the time so there was no way for them to know about it, let alone save them. So, her parents were killed because super heroes were illegal, but she still wants them to be illegal. WTF. Remember kids, this is a Disney movie so we can't have any logic, you understand?</li></ul><br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and I think most kids will as well. Not as good as the first but manages to get enough right for it to not be 'meh'. The only significant issue I had with the movie was with the villain as a whole because she was so much worse when you compare her to the previous villain, Syndrome. Other then that, I think Pixar put itself in a good position to make a better sequel if they decide to go that way. If so, I hope this is simple growing pains to get to the next big thing."
"avbbyav","8","1","2","7 July 2018"," Not bad but...
","1st I don't understand all the hate this movie has, it wasn't great nor was it bad. Jack-jack made the movie for sure & that's few & very far in between scenes. My biggest complaint would be the ending felt very rushed & the ending came off as anti-climatic because of that. Either way I was still glad to see a new one after so many years but wish it could have been better."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","6 July 2018"," A family movie in every sense of the word.
","Once again, Disney has proven that they are the best at making family movies. Not just movies that the whole family can see, but movies that people from 4 years old to 80 years old and every age in between can enjoy. There was only one specific thing that I didn't like about the movie, so I'll start with that. I was a bit upset that there was no resolution to the argument that the presence of superheroes makes ordinary people more passive. I thought that was a really interesting theme that deserved to be explored more. If any of you reading this have bought this movie or are going to see it again, please copy down the Screenslaver's voice-over speech when Elastigirl is looking for him and put it on the quotes page. I only started listening to it about halfway through, and I think it's something that most of the audience probably missed because so much else was going on in that scene.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I thought it was a great movie. There were things that could have been done better with it of course, but for a kids movie it was top-notch. When I saw the trailers, I was afraid that we would get some pretty stock scenes of Bob trying to keep things together as a single dad. While these scenes aren't that different from what we've seen before, I think they were better because their weight in the plot was diminished. Bob overcomes his Dad issues, or at least finishes dealing with them, well before the climax which made them feel more true. His challenge isn't this great internal struggle, it's just that he's out of his element and he finds that parenting is a frustrating job, and it doesn't need to be presented as anything more than that. 
What I like best about these movies is that the Parr's feel like an actual family. It may not be the most accurate portrayal of a real family dynamic, but it feels real enough that I buy into them as a real family. Disney movies often over-simplify their parent/child relationships, but thankfully that is not the case here. I love the moment in the motel when the whole family is like, ""yeah, it *was* awesome to fight crime together today... but we can't."" And their two big collaborative superhero scenes are feel real to their family dynamic, in a fairly subtle way.<br/><br/>The movie was also a lot more entertaining than I expected it to be. The scene where Jack-Jack fights the racoon might be the best scene of any movie I've seen this year. The action scenes, once again, were surprisingly exciting for a kids' movie. In fact, I can say with certainty that they were better than the action scenes of many live-action super movies, and they probably have a higher body count than many of them as well.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie as a young kid, but I think that most people who were/are fans will not be disappointed. Maybe there shouldn't be a third movie, even though it is likely given how much money this sequel has made. Though it exceeded my expectations, I would recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it yet lower their own. This is by no means a bad movie, and I wouldn't expect it to disappoint even the most hopeful fans, but it might not be quite as good as you dreamed it would be. Keep showing the world how animated movies are done, Disney!"
"thtgirlchloe","9","1","2","4 July 2018"," Better than I expected
","I remember seeing the first Incredibles movie many years ago when I was little and loved it. I don't really like sequels of movies that much so I didn't know what to expect from the second one. But it was amazing and not boring, I see some people saying that it was boring but that's their opinion. However, the lady who played Elastic Girl sounded so old. I cringed so hard every time she opened her mouth. She talked like she had something stuck in her throat it was very cringy. Other than that, the movie was great and the storyline picked up where it left off from the first movie. I hope that there is an Incredibles 3 and if so, then I hope they don't wait another 14 years to make it."

","After 14 long years, Incredibles 2 has finally arrived! I was excited and nervous headed into this film because I had this feeling in the back of my head that the hype would be better than the film itself. I'm happy to report that Incredibles 2 is a worthy follow-up to it's predecessor. The characters are just as entertaining and engaging to watch as they were in the original. I rather enjoy the new character dynamics given to us thanks to the role reversal of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl as Mr. Incredible stays home to take care of the kids while Elastigirl takes the forefront of most of the action sequences. Speaking of the action sequences, they are fantastic to watch. From the train chase to the helicopter rescue, I believe that the action is an improvement over the original overall. The animation as always looks outstanding, it's crazy to believe that the animators were able to create such a great looking film with so much detail. From the clothes, to the hair, to the action, I give the animators so much credit for doing such a great job. However, the film isn't perfect. While the story is well executed as a whole, it takes many familiar beats from the original. Also, the villain, the Screenslaver feels like a downgrade from Syndrome. While Screenslaver isn't a terrible villain as I do like the motivation of the Screenslaver, the execution could've been done better. Also, the true identity of the Screenslaver can be seen coming from a mile away if you pay attention. Overall, Incredibles 2 is still a great film with outstanding animation, exciting action sequences, and the same memorable characters we know and love. I highly recommend you see Incredibles 2 in theaters as soon as you can."
"carlos37andre","9","1","2","2 July 2018"," Man... I just love Pixar!
","I've been wating for this sequence for almost 15 years! And, it's amazing how it whorted. <br/><br/>It's incredible (sorry about that) how the whole process of making a film works at Pixar, they just let the creators do their thing in the best way possible, and the result is undeniable, the movies are in 90% of the times, great. And Incredibles 2 is great.<br/><br/>Probably the only ""issue"" that I may have with the movie is the villan, isn't a strong villan by far, it's some of those cases where in the moment a character enters the scene you know ""ok, future bad guy here"". But, that's it, I don't thing this is something that takes the light out of the movie. The story is clever, the script talks about some current subjects (as always) that anyone can relate to it. It's extremely funny too, great jokes. A real smart popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Summing up, Incredibles 2 is a great piece of work, Pixar nails it once again, and probably books the Best Animation Oscar again."
"nightlq","7","1","2","2 July 2018"," Really good
","So first my criticisms, it was too similar to the first and the villain made hardly any scene. I normally would only give an 8 to a movie with 2 flaws when they aren't very big flaws, but this movie did enough right for me to still give it an 8. I don't think that it will have that same impact of the first (which is a 9 or more likely a 10). 
The animation is great and very detailed, as well as the movie being just entertaining and when it's with Elastigirl I really like the story (though brought back by a bad villain) and when it was with the family it was interesting to see (though similar to the first). I may be a bit more forgiving because it's been a while since I saw the first, but I can say that you can probably really enjoy it if you've never seen the first one."

Elista-girl is the non-destructive one and all 3 kids come to grips with being super heroes.

"SnowLeopardMaster","9","1","2","1 July 2018"," I underestimated Pixar once again...
","Whenever I feel uncertain about the quality of a Pixar movie and believe it to be mediocre, it turns out really good. Cars 3, The Good Dinosaur, and Finding Dory proved that. (Of course, Brave and Cars 2 proved that it turns out mediocre when I think it'll be good).<br/><br/>And Incredibles 2 happened to be a movie I regarded as mediocre at first. I didn't watch any of the trailers, and didn't keep up with any of the news. And, having just gone to see the movie, I was blown away by how much I underestimated the geniuses behind this movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it wasn't perfect. There were a few glaring issues, like the new superheros that were introduced. They were all cool, and enjoyable to see on screen, but they seemed somewhat unnecessary to the plot of the movie, and, while they led to a fun fight scene at the end, the movie could have moved right along without their presence. Not to mention that they actually create a plot hole regarding how DevTech found these characters so easily.<br/><br/>The other major problem would be the lack of Robert Parr's character development. The sequence in which he takes care of the children was confusing to watch, and made very little sense. And it was too easily resolved, like, ""Oh, Violet, I'm sorry for giving your Boyfriend amnesia and ruining your life"" And then ""Oh, dad, I forgive you for ruining my life, and I don't even have a proper reason to do so!""<br/><br/>But enough about bad stuff. For one thing, the CGI has greatly improved since the original movie. While the original possessed beautiful animation, this was truly breathtaking. The original music is all there, and it's joined by a couple new scores that add to the movie spectacularly.<br/><br/>And, aside from those couple details, the plot was pretty awesome. It starts to fall apart as soon as one inspects it too thoroughly, but if you ignore all the crazy cynical people who exist to locate plot holes, it's spectacularly done. The suspense is amazingly well constructed, and it keeps you guessing. The villain was impressive, though not as good as Syndrome. The action scenes were exciting, and the movie also has spectacular comedic timing.<br/><br/>While not the best movie ever made, it's certainly a good one, and well worth seeing. I recommend it to anyone who's watched the original."

"maxfontaine","7","1","2","1 July 2018"," A Damn Good Yet Imperfect Sequel
","I'd happily call the first Incredibles a perfect movie. As far as being a spoof on traditional action/superhero flicks, it also managed to balance being a standalone animated feature that anyone could sit back and be enthralled by. The sequel thankfully manages to recapture that magic, albeit with a smidgen less success. The characters are exactly how you remember them, with Elastigirl taking centre stage being a welcome exception from the first film. Mr. Incredible hardly gets left behind however, with his parental struggles with Jack-Jack being a particular comedic highlight. The plot and pacing keep things interesting and the animation is as gorgeous as ever, and some twists surrounding the antagonist keep this franchise from falling into villain-of-the-week tropes. Unfortunately, these said twists don't always land, and the extremely contemporary inclusion of other Supers is intrusive and surprisingly annoying. The film also seems to lack the same tension and punch as the first, and while it thankfully resists the urge to tread familiar ground and spiral into full fan-service mode, I can't help but feel it's inferior to the first in terms of originality. Still, Michael Giaccino's incredible (pun most certainly intended) score and the fun antics of the Parr family will almost certainly reignite the excitement lit by the first film in 2004."

"gercs","7","1","2","1 July 2018"," Here I am hoping for more witty action-packed scenes especially for Jack-Jack
","About the general impression, from my perspective, it didn't work quite well with me. It is hard not to make the first film as a point of comparison; I find the first one really memorable with its more evident child-like approach to the story. Sure, I find the second one more sophisticated crime-busting-plot-wise, but this is more talky for an ""Incredibles"" film, wherein I find the action-packed facet quite unsatisfying. I would love to see more witty action scenes for Jack-Jack, that are comparable to those of Dash in the first installment. For me as a person who considered ""The Incredibles"" as one of his favorite Pixar film, apart from a sophisticated plot, at least one really satisfying action scene makes an ""Incredibles"" movie complete. Sad to say, I wasn't able to get enough of that same energy that I found in the first installment, and at some moments, I was even bored with the more talky parts of the film.<br/><br/>At the bottom line, I find this film solid and good enough for family entertainment, but then, here I am hoping for more witty adrenaline-packed scenes especially for Jack-Jack. There are some character-development issues especially for the villain, which at the end made her impact to the story rather so-so than awesome for an ordinary person. However, indeed, there's always a silver lining, and I'm hoping that the next one wouldn't disappoint."
"kevinxirau","8","1","2","30 June 2018"," A glorious continuation of a classic.
","You know what's incredible? That it took 14 years to get this long-desired sequel. About dang time! Anyway, ""Incredibles 2"" is finally here and I got to see it in the cinema. Normally, when Hollywood takes years to get a sequel out it tends to suck, but thankfully that is not the case here. Director Brad Bird was very mindful of what worked in the first film and continued the story in the appropriate manner. <br/><br/>Plot: Picking up right where things were left off, the superhero family still faces difficulty wanting to save the world when supers are still banned worldwide. It is here that they are approached by Winston Deavor, TV tycoon and longtime fan, who wants to improve the public image of supers by broadcasting their endeavors in the hopes of making them legal, to which Bob and Helen agree to play along. Things seem to be looking up for them until the mysterious Screenslaver decides to complicate matters.<br/><br/>Bird makes the interesting choice of reversing the roles of the parents, this time having Helen/Elastigirl playing hero and Bob/Mr. Incredible caring for the kids. This led to some great development since they are now somewhat out of their established roles in the first film and facing the inherent challenges that come with them; Bob struggling to raise his kids is both endearing and relatable to anyone who has children. The kids themselves have more to do this time around as well, especially baby Jack Jack with all the crazy powers he's gaining. Most of the actors return to their roles with one exception and they all fit like a glove; Sam Jackson and Bird as Frozone and Edna are still fun to watch. New heroes are introduced as well and each brings their own flair to the table, though only one, a portal-opener named Void, is fleshed out. The villain, while not as entertaining as Syndrome, definitely stands out and offers both substantial threat and interesting commentary, though the character's motivation does overlook a vital detail within the world's lore. The action and animation are top notch as ever as they take full advantage of the characters respective abilities, especially the train scene involving Helen on a motorcycle, and the music is still catchy as hell.<br/><br/>Part of me was afraid that this film wouldn't live up to the hype and my expectations, but that was all laid to rest after watching this. ""Incredibles 2"" is a worthy sequel through and through. If you love the first film, then do see for yourself."

I remember seeing the movie with my mom and immediately fell in love with the movie. <br/><br/>14 years later, I'm 23, married and seeing a movie for all ages. I honestly loved it. It was a good sequel and I hope they come out with a third one because it's such an amazing franchise. I always relayed to Violet because I see so much of myself in her. Shy and quiet but quite the talker and very fun. <br/><br/>I sat there in the theater laughing my butt off to all the jokes.

Starting the movie out where the last ended was a good choice by the crew, it refreshed the audience with the rhythm of the plot, with lots of action, and lots of humor. I think the emphasis on the ""women can do it too"" was a good way to spread the message to kids. This also created an opportunity to add humor to the whole ""dad taking the traditional mother's job"" but. Humor was sprinkled within every scene, and the voice acting was superb.

"sohansurag","7","1","2","29 June 2018"," The Name Still Say it All
","14 Years. Highly Anticipated Sequel...yada yada.... You know the drill.
For me, Incredibles was by far the best movie Pixar ever made. I am sorry Toy Story & Ratatouille, Incredibles definitely takes the throne here. Every movie Pixar made after Incredibles I kept asking ""Wait....where's Incredibles 2? Who asked for Cars 2? Didn't we get enough closure with Toy Story 2? And lastly who in the right mind wanted Cars 3?"" Almost a decade and a half later we finally get a sequel and does it live up to a decade worth anticipation?<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 starts off right where the first left off. Following a short encounter with the Underminer, Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and his family get scrutinized again for all the destruction and chaos. Jobless, forced to relocate to a motel and having not a clue how to keep the family together, Bob & Helen (Elastigirl) along with Lucius (Frozone) gets a proposal from Winston Deaver and his sister Evelyn from Devtech, a corporate giant who wants to bring back the Supers via documenting their adventures through a video camera fixed within their suits.<br/><br/>The tables have turned this time and the lucky number goes to Elastigirl to take up 'super assignments'. Elastigirl takes the limelight here while Mr. Incredible takes a backseat: a dad looking after the family and having a tough time in her absence (and not admitting the same). Things obviously go awry for both Helen and Bob. While Helen is threatened by Screenslaver, a masked antagonist who hypnotizes people using screens and making them do awful things, Bob almost has a breakdown trying to juggle a pissed-off, adolescent Violet, a hyperactive Dash whose homework keeps his dad up all night and add to it a delightfully scene-stealing baby Jack-Jack.<br/><br/>At its core, Incredibles had always been about family, how they keep things together while secretly wishing to go back to their exciting, super, espionage lives and that's what that made the original so unique. The same has been carried down to Incredibles 2. The little nuances you're faced with when you're running a family is just beautifully depicted and as a husband and a father, I could relate to a lot of things. Baby Jack-Jack, whom we had seen glimpses of in the first one is terrific in this one. I would say the scenes with him are the best. Like how Mr. Incredible stumbles upon his powers. A bundle of joy indeed.<br/><br/>The weakest link in the plot is the villain Screenslaver and unfortunately, you can see the twist from a mile away. I wouldnt say it spoils the movie but Incredibles set a standard so high for villains that this antagonist looks ill-conceived. What I also found lacking were the 'goosebumps moments' that were sprinkled lavishly in the first Incredibles. Maybe its because the novelty has faltered in the second outing but yet again, it wouldn't have hurt to include a scene or two reminiscent of the 'Dash running on water' sequence from the first which was an absolute blast to watch.<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are flawlessly embodied once again by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter makes them feel like real life people than animated characters. The same goes for the supporting characters, Samuel L Jackson as Frozone, Bob Odenkirk as Winston, Sarah Vowell and Huck Millner as Violet and Dash respectively. Edna Mode voiced by Brad Bird himself is still a rockstar! Michael Giacchino's score still packs the same punch and is absolutely spellbinding. Who would have thought blending a kind of 60's campy music with James Bond-esque themes would create such wonders.<br/><br/>In the end, Incredibles 2 despite all its mesmerizing visual glory, the brilliant family dynamics, and the action setpieces, live a little short of its expectation. Don't take me wrong its still a good sequel and I understand 14 years worth of anticipation should be hard to live up to but seems like Brad Bird was playing it safe. If Incredibles was You Only Live Twice, Incredibles 2 plays more like Tomorrow Never Dies (an exaggeration). Five years from now, Incredibles will be the movie I'd love to watch with my kid; Incredibles 2 though, I will still have to watch for its a great extension to the original."

"ryanbartlett-870-746486","7","1","2","29 June 2018"," Another Pixar smash hit!
","I don't know if it is due to all of the years and time put into making an animated film, but Pixar is continually the most consistent film company. Coming off of their last hit in Coco, they headed back into the sequel conundrum, but a sequel that involves really their only action films of their company. Incredibles allows them to try out unique storytelling and a new take on a pixar movie, you know without killing a parent.
Incredibles 2 thrives off of new age mothers and the humor provided by a one year old. In the new day and age of woman empowerment and stay at home dads, this is the movie of the time. They highlighted the highs, the lows, and the quirks in between of parenting. That even for a child who doesn't have children, I could still relate to.
Now further into the plot, and it was really good, but I don't think that it really broke into the great of other pixar movies. They followed the usual plotline of the evil villain being the person you were working with all along. A little redundant, but they hid the similar plot beneath new super heros, personable characters, and lots of humor."
"view_and_review","7","1","2","29 June 2018"," Interesting but nothing memorable
","Disney-Pixar is very adept at making blockbuster movies and Incredibles 2 is no exception. That's not to say that the movies are all classics and I'd like reiterate that Incredibles 2 is no exception.<br/><br/>This was an entertaining movie but nothing memorable. The story was interesting but nothing cutting edge. The humor was mild, nothing knee slapping. The only real distinguishing characteristic was the addition of several new ""supers"". Adding the new ""supers"" added some flavor and diversity with the action.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 was a nice follow up considering that many sequels are completely worthless."
"austin0731","8","1","2","28 June 2018"," A sequel that was actually wanted
","Incredibles 2 is the sequel to the hit Pixar animation, The Incredibles. Long in the wood works, this film had a lot of hype to live up to and in many cases it meets these expectations. Incredibles 2 picks up right after the end of the film and explores new dynamics in the Superhero trope as well as familial and gender roles. Much like its predecessor, this movie challenges the stereotypes of the Superhero genre and in addition tackles new topics such as the aforementioned 'gender roles'.<br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 has clearly been incubated with much love and is a case where I would think a sequel is absolutely needed, unlike many of today's sequels that are set to make a quick buck The Incredibles 2 had a story to tell and a purpose. Personally, this holds up as one of the best Pixar sequels on par with Toy Story's brilliant additions. See, unlike films such as Monsters University or even the highly successful Finding Dory, while there was anticipation, it could be seen the the writers didn't necessarily have any material for the continuation of the stories of our beloved characters. In which case, I would think that having sequels is unnecessary. <br/><br/>Incredibles 2 handles its characters impeccable, with fun character moments that highlight the growth and development of each of the characters. All this was enhanced by the use of new technology to craft very fine and intricate images. This was a sequel that had something to add to the foundation created in the first film, a wonderful, heartwarming sequel and a brilliant family film."
"AnishMisra","9","1","2","27 June 2018"," Incredible 2 Review
","Incredibles 2 is a film written and directed by Brad Bird. After 14 long years of waiting, every 'Incredibles' fan was happy that this film came out and I can definitely say the same about me. The trailers just impressed me and after coming out of the hall I would like to say that this film was a blast.<br/><br/>Plot: After Elastigirl, is chosen to redeem the status of superheroes in the eyes of public, its upto Bob Parr to take care of the home and his children. Also there is a new villain in town by the name of Screenslaver.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Knowing that Brad Bird would be back with the sequel, I was more excited than ever. I do consider Bird as one of the top animation directors of our time. And with this film, he basically solidifies this fact. He decides to keep the timeline same as of the first part. This shows how well he understands his audience. The writing of this film is just superb. Yes, the jokes are spot on and just got me laughing, but the way he deals with real life issues are just perfect. I felt that certain decisions would be the same if taken by me. The characters, both old and new, are great and get equal screen space to shine. Bird doesn't take the conventional route; he takes risks which is commendable. The animation is spot on. And that's not just because it's Pixar; it's because the detailing is so perfect. The action scenes and VFX are just as excellent as with me seeing it in 3-D, it was an added advantage. The music is also 'incredible'. Given the fact that the film is longer than any animated film (even longer than part one), I never felt bored or the film never felt stretched. But I do have one complain regarding the film. I would say that one aspect of the film felt very guessable, which was the only little glitch this almost-perfect film has. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene of Jack-Jack displaying his different powers in fighting a small raccoon like animal. The scene was just awesome because of the cool VFX and the humour in that scene. This is the scene where I felt that Jack-Jack's character shined the most. <br/><br/>Verdict: If I had to compare this film with the 2004 predecessor, I would choose the 2004 film without a doubt. But given the fact that we have had a lot of superhero films from that time to this, I would commend Brad Bird and team for presenting our favourite characters in a film and even making them more likable. The film doesn't feel saturated; it feels fresh, which is rare. The 14 year wait finally paid off. If there will be a third part to this film, I would say I am already in for it. I sure would like this film seen to the nominated in various awards for 'Best Animated Film'. If you loved part one, definitely watch the film as this film celebrates the characters in the best possible way, even after 14 years. If not watched the previous part, do watch that and then watch this film as it's mostly related.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

","I like films made for their entertainment value without trying to hide it, there's nothing to be ashamed about entertaining people. I love them even more if there's some added values put in. Wit and charm never hurt the outcome. The plot is slightly weaker at certain points, sometimes it's definitly rushed. As far as I remember the original the plot was stronger , but I could be wrong, it's been a long time since I last saw it.<br/><br/>So here it is, this is really a superb fun film. Really super characters, in believable situations with a stellar cast who performs flawlessly. Not as surprising as they wanted to be, and as I already said the plot itself is not always there, but everything else is really of the highest quality and we all get entertained. We even get the points about family life and the inherent stregth of this unit. There's a slight suspicion aimed at science going with this frenchise, which I find somewhat annoying, but even this didn't spoil the fact that it was FUN. So they must've done something right."

","PLOT: The film begins with the Incredible family and Frozone trying to capture the Underminer. Underminer escapes and the Superheroes' attempts at trying to save the City from the Underminer ends up in them wrecking the place. As a result of which they are arrested by the police and the Project for the Superheroes that was initiated in the first film is scrapped and Supers continue to be declared illegal.<br/><br/>The Incredibles get called by Winston Deavor who runs Devtech with his tech genius sister, Evelyn. They have come up with a plan to legalise the Supers and they recruit Mamma Incredible to help them bring their plan to fruition. (Much to Pappa Incredible's annoyance).
The movie runs parallel, covering the lives of Mamma Incredible who is on a mission to portray to the world, the real and heroic efforts put in by Superheroes in saving the lives of people. She is constantly challenged by Screenslaver, a mysterious villain who controls the minds of people by hypnotising them. While Mamma is basking in the glory of her reclaimed fame, Pappa Incredible is going ballistic at home trying to control a moody teenager, a high-powered pre-teen and a cookie loving baby that is just discovering its superpowers.<br/><br/>Who is the mysterious Screenslaver? Will Mamma Incredible bring him to justice? Will the Supers be legalised?<br/><br/>Sequels very rarely match up to their predecessors and this one didn't either, the reason being that the sequel loses out on the grounds of absence of novelty and inadvertent comparison running through the minds of the viewers. <br/><br/>I ought to make it clear that I did enjoy this movie and would definitely recommend watching it but please do not go with high expectations.<br/><br/>The first one was funnier and with more action and adventure. Baby Incredible did manage to evoke some laughter out of the audience and one was looking forward to seeing his super powers being used against the villains. I was disappointed that it was grossly under-used during the climax.<br/><br/>While Pappa is left to tend to the children, Mamma is out there ""kicking ass"". She gets to wear the superhero costume, ride an electric bike, stop a speeding train and fight the super villain and party at night. While he's at home trying to figure out complex math problems and get a baby to stay asleep. While this may make one remark that the ""hero"" of the film is clearly Mamma Incredible, I beg to differ. Pappa Incredible is also the hero in his own rights and you'd agree if you've been in his shoes!<br/><br/>This was the kind of movie where you step out of the theatre with nothing to discuss about. (No bricks or bouquets to toss)."
"robinsonaustin-07490","8","1","2","24 June 2018"," It was super.
","14 years ago was when the Pixar film The Incredibles was released. A story about a family of superheroes living in a world where superheroes were banned and made to relocate is what the first film delved into as well as the repercussions of such a banning. I will admit that the first film wasn't my favorite of the Pixar films, namely because I had actually watched the film twice in my lifetime: back in 2004 and 2008. That's not to say that it was a terrible film, but I didn't really get all of the love that most critics would give it. Out of all the Pixar films, I knew that the one that was a shoe-in for getting a sequel was the Incredibles. But what I did not expect was that it would take about 14 or so years for a sequel to be made. <br/><br/>As for the sequel, I honestly loved it, possibly more than the first film. The action scenes were fantastic, as well as the animation. The animation was definitely a major improvement between both films. However, a word of caution to note is that in some scenes there are flashy moments that could flair up epileptic fits in anyone who has a history of epileptic seizures. I was initially a little wary of Mrs. Incredible/Elastigirl being in the leading role because I felt that it would've been a retread of the first film. That and since liberal Hollywood would often try to shoehorn in feminism in the name of ""progressiveness,"" I was a little worried. To me, the first film already established Elastigirl as a strong character, and it wasn't because she was a woman. In the sequel, it does make some sense as to why Winston Deavor would select her as being the first step in getting supers legalized again because she actually ended up being documented as causing less collateral damage that other supers like Mr. Incredible and Frozone would inadvertently do, but I was somewhat hesitant to see the movie because I thought it was another ploy to try to appeal to SJWs. However, I would happily state that it wasn't as persistent an issue that many other critics had made it out to be. <br/><br/>The side plot of Mr. Incredible trying to care for the kids was personally my favorite parts of the movie because in the first film, you hardly got any moments of that with the first film. Violet also received some considerable development from the first film, and Jack-Jack's powers are explored further in this film. Jack-Jack was probably my favorite character in the film because of how his powers made him do several humorous feats, my favorite being when he was fighting off a raccoon trying to eat their garbage. The one plot I did feel was kind of pointless was Violet's, but mostly because it amounted to ""boy trouble."" <br/><br/>The new characters are fine for the most part. Winston comes off as likable because of his adorkable tendencies to reminisce about the days when supers were still legal, and there was his sister Evelyn Deavor, who mostly did the technological side of the company. The new supers brought in were fascinating in appearance, but they don't receive as much development. The only interesting super that was introduced was Voyd who had the power to create portals, but for the most part, she was the one who I felt stood out the most from the new recruits. Lastly, there's the Screenslaver, a villain who has the power to brainwash people into doing his bidding and could hack into any network with ease. I will admit that for an Incredibles villain, the Screenslaver was not as good as Syndrome, but I don't really find that an issue. My only problem with the Screenslaver was that his true identity was just so obvious. Disney and Pixar had been having a recent trend where they have a character who seems to be nice at first only to then be revealed as the bad guy. It's not too different there, though I do think they deliberately added a red herring to at the very least make you suspect someone else before the twist. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a great film that I would recommend seeing, especially if you're one of those people who waited for 14 years for a follow up."
"runtve","9","1","2","23 June 2018"," 14 years.... Totally worth it!!!
","So in my book, this film goes down as a near perfect follow-up to the first iteration.
I really did feel attached to these characters once again, which I think is a great achievement. 
This took 14 years to come, but didn't let me down nearly as much as the half-okay continuation of Shrek <br/><br/>(actually no letting down involved here, apart from having to wait to see the 'after credits short' they always put in but now didn't) <br/><br/>Overall I REALLY enjoyed this. Hats off to all of you at Pixar etc. <br/><br/>P.S. I really like the dedication to bring back the old voice actors even after 14 years of waiting! makes a really significant difference."
"pmtaran","8","1","2","23 June 2018"," This movie was great but epileptics beware-take caution
","First off, I have epilepsy and I loved the first incredibles and did not want to skip this sequel. True to the disclaimer warning before the movie started, there were like 4 or 5 scenes where you feel like you're staring at a huge strobe light. So, since I had heard the rumors of this, I decided to take the risk but also brought a pair of sunglasses with 100% UV protection. I wore them when those tough scenes occurred, which allowed me to still view the movie and barely felt the effect from the flashing lights. So I hope anyone else with a seizure disorder has the same experience as me if they decide to see it, because it was definitely a fun and entertaining movie that I'd say is as good as the first and I'd probably watch again when it's streaming."

","After a decade of the release of the original The Incredibles, Incredibles 2 is the long-deserving sequel that truly delivers and exceeds expectations that will satisfy everyone in an incredible and fantastic way. Just like the original, the story is once again great and fascinating, with the theme and dynamics of family amplified further in making a story as wonderful and powerful as ever and in addition, the humor and the dialogue is superb. In the days when the superhero film genre dominate the entire film medium, Incredibles 2 is worthy companion piece. In regards to the visuals and animation, Pixar has once again impressed everyone with their state of the art technology in creating such stunning visuals and animation that never ages in time.<br/><br/>However, there are some flaws that can be noticed: The villain is totally cliched along its motivations which is a disappointment considering the fact that the original features a unique and memorable villain that is one of the main highlight of the original and within this sequel, this villain is forgettable and bland. Another flaw of the movie was the pacing which comes off the rails and sometimes affect the quality of this film. Lastly is the overuse and oversaturation of flashy lights within the animation which causes major headaches and severe seizure especially to those that have epilepsy and the ones who have photosensitivity issues.<br/><br/>Despite of this flaws, Incredibles 2 is simply fun and adventurous and is definitely worth the time for everyone to enjoy and just considered one of the best movies of 2018 so far."
"garabedian123","8","1","2","21 June 2018"," Great movie, but it could have been better!
","First of all. I saw this in the theater, where before the film starts all the actors tell us how amazing the film is going to be because its been worked on for 14 years...PLease....don't insult my intelligence...<br/><br/>Anyways, The movie is great but i wondered about certain choices that held the movie back. ElastiGirl tells her husband she used to have a bike, and much more he does not know about. But her past is never brought up again to reveal something important. I actually thought she recognized Screen Slaver as a villain from her past. But that ended up not being the case at all.<br/><br/>The villain is really weak. And in a copy and paste from the first movie. A event is staged by the villain for the hero to look good. Its set up so that cameras are installed on her costume. but other than a few seconds in a news clip, this setup goes no where, I feel some interesting things could have been done with the situation but nothing happens.<br/><br/> I know the movie takes place immediately after the 1st and yet at some sections the family acts as though the 1st movie never happened. <br/><br/>And another thing. Usually the opening scene is of some importance that is to be explained later in the movie. Yeah, i thought memory wiping was going to play a big role in the movie. But no...that entire opening scene was for nothing except to add some teen drama into a movie and it ended up being completely pointless and only added duration to the movie. <br/><br/>And again from the opening we never see the Underminer again...he just shows up and leaves and adds no impact to the movie whatsoever...also just adding screen time.<br/><br/>And last but not least lets talk about the quality of animation. It seems like they changed nothing from the first film except they added bags under everyone eyes...which was really annoying and hard to look at...Especially Violet. She is like 12 and yet she looked older than most of the adults in the film. At first i thought some thing was going on in the background and we would be told why she is not sleeping...But no..there was nothing...so they just added the bags because they liked them? they looked terrible,,,!!!"

","Incredibles hit the world. Disney and Pixar kind of won its rivalry with Dreamworks. But not this time. Incredibles 2 is fun but not as entertaining as the prequel.
Been so while for this sequel. And by still connecting the story I believe they dont have to. Craig T. Nelson is not at same age for the voice of Mr. Incredible today, we can hear on few dialogues he sounds trembling. They also make aging dimples for Mr. Incredible, I dont know why. 
I love few scenes which I laughed out loud. But in the prequel I laughed for almost entire movie.
The story is predictable but it's okay."

","I enjoyed the movie. It was nice that 3 of the actors talked to us before the movie began to explain the 14 year gap between the original and it's sequel, which at times I thought was 14 years later for the characters as well, however the kids had not aged, so I guess not? Jack Jack turned out to be a very fun addition to the family with a ridiculous number of super abilities by the end. I guess more than 17? I had trouble watching the crazy fast-paced chasing of the Underminer scene toward the beginning. Too much, too early for me. The humor and animation were the best parts of this movie and Edna was in top form. Loved how she interacted with Jack Jack. It was good all the new supers turned evil for awhile so we could see their abilities were more useful than parlor tricks. Reflux man was particularly gross however!"

"chriscotterill1994","8","1","2","20 June 2018"," Fun for every viewer!
","So I got to see the incredibles 2 early as I'm in Dubai. What a little added bonus it was to the holiday. The story is solid, funny and full of action packed scenes. We get to see some familiar faces which do not disappoint! 
The film is very well done because it starts where the first one finishes with the underminor, although this scene is amazing, it also seems like the underminor was pushed to one side once certain things happened in the film and wasn't spoken about again. 
Edna Mode is hilarious in the film, as well as funny moments from Jack jack. I would say jack jack steals the show with all of his abilities as the scenes with him in are brilliant. 
The only downside to this film I would say is the villain itself. Rather weak and simple and for me after watching the film for around 20 minutes, I could guess what the plot was going to be. Nether the less it didn't take it away from the film, we had some new cool characters which I think are going to make great appearances in the third film.
Overall the film itself is a solid, Disney Pixar action packed film with lots of good and barely any bad! If you love any Pixar movie, you'll love this!"

","A far better Fantastic For Movie than all Fantastic Four Movies in existence, in fact, The Incredibles is a better Fantastic Four (or Fantastic Five? or even six with Frozone?) then Fantastic Four Themselves.

The plot and the plot twist are simple and predictable which is good!! For a movie too complicated and too dark almost never gets anyone's attention seriously in the long run (cough*DCEU*cough).<br/><br/>so, in general, it's another good (but not great, and that's good enough!!) comicbookish movie, even though it's not coming from comicbook, I would even go as far as proclaiming that this is the best comicbook movie I've watched so far in this year (let's see how Ant-Man 2 and Aquaman would fare against this) and if they decide to continue the adventure of the great Parr family into the third Incredibles movie I will certainly watch it on the theater in which I hope Disney would make it happen, because it's a better choice than Frozen 2 (Because I personally need more of a cool and a badass Frozone than a whining I-don't-know-what-to-do-to-make-things-right Elsa)"

"gcsman","8","1","2","19 June 2018"," ""... and don't fire the baby inside the house!""
","... is the funniest line in this totally entertaining sequel. That's particularly appropriate because you can make a good case that the main character (if there is one) whose story arc runs through the whole film is baby Jack-Jack, who's cheerfully and accidentally discovering his wide array of 'powers' that the rest of the Parrs have to learn to manage. The best sequence in the whole movie, I thought, was an extended dust-up between Jack-Jack and an amazingly plucky and persistent raccoon. (!) In the midst of a film built on charming homage and spoofing of superhero movies, that scene stands out as totally original. The little guy is incredibly cute (it's the eyes), and wait till you see what happens now when he sneezes.<br/><br/>The rest of what I'll say is a bunch of my favorite bits, so if you haven't seen the movie yet, you might not want to read further -- come on back later.<br/><br/>I give this an 8/10 because it's not deep, but it's well crafted fun from beginning to end, absolutely worth a night at the cinema. Incredibles 2 as a sequel doesn't have the advantage of being an origin story (which I generally like, unlike some viewers), but there are lots of inventive touches with the obligatory fight and chase scenes, and somewhat surprisingly the first third of the movie -- where all the setup happens -- is actually quite measured, deliberate, and (gasp!) almost adult in feel. Once you suspend disbelief to put yourself in a world where Supers exist, a lot of good questions come up. What about collateral damage to ordinary people and property, which most superhero movies (and comics) skate right past? Money problems too -- if your profession is 'superhero' and that's what you're good at, how do you make a living if that job has been outlawed? And if it's a whole family of them, how do they all get their share of the action when school, groceries, and baby care always need managing?<br/><br/>All the Parrs and their buddy Frozone have good scenes with lots of side material. Bob learns in-the-trenches parenting. Violet goes back and forth with her targetted to-be-boyfriend Nick (who's been rehabilitated into a decent kid from the jock-in-training that he was in the original). Dash gets dad's old supercar to play with. And especially, Helen gets lots of action on her own recovering her old superheroing (superheroine-ing?) days. There are loads of other nice touches. The Parrs are given the run of an unused mansion built by ""an eccentric billionaire who wanted lots of secret entrances"" (thanks, Bruce Wayne). The runaway-favorite character Edna Mold is a ringer for famous old-Hollywood fashion designer Edith Head, which fits nicely into the understated retro feel of the whole production (no one seems to be using cellphones, for example). And near the end, there's a sequence where some of our heroes are wearing luminous goggles that turn them into zombies obeying the villain's commands. They look passively out of the screen at the audience, who are in turn looking back with our 3D glasses. Weird meta moment.<br/><br/>I like that the cartoon style of Incredibles 2 is a very close match to the original, which was an essential part of its charm. No attempts here at something glossier and more advanced like e.g. How to Train Your Dragon did with its sequel -- as the artwork becomes more 'real' it also becomes less pure fun, like comics we read as kids. Now the costumes: while Frozone has his complete body suit covering almost his whole head, the Parrs have these little black masks that don't disguise anything but nevertheless seem to work, like Clark Kent's glasses. Another fun bit is how the masks stretch and compress with their facial expressions. One improvement with the artwork is the hair (Helen gets several scenes on her high-speed motorcycle with hair blowing pretty realistically, and she has lots of closeups that are really quite expressive.) <br/><br/>However, there's something odd that has happened in the 14 years between the original Incredibles and its sequel. Special effects and CGI in live-action superhero movies have advanced so much that the ground between them and actual cartoon/comics has almost closed. In other words, watching The Incredibles (1 or 2) doesn't feel radically different from Avengers Infinity War, which is the closest yet to replicating what happens in superhero comics. Not that this is a complaint."

Incredibles 2: Reel Review
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Brad Bird
Starring Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Huck Milner, Eli Fucile, Bob Odenkirk and Samuel Jackson
 I have a confession to make. I have never watched the first Incredibles movie from Disney/Pixar. That being said you don't have to have seen the first one in order to know what's going on in this film. It is a self contained story and does a good job of introducing you to all of the characters in the film and what they've been up to and what is going on. 
 I had a really good time with this movie and really enjoyed the characters in the film. Craig T. Nelson who I have been a long time fan of since Poltergeist is great as Mr. Incredible and the patriarch of a family of superheroes with the amazing Holly Hunter voicing the matriarch Elastigirl. Superheroes have been outlawed in all countries and the head of a mega corporation wishes to change that by using Elastigirl to help shape public opinion by essentially sponsoring her in her fight against crime.
 With Elastigirl as the family's primary breadwinner Mr. Incredible takes on the duties of homemaker much to his chagrin. Think of this as a superhero version of Mr. Mom with a little bit of the X-men and a dash of The Fantastic Four added in for good measure. Mr. Incredible feels a bit jealous and out of place as he was accustomed to being the one providing for his family and being front and center in terms of superheroics and fighting bad guys. 
 Mr. Incredible struggles to bond with his kids as the primary caregiver as they navigate through struggles of their own such as homework and falling in love for the first time. He stumbles and he fails but he keeps on trying because he loves his family and wants to provide them with the best life possible. 
 Even though he wishes that he were the one on the front lines he still loves and supports his wife and doesn't wish for her to worry. Elastigirl has to contend with the rise of a new Supervillain the Screen Slaver with the help of the Deavor corporation headed by siblings Winston and Evelyn whose father was murdered shortly after superheroes were banned from fighting crime. Elastigirl forms a friendship with Evelyn and acts as a confidant of sorts who praises her efforts and invents Elastigirl's tech in the film.
 There is much fun to be had in this film. Baby Jack Jack steals the film as he develops superpowers of his own much to the pride and chagrin of Mr. Incredible. The film has a lot of heart and one of the best things about Incredibles 2 is the real life struggles of everyday life depicted in this film. This film deals with issues of discrimination, the redefining of gender roles and expectations in society as well as the struggles of feeling different and of a family struggling a balance life and work. I really highly recommend this film and am very eager to see the first Incredibles film."
"clarissa-nathania25","5","3","12","26 June 2018"," Storyline sucks
","The storyline sucks, and what happened after 14 years, we got the timeline right after The Incredibles 1. Where is Underminer? and also, what did Robert got for his 'family babysitting' sacrifice in the end? there's nothing explained about that. and it's like totally a 2 different plot movie combined. i think it's kinda sucks. the thing i looked forward for is the baby jack jack and his powers. also we had very little runtime of Edna Mode. But i should say the details of the animations is perfect. and the A113 easter eggs is always gonna be there. But it is not something that would wow me out of the theatre sorry to say."

","I have to admit, when the trailers came out for The Incredibles 2, I had absolutely no interest in it, despite loving the first film. But I was invited to see it, and it blew away my expectations. <br/><br/>The animation is one of the most eye-stunning I've seen in an animated movie. Everything from the characters to the environment stood out. The city looks amazing and highlights the retro aspect of the world. <br/><br/>The big praise I give it is that it did not lose anything that made the first film so great. It did not turn into a generic cash-grab sequel with a shallow plot. The family aspects are as strong as ever. Many times, you expect the film to follow certain cliches, but it does not.<br/><br/>One of my favourite Pixar movies ever. It is a must see."

The animation is so vibrate and colorful making for some exciting action scenes to go along with the amusing story they created. <br/><br/>I will say there is a lot of talking in this animated film which is odd for a animated film that coast so much money, but I must admit I like those moments of character interaction. <br/><br/>Also really loved the short film that premiered before the film making it over two hours long. <br/><br/>Please go see the Incredibles! fun an enjoyable!"

","This is a very fun film and is one of the very rare sequels that caries the feel of the original film without repeating the original film. If I have one complaint, the big reveal is so obvious that very few people will be surprised. It would have been better to let the audience in on the secret rather than trying to surprise them. It's so obvious, I'm not even sure they were trying to surprise you. Pay attention to the character names. Thankfully, it takes place early enough in the movie that it recovers without a hitch. <br/><br/>Very suitable for kids. I brought my very sensitive 11 year old son, and he really go into it.

"lesleyharris30","9","2","7","6 December 2018"," An Immensely Solid Sequel that Shines on its Own, As well as being a Fateful continuation of its Predecessor,
","Incredibles 2 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. As far as sequels go, it really does shine and is probably one of the best continuation to an animated film I have seen in a very long time. Though he may have been shying away from them for several years, it is clear Brad Bird did not stop thinking about these characters, the love, passion and intrigue in developing them further was felt in this screenplay throughout.<br/><br/>My only issue with the film really is that the villain does not shine half as much as Syndrome, who was one of the highlights of the first Incredibles. While there are brilliant moments, particularly a very tense scene where Elastigirl tries to track their location, the motivations and scheming of the character is quite cliche in terms of superhero movies, and was not nearly as personal or hard hitting as it felt in the original.<br/><br/>The voice cast is all around fantastic and as great as ever, and the new sides we see from the characters in this movie are fascinating, without feeling out of place or forced in any way. The star of the film, for me, is Violet, who is given a spectacular arc that I was always the most invested in, while Jack Jack was also a joy in every scene and a character with so much fun capabilities for writers.<br/><br/>An immensely solid sequel. Despite the difficult challenge this film takes of being a sequel people waited 14 years for, it takes this challenge heads on and manages not to disappoint, The Incredibles 2 is a joy from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Following directly after the events of the first movie, Elastigirl takes up work with an organisation striving to save the protection of superheroes, while Bob stays home with the kids and discovers Jack Jack's superpowers."
"MattyAndAnnika","1","2","7","19 November 2018"," Very weak as a story and the audio engineering is horrible
","We love Pixar and was really excited when this film was mentioned to come out. The long wait turns out to have been not worth it. Voices no longer fit the characters, the story just seems to be rushed and weak and whoever mastered the audio should never work in audio again.
We got this movie on Amazon for rent and we had to blast the audio at 90% to hear some of the story and in other areas 10% would rattle the windowd, very beginner levels in this part of the film; after about half way through the film we were discussing shutting the movie off. Pointless and not worth the time."
"pete-murphy97","5","2","7","9 October 2018"," Mr. Incredible made to look like Mr. Underwhelming
","TL;DR pretty good overall but was needlessly politicized and betrayed original portrayal of some of the main characters.<br/><br/>The first film was a groundbreaking animation back in 2004, one that I will always keep going back to: witty dialogue full of one-liners, smooth sequences, a group of heroes rooted in the everyday lives of the (majority of) the audience - and a villain just as iconic. It was, and remains a memorable tour de force in Pixar animation and a stunning achievement in cinema. 
People everywhere love superheroes for being so different, they are seen as an answer to the world's problems - but Brad Bird showed us that being ordinary: a mother, a father, a friend, son or daughter is equally as extraordinary and equally as important in keeping bad at bay. 
He showed us that the family in all its parts is worth so much more in its whole - this sequel betrays that beautiful expression. In the original Incredibles movie, Elastigirl and Mr Incredible were equals. They both had strengths and weaknesses, and in the end she ended up saving him. I loved that movie. It was about a loving family and about equal partnership. The sequel abandons that.<br/><br/>After many viewings of the first film, I've asked myself: ""does this really even need a sequel? Has everything Brad Bird wanted to say been said?"" 
That's up to you to decide, but the fact that Incredibles 2 is the second highest (nearly the highest) grossing animated film of all time, behind 2013's Frozen, speaks for itself; people believed Brad Bird had more to say and turned up in their droves to hear it. <br/><br/>The anticipated sequel did (eventually) come after a 14-year wait. But was Pixar's 20th feature film up to the coveted ""incredible"" standard?<br/><br/>Continuing where the last film left off; superheroes are still illegal, and the Parr family is against the ropes trying to find its purpose after it faces mounting legal pressures to hang up the suits for good. <br/><br/>It sounds like a good starting point, but things rapidly take a turn for the worse:<br/><br/>1. It's needlessly politicized: a consistent portrayal of Mr. Incredible as insecure and unstable:<br/><br/>This film shifts the focus away from Mr. Incredible as the centerpiece, not necessarily a bad thing, but a major problem is that it was done in a way that made Mr. Incredible look like a clueless idiot.<br/><br/>""Mr. Underwhelming""<br/><br/>Mr. Incredible was shown as an embittered, incapable father figure that is clearly annoyed (and jealous) that his wife wasn't staying at home and he was out doing the crime-fighting. He was portrayed as too ""messy"" to be a hero, and as a father even messier; degrading and depressing, this motif contributed nothing to the story and spat on the previous film's legacy, it lacked any comedic nuance. <br/><br/>It was completely out of character for Bob Parr, a character who is known to be selfless, supportive and at no point in the previous film had demonstrated egotistical traits that this film now claims he has. 
If anything, a cringe-worthy stretch to make Bob look like a bumbling oaf. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the film's third wave feminist influences can be seen clearly early on: ""it's not like I don't like strong women... I'm pretty secure, manhood-wise"" - an utterly pointless line bizarrely included in an early scene from Violet's crush Tony Rydinger. 
Why is that line remotely relevant to the wider plot? Out of context social commentary doesn't need to be there, especially not in a family entertainment film aimed at kids. Did Brad Bird sell out?<br/><br/>2. A poor villain that lacked screen-time, charisma, and was nowhere near as engaging as Syndrome.<br/><br/>The villain, while having some iconic attributes, wasn't connected to anything particularly significant or as deeply personal as Syndrome was. 
The audience was never made to feel the villain's personal plight or raison d'Ãªtre, because of that the villain wasn't engaging, was largely predictable, and failed to earn much (if any) emotional investment. <br/><br/>3. Too much emphasis on the ""stay-at-home dad"" trope.<br/><br/>Family is core part of the Incredibles, always has been, but the focus was obsessed on the Jack-Jack subplot, the unraveling of his powers and Mr. Incredible's unfunny mental breakdown.
All were novelties that wore thin, using precious time where something more original could have been developed (there was plenty of screen-time to do so). Fortunately, the movie wasn't a showreel of old gags and throwbacks, even if returning to Edna (a fan favorite character) was a marketable move for the trailer, it was not a decision that really moved the plot forward. <br/><br/>It gets a 5/10, because it was half of what the first film was. Cinema may be past its prime, politics have seeped into most big-budget productions, this one included."

","Can't believe that something that took 14 years to release felt so rushed and cheap. So disappointed. I know they tried to update the animation with the advances in technology but in doing so they made it feel cheap. It was like watching an episode of Paw Patrol. <br/><br/>The original is one of my favourite movies, animated and otherwise. Great story and decent animation that actually holds up incredibly well. <br/><br/>The story was ok in parts with some decent gags but that was about it. It felt like a mass produced TV series on Cartoon Network, not a Pixar event movie. <br/><br/>My kids thought it was good. I think they laughed at the bits Brad wanted them to. I think most of the problem is that it is aimed squarely at young kids. Not at all ages like many other Pixar classics. <br/><br/>They left the door open for sequel after sequel. Clearly going to follow the money. This felt like the 5th sequel after they licensed some other studio to carry on with it when they couldn't be bothered with it anymore."
"DarthPaul85","7","2","7","16 June 2018"," A good, but not great, sequel.
","I love the original Incredibles, it's probably my favorite Pixar movie, or close to it. <br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 hits many of the right notes, but suffers a little bit from sequelitis. <br/><br/>The good: The characters are still lovable and are consistent with their previous movie. The action sequences are great, and there are more of them than in the first film. The animation and visuals are ""incredible,"" and somehow match the aesthetic of the first film while taking full advantage of the 14 years of computer graphics advancements. The comedy is also ""pretty good,"" although some of the best jokes are in the trailer. The graphic design of the film is also stunning- on par with the first film, if not even more polished. <br/><br/>The bad: Feels like a ""monster of the week"" episode of a TV show more than a movie. The timelessness and gravitas of the first movie don't even come close here, and the philosophy feels a bit more forced and less digestible. The comedy, though generally enjoyable, also isn't quite as polished throughout. There's also a weird flavor to the writing here, like the movie knows it's being watched, and so it's treading a bit too carefully...nothing too detrimental, but I found it harder to relax with the film because of it. Things just didn't feel as natural. <br/><br/>Another thing that might throw some people off, the balance of character use is very different here. It's almost inverted from the first film, so that's good in the sense that it's something new, but some people may be disappointed if their favorite character doesn't really ""do much."" <br/><br/>Anyway, this is a good film, and a good sequel, but it definitely has flaws. I'm a little saddened that the film didn't match the first one in terms of timelessness and relatability, but to re-visit the Parr family one more time, it was worth it."
"kjproulx","9","3","13","15 June 2018"," The Movie Everyone's Been Waiting For
","Pixar has been a company that everyone cherishes. From their classics like Toy Story and Monsters Inc., to even their solid attempts at sequels in Monsters University and Finding Dory, their heart is and always has been in the right place. The reason I don't include Cars in this discussion is simply due to the fact that the sequels were only made to make the studio sell more merchandise. I don't fault them for that, because their original content is usually always stellar. The Incredibles was a film that was beloved by the majority of audiences around the world and it left people wondering why a sequel wasn't being made. Incredibles 2 has been long overdue for fans and there was almost too much hype to really live up to it for some. Personally, although I don't think this sequel surpasses the original in any way, it sure does live up to the hype in my opinion. Here's why I believe this movie delivered on all fronts.<br/><br/>Picking up immediately after the events of the first film, this film can easily be viewed as an extension of the original, rather than a sequel. The seamless transition between films was flawless in my opinion. The world still believes that superheroes are a potential danger to the world, so Helen is taken away to help prove their innocence and to reinstate their relevance once again. This ends up leaving Bob with a task he really doesn't want all that much; taking care of the kids. Having to deal with his baby (Jack-Jack) having very special abilities, this causes a lot of stress in his life, but also a lot of laughs for the audience. Helen's storyline is very solid and makes for some great additions in terms of storytelling, but this is where the film doesn't quite get to the standards set by the first movie.<br/><br/>Yes, Bob taking care of the kids is cute, Dash and Violet (his older kids) both have amazing times to shine is incredible (pun intended), and Jack-Jack's misadventures are show-stealing moments of hilarity, but I found myself a little tied down by the drama involving Helen. Her storyline exists in order to further the plot of the villain, which is completely fine, especially in a film made for a younger audience, but there were times that felt slightly predictable and bogged down the film a little. That being said, the pacing and cutting back and forth between these two storylines are really the only complaints I had about this movie. I personally think the first movie is near-perfect, so this is why I can't quite say I loved it as much as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Where Incredibles 2 does make things a little more interesting is in its surprises and heart. There is plenty of action/espionage throughout the movie to keep fans entertained, but the backbone of the movie is reversing everyone's role in comparison with the first movie and it really did add a layer that I felt authentic, which I was expecting to feel forced. The pacing in the middle of the movie is saved by a fantastic conclusion that had me grinning from ear to ear. Some people may find this movie to be a slightly slower burn than the energetic pacing of the first, but that's simply because the story required it.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is a fantastic sequel and easily one of the best follow-ups that Pixar has ever done (excluding the Toy Story sequels obviously). Personally, I think this movie was well worth the wait. It went in a few directions that I wasn't expecting it to, its themes are very relevant to today's climate and adults will definitely see where that comes into play, and the score by Michael Giacchino leaps off the screen. Very well written and directed by Brad Bird (who also helmed the original), this movie is the definition of a film that warrants its existence and proves that the people who were demanding a sequel were doing the right thing throughout the years. Incredibles 2 may not become as beloved as its predecessor, but it's still a fantastically well-done film nonetheless."
"greentunes","9","3","13","15 June 2018"," Impressed!
","I was quite a bit nervous that this movie would not live up to it's 14-year hype, but am pleased to say it completely did! 
All of the characters are the same, with fun humor, and and overall great story. I'm probably stating the obvious here, but the original, per usual, is still superior. This movie had a bit of a less spy-eske tone, but I can't really downgrade it for that. 
Some of the more memorable side characters did appear less that I had really hoped, like Edna, who was barely in the movie unfortunately, but the movie did add a seemingly larger scale of superheros in the metropolis. 
HOWEVER, 
I really do hope that these films are not turned into a franchise, as I really feel like we could easily be over-saturated with them. 
I think this film left the series off pretty well, and am nearly praying that Disney will not try to franchise this one. I don't want another Star Wars situation here. 
Please do check this movie out!"
"christianrmaxwell","9","3","14","17 June 2018"," An extremely fun and fascinating watch
","This movie is so great in terms of all the basis a movie needs to be great. Fantastic animation as expected, great voice acting, a compelling and smart story, heartwarming messages, and necessary character development. The most surprising out of these for me was definitely the compelling story. Although the story for the first Incredibles movie was noticeably dark, this movie seemed to double down on that factor, and it only benefited from it. The villain, when revealed, is extremely believable in their motives and reasoning for their evil actions. I honestly expected there to be an abundance of pandering children's jokes in this movie, but I should have known that as with the first Incredibles movie, there was a very minimal amount of this. The humor was very smart for the most part and quite literally the only issue I had with the movie was that some of the jokes and gags the movie tried to pull off just didn't work for me. I was able to mostly forgive the movie for this though, because these scenes were very few and spread out. I commend the director for working on this movie until he felt that it was as good as the original movie if not better, and I personally would say it is even better than the first. More than anything, this movie is extremely thrilling (which I didn't expect), heartwarming, compelling in terms of story, and just overall a fantastic Summer movie and a family movie. The action scenes in this movie were also filmed extremely well in my opinion and deserve to be recognized for it. This was a great movie and I highly recommend to see it on the biggest screen you can find."

","Having young sons, it's safe to say that Pixar's Incredibles was a staple movie that delivered many of the cartoon giant's trademarks; compelling storyline, social messages and a very balanced sense of humour that strikes a chord across all levels. This set the bar reasonably high for the arrival of the very long awaited sequel. 
Before it hit the screens, I wanted to love it. The trailers were reassuringly witty and there was hope that the cliffhanger from the first film would bring much more of the same. 
So what happened? Well it's with disappointment that I gave too say Pixar probably misfired on this very rare occasion. 
The plot was reasonably weak, literally dragged over the finish line. The ""twist"" was transparent and yet it took almost the while film to unravel. 
It feels like Pixar's script writers were absent when the comedy elements were forged and so most of the jokes were already broadcast in the trailers. 
The whole plot failed to muster anything more than mediocre pace as it meandered to a conclusion, leaving an empty feeling where the laughter and love of the latest Pixar production were meant to be. 
Small moments of mercy from Baby Jack-Jack offered just a glimpse of how the film should have felt, but this brand is far greater than a single character and so for the first time in the history of Pixar, I felt like I needed to jump out abs help push the movie to the final credits to put it out of its misery."

I will not spoil you on the plot. Simply watch it. I hated it the first time I watched this, but the second time around, I was surprised to find how much I love this movie!
A very mysterious plot with plenty of twists and turns, great voice acting, the darkest, most violent, and most intense Disney-Pixar movie so far - and I enjoyed it for it's intensity and dark themes. Still cheesy, but definitely enjoyable. Engages you from the point it starts (unlike the first one), and sooo amazing, ""Incredibles 2"" is a recommended movie flick."
"jeremycrimsonfox","9","1","3","2 June 2019"," A Good Long-Awaited Sequel
","The Incredibles was a good Pixar film, and when I heard of this sequel, I was hyped. Picking up immediately where the first film ended, after being arrested battling the Underminer, with the destruction causing the Superhero Relocation Program being shut down, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone are invited by Winston Deavor, a wealthy businessman who is a superhero fan, who wants the three's help to re-legalize Supers. Elastigirl is put in the front line first, as she is the least destructive, and Mr. Incredible becomes a stay-at-home dad, especially when Jack-Jack, the baby of the family, is developing his powers.<br/><br/>While I have heard complaints about feminist messages and such, but I don't care about political messages. Besides, Mr. Incredible is okay with it, as he tells Elastigirl to go and do the job Winston gave her so their kids (Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack) can have the choice. Also, he does his best to be a good father while Elastigirl's away fighting crime, so basically, it's saying anyone can be anything, regardless of their gender.<br/><br/>The main cast from the first film returns, with the exception of Dash, who has been recast due the VA from the first movie hitting puberty. The new characters are awesome, and the story is good, with a huge twist to the villain I will not spoil. This is how a sequel is done, and is recommended."
"mitsubishizero","9","1","3","25 May 2019"," Better than the first one
","I was initially worried that this wouldn't deliver what we were waiting for but it did and it's better than the first one. It begins where the first one left off where they prepare to fight The Underminer(John Ratzenberger). While doing so Violet's boyfriend accidentally discovers her identity and the main villain ends up escaping.<br/><br/>Things get worse when they find out the service that helps superhero's has been dissolved leaving them without any financial assistance. Things change when a fan of superhero's appear and offers Elastigirl a job while Mr. Incredible stays behind to take care of the kids.<br/><br/>Now you'd think this would be a rehash of the first but instead they go a different direction and show how Bob would handle it. The end result is a hilarious set of jokes involving the baby who's powers develop even further much to Bob's excitement/horror. There're also some emotional scenes such as when Violet finds out that Bob was behind her boyfriends memory being erased.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Helen enjoys her job and the perks that come with it such as the motorbike she's given. Man, any scene with her riding that bike is awesome because she contorts herself so much and it's just cool. Things however get strange when a villain known as the Screenslaver pops up and starts controlling the technology and superheroes. With little time Elastigirl needs all the help she can to stop this new villain.<br/><br/>The animation's faster, the dialogue's well written and characters are as likable as ever. The action scenes are very much improved. Jack-Jack pretty much steals the show. His fight scene with the raccoon is funny and cool. All in all it's a great movie! Check it out."

I guessed what was going on early on but thought, no, they can't possibly be just repeating the first movie. But yeah, they are.<br/><br/>While the movie is utterly predictable and not always entirely sensible (heroes near the end don't do a super-obvious thing because it would have ended the movie 20 minutes earlier), it still has some terrific moments, most of these involve the youngest Incredible. There's also some nice exploration of traditional gender roles.<br/><br/>I loved the original the first time I saw it but only liked it when I recently re-watched it. This felt a lot like watching the same movie a third time, which may be why I was less entranced yet again.<br/><br/>Not *great* Pixar, but still fun."

"plasticanimalz","7","1","3","21 November 2018"," Beautiful Design But Not Quite As Good As The First
","The Nutcracker: The Fourth Realm and Incredibles 2 are hands down the most beautiful films I've seen this year as far as production and design. Though, both were a bit lacking in the story department. Incredibles 2 has a story, and it's fine, it just doesn't hold up quite to the original, which was fairly flawless. I was fine with the feminist spin some are on here raving like lunatics that it's some political agenda. Ha. Animated films take 3 years to make. And, unlike live-action films, the script and voice-over work has to be done ahead of time so directors can't take liberties like they do in live-action. Basically, the structure is much more rigid and planned out than the Marvel live-action films where the storyboard artists come up with the action scenes then they hire a writer to write around them, or the latest Mission Impossible, where the director was writing the film as he was filming it. So, it would be literally impossible for Pixar/Disney to infuse the current MeToo movement into this film as it had to have been written at least 4 or 5+ years ago. And unlike live-action, it would be extremely time consuming and ludicrously expensive to add new scenes later and edit them into an animated film. Not to mention, I've never ever heard of them doing that. And since that's what I do for a living I think I have fairly accurate understanding of how big studio animation works.<br/><br/>I love Brad Bird's work and having Elastigirl take the role of the superhero in this film seemed like an obvious transition. Mr. Incredible doing the same thing again would have been redundant, so, it was a good choice to have her take on that role. And I thought watching Mr. Incredible at home was funny watching a big clunky guy trying to maneuver home life and kids. Maybe seems cliche, but that is what animated physical humor is about and what the great Warner Bros. cartoons were built on. Like the whole scene with the Jack-Jack fighting the raccoon I could see they were going for that old school physical comedy that required no words. That was one of my favorite scenes. Great physical comedy. My favorite scenes involved the kids and I wish they would have showed more of Violet and Dash. I liked Violet's arc with Tony and it would have been nice to see that or her school life explored a little more.<br/><br/>While I like the ScreenSlaver villain, which was clever and a great pun, and I liked the Winston character and his enthusiasm, I felt that storyline was a little clunky. It started out good, and the whole PR angle with Elastigirl was great, and played into the first film with destruction being why superheroes were outlawed in the first place. I can't say I know what was wrong with it. Usually it's pretty clear to me but...I think what it is is that they tried to tackle a more adult subject in a kid's movie and then tried to maintain the animation, kid angle, which made it like two films, struggling to take spotlight. Understandable, Brad Bird is getting older and has been doing kid's films for a while and may be interested in expanding into more adult subjects. Which, once you're pegged into one genre it can be hard to break out. Like, the scene where she goes to SreenSlaver's hideout reminded me of serial killer shows. That seemed a bit adult for children. It was pretty tame, but I shouldn't be in a kid's film and thinking of Dexter. Though, the first Incredibles is a cartoon version of James Bond which is very adult, so, where do you draw the line? I did agree with some reviewers that the adults shouldn't be drinking whiskey in an animated kid's film. I don't remember the swearing...it was in E.T., if I remember correctly, but I do agree that adults should feel safe to take their 5-yr olds to a Disney/Pixar film and not have to worry about that.<br/><br/>As far as design I think it's the most beautiful post '70s animated film I've ever seen. Every visual department is on-point and should be proud of the work they've done. Not only was it visually more beautiful than the first Incredibles, but the best animated design I've seen since Sleeping Beauty. The backgrounds, props were amazing, layouts amazing, animation, flawless. The scene where it was darkly lit sitting around a beautiful blue pool, that was stunning. The story could have used more oomph to truly put it into one of my favorites. But it is definitely something I will look back to for design, as I think anyone in animation, visual effects, architecture, or design will, as it was truly inspiring."

So that's probably why I didn't love or dislike this movie.<br/><br/>This might be one of Pixar's most formulated movies. The film is ungodly predictable. The story is just not very engaging. The characters feel very ditached and don't feel like the same characters from the first film. Bob is very unlikable , Dash was annoying and Jack Jack was just a very unfunny comic relief. Helen and Violet are the only two that feel like the same characters and Frozon was pretty enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film does have good things about it. For example the animation is very well done. It isn't mind blowing especially comparing to there previous film Coco. The score I thought was well done but nothing great. The action was very well put together and the film did feel like there was passion put into it.<br/><br/>Overall it's a mixed bag. For every one positive there is an equally as big negative.

Plus, both Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl still got to work as a team in fighting villains. The kids were cool too.

","After fourteen years, Brad Bird returns to his spy/superhero mix. The film picks up immediately after the events of the original film, which is admittedly something you don't see every day, but at the same time I also feel that it constrains the film, forces it into a cubicle.<br/><br/>The film looks and feels almost exactly like the original. Which is great. The colours are still phenomenal, the 60s spy thriller aesthetic is still superb and a refreshing change of pace, the characters feel familiar and the even though the special effects and animation quality have definitely gone up in fourteen years, the transition is pretty much seamless.<br/><br/>What I don't appreciate as much is the fact that this is almost exactly the same movie as the original one. At least in terms of theme, plot, character arc and underlying message. Once again we have superheroes under scrutiny. Once again Mr. Incredible has to juggle family duties with his consuming need of being a hero. And so on and so on, ad nauseam.<br/><br/>And certainly, a lot of sequels are very similar to their predecessors. But I think it's safe to say that we can expect more from Pixar. And more from Brad Bird. The man has reportedly said that he didn't want to make a sequel to The Incredibles unless he had something new to tell. Well... this isn't new. You can definitely watch it and appreciate it for its technical excellence, its great characters and its thrilling story. But you don't get anything from it. Nothing you haven't gotten from the original, that is. And I don't like that. This film universe has so much potential for great and meaningful stories that it's a great shame to see it wasted like this.<br/><br/>Still, it's by no means a bad film. It is enjoyable to watch and as a standalone film I do like it a lot. As a sequel it leaves much to be desired."
"FelipeCarrillo","8","1","3","23 September 2018"," ""Incredibles 2"" upholds the Parrs as one of the best families in the history of cinema
","Luck or fate, my childhood, like those of thousands of human beings, was strongly influenced by Disney/Pixar's wonderful, sophisticated tales, which I saw on TV without any prejudice or criticism over and over again, movies that always were a healthy, high-quality entertainment. If I revisit these films today, I can possibly question certain aspects due to the passage of time and that's completely natural because a flick can be perceived in a myriad of ways according to age, mood or state of mind of the viewer. One thing that definitely seems to have been proven with unfading solidity is the thought that they're truly complex audiovisual works, these movies were the beginning of a kinetic digital era for animation genre that currently keeps going on both destroying box office expectations and exciting and teaching the new children with creativeness, passion, and effort. Although not all Disney-Pixar-made movies of the 21st century are modern classics, there are time-worthy pieces of art with visual tidiness and original, heartfelt storyline execution that keep alive- and many nonfans have complained about this - the 'Disney formula' that inspires hope, union, forgiveness and improvement.<br/><br/>That's why the first movie of the Parr family is so intimately untouchable for me, just like a few others beautiful animated films. Even with its unimportant flaws, it saved the 2000's superhero genre and set some rules to follow for the following animation stories thanks to one of the most powerful, meaningful, family-friendly screenplays in the industry, minimizing the margin of error as for the effect of the plot in worldwide audiences; this is one more Disney-Pixar feature-length for the ages.<br/><br/>A sequel was a high-risk move on the part of the company that produced major concerns among die-hard fans. On the one hand, for example, we have the Andrew Stanton-directed sequel/spin-off ""Finding Dory"" as a reference, but the Dory-centric movie was far from reaching the impact of Marlin's ocean trek. However, on the other hand, ""Toy Story 2"" by John Lasseter, former creative chief at Pixar and Disney, found the magic formula to enhance the good features from the first film and mix them with interesting, new improvements, turning into a truly computer-animated marvel. When it was announced that Brad Bird would direct this new story, things quieted down a bit, and after knowing the time between one film and the other - just 14 years!, - everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Today, it's possible to find out what kind of work was made along this time and, to tell the truth, the final cut manages to stand alone due to the return of the original vocal cast, the preservation of the 2000's animation style, a superhero family story with interesting repercussions and a few features that, although don't overshadow some detrimental decisions, at least, reach a good conclusion with a harmony of different genres not so miscible in that scenario.<br/><br/>""Incredibles 2"" is an important film, a smart sequel that enriches its animated universe through a radically contrasting plot that refreshes the Hollywood-era animation, superhero scene. Even when we've seen movies driven by gender-swapped thematics between daughter and mother (""Freaky Friday""), criminal guy and mean girl (""The Hot Chick"") or married man and single friend (""The Change-Up""), most of these body-life switches were, first of all, comedies, but also provoked by some kind of magic object or spell, as a fortune cookie, a pair of earrings or peeing in a sacred fountain. On this occasion, the same characters are who will switch roles by their own due to money crisis, survival compels them to make great efforts, just like a real-world family. Putting narcissistic, kind-of-sexist Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible in check when his wife takes on a fabulous new job is a risky plotting move that, even if it sounds clichÃ©, allows the story to argue that household chores and family issues aren't easy work or responsibility of a single member.<br/><br/>As for the family as a whole, the film gets a myriad of ways to use the comedy potential of every member with every-day, representative situations which take advantage of the well-defined personalities to set up hilarious sequences. Dash is, in some way, sidelined with humor focused on his lines this time. However, it puts a greater importance on Violet, who with her impossible-love sub-plot fit in with ease. But, no one can deny it; Jack-Jack steals the entire film by being one of the funniest, cutest characters this year. Math, breakups, dinner, household chores, and an adorable baby have never been better in an animated film.<br/><br/>Clearly, mom is the boss here; she gets the spotlight, a woman who's forced to lay aside her children and husband for an indefinite period to ""make supers legal again."" There is a strong, meaty commentary/fictional debate on the issue of the legalization of superheroes, a purpose going through several discussion-worthy obstacles. Helen, the new focal point in the plot, blissfully becomes one of the strongest rocks of this sequel because there are insufficient animated films that place a woman in the starring role with such priceless storyline skills. It's an important step in female representation in kids-oriented cinema to see not only how a woman monopolizes the whole story, but also the way they change the stereotyped conception of mother; likewise, just a few decisions feel synthetic as the story takes the right time for Bird's distinctive approach and development on the visual and narrative section, a balance where comedy takes place at home mainly, whereas the most dramatic events takes place among the streets of the huge metropolis. At a given time along the movie, Voyd, the Kristen Stewart-inspired character voiced by Sophia Bush, questions Elastigirl about how it she can level her life as a heroine, mom and wife, and although it's never answered by her, the film itself provides the answer.<br/><br/>While Mr. Parr does household chores, Elastigirl accepts to reintegrate in the field, just like that heroine dressed in red and white who kicked the asses of pickpockets and thieves some years ago. Brushing transient lawbreakers aside, the Screenslaver is her main target, a new-age antagonist that serves as a stark commentary on crowd control by media info day to day. This villain plays his role in an interesting way, at least until the predictable big twist takes place, from that moment on, the ""bad guy"" must recover strength from any situation in order to get back the threatening sense he was during the first fifty minutes. <br/><br/>Special mention for a couple of iconic characters who have the right to be part of the modern-day pop-culture as for animation field. That's right, it's the meanly charming Edna Mode, who, ironically, steals the show completely just as the first film with her upset, super-rich visionary costume designer thanks to the writers' witty work. But alongside Jack-Jack, who supports on his tiny shoulders the best visual gags, they're an explosive duo, in matters of comedy, of course. It will be no surprise that it's already insinuating their own movie, however, Disney has the things clear, and that makes us happy.<br/><br/>The animation isn't at the same level of detail as the most visually complex feats of the company, but it isn't by reason of a poorly-crafted work, is because the film sets just some minutes after the first feature film, that is to say, they decide to remain in the same timeline of 14 years ago, safeguarding its textures and animation styles, holding true to the simplicity of the features at that time, a world where realism doesn't have to be part of the equation. There are a few eye-popping landscapes; on the contrary, the film stays in urban settings to develop most of the plot. Truly unforgettable, beautiful sequences can be counted on the fingers of one hand, there are only a handful of important pictures, the best frame: An exhausted Bob going upstairs carrying his two boys in his arms, a visual poem that finds beauty in the emotional. It's understandable that Pixar doesn't deliver a visually arresting experience, but there is a character who went too far, id est, he looked like I was looking at a 2005 video game character, his expressions were made of rubber. It's Bob Odenkirk's character, Winston Deavor, he's of wax.<br/><br/>Leaving much to be desired with his ""Fallen Kingdom"" score, Michael Giacchino takes the throne back with the habitual power, experience in most of his soundtracks. A composer with more than 128 credits divided by video games, shorts and feature films, Giacchino creates again an excellent soundtrack for this animated sequel, one that is equally effective and exciting in both the most dazzling set-pieces and the simpler, dramatic scenes, there is passion in the melodies, which don't stay behind the pictures, they even got the spotlight in some set-pieces, modernized but faithful compositions. Another towering work of a towering composer.<br/><br/>""Incredibles 2"" by Brad Bird is an unusual sequel, as it knows how to transmute into a Hollywood modern motion picture by using a mold that respects the universe built fourteen years ago. For a certainty, its greatest virtues are found in the priceless female importance, the skillful editing that balances comedy and drama as only Pixar can do, a super-absorbing soundtrack and an enchanting narrative treatment that simply would not be possible without Bird's experience, the numerous crew and the incredible vocal cast led by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Catherine Keener. Brimming with messages of representation, equality, family and topicality, this laugh-inducing family-friendly sequel is a step forward for animation and superhero genre, and another knockout for a company that honors its gems of yesteryear, that goes hand in hand with new technologies and its roots, that roots that were the awakening of a new era."

I think the animation was beautiful and the charactisation of their ages and the roles they play in their society and the time it is are very fun. The villain is a nice twist and I really enjoyed her reveal. Disney is becoming so open to new ideas and new ways to build characters, I think that this movie shouldn't have focused on its underminer roots in the trailer, as the underminer was there for 10 minutes max. I think that the way Bob and Helen are together, their way of life and how they care for each other are so much more deeper than some people can see and I think that they really captured what the scorned once-hero would feel like in Bob.
Especially the scene where Helen is talking about the train she saved, this was a throwback to the first movie where Bob couldn't save the train and to me it's little details like that that make it fun."

"NeodymiumIII","8","1","3","1 August 2018"," A fantastic and topical sequel
","The Incredibles may be my favorite Pixar film, and I was very excited for the sequel to come out. I was not disappointed. The movie is remarkable in many aspects: the direction is better than ever, the soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is just as amazing as in the first one, the characters are still adorable and relatable.<br/><br/>As a child I was very curious about the ""golden age"" of superheroes that was briefly shown at the start of the original film, and since Elastigirl is a ""remnant"" of this golden age, it was incredibly satisfying to see her put in the center of the story.<br/><br/>But what's truly amazing is the antagonist : the Screenslaver (amazing name) uses screens to hypnotize people. This serves as a way for the writers to beautifully critisize the ubiquity of screens and what they are used for: regular media, social media and the entertainement industry.<br/><br/>The film makes it easy for young children to understand how the excessive presence of TV or the internet can affect judgement, imagination, and ultimately how any media today can lead to a false perception of reality, by allowing the cult of certain people, and by diverting people from their own community.<br/><br/>Even as an adult, I really liked the message that was sent, and how it was sent, thanks to the funny, multi-layered dialogue.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the last segment of the film is a lot wackier than the rest of the film, but it does not ruin the film, far from it. Overall it's a masterpiece."

"stamenkovickosta","10","1","3","27 July 2018"," Don't let some negative reviews fool you
","It's a good movie. Not as good as the first one, of course, but it's still a good movie. I think that we all knew that there is no way that the sequel is gonna live up to the original, which only few movies accomplished. But that fact doesn't mean that the movie is bad or disappointing. I went to the theaters with my 8 year old cousin and we had a good time. There was a lot of good action and good humor. True, it didn't have as much character moments as the original one, but ones it had was more than enough.<br/><br/>Negative reviews say that ""Disney turns everything into comedy"". Most of the comedy in this movie comes from the baby, which was supposed to be comic relief, so i don't see what's the problem with it. All other main characters also had their funny moments, but not enough to turn them into blatant comic reliefs.<br/><br/>Plot isn't too complicated and it was easy to guess who was the villain. But still, even though not as good as Syndrome, it proved to be entertaining and dangerous foe.<br/><br/>Overall, if you don't expect this movie to be as good as the first one, you'll probably have a good time. Watch it for what it is: a sequel to one of the best animated movies ever.<br/><br/>I won't recommend this movie to those with epileptic problems, since there are few very flash scenes that might trigger attack."
"shpasstudios","9","1","3","27 July 2018"," Best Movie!
","Incredibles 2 is amazing and 'totally wicked' film since their last film, Coco. Sure the sequel can have it's quirks like with a plot that copying elements from the first Incredibles, but with a great executed story (like the role reversal), animation that gonna a hugh upgrade from the first film, humor that is still funny as last time, great voice acting brought by the returning voice actors and the new ones and characters that are still memorable like before. This is great highly recommendation for both Pixar fans, super hero fans, Incredibles fans and ones who are a fans of Brad Bird who enjoy this like the first movie. I gave this 14-year long awaited sequel 9/10 for being the best Pixar sequel/film of 2018."
"tom-james-brennan","7","1","3","25 July 2018"," Some people are bashing this film for little or no reason
","I've just finished watching this movie with my 8 year-old son. Both he and I are huge fans of the first film, and I've been waiting 14 years for this sequel to come out.<br/><br/>The movie is good, not as good as the first, but it is enjoyable and a nice way to entertain the little ones if you've got them. If you grew up as a kid watching this movie, I'll tell you that you probably are not going to like this one. <br/><br/>Now, to clear up some of the negatives being bandied about by the other reviewers:<br/><br/>1) 'God' and 'Hell' are not curse words. Literally any word can be considered a curse word in the correct context i.e. ""the reviewers of this movie are fudging puppy lovers with not an ounce of shooting sense between them"" - no curse words right? Bt you've already understood the inference - don't bash a movie which uses two words that are not cuss words but you've gotten overly sensitive about - if you have a problem with the language, then be a responsible parent and tell your children not to say them - it's your personal opinion, keep it that way.<br/><br/>2) the use of drink in the movie - there are scenes where Elastigirl is at an ambassadorial function and is seen to be drinking a dark red or brown liquid from a glass - at no point is this explicitly stipulated to be alcoholic, except for a moment later on in the film where someone says ""is it ok to drink on the job?"" (when no job or official working capacity is technically being done). <br/><br/>Firstly, adults drink alcohol from time to time. Doing so responsibly is absolutely fine, we are not living in prohibition era America. Disney have done nothing wrong to have a character drink a drink (alcoholic or otherwise) within their movie. It would be a different story if the drinking was excessive, or resulted in drunken behaviour - but then again how many of you were up in arms about the scene in ""The Good Dinosaur"" where a child and a dinosaur ate some berries and went on a seemingly drug-induced 'trip'? How many of you are going to boycott the live-action Dumbo because in the animated original Dumbo gets drunk and sees pink elephants? <br/><br/>Once again here on IMDB, people are being way too sensitive and it gives the movie an unjust review scoring.<br/><br/>The story and the villains may be predictable to some, (personally I clocked it straight away as being one of two possible characters) but again, let's all step back a second and realise this is a kids movie, not a Christopher Nolan epic like 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' - the plot needs to be accessible enough for kids, and entertaining enough for adults - for over 25 years Pixar has been treading this line with aplomb, and now all of a sudden people are outraged because they dare to make a sequel which has female characters taking more of a lead, and they call this ""Feminist propaganda"" - wake up and grow up people - I'm a dude, and wouldn't call myself a feminist, but it's clear that this movie is obviously tackling some themes that are a hot topic, but in no way is this 'propaganda'.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is entertaining but nothing to shout about. It's nice to see Mr Incredible deal with his sidelining and become the parent that Mrs Incredible knows he can be, and it was a hoot to see Jack Jacks various powers taking some of the spotlight. It's never going to be the original film, but if that's all you want from this movie then here's a tip - go raid your DVD or Blu Ray collection and watch the first one again and give this a miss."
"siwyn","8","1","3","24 July 2018"," Great Sequel
","Great film for all with an interesting follow on from the 1st. However I suspect if you're the kind of person who believes that everyone should be armed and gun control is a liberal plot to destroy freedom, Barrack Obama is a Muslim, segregation wasn't all bad and women should be content to exist solely to serve men then you will hate this film However given that its already made a billion dollars and is likely to be one of the highest grossing films of the year your loss. Welcome to the 21st century. <br/><br/>Agree with others that it would have been great to have some of the super heroes involved that were mentioned in the first Incredibles but overall really good animation, excellent comedy scenes and a story that works on a number of levels"
"alindsay-al","9","1","3","23 July 2018"," A fantastic sequel that is well worth the wait
","The first incredibles film is one of my favourite films of all time and I can't believe we have had to wait 15 years for a sequel but we have finally been given it and if you are a fan of the first film you will enjoy this film, hopefully as much as I did. The premise of the film sees being a superhero made illegal, elastigirl is sent out to give supers a better outlook while Mr incredible is left to look after the kids. I think Craig T Nelson and Holly hunt are perfect as the roles of Mr incredible and elastigirl respectively, I love the reverse roles they are put in this film and how their characters deal with certain situations is just so fitting of their characters. The rest of the family are back and Jack jack steals the show in this film as he starts to discover his powers and it is just hilarious to watch. Dash and violet are fun in the roles given to them but they fade into the background at times in this film. Samuel l Jackson reprises his role as frozone and he isn't in this film as much as you want him to be but he is great when he is on screen. The villain though doesn't provide much intrigue to me and I feel like they weren't an important part of this film. The story is interesting and deals with some themes that are pretty mature and seemingly reacting to the huge explosion of superhero films in the media today. However, the biggest negative in this film is the plot twist involving the villain. I predicted the twist straight away and it didn't come across particularly well at all. The script has the likeable humour from the first film and some great drama that adds to the complexity of these heroes and there lifestyles. The style of the film has some great action set pieces involved that really grew in stature as the film progresses. Also this film moves quickly and flows really well to keep you interested throughout. Overall this is a fantastic sequel that is worthy of the wait and definitely worth a watch."

"datautisticgamer-74853","8","1","3","30 June 2018"," Familiar but familial
","I adore The Incredibles. In fact, I'd say that of Pixar's early 2000s movies, it would be my favorite. Understandably, I was hyped for this movie when it was announced, to the point that I watched its prequel again in order to prepare myself for continuity errors here. After a bit of deliberation, my father managed to find a Friday evening that worked for both of us. Now that we have seen it, what is my personal opinion?<br/><br/>Admittedly, the already familiar plot does draw back on the potential of this movie as a sequel, since it pulls some of the same plot points from the first one but with drastic tweaks. Fundamentally, it's very similar to the first Incredibles, but when carried out, it's a tad more interesting than it would seem. It trades some of the originality and witty, insightful commentary for humor, which is actually a very acceptable trade-off. Sure, there are the clichÃ© jokes such as hand washing, but many of the others are fast-paced. I could actually recall most of my fellow audience members chuckling at some parts. Of course, we also have the family focus side, which is conceptually identical to the first movie but is twisted. Again, not original, but the edits are just enough to save it from being a retelling of the first movie. As time has drawn on, Pixar has continued to upgrade their films, and here, the aesthetics actually received some very glorious upgrades. The environments feel like more attention was added to the detail, and the effects take advantage of the 14-year gap with light flashes and real world tech like VR (the hypnotism goggles). As one of the first film's officers would say to Pixar regarding the overall animation, ""You've done it again."" I won't talk much about the main characters since they're the same, but I do admire the slight development of Jack-Jack and how the focus on the legal status of supers affects the returning characters. I was disappointed that we didn't see Mirage, Bomb Voyage, or some other characters from the original movie, but I do feel like the new supers and the Deavors made up for it in the end.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the first Incredibles, you will either love this film for its action, humor, and improved animation, or hate it since, considering its similar plot to the prequel, it may as well have been a (n honestly well thought) fanfic of the first movie. For everyone else, this is more of an older kids' film due to its language and slightly more mature subject matter, but it still has the action, humor, and consistent commitment to family and life that should make it a solid bet for entertainment. I personally enjoyed it, and I expect that families will, most likely, end up satisfied."

"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","3","21 June 2018"," The Best Pixar Sequel Since Toy Story 3
","Thank God for Pixar. Each time I'm convinced every CG-kid's movie monstrosity looks like the same plastic, soulless bombardment of color as the next, they come along and remind us why they are the undefeated champs of animation. Even in their sequels, like their most recent Incredibles 2, there's a crispness and attention-to-detail that far exceeds their contemporaries. But Pixar has always been story first, and Incredibles 2 continues that tradition, giving us their best sequel since Toy Story 3.
Picking up right where the original left off, the Parr family-of-superheroes are still learning to juggle school, work and home life, all while trying to go unnoticed in a world that has made vigilantism illegal. When Elastigirl is offered a new job that will help supers gain back some public credibility, things only become more complicated, especially when Jack-Jack's powers start taking shape (a fight between the baby and a raccoon is the highlight of the film). The mid-20th century aesthetics are still wonderfully strong, and the action scenes are even more inventive, exciting and cohesive than the already stellar first one. Best yet, it beautifully presents a truly female-forward family adventure without ignoring the implicated difficulties of a changing time.
Like most sequels, it doesn't quite match the heights of its predecessor. Familiarity, plot clichés, flat jokes, and obnoxiously obvious twists are scattered throughout. However, what makes this series great is the family-life stuff, and director Bird clearly recognizes that. Marriage is hard; parenting is hard; family is hard; no superpower can change that, yet no difficulty can defeat true love. (SIDE NOTE: make sure to get there in time for the honest and hilarious pre-film short ""Bao"")."

","GRADE: B+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A delightful animated romp with superheroes who save the day.
JIM'S REVIEW: Incredibles 2, writer /director Brad Bird's sequel to his original 2004 film, continues with the right 60's retro vibe from its op and pop art settings, its endearing family of superheroes, and its way-too-cool jazz-infused score by Michael Giacchino . Yes, it was a long wait for its return and the film delivers in its artistry and savvy animation. <br/><br/>The plot: It is now illegal to be a superhero. This law includes The Parr clan: Bob a.k.a. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Helen a.k.a. Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) are in hiding and living in a cheap motel, along with their gifted children, moody teenage Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and Baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). Soon they are called upon to legitimize their powers once again, this time by a rich businessman, Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk)) and his inventor sister (Catherine Keener) who will finance their reappearance. They decide to re-package and sell our crusaders to the American public, including their buddy, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), and start their campaign by making Elastigirl the main focus of admiration. This shifts the family dynamics by having Mr. incredible become a stay-at-home dad who morphs into Mr. Mom with harried results, especially since Baby Jack Jack begins to develop his own lethal super powers.<br/><br/>Mr. Bird does a masterful job directing the film. His unmistakeable visual look of his film with its dated futuristic viewpoint is stylized pop via George Jetson. Script-wise, his characters' dialog is sharply written too, even if his story does meander, spending too much time with exposition about the arch villain, ScreenSlaver, and the introduction of other superheroes that barely register in personality or interest. Their only purpose is to somewhat complicate the plot and allow for more action scenes. But there is enough wit and humor throughout the movie to sustain the pure joy of gorgeously rendered chase sequences of dare-doings that flow with wonderful movement and clever details. <br/><br/>However, some wonderful minor characters are given short rift in this installment due to the narrative. One wishes the likes of Rick Dicker (Jonathan Banks), Underminer (John Ratzenberger), and especially Edith Head look-alike Edna Mode (the multi-talented Mr. Bird himself) had more screen time. If the film had devoted more expansion of those unique figures and less on other newly introduced ones, the film would have been all the more memorable. (Personally, the two highlights for me were not the many chase sequences, though they are so well edited and excitingly staged. No, it was the quieter ones that involved Baby Jack Jack and a feisty raccoon and a truly comic scene with Miss Edna, of course!)<br/><br/>Just as the colorful animation is outstanding, so is the voiceover work. Special kudos go out to to Mr. Nelson, Ms. Hunter, Mr. Banks, and the director for their vocal skills. All of the actors do a tremendous job of imbuing the characters so well, Particularly impressive is Mr. Nelson's sleep-deprived fatherly tirade moment which is a perfect blending of voice and animation.<br/><br/>Always highly entertaining, Incredibles 2 is a worthy successor in the series. It is a movie filled with much whimsy and one can only delight at all the mischief and antics on display and be in constant awe of the artistic talent emanating from Mr. Bird and the Pixar Studios.<br/><br/>NOTE: On a deeper level, this family film says a great deal about our polarized nation and I wouldn't be surprised if there is a conservative outcry about Hollywood's bias and that darn liberal agenda. But putting that bi-partisanship aside, the movie proudly celebrates the importance of family and the need to accept our differences and our individual multicultural talents. Politically speaking, the film's subtle message of unity is so apropos in these troubling times when we can use a courageous superhero (or ethical lawmaker) to change our world and speak out against injustice."
"bankofmarquis","8","1","3","20 June 2018"," Not just a good ""kids"" movie, but a good ""movie"" movie...
","INCREDIBLES 2 is one of the best movies that has been released, thus far, in 2018.<br/><br/>Now...there is some debate as to whether that is praise of this film, or a damnation of the lackluster year (thus far) in film.<br/><br/>But...let's start with praising this film. Coming into Cinemas 14 years after the original film, this sequel picks up the story where the first INCREDIBLES film left off (the beauty of cartoon films - the actors don't age) and starts right off with a fun action sequence that, then, sets up the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Brad Bird (THE IRON GIANT) returns as the Director and Writer of this film (he also wrote and directed the first Incredibles film) and his deft touch shows through usage of humor, character, plot and action - all nicely blended to keep the film rolling along. He also was able to get wonderful performances from his talented voice cast.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter and Craig T. Nelson reprise their roles as ""Mr & Mrs. Incredible"" and hearing them banter back and forth - and seeing these two characters back on the screen - was like pulling on a pair of comfortable shoes. It was good to see/hear them again. Samuel L. Jackson is perfectly cast as their best friend/Allie Frozone and Brad Bird himself is wonderfully funny as Edna. Joining these two is Bob Odekenirk and Katherine Keener as brother and sister Winston and Evelyn Deavor - the duo that hires the Incredibles. Both are terrifically talented character performers and slid right into the swing of things here. Eli Fucile continues the ""baby-talk"" of Jack-Jack Incredible and Huck Milner takes over the role of Dash Incredible - both are good.<br/><br/>But it is the work of Sarah Vowell as angsty teen Violet Incredible that stood out for me. I had no idea who performed this character - and had vague recollections of Violet from the first film - but she is front and center and was so extremely entertainingly real as the teenage daughter that I had to look up who is the voice. To my surprise, this teenager was voiced (yet, again) by a now almost 50 year old radio journalist, critic, reporter and editor (best know for her work on NPR's THIS AMERICAN LIFE). I had no clue that I wasn't listening to a teenage girl - she is that good, and that believable. And I should know, I HAVE a teenage daughter!<br/><br/>While the first INCREDIBLES is my #1 Pixar film, I'll have to sit on this one for awhile to see where this one lands - pretty high up the list, I'm sure. I could quibble on a few things - the motivations of the ""bad guy"" is paper thin and the humor relies just a bit too much on the Jack-Jack character, but all-in-all this is a top notch Pixar film - and a top notch SuperHero film. Proving that a good Pixar movie isn't just a good ""kid"" movie, but a good ""movie"" movie as well.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars - and you take that to the BankofMarquis"
"Uwontlikemyopinion","6","1","3","20 June 2018"," A Crowd-Pleasing Sequel
","The Parr family battle the Underminer which leads to significant damage to the city. A government official confines them to motel for two weeks. During this time, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl meet Winston Deavor, a businessman who wants the criminalization of superheroes to be eradicated. He and his sister Evelyn devise a plan to promote Elastigirl as a lovable superhero. As Elastigirl fights crime, Mr. Incredible takes care of the family at home and learns about the struggle of domestic life.<br/><br/>A fourteen-year old sequel long overdue accomplishes some fantastic action scenes that should please audience members. In fact, Incredibles 2 is pure family entertainment and that elicited strong laughter from the audience in the movie theater. The film's animation is superior (the textures in the film are mind-blowing and makes the animation from the original Incredibles seem dated). The narrative is well-structured although I wish Elastigirl's story had a better throughline and Mr. Incredible's story had better motivation and plot for his children. Basically, while the first Incredibles felt ground-breaking, Incredibles 2 feels diluted.<br/><br/>Mainly, the film appears diluted because the children (Violet and Dash) have no motivation (Dash is a rumbustious child from beginning to end) or depend on weak subplots (Violet has a crush at school and Dash has problems learning math). The main culprit seems to be that the novelty is gone. If Dash and Violet were older then the film could create new and meaningful motivations for these characters. Jack-Jack is overused for jokes, but nobody complained in the audience (that's a me problem, rather than a major complaint about the film). The themes range from marriage equality, female empowerment, over-reliance on technology, and many more that I'm forgetting. While the themes are strong, there's nothing fresh or original about them. Finally, the villain is obvious which makes the film predictable and overlong. Incredibles 2 contains rousing sequences of action and explores the domestic life with laughter and warmth, just don't expect a film as ground-breaking as the first Incredibles."

It'll be Pixar box office champ for awhile until next summer when that 4th movie about toys comes out... but that's a different story."

","REVIEW - THE INCREDIBLES 2<br/><br/>Stand back superman, iceman, spiderman, batman and robin too because elastagirl is coming for you! <br/><br/>Yes the long awaited sequel to The Incredibles is due out on 13 July and yes your reading this correctly I'm going to do the review!!!<br/><br/>The sequel starts where the first film finished, good move by Disney and Pixar there, as it has been so long since the original they can get the young audiences watching both films. <br/><br/>I've got to be honest, I'm not really a huge fan of animated films but I do remember watching the original, where supers were outlawed and our family had to save the world in secret, that was of course until The Underminer turned up. <br/><br/>The sequel finally sees elastagirl come to the forefront with Mr Incredible taking the back seat to be a stay at home father looking after baby Jack. Don't worry I'm not going to give anything away. <br/><br/>The whole film works well, with the role reversal ensuring that the simple message that women are just as good as men at going to work and men can be equally as good staying at home and raising the kids. <br/><br/>Of course all of the usual characters are back in the sequel with the added bonus of more supers thrown in for good measure. <br/><br/>Kids will of course love this but be warned......<br/><br/>WARNING 
There are a number of sequences with flashing / flickering screens so if you or your children have Photo Sensitivity these may cause a seizure. <br/><br/>Basically a jolly, kid friendly, family flick that they will enjoy with a few adult in jokes to make you smile, bribing the baby to behave with sweets for example (we've all done it).<br/><br/>The problem is that even though it has been many years since the original, the sequel isn't as good as the original, but for the young ones who will be new to the original and this sequel they will love both. <br/><br/>Basically, if you saw the original this just isn't as good, if you didn't see the original you'll love both. <br/><br/>Go see, great family fun but please be warned, if you do experience Photo Sensitivity please be careful. <br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10"
"capaldimark","8","1","3","18 June 2018"," A funny and charming superhero sequel that doesn't quite reach the level of the original
","Back in 2004, Disney Pixar released ""The Incredibles"", an animated movie about a family of superheroes. It was something we've never seen before, and it felt fresh, and as a result, the movie became a huge hit both critically and financially. Fast forward 14 years, and we have the sequel, titled ""Incredibles 2"", with Brad Bird returning to direct and write. The end result here is a fun-filled sequel that doesn't quite reach the level of its predecessor, but is good enough to rank as one of Pixar's better movies of recent years.<br/><br/>The story follows the Parr family shortly after defeating the villain ""Syndrome"" in the first movie. After their unsuccessful attempt to stop a bank robbery and causing extreme damage throughout the city, the government decides to outlaw superheroes, which forces the Parr family to go into hiding until they, along with Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), are confronted by Winston Deavor (Bob Odenkirk), the head of DEVTECH, and his sister, Evelyn (Catherine Keener), who plan to use Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), under her old identity as Elastigirl, to fight crime and re-gain public support of superheroes. All this results in Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) becoming a stay at home dad, taking care of Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner), and baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). It's a more complex plot than the first movie, but the problem is that it ends up being a bit too familiar. I commend Bird for trying to make the story more complex, but the narrative of whether superheroes should be legal or not is something that has been done many times before in the superhero genre and at this point it's starting to feel a bit redundant. Because of the various things going on in the story, the movie tends to drag, especially during the second act when we spend a lot of time watching Mr. Incredible struggle with the responsibilities of being a dad. It's certainly nice to get a change of pace from the action scenes, but there was too much of it and not enough of those spectacular animated action scenes that made the first Incredibles so enjoyable.<br/><br/>The Incredibles 2 ultimately shines when it comes to its characters, humor and animation. Most of the cast from the first Incredibles were able to reprise their roles, except for the voice of Dash, whose voiced changed in between these 14 years. Huck Milner replaces him just fine and performs well. Each character gets their time to shine throughout the movie, whether it's through cool action scenes or witty dialogue, reminding us why we got so attached to these characters 14 years ago. Pixar's signature beautiful animation enhances this. The animation looks almost identical to the first Incredibles, and it looks great. Typically companies try to change the animation to create a more modern, stylized look, but Pixar smartly stuck to what worked 14 years ago. <br/><br/>Bird's reason for taking so long to make this sequel was because he wanted to craft his own original superhero story while avoiding the typical superhero tropes that are present in TV shows and movies nowadays. While I commend him for his effort, his vision never fully comes together like I hoped it would. Nevertheless, Incredibles 2 is a funny, charming adventure that gets enough right to make this yet another Pixar success."

I was hoping I wouldn't be able to figure it out as quick as I did but other than that, there is no reason why anyone should avoid this film or view it as a disappointment for it's definitely worth the wait! Also FINALLY!! A film that doesn't revolve around a weapon to make the villain superior to rule all THANK YOU!!!!!!"
"natalicoetzee","8","1","3","18 June 2018"," Not as expected, but very good.
","I enjoyed the movie, but thought some of the scenes might not be for younger viewers. There's a lot of conflict and rebellion between the kids and especially the Dad, that doesn't get resolved. It is also evident that the Mom and Dad are going through their own issues - it is sad though, that Mom is painted in a light where she doesn't need her husband. (Too egotistical in comparison with the first movie.)<br/><br/>But if you can look past that, there are a couple of great laughs in the movie. I enjoyed some of the new characters and their stories. Some of the characters were really well depicted, and I loved seeing and discovery who they are.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was very good. The animation was amazing, voices were good, and the little details were brilliant. Will definitely watch it again!"
"elicopperman","8","1","3","18 June 2018"," After 14 Years, it's a Worthwhile View
","After 14 years of waiting, the long awaited sequel to The Incredibles has finally hit theaters nationwide. The main reason it came out much later than expected is mainly due to director Brad Bird and the Pixar team not really knowing the proper continuing story until later on. So now that it's officially out, while I don't put it nearly on the same level as the first film, I was quite satisfied with what we ended up getting nonetheless.<br/><br/>Set immediately after the events of its predecessor, the story of Incredibles 2 centers around two particular plots: Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl) taking on superhero action undercover while Bob Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) watches over the family. Both plots work quite well in continuing the Parr's arches in attempting to return as superheroes. Rather than being a simple case of role reversal, the main plot further stretches the elastic heroine to gain more momentum, especially with her main goal being to catch the menacing Screenslayer. As for Bob's arch, he develops as both a father and role model by watching over the kids, while discovering more to his and their individual personalities. With baby Jack-Jack's powers going all over the place, this creates many fun sequences of his various abilities that later attribute more to the story as it progresses. Even Violet's arch consisting of boy troubles helps expand her character and to teach Mr. Incredible something new about her.<br/><br/>The first film's thematic elements of brilliant people not to be forced to conform to societal norms continues here, especially with telecommunications tycoon Winston Deavor trying to bring supers back in the spotlight again. In addition, there's some neat commentary on Elastigirl being seen by herself as the current face of superheroes. The only main issue with the story is how some of the first film's story beats are reused, I mean does Elastigirl fighting crime to support the family remind you of anything? Also, despite being threatening, let's just say that the new villain Screenslayer isn't quite as memorable as Syndrome in The Incredibles, with a reveal that might be more predictable than assumed. Thankfully, most call-backs are very far and few in between, as Brad Bird presents new ideas that we never saw him unfold before. <br/><br/>As for the new characters, they range from humorous enough to rather iffy. The most prominent ones featured have to be the Deavors, with the aforementioned Winston being a very competent businessman who desires returning supers to their formal glory along with his technological genius sister Evelyn who always fixes a dilemma when needed. The new supers that come by mainly stick out from their designs and distinct abilities, although Void does come off as a rather awkward fan of Elastigirl. While they don't become very intriguing until later on, which I certainly can't go into without spoiling much, the rest of the family still showcase their memorable love for each other and their individual powers.<br/><br/>With a 14 year time span, it's no wonder the animation got a significant upgrade compared to its predecessor. For one thing, not only did the characters get a significant redesign, but there is much detail displayed on their bodies and clothes to make them look more polished. Also, the set-pieces take full advantage of the battles the Incredibles' and other supers get into, complete with much more varieties of extravagant powers. The action sequences display even more wonderful and smooth choreography, particularly when it comes to Elastigirl showcasing her rubbery limbs. The real scene stealer has to be the multiple powers that Jack-Jack creates, as they astonish the viewers as much as make them chuckle. Similar to the first film, the modernist 1960s influenced production design adds much visual flavour to Incredibles 2 to help it stand out. While many modern animated films keep moving forward, it's great that films like these go for the old-school touch.<br/><br/>With the exception of their upgrade in computer graphics after 14 years, the Incredibles family are still back in action after so long. While it has its similarities to its predecessor and not all the characters are all that great, the spirit and thematic qualities that characterized the first film still remain present, complete with the lovely family of before growing and the animation and action scenes looking better than ever. If you're a fan of the first film or Pixar in general, I highly recommend viewing this worthy entertainment that packs enough thrills and character development for the whole family. At the end of the day, I can officially say that I am satisfied after the 14 year wait for this film, and it will definitely remain a stand out family film like its predecessor, even if I still prefer that more."
"kronicton","8","1","3","17 June 2018"," Great Movie, But Flawed (Epilepsy Warning)
","While the movie for the most part was a very enjoyable, captivating experience, there are points that should be noted.<br/><br/>To start, I need to let you all know that this movie is NOT PERFECT by any means, so don't give in to the hype train. But that being said, this movie is very enjoyable with great action and humor stitched in to the plot, which I will discuss more of later. I really enjoyed the animation, as it stays true to the original, providing a rush of nostalgia that lasts throughout the movie. The virtual camerawork (yes, the animators at Pixar program in virtual cameras into 3D environments) is done very well, like in all of Pixar's movies. I really enjoyed the attention to detail in this movie, which is another thing that Pixar excels at (opposed to other studios for animated movies such as Dreamworks).<br/><br/>Now, about the plot. For many of this film's harsh critics, this is a breaking point, but I choose to see both perspectives of this plot, the syncophant and the critic.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>This plot contains a lot of satire for a movie marketed towards children. This satire is mostly directed toward the addiction to screens and the everything that's going on with the media. Very many parallels can be made from this movie to the present state of the world, and the movie leaves heavily analyzing viewers hopeful by the message of overcoming all of this.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the chemistry between the characters is very relatable, and sometimes so much so that it becomes intentionally cringe-inducing and uncomfortable because this animated movie becomes too real.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Some of the plot is very predictable. I watched this movie with my family and about thirty minutes in, we could guess what would happen an hour later. Some of the plot also seems a bit recycled from the original movie, but fourteen years later, it still feels fresh enough to pass off for most viewers. This isn't really part of the plot, but it needs to be mentioned that after fourteen years, the voice actors have aged, and so have their voices. This is most easily noticed with Elastigirl, who now has a lisp.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I would recommend this movie, especially to families and English majors."
"mik_mik_90","9","1","3","16 June 2018"," An Incredibly 14 Long Years of Waiting for Incredibles 2
","The Incredibles is definitely one of my favorite Disney/Pixar movies. The first movie came out 14 years ago and 14 years ago I was still in my first year of high school and watched it more than I can count and I've wanted so much more of it. Over the years I was hoping that they would make the second movie already since other Disney/Pixar movies such as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. already got either their sequels or prequel. And I thought that it was unfair that studio still has no plans for a second installment of The Incredibles, until 2014 when it was announced that The Incredibles 2 is in works. I was excited about the second movie but another 4 years of waiting is just a lot of time...and so I waited...<br/><br/>Now that I watched The Incredibles 2, Disney and Pixar should announce the part 3 already and I don't want it in the next 14 years, I want it next year. I even got goosebumps (I know!) in the first part of the film picking up exactly as to where the first movie left, and it made me feel as if it was like yesterday. It brings back so many good memories of my life back when I was 14 years younger and damn it made me feel older. <br/><br/>As for the story, I think that The Incredible 2 focuses more on the characters and fleshing them out in a way that we have not seen in the first movie such as Jack-Jack which is a delight to watch and Frozone with his relationship with the Parr family. They also included a bunch of new characters both supers and humans. Surprisingly though, Mr. Incredible was left out of action and stayed home to take care of the kids but what made me realize is that this movie is a perfect film to watch on Fathers Day. Mr. Incredibles relationship with the kids, especially with Violet's boy problem and Dash's math homework, made me appreciate him even more as a character and as a father. So, I thought it was an odd choice at first to release The Incredibles 2 in June but now that I saw the movie I think it was a great move because of Fathers Day especially now that some of those kids who saw the first film 14 years ago could be/or a father now. Too bad though that they did not use it in their marketing strategy or maybe I was not just paying attention. <br/><br/>As for Elastigirl, I was skeptical at first when I saw the trailer and that they just basically move the spotlight from Mr. Incredible to Elastigirl. And that Disney/Pixar are just riding the badass woman bandwagon that we have in movies, tv, and books these days. I'm not against it but I think that it is important that these characters were not there because they're a woman, or because they're sexy, or because it's a trend but I think it should be more than that, they should also possess certain qualities of what it takes to be a hero or give them some ideology, a push and a reason as to why we're having these stories in the first place. And to be fair with Elastigirl though, I think that it totally made sense as to why she was put on the spotlight, she has the least collateral damage to make than Frozone and Mr. Incredible when fighting a crime, and that either her or Mr. Incredible needed a job in order to get out of the motel that their family are staying. <br/><br/>The movie also has some great visual action scenes. I was never a fan of Mr. Fantistic from Fantastic 4 but I think it was a missed opportunity for previous Fantastic 4 movies to showcase such great power set on screen because of Elastigirl is really rocking it and made me change my mind about elasticity as an awesome superpower to have. She was a fusion of Mr. Fantastic and Spiderman and it was really amazing to see her on screen swinging on buildings fighting crimes and chasing the Screenslaver. <br/><br/>Overall, It was really a fun movie! I just think that when you watch too much Disney/Pixar movies you'll kinda predict what's going to happen but still, 14 years of waiting was worth it. I am excited to watch this movie again and again."
"claytonmingalls","7","1","3","16 June 2018"," Incredibles 2 doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor, but it's still a good time.
","Finally after the 14 year wait, Incredibles 2 is here. So was it worth the wait? Yeah kinda.
[Yes I am going to get very critical with this movie even though it is technically a children's animated movie
Firstly, the most fine tuned aspect of this movie are the visual. The camera movement, lighting, animation etc. are all absolutely phenomenal. Only complaints are that some of the new superheroes have some odd character designs and some of the models are not always consistent with the previous Incredibles style. The complaints here are minor.
The weakest part of the movie to me was its story. I found it to be predictable and almost nonsensical at times. The villain is extremely weak and does not hold a very well thought out motivation. The ""twist"" in this movie is highly predictable (at least if you are over the age of 7 or 8.) The stronger parts of the story are the ones with Bob taking care of the family. Elastagirl's adventures are interesting and exciting enough to move forward the plot, but I can't help but think that it all could've been more captivating. Syndrome from the first Incredibles was such a great villain with a very direct motivation and reasoning for why his character felt the way he did. I did not get this with Incredibles 2. I definitely can't say that I was ever bored. There was always something entertaining enough with the cast of characters occurring on screen to where I was enjoying it. The humor was pretty good, there were a few parts here and there were it started to get very ridiculous but overall it was very fun and some parts had me and my friends giggling pretty loud. 
That being said though, I would not consider the writing in Incredibles 2 to be nearly as good as the first. There were many pieces of dialogue that just felt ham-fisted (mostly involving Elastagirl's side of the plot.) The best bits of humor and writing come from Bob hopelessly trying to be an active father. Not saying its bad writing, but it definitely could've been better.
This movie had a lot to live up to, and for the most part it does an adequate job. It's not amazing but it is still an overall great time and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. I think it would also be safe to say that"

If it's not a rude joke on the actress for her inability to speak clearly and not annoyingly, I don't know why this scene is even there.

"geno-young","5","1","4","26 March 2020"," Lazy, Feminist, Virtue Signaling and Unoriginal.
","Seriously? I waited 16 years (I just saw it for the first time today) for this? The ONLY reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because of the animation, humor, charm and fast-paced story telling. That's it. This was nothing more than another preachy, far-left piece of feminist propaganda that fits into the virtue signaling politically correct culture that has a strangle-hold on our media and society right now. I'm all for equality, but when you shamelessly pander to a specific group of people (women) and emasculate the other group (men) just to further the social standing of the group that you feel has been marginalized (women), you totally defeat the purpose of your mission. If equality is what you are seeking, let the marginalized party gain that respect on their own merit. I believe that it does women a great disservice for these movie studios and the media to thrust them into the spotlight for the sole purpose of making them look superior. That in itself defeats the purpose. Enough with the virtue signaling from Hollywood, let women be strong side by side with men, for THAT is equality. One can not be better than the other. This movie clearly pushes an agenda, and makes men out to be mindless, bumbling buffoons while the women run the world and are the masterminds behind it all. The only male with a SHRED of common sense is Dash and THAT'S REALLY saying something! The whole premise, in fact, is that Mr. Incredible is so bumbling and heavy-handed, that Elastigirl has to hold up the torch while he stays at home with the kids; leading to disastrous results . You get it? Classic feminist role reversal.<br/><br/>Make no mistake whatsoever, this film was a deliberate cog in the master plan of blurring the lines between what it means to be male or female. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last 4 years, it's been blatantly obvious that there is a serious war against masculinity occurring in our society right now; and this film plays on that and is nothing more than propaganda advocating for it. The film rambles on with little substance or originally and ultimately leads to nowhere. There's no climactic build up, plot twist or shocking reveals. Just a disgruntled woman at the center of it all. And that's it. Pair that with Violet's bumbling obsession with Tony, and Mr. Incredible trying to learn ""New Math"" and you've got the whole film in a nutshell. I didn't wait darn near 20 years for this! The film is entertaining and the characters are likable, but the subliminal and often OBVIOUS messages and themes throughout make this film such a disappointment. The original appealed to EVERYONE, but this one clearly is geared towards a certain group. There are moments in the film when you don't know if you're watching ""The Incredibles"" or ""The Princess Diaries!"" Yes, the feminist undertones are just THAT loud and clear. I know in our current political climate EVERYONE is a 5¢ advocate/activist but this is just pathetic. You can't even escape in a CHILDREN'S movie! Get back to making classics Disney, and leave the politics to the experts. A disappointment."
"gkgkoenig","5","1","4","18 February 2019"," What a disappointment
","Too much explanative dialog. Too much ""growth"" and family dynamics. Too much hand-to-hand combat and violence for my taste - especially by the kids.

Elastagirl can take a hike, as far as I'm concerned. TOO LITTLE Edna! Fortunately her character and part in the movie resembled the first. Jack-Jack featured too strongly.

","Still acceptable and watchable, but the ""victimhood identity group"" is getting to be a VERY old message popping up to ""Kathleen Kennedy"" a lot of films.<br/><br/>I didn't find it nearly as painful to watch as say, the latest Star Wars, the unequal treatment of the characters was evident. The lead female roles (Helen, Violet) conintued to developed, but the lead male roles were all stuck spinning their wheels.<br/><br/>I'm not adverse to a strong female role or a female villain (which are some of cinematic history's best villains!). But just reversing gender roles doesn't fly any better than in GhostBusters II.<br/><br/>Incredibles II ran well when ""oppression group"" dynamic was kept to a low rumble. But when it popped up with a vengeance at the end, the flow seemed rushed and disjointed, and this led to the ending manifesting as too contrived for my liking.<br/><br/>Still a good watch if you can overlook the flow of the ending. It was really nice to see Etna back again. If there's an Incredibles III it would be nice to see her play a larger supporting role, and to see the identity politics sidelined.
Women can be strong . . . without forcing an almost total role-reversal."

"southdavid","6","1","4","16 August 2018"," Not so much a sequel as a remix.
","For whatever reason, I haven't really revisited the first ""Incredibles"" film since the first time I saw it. I didn't dislike it, but I also haven't felt the need to watch it again since. Having seen ""Incredibles 2"", to be honest I largely feel the same way. <br/><br/>In a plot that's overall pretty similar to the first one, this time Holly Hunter's Elastigirl goes back to work as a ""super"" leaving Craig T Nelson's Mr Incredible at home to look after their three kids. The return is inspired by brother and sister combination Winston and Evelyn Deavor (Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener) who are attempting to reverse the laws prohibiting superhero activity. Their plans are thrown into chaos though when a new villain ""Screenslaver"" makes their presence and their mind control abilities known. <br/><br/>Predictability and repetition is what really does for ""Incredibles 2"" for me. The villain reveal at the end is pretty easy to see coming but it's the repeated plot points and scenes from the first film that lost me, the kids saving the day again, another visit to Edna Mode - it's pretty much the same film as the original. That's is not to say that it doesn't look great, it does - particularly in some amazing portal work when the character of Voyd. The Vocal work is good too, though nobody is particularly outstanding.<br/><br/>It passed a couple of hours in a reasonably entertaining fashion, but it'll be a long time before I decide to watch it again."

"mtrburrows","8","1","4","4 August 2018"," Better than the Avengers?
","Featuring better action than most superhero movies these days, and just being a thrill ride from start to finish, the Incredibles 2 is worthy of its spot in today's wave of comic book action movies, with likeable, grounded characters (apart from Bob, who comes across selfish and unlikeable for a large chunk of the film, but is redeemed by the final act), who all get their moments, with frozone and elastigirl being the standouts this time. <br/><br/>The villain plot can be picked apart with a crowbar, from the motivations, to the whole first half on their plan being completely pointless. However, they do their job in getting the characters to a thrilling climax that puts most live action action sequences to shame, so the villain plot can be seen as a necessary sacrifice.<br/><br/>Overall, the Incredibles 2 is a fun, light hearted roller coaster and a nice refresher in the comic book genre!"

"evanston_dad","7","1","4","24 July 2018"," Father Doesn't Always Know Best
","It was probably inevitable given the wait that Pixar put us through for this sequel to its 2004 masterpiece that expectations would be somewhat disappointed. ""Incredibles 2,"" while a lot of fun, never reaches the dizzying snap of the original and it didn't leave me panting for a third installment in the series.<br/><br/>This time around, the focus shifts to Elastigirl and the business proposal offered her by a brother/sister team to use her celebrity as a way to bring superheroes out of hiding and back into the mainstream. This means that Mr. Incredible gets left at home with the kids and his feeling of inadequacy at being overshadowed by his wife. In this current climate of extreme ""wokeness,"" the screenplay could have done a lot with this idea of threatened middle-class white male masculinity, but it instead decides to take the predictable and rather tired route of showing how hard it is to be a stay-at-home parent. Is there really a lot more humor to be wrung from the premise that 1950s dads had no idea how to run a household?<br/><br/>The plot involving Elastigirl, meanwhile, thickens, as such plots do, but not in the most compelling of ways. The villain of the film is weak and uninspired, and the plot becomes muddled and messy by the film's end. When the movie was over I found myself wishing it had just been about the Parrs fighting the Underminer rather than any of the things the movie was actually about.<br/><br/>The best part of the film, and the one that I think has the most room for exploration if Pixar decides to make more sequels, was watching Dash and Violet begin their growth into independent superheros in their own right. That's what the third film should be about, if there is one.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

"jetlu","6","1","4","6 July 2018"," Thia movie doesn't need to exist
","The first Incredibles, is a great film, it tells a story about cop with society, struggle and learn to trust you family, Truly hide under the mask, everything in this movie is about that, and that is why the first incredibles is one of the best Pixar film.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about this new one, incredibles 2. It is decent, not bad, but there are so many problems. 
First, the animation in this movie as you expect from Pixar is incredible, in the movie elastic girl is their best choice for the mission, it's actually because they can anime her in really creative ways, the chase scene is so good, that you can't believe what you're looking at. It is so creative and fun! Hats off to you Pixar, but just for these scene.<br/><br/>But here comes the complain, I feel like this movie is totally unnecessary, it really doesn't need to exist. The movie immediately took place after where the first movie left off. The first movie is about trusting your family and cop with society, but for some reason, the incredibles are facing the same problems, mom won't let her children use their powers, just like the first one! They completely using the same morals from the last movie! The scene where the husband and wife were fighting about should their kids use their powers, I was like, did thy had the same problem in the first movie, also during dinner? And when they choose elastic girl for the mission and the husband have to suck it up and not use his powers, did he had the same problem in the last movie? He wants to use his power but he haves to work to support his family. It's the same stuff! The family are facing the same problems, then what is the point of this movie? It didn't bring anything new! But some people will say, the story is totally different, they are fighting a different villain, ok, here is my next point.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a story. Most of the characters are just their have nothing to do with the story. The main story is they fight against the screen slaver, and the subplot is the husband taking care of the children's, but what ever happened in the subplot really doesn't affect the main story, everything is just there, especially jack jack and dash. I will talk about dash fist, he is just there so the husband can learn math, he really doesn't have a story line, the only story line is he play around with his dad's car, but it is so short you really can't call that a story line, and the rest of the movie is just their, he don't need any character development because the first movie already did it, we really didn't see him using his powers in this movie which is a shame, in the last movie, his escape scene from the soldiers is one of coolest scenes in the movie. 
Now back to jack jack. Through out the entire movie I thought this little baby is going to be the one who turns the table around during the final battle, but it didn't, the movie spend so much time showing us what jack jack can do, I do admit the scene is very cool, but at the end it doesn't serve any purpose! He is there just to be cute, and I really don't like babies. All the scenes with him are just cute, it doesn't change the story at all! When he is causing trouble on the ship, at the end nothing really happens, all the trouble and damage he makes nothing happens. Best example I can think of is Guardians of the galaxy 2, when baby griot is planting the bomb, he is acting ignorant about the bomb, so when he is at the heart, there are stakes, you're worried if he is going to push the wrong button, he actually have an affect on the story, but jack jack, he is just their to be cute, so Disney can sell toys.<br/><br/>The last movie, the spot light is on Mr. incredible, because he screwed up and put his family in danger. But in this one, elastic girl and Mr. incredible basically have the same amount of screen time, so there is no focus. The script is just really weak, the reason this movie can success is all because of the hype and animation.<br/><br/>I will give this movie a 5.7/10, on IMDB I will rate a 6/10."

","This must be quite a belated sequel and I saw it because I remember really liking the first film, whenever it was released, even though I went into that not having any great expectations for it, seeing as I took it be a ""children's film"". Even though I remember very little of that first film, due to having only seen it during its original cinema release, I would say that I found it very entertaining and probably quite funny. If I had been scoring films here back then, I would guess that it might have gotten a score of around at least 80%, if not 90%.<br/><br/> Perhaps due to the sequel seeming to be of a different nature to the original, my score might be quite harsh. I was planning on scoring it at a perhaps generous 60%, but have bumped up my score. If you're expecting a film pitched at a young audience, you might also be similarly harsh in your views on this film, but if you view it from the perspective of being like an animated Marvel or X-Men film, you might fare better. Humour isn't really this sequel's thing though, as I did find it quite ""serious"".<br/><br/> Anyway, the plot concerns ""The Incredibles"" family, a family of superheroes, living in a world where superheroes are now criminalised. A technology tycoon gives the family an opportunity to try and overturn these laws through public relations. Some of the themes raised in this film include the notion of ""just"" and ""unjust"" laws, as well as what it is right to do in the case of the latter. The notion of pop culture as reducing the experience of humanity is also touched upon, briefly. Perhaps you could also interpret the film as dealing with post-11/09/2001 issues as well. <br/><br/> As I say, the film doesn't seem pitched at a young audience and it probably isn't suited to children who aren't mature. There's scenes of destruction, not too far removed from visions of September 11, 2001, especially early on. Death is alluded to as well and in a sign of the film's ""mature"" orientation, Mr. and Mrs. Incredible have marital tensions to deal with, such as how gender roles define them, for better or for worse.<br/><br/> I saw the film in 2D and I'm not sure how worthwhile it would be to see the film in 3D. It did occur to me watching the end credits that the film may have been released in 3D, and later end credits did confirm to me that that was indeed the case.<br/><br/> Visually, the film does dabble in realism, as far as outdoor scenes go, with the human characters usually looking caricatured, although occasionally realistic.<br/><br/> Even though I didn't find the film particularly funny, I'd say that it was funnier than ""Avengers: Infinity war"" (which isn't saying much...at all). Like I say, I see this film as more akin to an animated Avengers or X-Men film...but probably better than most of those. I'd be curious to see the first Incredibles film again, to see if it was quite funny and more entertaining (as opposed to ""serious"", like its sequel).<br/><br/>Random observations:<br/><br/>* Musically, there seems to be some nods and winks to the James Bond films and the film ""Shaft"".<br/><br/>* Maybe the music and perhaps the end credits as well have a touch of 1960s and 1970s era films to them, including the visual style of the end credits."

"virzana_virzana","10","1","4","19 June 2018"," A clever, must-watch summer-movie
","I just saw it and it's impressive. A crispy film, yet soft on the inside, it could be slapstick and heart-warming at the same time. If not, it did really take the superhero trend to the next level. If compared with Avengers or other animation, it really is incredible. <br/><br/>This movie somewhat reminds me of Captain America: Civil War, but between Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible. The script matured more than average superhero (e.g. Civil War) movie, despite being family movie, which is mostly watched by kids. How Elastigirl worried about people lives and trying to save them with minimal risks is the proof of how mature and how realistic the script was. Even I love the vocal quality of Elastigirl, it was raspy, hoarse, and deep. The vocal quality stressed girls aren't weak and can do what man can. The theme song was also enganging, as Disney always done. The reminisence of Donald Trump was funny in spite of that was a serious issues.<br/><br/>The technicality was excellent. I love how the panning in the early scene seems to 'blur' the view and make it more realistic. The sound effect was surrounding and the scoring was very fitting also add up the thrilling seasoning of the fight scene.<br/><br/>The pattern of Disney movies are guessable and always the same. But guess what, it never gets old. I knew from the start that who is the culprit. Who doesn't know? I mean Disney always do it right? Doctor Callaghan, Charles Muntz, Ernesto de la Cruz? The 'good guy' always turns out to be the 'bad guy' And my friend, that is exactly the power of Disney that always entertain us even with the same pattern all over and over.<br/><br/>You should watch this, no matter how old you are. Bring yor kids too. If they're girls, it will raise their moral about how girl can do anything too, but not radically as radical feminist. If they're boys, they will learn about appreciating their mom or appreciating your wife. And you adult, it'll teach you to prioritize otherselves before you, and push back your ego for a greater good.<br/><br/>In the end as Disney always told us, family comes first."
"Scarefish","6","1","4","18 June 2018"," The Credibles
","All in all, The Incredibles 2 isn't a bad movie, but compared to the original it is unexceptional in every aspect. The original felt like it was constantly taking big risks and trying ambitious and interesting scenes throughout it, and as a result the final product was one of the most fun and engaging family films of all time. The sequel on the other hand felt safe, generic, and surprisingly boring. The plot made sense, but it simply wasn't incredible by any means, choosing instead to be mostly a slice of life film, and the drama is pulled from X-Men, going for politics and oppression, but it's more of a distraction than anything else.<br/><br/>The main cast was fine with a few nitpicks to make here and there, though none of the out-of-character moments were significant enough to pull me out of the film. The gimmick with this film is that it's essentially a flip of the first film with Elastigirl in Mr. Incredible's place while Mr. Incredible stays home and takes care of the kids. Oddly enough, the most interesting scenes were the ones in which Mr. Incredible is interacting with the rest of the family, despite how boring that might sound for a superhero film, but at least such scenes have charm to them. Mr. Incredible's jealousy was a bit overdone, however it wasn't long-lived enough to become obnoxious. The voice acting was great, aside from Holly Hunter, as her voice was much more whistly than it was 14 years ago, as well as her accent becoming a tad more Sean Connery-y.<br/><br/>The plot is very basic. It's odd that it's being sold as this big thing that took 14 years to make when obviously they were working on other things instead while this sequel was on the backburner. If you ever expect the movie to go in a certain way, you'll be absolutely correct. It might be one of the most predictable films of all time. There's also the issue of repetition, as every action scene basically boils down to ""big vehicle will cause mass destruction if we don't shut it down in time,"" first with the Underminer, then with the runaway train, and the cruise ship at the climax. Elastigirl is the hero for most of the film until at the end they have to learn to work together and put their powers to use to defeat a greater enemy, just like in the first film. It is especially frustrating when the kids point this out to her at the very start of the film, especially since this film takes place only three months after the previous film, and she refuses to listen to them until the end.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty decent and the film has a decent charm to it even during its worst moments. One of the major detriments is that a lot of the humor is safe and predictably effective, such as Jack-Jack doing dumb baby things throughout. Sure, seeing him fighting a raccoon is very entertaining, as is the interdimensional stuff, but it's ultimately used as a replacement for writing an intriguing story.<br/><br/>The villain, Screenslaver, was not great in my opinion. She pales greatly in comparison to Syndrome from the first film, who might be one of the greatest villains of all time. Screenslaver's motivation feels incredibly weak, especially since she's directly contrasted by her brother who went through exactly the same loss as she did, except he had a rational reaction to the situation. She also helps Elastigirl in legalizing superheroes at first so she can flip it and the idea is that reillegalizing superheroes will make it so they stay illegal forever, but it just seems incredibly stupid how she's hoist with her own petard.<br/><br/>The feminist angle didn't feel like much of a thing in this film really, despite what the Buzzfeed copycats report. I'm sure it will be obnoxious to many others, but it felt subtle enough to be natural in the context of the film, which is rare in current year. but If anything, the villain Screenslaver is a bit feminist, though since she's the main villain, it's hardly an empowering role. Void is kind of SJW-ish I suppose, but she's got a few minutes of screen time, so whatever.<br/><br/>I also felt there was a serious pacing issue throughout this film. I would never have expected this film to be nearly as boring as it was, but it was actually mindnumbing when I realized I was watching the fifth scene in a row with zero action. None of the talkshow stuff interested me, as the side characters were just one-dimensional garbage, even if that was intended to be satire on dumb hosts, but all of the new characters that Elastigirl interacts with kind of suck. The only one who's developed is Screenslaver, and she's horrifically stereotypical, thus their conversations are dull.<br/><br/>The special effects are beautiful, as one might guess, and certainly an improvement to the first film, though the first film was more mindblowing for its time given the lesser technology back then. Some of the artistic choices are a bit questionable, as I feel Elastigirl is now heavily sexualized given her new flashy suit and the frequent low-angle rear shots. It almost feels like rather than taking the Shrek route of tossing in innuendos for the adults, they just took the easy route of framing each shot to emphasize sexual traits. I'm also rather desensitized to special effects as most animated films look beautiful nowadays, but lack interesting plots, and this film unfortunately falls into that category.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is good, but it isn't phenomenal, and hardly deserves its title. It's ultimately lackluster, but it has good moments sprinkled throughout it, and it is worth a watch if you're interested in nice animated films or the original film, but otherwise I would think it to be boring and dull."

","I went to see Incredibles 2 last night, I thought it was a fun and exhilarating movie for adults that grew up with the original and kids that are new to the franchise. It improved on a lot from the original but also felt a little more lackluster in some aspects. The fight scenes seemed a lot more grand than the first film, and the animation was the best that I have ever seen from Pixar. There was one scene in particular where I could've sworn one of the characters was Live Action! The environments are much more lively as opposed to the island from the first film. The problems I had with the film however are a little more precise. I'm sure everyone has mentioned the flashing lights and epileptic unfriendly scenes. I myself have no issue with scenes like this, but I can clearly see how this would affect someone. It makes you wonder how the MPAA would allow this to pass? Did PokÃ©mon teach us nothing about flashing lights in animation? Another issue I had was that the twist of who the villain was was a little too obvious. I understand they wanted to make it a mystery, but I'd rather have a villain like Syndrome from the first film that was more on the frontlines rather than causing havoc from the shadows. I did like how they showed off other types of heroes with other superpowers, but I feel like they didn't get any screen time. In the end I think was a great movie. Just a little less great than first though. If they ever make an Incredibles 3, I hope they fix all of the issues I had with both of these. And I hope we won't have to wait another 14 years."

"frauhicks-1","7","1","4","16 June 2018"," Exciting but missed the mark
","The first Incredibles, besides being an exciting, fun movie, also had things to say about being special. Incredibles 2 came close to talking about people being accepted as they are, but then dropped the ball. One young Super talks about how relieved she is that ElastiGirl is no longer hiding, letting the audience know that she now feels less alone. I was hoping this message would be developed at least a bit. Being accepted exactly as you are is the most important lesson any child can learn. Related to this, and a huge problem in the plot, was the implication that just ""being Super"" was illegal! What kind of message is that for children? Your very existence is illegal? Wow, no wonder so many LBGT kids commit suicide and so many people hate minorities. Some nowadays even call them ""illegals"" as if their very existence is unacceptable. On the other hand, was it the Supers interfering with police business that was illegal? If so, yeah, I can kind of see the law's point. The movie did not clarify this at all, and seemed to leave one with the impression that simply being a human with super powers, that human has no right to exist. I couldn't help but wonder, where is the family getting all this money at the end, as they zoom away in their fancy car. Is someone now paying them to be Supers? It didn't make a whole lot of sense. Please talk with your children and tell them that you love them exactly as they are, no matter what. If you don't do this, most likely no one ever will."

","So like everybody has been saying, it's been 14 years; there's even an apology from director Brad Bird and the cast before the movie starts. But you know, you gotta get it right. Otherwise you get the ""Cars"" franchise. <br/><br/>Even though it's been so long, very little time has elapsed between the last film. Superheroes are still illegal so the Parr family is still fighting crime under the radar.<br/><br/>A PR guy who has great respect for super heroes wants to change all that and he wants to send out Elastigirl clad in camera and surveillance tech to prove to the public Supes are A-ok. <br/><br/>""The Incredibles"" has never been short on novel ideas and the main one here is that we should be able to trust those that protect us, but can we if we barely even know them?<br/><br/>It's timely and brings up a few questions about blindly trusting as well as public perception vs. what actually is. <br/><br/>At it's heart though is still a great family dynamic, one that sees a father staying home with the kids while mom gets to go out and lead an exciting work life.<br/><br/>The movie seems to understand feminism more than most but also that dealing with the kids is a job in and of itself, one that Bob finds himself hilariously in over his head for.<br/><br/>Kids are volatile all by themselves but try dealing with a pubescent teenager trying to have a social life while being part of a clandestine agency or a baby coming into a slew of powers, and you got some problems.<br/><br/>And of course the movie looks fantastic, from the colors to the kind of old school Metropolis this all takes place in.<br/><br/>The action is also just top-notch as they try to stop runaway monorails, helicopters, boats, and Elastigirl has her motorcycle and Frozone gets in on the action more and more.<br/><br/>It all moves at break neck speed and has a real eye-popping quality to it. You just wish that the villains were as exciting. <br/><br/>The main villain is secret for most of the movie but not so secret that you can't figure out who it is right away.<br/><br/>Also keeping it a secret for so long really does mess with establishing a feel for the character so pretty much by the time we get to the finale battle, it's hard to care about those motivations. <br/><br/>But other than that this is an enjoyable follow-up with comedy, action, way better visuals due to the updating of technology, and above all a charming family. <br/><br/>If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more"
"yokoyakamori-33385","8","1","4","16 June 2018"," A decent sequel...though could have been better.
","I was in primary school when I watched the first movie, and I loved it. Made my mom take me on a school night and it was worth losing some sleep. When Disney/Pixar started going through their ""Sequelitis"" phase and started giving their movies a sequel and more, I was hoping The Incredibles would be one of them. Took over a decade to get it, but I thought it was worth it.<br/><br/>My concern with watching the trailer was that it would follow the Toy Story 3 route and just copy and paste the same narrative, but change the formula a bit, but it did do some interesting things.<br/><br/>Instead of Mr. Incredible getting the bulk of the action, it was ElasticGirl's time to shine and she had some really kicka** moments in the film. Mr. Incredible watched the kids and it started off pretty rough, but managed to get the hang of things with a little help from Frozone and Edna to become a better parent. Violet got her own story where Tony completely forgets about Violet's existence thanks to Dicker and also had some great movie moments, though I wish the same was distributed to Dash as well, as he was mostly...just there until the final act.<br/><br/>Plot twist in the narrative was kind of predictable, but given how overused it has become, I don't think they could do much about it.<br/><br/>The villains were okay, but the first movie just had a more enjoyable villain.<br/><br/>The animation was pretty good, though Dash's hair design from the back kind of looks weird to me.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was fun to watch, had great action segments, and was pretty funny most of the time. It probably would have been better though if they aged the characters after the Underminer fight, especially the kids. It would have opened up more possibilities for the narrative that way and we can see them through a new light."

"mosestorres-05766","5","1","5","29 July 2018"," So average it becomes disappointing
","It goes without saying the original Incredibles is fantastic. It's a stylish, well paced, smart, and funny family movie that has respect for its audience. It also has a tone to it that's extremely unique to the genre that really invests and intrigues. 
Incredibles 2, however, goes with a more traditional animated kids movie tone. In that sense, the movie works fine, but that's just the issue. The movie doesn't give the watcher anything cool or unique. It's just a really well animated movie, with pretty lackluster comedy and characters. 
The visuals are by far the highlight. The movie looks great and the visual humor, for me, is the only comedy that works. Some character designs and facial expressions are extremely funny to look at. The choreography in the action scenes are also fantastic. The fast paced and stylish action is pretty great in most scenes. 
This only goes so far, however. The sometimes cringe worthy dialogue, the bland story, the obvious twist (in my opinion), it just seems so wasteful. The writing is basically interchangeable with pretty much any other Pixar, Dreamworks, or Blue Sky movie, which Is really sad, because of the originals sharp and smart dialogue. 
It's comprable to Kubo and The Two Strings, except that movie looks much better and is occasionally really sweet and heartfelt. 
In my mind, it's somewhat sad that the movie is getting the acclaim it's getting. I'd rather see a movie that tries something new and falls flat than another text book animated kids movie. I still had an enjoyable time and the movie has a place due to the audience it clearly has, but it's showing Pixar that they can get away with lazy writing and lack of their so missed style."

","Brad Bird often stated that he would only make a sequel to 'The Incredibles' (2004) if he could come up with a story that was just as good as, or better than, that of the original. Sorry Brad, but I don't think that using the exact same story again really counts. Seriously, 'Incredibles 2' has pretty much beat-for-beat the same plot as the original, only with worse dialogue, much worse characters, and far worse motivations for the villain. In the first ten minutes or so, the film completely goes back on the character arcs of the original and basically resets the story, so that the exact same plot can play out again. Instead of expanding on the original, it actually takes away from it which is very disappointing. That's a good word to sum 'Incredibles 2' up: disappointing. There wasn't a chance that this one would actually be better than the original, but the fact that it doesn't even come close, and that it's definitely one of Pixar's worst efforts, is actually rather surprising. The two plot-lines that we cut between during the film don't really blend together all that well, and therefore the film feels disjointed. Personally, I think that the best moments of the film are those that explore Bob's relationship with Jack-Jack, however these moments are underdeveloped and the exploration of Jack-Jack's powers begins to lack logic as the many powers that he gains start to become illogical with his supposed 'polymorph' power. However Jack-Jack does provide some of the film's best moments, especially a scene involving a raccoon. The voice-cast are fine, but there's nothing noteworthy in that department. The best pieces of music are taken straight from the first, and the new stuff that Michael Giachinno brings is underwhelming and forgettable. The action scenes are, for the most part, well done and deliver some sort of entertainment, however there's always the underlying sense that we've seen it all before. This film claims to be something different, that it is better than the recent bulk of similar superhero flicks, when in reality it is just that: a generic superhero film with hardly any real character development. It's a shame too since the first definitely wasn't a generic superhero film and it broke the genre stereotypes (despite being released years before the modern 'superhero craze'). The film just sort of ended too, without any real resolution or closure, and instead of leaving me excited and ready for more, the bombastic score (taken from the original) and the once cool 2D credit animations (taken from the original) left me feeling hollow. 'Incredibles 2' is an incredible disappointment, and actually tarnishes the legacy of the first. Sure, it's not terrible and it's entertaining enough for the majority of its runtime, but as a follow-up to one of the best animated films of all time, it's simply not good enough. 5/10"

","The first Incredibles is a great movie, and one of my favorites. When I heard that Incredibles was getting a sequel I was definitely worried. I was worried that Incredibles 2 was going to be bad and be a huge disappointment... It sort of was. Incredibles 2 is probably the most predictable movie I've ever seen. If you think you know what is going to happen next, you most definitely do. For me, it was distractingly predictable, and that made the story very bland. That wasn't the only problem either. One problem that you eventually get used too, is that the voice actors are noticeably older. This problem is especially noticeable with Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense and arguably the two best characters, Frozone and Edna, are hardly in the movie. For young children this movie will probably be very enjoyable. Going into this movie with the expectation that it's going to be a great as the first one is a mistake. My rating for this movie is really more like a 5.5, but I just settled with 6. The movie did a few things pretty well. The animation was great, which is typical for Pixar, and the movie felt more like it was set in the 60s than the first one did. This movie is a nostalgia cash grab. If you go into the movie expecting dumb fun you won't be disappointed, because it is exactly that. There was so much potential, and Pixar really dropped the ball."

","We all loved the first film. It's a classic, it's great, but there are people giving 10s to this film, when really it doesn't deserve it. I always say, a sequel doesn't get points for having the original characters, but it does for what they do with them, but I feel like the characters have gone backwards this film. Suddenly, Bob Parr is selfish, and half of the film is just Jack Jack doing cute baby things because cute babies get ha has from the audience.<br/><br/>The animation was great, the sound was great, as up to the standard of pixar. But the story was so simplistic I really couldn't grasp onto it. 14 years to write a story! To put into perspective, Eraserhead took 6 years to make. 14 years, for this? I love Incredibles as much as the last person, but seriously, this is a blatant cash grab and I am saddened by the fact this sequel is now higher rated than the original. I hope those who gave this film perfect 10s are disappointed when they re-watch it on DVD release, because they'll realise they've been tricked."

"violinjoe","6","1","5","23 June 2018"," Should I care about the social justice nonsense?
","I'll start by saying I don't like movie reviews that can't speak to the substance of the art while perhaps disagreeing with the message. That being said, there is definite social justice garbage being pedaled in this movie (female empowerment over men who are all a bunch of idiots, gender role switches, ""illegal"" social classes, etc.), and those are a part of why I was bored with the movie. But the main reason I that I felt like this movie went nowhere. All of the subplots never played out (Helen upstaging her husband, the villain's absurd and elaborate motivation). The only funny moments involved the baby. The worst part was that the movie was just too long. Not as good as the original, but not a terrible movie. Pixar has done far better sequels."
"ladyviola80","3","1","5","22 June 2018"," Thoroughly unimpressed; propaganda on full display
","I don't typically write reviews unless I really love a movie or I really don't love a movie. Unfortunately, Inc2 falls in the latter category. It's not a horrible movie, but it's nothing new and had more negatives than positives. I really feel like Hollywood is running out of new ideas and so has taken the easy route of regurgitating and recycling old stuff. Furthermore, I'm slightly perturbed by the fact that critics refuse to give an honest critique of Pixar's movie. The last few Pixar creations left a lot to be desired. Finding Dory and Incredibles 2 both have a 94% rating on RT. Seriously? Both movies are mediocre at best. Lastly, I wish, that just once, Hollywood was capable of producing a movie without injecting their generally leftist views front and center. Is it too much to ask for a movie void of all the political propaganda that plagues us daily? Incredibles 2 falls right in line with the status quo by pushing the current political agenda: feminism. Hey, I'm a woman and I'm all for women empowerment. But not at the expense of belittling and emasculating men. Why can't we empower women without portraying men in a negative light? Why can't both men AND women be strong and powerful?"

","14 years after the original, I wondered if a follow-up would be able to live up to the hype for all the millions of people begging for a second Incredibles movie. Incredibly (I'm not sorry), The Incredibles 2 is one of those sequels that not only lives up to its name, but is far better than the first movie. Even though it takes place immediately where the original story left off, it seems to have grown up with those of us who were kids a decade and a half ago, asking interesting questions for us to ponder and remaining more than relevant for today's audience. Looking at Cars 3 and Toy Story 3 (and soon to be Toy Story 4!), I like to imagine we might get an Incredibles 3. I just hope we don't have to wait another 14 years for it to happen."
"RforFilm","9","1","5","18 June 2018"," What can I say but Incredibles 2 is Incredible. It contains great action, comedy, and relatable family dynamics
","Yep, I get to talk about The Incredibles this week. It's already well known as a great animated movie from Pixar & Disney, a fun superhero action story, and is even presents a more typical family. Not too sweet like the Waltons and not too cynical like the Simpsons. The Incredibles or the Parr family don't hide that they have problems, mostly learning to deal with the outside world, but manage to work together to get through life, whether it's a new super villain or helping their son succeed at school. The Incredibles may have been the closest thing to a ""realistic"" family from Disney, despite their super powers.<br/><br/>Many fans have been wanting a sequel, but faced a lot of challenges. Not only did director Brad Bird insist on coming up with a story up to his standard, but the fact that superhero movies have become more common and even overblown. When the original came out, superheroes were only out sporadically. So how do you go about making an Incredibles sequel while standing out in a market currently dominated by Marvel and D.C.? Well based on how good Incredibles 2 is, I'm pleased to say that were able to build not only on it's own superhero ideology, but it's commentary on family and suburban life. <br/><br/>Taking place immediately after the end of the first one, the Parr family, Bob ""Mr. Incredible"" (played by Craig T. Nelson), Helen ""Elastigirl"" (played by Holly Hunter), son Dash (played by Huck Milner), daughter Violet (played by Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack-Jack are once again forced to hide when they manage to cause damage attempting to capture a super villain. Bob fear having to take another menial job, but his friend Lucius ""Frozone"" (played by Samuel L. Jackson) tells him of a new opportunity.<br/><br/>Bob, Helen, and Lucius are taken to the office of Winston Deavor (played by Bob Odenkirk) who happens to be a fan of superheroes and wants to get their illegal status reversed. He proposes that Elastigirl fight crime with a hidden camera showing the work she puts in to save lives. They agree, which causes Bob to have to stay home to look after the kids while mom continues her superhero actions. Bob suddenly finds himself in a tough position from trying to help Dash with his homework, helping Violet with her crush, and dealing with Jack-Jacks multiple new powers.<br/><br/>I loved The Incredibles back in 2004 and I can say that I loved Incredibles 2. What Brad Bird understands about his family movies is that the most important aspect is the family. Not just with the likable and relatable family characters, but the problems they face and the challenges parents face. While I did think about that Michael Keaton movie Mr. Mom, Incredibles 2 showcases a lot just how parenting itself is a superhero act. Yeah, there's plenty of Craig T. Nelson looking tired and multiple bags under his eyes, but I'll bet a lot of dads are going to look at this and say, ""That was just me a few weeks ago!"".<br/><br/>Even in a market where superheroes are dominating the box office, Incredibles 2 still works as a superhero movie thanks to a lot of elements. For me, it's the action. Brad Bird not only knows how to play with a lot of the powers characters have, but thanks to the magic of Pixar and computer animation, makes the larger set pieces look great without having to make them realistic. This makes me realize that animation still has that advantage over live action movies in which it doesn't have to build it's effects in a realistic manner, making it's scenery looking seamless.<br/><br/>If I do have to fault this movie, it's with the villain. While I won't say who it is, Disney attempts to throw another character who initially isn't a suspect but later reveals themselves. Not only is this becoming a trope that I'm getting sick of, but isn't as interesting as Syndrome from before. At least Syndrome had more of a personal connection to Mr. Incredible. The Screenslaver has their moments, but again, when it's revealed, the motivation doesn't make a lot of since. What does help is the action in the final act, which is a boat chase that puts Speed 2: Cruise Control to shame.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine Incredibles logos out of ten. Incredibles 2 is such a relatable story and really funny that I have hard time finding people that won't like this movie. Brad Bird really is incredible making this movie. So put on your make and fly with this movie."
"sefrafer","9","1","5","17 June 2018"," the incredible sequel
","14 years have passed since Pixar and Brad Bird brought the first part of this film and if one thing Brad Bird knows is making a good movie and it is understood why it took so many years to connect with the sequel had to bring not only a movie with animated advances, I also had to have a plot with a sense and emotion that we feel in The Incredibles, Ratatouille and The Iron Giant, The Incredibles 2 is not just about being an animated superhero movie, it is about generating awareness under parental responsibilities,, it's about balanced feminine empowerment and it's about generating awareness about the obsession we have with technology, all accompanied by an excellent music of Michael Giacchino that reminds you of the espionage music of the 60's-70's, It has small visual details that bothered me but not enough so that I do not continue to love her, in conclusion an extremely funny movie, with great action stories and great history that despite making animated manages more real problems than other superheroes this year and is something that you definitely can not miss."
"cliftonofun","7","1","5","17 June 2018"," A sequel worth waiting for
","I have been quick to criticize Pixar's recent infatuation with sequels. We did not need another Cars or Monsters Inc, and we certainly did not need another Finding Nemo. I want them to tell original stories...not recycle old ones. And this one is a tad predictable and old fashioned. But you know what? It is hard to criticize sequels when they are THIS good. It would have been so easy to make the second Incredibles an action-fest of family crime fighting, but this movie managed to remember what made the first film so great: fully realized characters and one of the most realistic family dynamics ever captured on screen. From the marital tensions to the sibling bickering, you know these people. And the writing is JUST as strong this time around. It means you care, and it means you recognize yourself, and it means you laugh. This film is not about new villains so much as it is about new angles on rich characters. Fifteen years after the first Incredibles, we are awash with super hero movies. Sometimes it seems like they are all Hollywood cares about. But few of them are this good. Pixar nailed it the first time around, and this sequel absolutely nailed it too."

","We've had to sit through two terrible Cars sequels, an amazing Toy Story finale, a standard Monsters inc. prequel, and a completely unsessessary Nemo sequel just to receive this Incredible sequel. Brad Bird returns to Pixar once again to give us the delight that was Incredibles 2. One thing I love about Incredibles 2 is that it doesn't pander to its 14 year gap and also doesn't saturize the superhero films that have since preceded it, giving us a great colorful continuation to the first film. The family dynamic still resides and the animation looks much more impressive since the last time. It also feels great to hear Nelson, Jackson, Hunter, and Bird in their classic roles once again. The action looks as if it could've taken place in a Live Action Film, which is a wonderful accomplishment. My one complaint with the entire film is the terrible villain ScreenSlaver and the horrible twist of Evelyn being her. I knew from the get go she would be the villain which made me sad, because Syndrome is such a great enemy from the first, but if you look past that you'll find a fun wholesome superhero film that despite its villain more than lives up to the original."

"gmacdon-16521","5","1","6","17 July 2018"," Poor sequel
","Like many, I was really excited when I heard a couple of years back that a sequel to the Incredibles was in the works. The first film was brilliant, packed with punchy lines and witty humour really emphasising what Pixar do best. I just want to say I think Pixar is amazing, always delivering even on sequels- no need to mention Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3. However, I left the cinema feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by the plot that didn't hold the character and uniqueness of the first film. 
The introduction of so many new superheroes was completely unnecessary, and the main plot I think many will agree was very poor and predictable, with unfunny dialogue. The film does continue straight from where it left off with the Incredibles having to fight the Underminer, but this was very short, only about 15 mins of the film. The main plot is Elastigirl having to fight crime in order to prove that supers should be made legal, whilst Mr Incredible has to stay at home and look after the kids. The plot is very disjointed and packs far too much in leaving it a manic mess, with no charm and appeal to it. The whole Screenslaver thing was a terrible idea, just the name lacking any imagination and you would think Pixar should have been able to think of something much better, considering the amount of time and money they have spent on this film. There are several similarities between this movie and the Fantastic Four- Elastigirl is frozen like Mr Fantastic and she unlocks a door like him by putting her hand through the underneath. The villain, Evelyn Dever, is an extremely weak and boring character, especially if compared to Syndrome. If you look at past Pixar villains they each have a very individual character- e.g. Randall and Charles Muntz, but there was nothing remotely unique about her, making her a very forgettable character. Even the appearance of Edna Mode couldn't save this film, her lines not nearly as funny or clever as in the first film, her character not the same as before. 
The climax of the film is bad and at the end of the movie, loose ends aren't tied up- the Underminer is still free. 
There are a few good moments in this film such as Bob's efforts to help Dash with his homework, looking after Jack-Jack and trying to help Violet in her boyfriend crisis. I am not saying this film is terrible, just it does not live up to the extremely high standards set by the fist. Some may enjoy it but I do believe Pixar could have done something much better than this. Perhaps this could have been improved with the inclusion of more characters from the first film, like Mr Huph and Mirage and less new ones. Also, since when do Disney films have swearing in? Overall, I would not recommend this film as it will probably leave you feeling disappointed. But if you do want to see it, don't see it at the cinema, it's really not worth it and would be better to wait till it's out of DVD or Netflix."
"diverdown-71966","5","1","6","27 June 2018"," Not as good as the first. *Plenty of overrated reviews on here.
","Like everyone else, I've been waiting for the Incredibles sequel for what seems like forever. As you would expect, after 14 years of innovation, the visual and audio aspects of the movie were fantastic. However, I left the movie scratching my head wondering how this was the best storyline they could come up with after all this time. Disney has taken a lot of criticism over the last few years for their overly feminist approach to story telling and unfortunately the Incredibles 2 is no different. The storyline will seem all too familiar. The meathead male lead is relegated to staying at home and taking care of the household duties and children while the more intelligent and empowered female lead is off saving the world. The story itself seemed long and at times uninteresting. The magic of the first movie is long lost. The strangest part of the whole experience was the Japanese short film before the feature. Why? Also, in my theatre, they played a Lego Movie 2 preview. - LOL. If the preview is any indication, and based on Lego 1 I'm sure it is, we haven't seen anything yet with respect to the over the top feminist / anti-male approach to storytelling."

","Yes, I said it. Toy Story stans can seethe. Incredibles 2 is by far the best sequel in Pixar history. After watching Finding Dory and Monsters University I was honestly a bit worried for The Incredibles followup. It had been so long since the original and many sequels made this long after the original end up being huge disappointments, and with a movie like The Incredibles, where it's near perfect and fondly remembered by so many, it's hard to truly live up to it. <br/><br/>The action set pieces were more thrilling than most live action superhero films and for once I felt as though characters in a superhero film use their powers to their full potential and when appropriate. Elastigirl and Jack Jack get the most visually inventive scenes and the bulk of Incredibles 2 action scenes and screen time. The use of Helen/Elastigirl makes for an interesting gender flipped version of the first Incredibles movie and in some ways she is a more interesting protagonist because she is more conflicted about her actions. <br/><br/>Although Incredibles 2 was amazing and a great way to reintroduce use to the rich world the initial Incredibles introduced us to, it is the lesser of the two, but both films have their strengths and weaknesses and Incredibles 2 relies more on the smaller character moments and comedy than the overarching story like the first movie."

","Incredibles 2 is the by far the greatest Pixar movie ever. Now that is a big statement, but with the incredible (No pun intended) animation, sound design and writing this is a pretty great deal. The only problem was the high amount of strobe (which means fast flashing lights that can give seizures) and the fact that some parts of the movie's story were hard to follow. Some curse words make it less suitable for audiences under 5, however they are brief and hard to hear. There are also jump scares, which aren't to bad but can still scare children, and loud parts, which I saw most kids in the theatre covering their ears during these.<br/><br/> Overall though Incredibles 2 deserves praise for it's incredible audio design. It is very fluid and easy to hear the characters because they don't sound like their mumbling all the time. The animation has no faults that I could see, (and I have pretty prone eyes) in the action scenes the animation really shows off being very realistic. The physics make absolute sense, and even though you can tell it's animated it stays close to real-world physics and makes you think your looking at real fighting scenes.<br/><br/> Thank you so much for sticking around this long, now on to the big one. Story. While hard to follow at some points, the story is awesome. It has twists, turns, and conspiracies. Now I won't spoil it but it is an exciting rollercoaster ride watching this movie. There are side missions building up to the largest battle like in every superhero movie. But this one does the best job at that. Better than any movie I've ever seen. I would give this movie a 5/10 if it was just preformed by two boys in a garage playing a puppet show with the same story. Highly recommend this movie to people who like twisty stories. Which is almost everyone.<br/><br/> Please give me your feedback on this review by saying whether or not it was helpful. Thank you so much and I hope you enjoy the movie if you go.<br/><br/>Best Wishes,

","Incredibles 2 is the latest installment of the Disney/Pixar formula of making a follow up to a popular existing propertie, without any 
real substance.
The story follows the Parr familys life after helen/elastagirl played by Holly Hunter, is recruited to take part of a project to help better the public perceptions on superheroes in the hopes to lift the band inplaced on supers stablished in the previous film. In the mean time Bob Parr Aka Mr. Incredible (played by Craig T. Nelson) takes on the duties of taking care of the house hold while also being supportive of his wife's new position. He comes to realize both task aren't as easy as he thought.
 From this information alone you'd imagine a sold structure follow up. Unfortunately that's not the case... You have character acting in one way only for it to lead to a subpar or unsatisfying conclusion.
New characters are introduce that are highly forgettable. A very lack luster villain who's motives seemed very incoherent. Especially compared to syndrome from the first Incredibles.
Not all was bad though,
the animation was fantastic as what was expected. The action scenes were a lot of fun. And the real highlights of the film come from the scenes of Bob interacting with his family. But those are being held around a underwelming story.
I know a lot have waited for this film. Hell myself included. But what we got was a straight to blue ray premise wrapped in a Pixar level esthetic. The film is not bad by no means. But it isn't remember enough to go back to view it again. Especially when you have a better product in the first movie go back to. That's why I'm giving Incredibles 2 a 5 out 10."

","Incredibles 2 proves to be another hit for Pixar and Disney. Released 14 years after the original, this film picks up from where the last film ended, and it never stops to take a breath. The action sequences are exhilarating and fun to watch, aided by a clear improvement in animation technology.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 can never be as innovative as its predecessor, yet it keeps the heart and the fun of the first film. The story about a family of superheros sets it apart from the comic book films, giving us interesting family dynamics and everyday problems that all families face, which feels organic and human, allowing all of us to relate to this family and allows us to see them as not just superheros, but ordinary families trying to live their lives.<br/><br/>All compliments aside, the villain, Screenslaver, in this film was surprisingly weak and never much of a threat, due to a lack of opportunity for Screenslaver to truly develop itself. Unlike Syndrome in the first film, this villain never challenged the ideals and beliefs of any member of the family, although you could see where the villain is coming from, adding moral ambiguity, a characteristic of most Pixar films.<br/><br/>In addition, so many ideas about politics, commentaries about the justice and fairness are introduced throughout the film. While relevant, it can't help but feel over-saturated with different kinds of messages it wants to bring across. In the end, although the film was a fun and enjoyable time at the theaters, the muffled message makes the journey slightly frustrating."

"ericstevenson","10","1","7","17 June 2018"," Yeah, one of the best sequels ever made
","I gave this movie the highest rating because of one thing. This film's main plot is that the Incredible family are trying to make superheroes legal again by having the mother Elasti-girl carry out missions. There turns out to be another villain known as the Screenslaver about. The meeting to legalize superheroes is arranged by this one guy. My dad and I just knew that he was the Screenslaver. Then it turns out...it's actually his sister! <br/><br/>We seriously did not see that coming! Okay, I admit that by this point it has gotten kind of clichÃ© to have the villain in a Disney or Pixar film be a twist. Still, this was at least done better than most examples. Anyway, I thought this was even better than the original. It's great to have all these great characters back in a sequel that truly does advance their mythology. It even starts out as an immediate sequel to the first movie.<br/><br/>There's even this great opening credits gag done in the style of the show. What many people might not know is that Elasti-girl was also the name of a DC Comics character, but Pixar explicitly got permission to use the name. Don't worry, Disney will probably eventually own DC as well. It's great to see the more mundane scenes with Mr. Incredible and his family. It really does make the film realistic. Just when you think Edna won't appear, she does! ****"
"cruise01","9","1","7","16 June 2018"," Incredibles is astonishing and awesome with its exciting visuals and lovable characters.
","Incredibles 2 (4.5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is an awesome superhero sequel that matches up to the original movie that was released 14 years ago. Now, that was also a risky move on pixar's end since they do not have a good track record with making good sequels except for Finding Dory. While, the rest of them like Cars or Toy Story were kind of losing there touch that made the original movies so good. Sure, the story was good in this sequel which focuses more on Elastigirl doing solo missions while her husband Bob is a stay home daddy with Dash, Violet, and baby Jack Jack. While Elastigirl is on a trail of a new villain called Screenslaver that brainswashes anybody that gets hypnotized by his static coding on monitors. <br/><br/>Director Brad Bird is back and brings a lot of entertainment in his film. It has plenty of colorful visuals and the animation was stylish. The action sequences are great and exciting. The film follows right after the events on the first film when Mole man breaks through the city with his big driller. And the Incredibles family has to stop him. Which sets the plan in motion when the destruction makes the officials question if superheroes are even needed or do they create more destruction than just letting the bad guys get away clean. The train sequence was fun and exciting with Elastigirl chasing it with her motorcycle and trying to stop an unstoppable train. Seeing Jack Jack experience his powers when the clueless father Bob is burnt out from being a stay home father. While Dash is having math trouble and Violet having boy trouble. The family dynamic is a lot of fun and entertaining. <br/><br/>I do feel like the film slows down with the sub plot of Winston Deaver, a superhero fan that is recruiting other superheroes to help fight crime and to prove to the officials that society need heroes. The other superheroes that are introduced are forgettable. When the film backtracks to Mr. Incredible and his way of handling with the kids at home is back on screen. It is amusing. Or seeing Elastigirl back in action. <br/><br/>When it comes to sequels that lose its touch or is inferior to the original. Incredibles 2 lives up to the hype and is worth the wait. The pace is on going and fast. It does not lose itself with uneven characters being on screen. Elastigirl is more focused on in the plot. But Bob and the family are not forgotten and they have plenty of screen time when they are back in action. When Violet and Dash are to the rescue while bringing an uncontrollable baby Jack Jack. And Frozone is back in action when he takes off with his suit while his wife nags in the background again. <br/><br/>Overall, Incredibles 2 is a really good family superhero film. If you love the original, you will enjoy this just as much. Or if you love superhero movies, this one brings enough entertainment for children and adults to enjoy."

I have seen a story, like in all Super hero movies, in which the big government is corrupted, but everything will be made perfect with more laws and signed papers by people so important other humans can die.<br/><br/>I have seen an ode to the killer cop from the media. In which the procedure, the checks and balances, the private property itself mean nothing to save ""the Ambassador"". In which a woman with a mask and a hidden identity can enter no matter what home, break stuff, take objects, because she has a gadget with a screen and a flashing dot. In which evidence for a criminal trial is held and given as some sort of trophy at a fancy party. I have seen how nice is to spend big bucks to please governmental bureaucrats ""for the good of everybody"".<br/><br/>I have seen a feminist manifesto: the family can't get a nanny. No, the male should endure what was deemed humiliating for the women folk, in the name of equality.<br/><br/>I have seen a masculinist manifesto: the male of the family can't handle things as well as the woman after 10 years of hard practice, but this is only because he doesn't use his superior male brain. Once he starts acting like a man, everything becomes a breeze, and the woman's experience of 10 years is acquired in less than a week, as shown, simply overnight.<br/><br/>I have seen how the woman can't be a full person without popping more than 2 children, the 3 required for keeping a constant population. And, well, the evil one has none, because she won't do her civic duty to the king and country.<br/><br/>I have disliked to have seen the big nosed person that would sell anything to anybody.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","12","16 October 2018"," Extremely mediocre anima(c)tion
","Here we have ""Incredibles 2"" and the title makes it obvious of course that this is the long awaited (?) sequel to the Pixar Oscar-winning blockbuster ""The Incredibles"". It's been almost 15 years since that one and director Brad Bird is back behind the camera after a journey into the world of live action. So you get the superhero family back for this film we have here that runs pretty much exactly 2 hours including credits, which is really long for an animated Hollywood film these days you could say. Let me say first of all that I am writing this review as somebody who has yet to see the original first Incredibles movie. While I like animation, Pixar and live action superhero films, the 2004 film never really made me curious to the point where I would really wanna see it. And I guess I was right as this one here left me really underwhelmed and I don't think the problem was that I have not seen the first. There are basically 2 almost independent story lines here. The first is about the father who stays at home with the baby (and the other kids) and finds out that the baby has superpowers as well that may exceed everything they have known about so far. The second is about the mother being recruited by an influential businessman and his sister with the plan to make sure superheroes are no longer outlaws. Well, I mentioned the kids in brackets. The boy is fun to watch, but has literally no story line whatsoever. The girl has a bit more, some references about a boy she is crushing on and who may have an interest in her too, but sadly found out about her superhero identity and thus had to lose his memory about her altogether.<br/><br/>Let's talk a bit about the father-baby story line. I found it really uninteresting. The daddy is sometimes fun to watch, also his face, but yeah it just wasn't enough to make for almost half the film. It was never really funny, not even remotely and in terms of the fantasy aspect, i.e. the baby's powers, it wasn't good enough drama-wise either to cut the cake. Good enough for a 20-minute television special perhaps, but that's it. The mother being out there getting liked by the people was definitely the more dramatic story line. But it had crucial flaws too. I really struggle to find the mother interesting on a level where I see her as the defining character from a movie. I see that in the father though. Plus her part was so packed with action instead of convincing story lines that it was just one heavy explosion or stunt after the next. Then there is of course the twist when we find out who the villain is. As if that was any surprise. It was obvious from the beginning. The only surprise was to me that the brother wasn't involved. I thought he wanted to summon all these heroes and politicians on the ship, so he could kidnap them or do something worse. I remember plot twists about villains that I really didn't see coming like in Zootopia or Frozen, but here it is really really easy to predict and still they are acting as if it wasn't obvious. Another problem for this film is that it has just too many characters. The Black ice hero is completely pointless, same for the superhero brother and there are 2 or 3 other characters that are getting a solid amount of screen time, but add virtually nothing. It's like the animated Avengers gone wrong at times.<br/><br/>Finally, of course with Pixar, it needs to be said that the animation is as good as always. There is really absolutely nothing wrong with the visual side. But the film relies way too much on that component and the heart and charm of other Pixar films is missing entirely here. Rushed-in story lines like the antagonist trying to convince the mother she is the more powerful from the couple do not work at all. All in all, I am surprised this received such strong reviews and is considered a frontrunner for Animated Feature at the Oscars. It has nothing on Wes Anderson's recent dog-themed film. Or on a handful of Japanese films coming out this year. If ""Incredibles 2"" is really top of the pile this year, then this says nothing good about Hollywood animation this year and they may be losing their dominant position to Asia again. The introductory short film by Pixar (about dumplings) was weak already and the full feature film that followed wasn't any better. It could partially have to do with the German dub that I watched not being particularly great to be fair, but hey that's part of the entire thing as well, actually a crucial part. So overall, the only thing impressive (as usual) here was the visual side. The rest of the film was not a success by any means and I give it a thumbs-down. For all I care, they don't need to make a third film, but I'm pretty sure looking at the reception and upcoming awards accolades they will. Not sure if I'm gonna watch, but I'm pretty sure I'll never give this second film a rewatch. Thumbs-down. Please please please get back to your best again soon Pixar."
"faerlian","8","1","12","16 July 2018"," Way better than I was expecting
","I liked the original Incredibles, but didnt love it the way many did (and do). (Gasp, shocking I know). That being said, Incredibles 2 is an amazing and fun movie unless you're just trying to hate on sequels in general. Story is great; a bit darker than the original, while maintaining a classy balance between humor and seriousness. Yes there are some political and social undertones in the story, but it incorporates them neatly, without going full-on SJW like The Last Jedi. I felt like they actually had their place in the story, and that they strengthened rather than detracted from the movie. All the main characters were superb and the animation and voice-acting is flawless as you might expect, with cheeky Frozone, unpredictable Jack-Jack, and charismatic Elastigirl nearly stealing the show by themselves. Genuine character development and motivations all around. The action set-pieces are thrilling and are easily some of the best that I have ever seen in an animated film, or really just film, period. No really. I thought I was in a Mission Impossible film for a second. Not that that's a bad thing. <br/><br/>Where it goes wrong: All the other 'supers' except for the main ones and one particularly self-conscious super, feel kind of random and unnecessary. And while the villain is perfect, the third act, while certainly passable, felt like a bit of a letdown. I felt like there could have been more, well, oomph, to it. They could easily have made it 10-25 minutes longer and nobody would have complained.<br/><br/>Overall, 9/10, well worth watching."

I like the idea when they create a villain with no super power, and the way they tell the story is compelling and suitable for both adults and children. For the fans who has waited for 14 years, this movie is something more than a precious gift.
For me, there's several things I like in the movie, like the fascinating lines which is so deep somehow, and the way the film teach the kids, even all parents the way to understand each other, and live for each other, so beautiful and charming. My favorite character is Violet (especially her cute annoying voice).
But, another hand, I do not like how the movie ends, the bad person is beaten so easily and not intense, so predictable. There's not so much of Dash's scenes and also his power was shown boring and short (I love the way he ran on water in the 2004 version) and some short scenes came out of nowhere but I don't like them.

He was my favorite character in the movie and I believe his character is strong enough to create a spin-off. The animation is very good, and the action sequences are fast-paced and well done. It is also a coming-of-age story with the kids Violet and Dash growing up.

"leftistcritic","6","0","3","14 May 2019"," A 1960s throwback film with conservative undertones
","This animated film, which is clearly a 1960s throwback, loosely based in 1963, carries with it the similar conservative undertones to the first movie. After failing to stop the Undertaker who steals money from the bank, Elastigirl (Helen), Mr. Incredible (Bob), and Frozone (Lucius) are approached by a male capitalist, Winston, a sort of Madison Avenue type, who wants to rebrand superheroes (""supers"") and make them legal. He tells the tale of his father, who kinda looks like Andrew Carnegie, who he says ""loved"" superheroes, whom we find later he avoided going to the safe room because he thought that ""supers"" would save him, and he was killed by robbers. They are helped by his tech-savvy sister, Evelyn, and the family is moved to one of Winston's mansions he is ""not using."" Elastgirl is basically paid to break laws, since ""supers"" are still illegal, to raise the profile of superheroes. In the meantime, Bob becomes the stay-at-home dad, which clearly threatens his ""manhood"" as he watches his teenage daughter Violet and ten-year-old troublemaker son, Dash, and the infant, Jack-Jack. In the process, he shows himself as incompetent parent, while Edna, the fashion designer for ""supers,"" watches Jack-Jack for a short time.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the villain of this film is Evelyn, who wants to make ""supers"" illegal forever as she believes, not wrongly, that they shouldn't be trusted. She believes she is doing the ""right thing"" with her hypnosis technology (which allows people to be controlled through special glasses they where), more than her brother, Winston, seeing him, whom she once call ""Mr. Free Enterprise,"" as deluded and living in the past. It should be no surprise that she is ultimately foiled her plan, depending on media attention and having an ability to spread her message. Funnily, her plan is unnecessarily complex and she could have accomplished the same with fewer ""supers."" Even so, she is a bit more compelling than villains in other films, like the one in the first film in 2004.<br/><br/>It is with this, we get into the conservative undertones. Not only does Bob work to save his wife, Helen, who falls into the damsel in distress stereotype, but the capitalist, Winston, ends up living and is painted positively in this film. Instead, Evelyn is a more devious superhero than Syndrome in the first film (who was also a murderous psychopath), who wants to make ""supers"" illegal is painted as terrible. As all the adult ""supers"" are under the hypnosis of Evelyn, it ends up being the ""kids"" who save the day, and then they work together to prevent the ship from crashing into the city. It reminds me of what the character, Carmen, says in the 2001 film, Spy Kids (and a common theme throughout the films in that series), ""never send an adult to do a kid's job."" Some could say that like the first film, this film ""celebrates marriage, courage, responsibility, and high achievement,"" which are inherently conservative values. Additionally, when Violet points out that Evelyn will get a slap on the wrist because she is rich, Winston chuckles at this and says that we do not know what ""the future will bring,"" while the other ""supers"" seeming to not completely trust him anymore. Again, like in the first film, Bob is not totally faithful with his wife in that she does not tell her everything, like that Jack-Jack has superpowers. What does that say about him?<br/><br/>While I have my problems with this film, as I note in the above review, I still rate it as a 6 out of 10, because it is an effective drama and a relatively simple storyline. It ends with the whole family of ""supers"" (Jack-Jack, Violet, Dash, Bob, and Helen) speeding away to catch a set of criminals with machine guns, while Tony Rydinger, who Violet was going on a date with, since the first date was ruined by his mind being wiped of all memory of Violet by the shadowy government agent Rick."

","It's one of those sequels which insults everything that makes the first film great, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame or Mulan. Pixar's first bad sequel to a good movie since Cars 2. I love The Incredibles nearly as much as I love Toy Story, for about the same reasons everyone else does, so I don't feel the need to write more reviews for them. The Incredibles 2 removes any hope that superheroes would be legalized at the end of the first The Incredibles because the writers at Pixar aren't creative enough to give The Incredibles a new story with legalized superheroes, and all of the main characters are simplified, except for Frozone and Jack-Jack. Dash's only goal is to get his math homework done, which many of us want to do, but not something worth watching in a superhero film, and Violet went awry when she found out Mr. Incredible got Rick Dicker to make Tony Rydinger forget her existence, and not just forget seeing her in a superhero costume. At least it didn't ruin Syndrome, like how The Hunchback of Notre Dame II didn't ruin Frollo since this antagonist died in the first film.<br/><br/>I've always been offended by double standard where it is okay/funny for Helen to hypocritically become what she did not want Bob to do in the first film and Bob to mess up with dealing with the kids, but it's not acceptable the other way. A good story about female empowerment would not be afraid to give a female protagonist flaws. If you were worried about Vanellope going Turbo in Ralph Breaks the Internet, I would at least give that credit for having Ralph call her out on it when she got mad at him for ruining Slaughter Race for her, and Bob/Mr. Incredible would be right to be mad at Helen/Elastigirl for doing what he did after she told him to not do it. I guess it doesn't really help that there was no personal conflict between the second film's female protagonist and antagonist-Elastigirl vs. Evelyn-like the first film's male protagonist and antagonist-Mr. Incredible vs. Syndrome. But wait, there's more!<br/><br/>The Incredibles was a deconstruction of superheroes and how people in the real world would get mad at them for destroying things in the process of stopping bad guys, the dangers of capes, and villains who give heroes time to foil them by monologue, even having a scene where Elastigirl tells Violet and Dash that the bad guys they are facing are not like cartoon bad guys from Saturday morning cartoons. The Incredibles 2 becomes the genre of silly Saturday morning cartoons with none of the clever satire that the first Incredibles had. Many of the new superheroes in this movie, like Screech and Reflux, don't look like they could pretend to be normal and live a normal life without superpowers for 15 years when superheroes were illegal. Last but not least, Jack-Jack, who had but a few superpowers back in the first movie, now has any superpower that the story needs him to have. I'm glad to see superheroes be legalized at the end of this movie, but the Underminer is completely dropped from the story after the first 10 minutes, which I'm sure everybody who watched the first Incredibles came to the second Incredibles to see, and I'm a bit worried that when The Incredibles 3 continues from The Incredibles 2's cliffhanger where Violet gave Tony money to buy tickets for her and him, they will find another way to outlaw superheroes again."

","The only great thing about this movie is the final fight. Seeing other heroes was cool too.<br/><br/>Now.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was blah. It didn't have the same excitement that the first one had.<br/><br/>You already knew who the villain was. And when its revealed you can easily say ""i knew it"".<br/><br/>The animation and voice acting is great but that doesn't help make up for a bland action sequence and story execution.<br/><br/>Incredible 2 is not worth watching despite a 14 year wait. We could have waited another 24 and being happy with the first because adding this movie really does nothing to further these characters in any way or sort.<br/><br/>The development is basically none.<br/><br/>Incredible 2 is not a must see movie."

","There are many reasons why I love this movie and it works. I can't believe I seriously had to wait 14 years to see this movie.
First of all, the animated action was excellent, the plot was excellent, and the scenes with Jack-Jack were hilarious.
One of my few criticisms about the movie is that they seriously had to spoil us with the fact the Evelyn Deavor was the bad guy. Her name sounds like ""Evil Endeavor"". I'm still going to keep my perfect score. I'm just nitpicking.
One of my favorite parts of the movie were the awkward scenes with Tony Rydinger. There was one funny scene where the Parrs were at ""The Happy Platter"", but Tony worked their part time because his parents owned the place. Violet was so shocked that he was the waiter that water went out her nose and she got really embarrassed
The movie is an amazing Family Action Film and I highly recommend it"

","The Incredibles 2<br/><br/>The downside to being in a super-powered family is that your siblings will always reveal your secret identity to your arch-rival.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when the alias of the heroine in this animated-adventure is exposed, it threatens everyone.<br/><br/>When Violet's (Sarah Vowell) alter ego is revealed she withdraws from the spotlight. Meanwhile, her mother, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), has ventured out on her own to prove to the public that superheroes are beneficial. On the home front, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has become the main caregiver to the rest of his powerful brood.<br/><br/>Picking up right where the original left off 14-years ago, this overdue sequel fails to succeed, or even match, its predecessor. Lacking sufficient laughs and worthwhile action, the script to this follow up suffers from serious lulls, recycled plot points and a lackluster villain.<br/><br/>Besides, the point to having super-powers is so you can fly away from your family.

"Joaquim_R","6","0","1","28 October 2018"," Not nearly as interesting as the first one!
","I just watched the film, and as soon as it ended, I came here to checkout the reviews and all that stuff. Turns out I'm not the only one who shares the same opinion. This films isn't ""bad"", it just misses a lot from the original movie, mainly (for me) the action and those sick devices and machines that fought the incredibles.
At the start of the film I was like - ""ok, someone wants to save superheroes from disappering, and another someone is brainwashing people, being a ""bad guy"", ok, let's see what this leads to."". As soon as the film developed, I started thinking - ""ok, surely the brothers are involved in the brainwash."", and that pretty much ended the fun for me. Moreover, when the kids went to save their parents and the easiness it seemed to take off the masks, that for me killed the film. Where's all the action? Where are those crazy machines and devices that battle against superheroes? No, let's keep a boat from colliding to the city. It's still somewhat ""entertaining"" to see how they manage to save the city, that doesn't make it up for the film.
To sum up, this film needed a lot more work and action, maybe the baby could have shown more of his powers against crime and the enemies, maybe less talk talk and more action. On the other hand I at least found it very funny and narratively good."

","It has a few good moments. They explore the babies superpowers which is kinda cool. <br/><br/>The plot is a rehash of the first movie with the roles reversed. Mrs. Incredible (Elastigirl) is out being a superhero fighting crimes and all that while Mr. Incredible is Mr. Mom. She is the poster girl for feminism maybe. Unlike Mr. Incredible in the first one she is not sneaking around training or fighting as it would be too similar I guess. Superheroes crime-fighting is still illegal but Elastigirl will change that by representing superheroes as she saves lives with finesse while Mr. Incredible is messy with high property damage. Lives are more important than property dumba$$. The old company that deals with PR for superheroes, damage control and other such activities is being shut down by the government but rich eccentric brother and sister duo try starting the venture anew with this poster girl plan. The brother has a Ted Cruz vibe about him. <br/><br/>Screenslave, the villain is like Killgrave from season 1 of Jessica Jones. Hypnotism through computer screens is the MO. I predicted that Screenslave was one of the rich eccentric siblings. The first half hour and last half hour are decent but the first movie was better. Hopefully in the next sequel, if there will be one the 'superheroes are illegal' charade is done with and there is some kind of Infinity War."

It's funny how this has a higher rating than Zootopia (2016) which is the best animated movie of 2016 in my mind (and for once I agree with the Academy Awards).<br/><br/>I did like it slightly better than part 1 though, mainly because of the over-the-top baby.

","Incredibles 2 presents a great movie, with a powerful story.
I only have one and a ""HALF"" problem:
The ""HALF"" thing is how did Bob sleep with a beard and woke up without it? Well, it's an animated movie so I didn't care about it, but it bothered me, but my only problem is that the biggest event in the movie (I mean superheros being illegal) solved very very easy and fast, I mean they saved the world from villains are more dangerous than saving a train, and they didn't care, but yet I am going to give a 10/10 and more if I can do it!
Well the first one is better in somethings and this one is better in somethings, so for me they are both equal! I really loved it and enjoyed watching it!
I loved a lot of thing in this movie:
The characters were really amazing and amusing.
The sense of humor was really hilarious!
The story was powerful and entertaining (beside the problem I mentioned up there)

","So I saw this film about a month ago and still can't make up my mind. You see I agree with a rating from anywhere from a 5/10 to a 7/10. Nothing more, nothing less. The film has undebiable strengths such as its action scenes and the majority of Mrs. incredibles scenes. It also has undeniable flaws, such as Mr. Incredbibles parts being so stupidly cliche and obviously being comic relief. The film also had some really good family diolouge, but it was extremely lacking. However what determines your review will be how you took the humour and cliches. This films humor was pretty hit or miss. For me it hit and it missed resulting in a 6/10 (subject to change). I think overall many parts of the films were charming enough to help me not notice its flaws, but it is by no means flawless. I decided to give this a 6/10 overall because while this films charm and humor that can sometimes hit the spot as well as some really great action scenes. It wouldn't be fair not to compliment mrs incredibles portion of the movie. It feels like an actual super hero movie and I really enjoyed the action diolouge and characters. Some people didn't like the villains motivations and some did. Once again im in the middle. Overall if your a fan of the oringinal like me, give it a go, it's one of those movie where you really won't be able to decided without seeing it. <br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful!"

It seems like everytime Pixar does a sequel, they don't want to really do it, they don't put a lot of effort as with the originals, and that's what happens here.
The story is practically the same as the first one, but with a change in the roles. The villain is so preddictable, and his, or her, motives didn't convinced me. Sometging that didn't liked me neither was the beginning. It's some kind of flash forward, and then it goes to a flashback 5 minutes earlier...and then it comes back to where it started.

"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","0","3","25 July 2018"," A fine sequel
","The family of superheroes must come together to defeat a foe more cunning and adaptive than anything they've faced before - never-ending housework, teenage angst management and unfinished homework (oh, and a villain who uses screens to control people!).
 <br/><br/>Picking up directly where the original left off 14 years ago, the family of superheroes have to deal with the immediate threat of the Underminer terrorising innocent citizens. They do so knowing that superheroes have been made illegal on account of the vast amounts of collateral damage during previous failed attempts to fight villains.<br/><br/>Family matriarch Elastigirl is therefore tasked to fight crime in an orchestrated effort by a rich fan to get people to see supers (as they're referred to in the film) in a positive light and make them legal again. The Screenslaver, a new villain who uses screens to hypnotise and control people, is on the loose and is using his powers to keep the illegal so he can continue his control unopposed. Meanwhile, Mr. Incredible is tasked to keep the homestead in one piece as Dash has maths homework to do, Violet is chasing a boy, and new-born Jack-Jack reveals more and more powers.<br/><br/>It's too easy for lesser superhero films to slip into an old trap - a big fight might look impressive but if we're not told what characters powers are (especially newly created and unestablished supers), the audience is left confused that suddenly Superman is throwing a giant S from his chest at General Zod (seriously, what was that about?!). In the fight scenes between supers, the ways in which they used their powers were always a delight to watch since the script allowed us to understand all those involved well in advance. In this regard, special mention has to go to a particular fight scene between Violet and a girl who can transport objects through portals. Your imagination isn't doing it justice; trust me, it needs to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Having directed Ratatouille, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Tomorrowland to varying amounts of praise in the meantime, writer/ director Brad Bird gives an eager and anticipating audience exactly what they want and so much more. Incredibles 2 is at least as funny, inventive and visually stunning as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Boys are jerks and superheroes suck!"""

A rich man Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) agree to bankroll the family in order to rehab their rep with the public. The catch is they don't want the whole family, but only want to spotlight 'responsible' Mom/Elastic-Girl (Holly Hunter). This leaves Dad/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) to play Mr. Mom at home with the kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). While Elastic-Girl is out grabbing headlines, Mr. Incredible is stuck with domestic duty. While functional, the script just seems so...so ordinary (trying real hard to not make an 'incredible' reference). <br/><br/>INCREDIBLES 2 is genial enough. The voice work is fine (Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone and Bird's Edna Mode make return appearances). The production values are top notch, and Michael Giacchino's score groves in a 60s Monty Norman 007 Bond/Space Age Lounge kind of way. <br/><br/>Bird, Pixar et al. said for years that they didn't want to do a sequel until they found a screenplay worthy of it. The outlawed Superhero story is an old trope perhaps done best most recently in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR and is the fundamental basis of the whole X-Men universe. And, did we wait 14 years to see Mr. Incredible change diapers and spend 5 minutes struggling over a math text book? It just seems small. More akin to a TV series like The Jetsons or The Simpsons than a big budget blockbuster. Because of the high production values and A List voice talent, it might be a stretch to call INCREDIBLES 2 to be more suited for the Direct-To-Video second tier Pixar/Disney offshoots - but, sadly, not too much of one. INCREDIBLES 2 is an okay two hours, but, Bird and company have to aim much higher if this is going to continue as a feature film franchise."

","There are those that think that some movies should be ""stand-alone"" and not to be anchored with a sequel. It's a tough concept to subscribe to when, after all, a movie does some serious bank because of it's contributing factors such as originality, story, character development, special FX, etc., etc. I am not a gigantic movie buff, but if I reflected enough, I'm sure I can come with several as such. On the other hand, there are many sequels that equal or surpass the first, perhaps due to superior factors, and/or the the timing was just right to reach the right audiences and it became a ""perfect storm"" sequel that added up to a great sequel(s). This thinking is not just for animation either. I believe that one can reflect upon a sequel of movies (ie Rocky, Star Wars, Jaws, Pacific Rim, Nightmare Elm Street, for example) and come to the conclusion that the first was the primo. That's not to say that the sequels were all that helpless/hopeless, and may have in fact added to the future character arcs. But it would seem that once a Mona Lisa is painted, there is not a need for a Mona Lisa 2. Case in point would be Ratatouille. This was an excellent piece of animated cinema that contained a completely unique and innovative story, great characters and development, beautiful animation, and resolved excellently to it's conclusion. Could movie-land juice up a sequel? Of course. But would it be necessary? Another example is the Croods. And for me, the Incredibles falls into that category of ""no sequel required"". Was I2 a good movie? Yes. Was it a great sequel? Not really. Certainly the expectation was there when it was announced that after so many years a sequel was in the works. But I believe the challenge lies with ""ok, we made a masterpiece, what can we do to move it forward?"" Understanding that in some 14 years the industry has made exceptional technical advances, and I2 is brimming with awesome animation and visuals, the real work has to be in the story evolution, not relying on the previous movie's tropes. Now with that, the I2 team probably thought it may be better to revisit all of the original's plot devices so as not to loose anybody because of the 14 years gap? I don't know, I'm just guessing. But I2 really seemed like too much of a first movie rehash. All of the I1 plot vehicles were there with a lack of any character development or direction. Yes it was good to see Jack Jack use a bunch of powers, but the rest of the family seemed superfluous to the plot. It wasn't like we were able to see any different sides to the family so their entire time on the screen was uneventful. I1 had all of this cool inter-family dynamics going on, along with Bob's work struggles and his relationship with Lucius, the gov't crackdown on heros, and a great James Bond-like villain who kills all of the other supers...and all the other supers were done very well with cool names and nifty/goofy powers but it all worked. Yes, in I2 it was good to see Edna bond with the baby, but her short scene was also cookie-cutter from the first. And the villain was lame compared to Syndrome. The theater I was in along with my family was sold out. And I can count about 3 times when I heard any laughter or scene reaction. It was like everyone was waiting for something to happen and nothing did for long periods. I think many people may feel compelled to like the movie because of the great first movie and the 14 years gap. But it really felt like a letdown. And I can't stand that vocal lisp of Holly Hunter. Was it worth $12 to see it in the big theater? Kinda. Go, you will enjoy it. But let it not be over hyped, there was one Mona Lisa and Incredibles 1 was it. I give it a 5"

","After 14 long years we finally have a sequel to The Incredibles, a film adored by people all over the world. Brad Bird returns as director and the film picks up right where the original ended.<br/><br/>Incredibles 2 is easily one of the best movie going experiences I've had this year. The film has everything we loved about the last one from lovable characters, interesting themes and great action. Although the plot is somewhat similar to the last one but with a few changes, the movie is still a blast from start to finish.<br/><br/>I felt quite nostalgic watching the same characters that I fell in love with when I was much younger. This film focuses more on Elastigirl instead of Mr. Incredible so in a way we're getting the same movie only a bit different. <br/><br/>The action sequences were well choreographed and the stakes were kept mostly personal which was a good decision and that is exactly what Brad Bird does well. The score is grand and exciting which made the action more exhilarating. <br/><br/>Elastigirl played once again by Holly Hunter is fantastic and the film showcased her powers in several clever ways. Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible and Samuel L. Jackson as frozone are equally excellent. Jack Jack the youngest child who was barely in the last movie steals the show by being extremely cute. Violet ended up being one of my favorites in this movie which was unexpected which resulted in Dash being a bit in the background having not much to do. <br/><br/>By far the biggest problem with the film is its predictable story. If you've seen the movie you probably know what I'm talking about. The movie is entertaining, funny and a worthy sequel but it's not without its flaws. Overall it's a great time for the entire family."
"nate-car","5","0","2","5 July 2018"," too little... too late...
","I gave the original 11/10 as it was essentially the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Justice League and Avengers before their time. But this sequel was too little and too late. It doesn't make sense to make a movie 14 years later take place 1 minute after the original? 
But instead of following from the momentum of the first, which essentially had the entire family united as ONE, it just went back to scratch, broke the group straight apart and reversed the gender roles of a single parent crime fighter. 
Super disappointing story combined with slightly strange voices from Holly Hunter and Violet (which just didn't sound right).
 I kept waiting for it to 'happen' but never did. Mr. Incredible and Dash were pushed into a baby sitting back seat role, Violet had her character arc completely reset back to the start of the original and the SJW, feminism messages of making it essentially a 'Mrs Incredible' movie just doesn't work... it would be like making Fantastic Four and only focusing on the Invisible Woman, it's a four person team, it wouldn't hurt to have them actually BE in the same scene at the same time??? 
Supporting cast was great in this one though- Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener, Sophia Bush, Phil LaMarr and Isabella Rossellini are some of my favorite actors with voices that steal the show.
 I give this one 5/10 and won't bother going to see another on the big screen, not now that live action super hero movies have caught up to the original, and in the case of Marvel, are now far exceeding it."

But the plot is one of my main problems! The story line is very predictable and annoying. It's almost like they struggled to come up with one, so they picked a stereotypical plot like every other super hero movie. Some scenes were very cheesy, lazy and not necessary. Yes, this is a kids movie. I am WELL aware of that! And I'm sure kids don't think about this sort of stuff. But I now the difference between a good movie and a GREAT one! It's safe to say, I probably won't be watching this again. Yes it's good, but it's not really worth my hard earned money, because of those little things.

","The movie was extremely gratifying after such a long wait. The family picks off from the point where they ended the movie last time and slowly the gloves come off. The movie focuses quite a bit on character development. Mr. Incredible understand first hand how to do house work and he connects better with his children, frozone gets to unleash his full powers. The kids dash and violet work just as hard as they did in the original movie, except they seem to be a better team now. The movie's focus though, is on two characters, Helen parr or The Elastigirl and jack jack. Helen gets to experience the freedom of saving lives without giving a second thought and she meets her challenge. jack jack meanwhile keeps revealing himself and his abilities and learns a bit to focus them and listen to his family and also kick ass. <br/><br/>Overall, I believe there couldn't have been a better sequel. I am very thankful to the makers to have done it so very beautifully."

","Incredibles 2 is the continuation to the highly sucessful Incredibles (2004), and it is basically a direct continuation to that movie.This time around, Robert needs to stay at home taking care of the children, while Helen goes on a mission.
The script, just as the first one is very solid, the movie balances really well the superhero elements and the family ones, this last one working really well, making the movie relatable.What makes Incredibles 2 unique comparing to other superhero movies is the themes that it deals, mainly family and parenting, overall it´s all about family, the superhero theme is basically secondary.
The quality of the animation is terrific, the way that the characters move, the brightness, the textures, everything is remarkable, also worth mention is the production design.The action sequences are incredibly realized, thanks to the possibilities that the animation offers, the great sound effects and vibrant soundtrack by the composer Michael Giacchino.
The whole movie is incredibly entertaining and there are hilarious scenes throughout. The only issues that i had were that the villain wasn´t as interesting or memorable as Syndrome from the first movie, and also the ending was a little predictable.
Overall Incredibles 2 is a delight, it might be even better than the first one, i had a blast watching it.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

","I went into the theater without expecting much - the trailers weren't convincing enough to shout out a 'hit'. In fact, the trailer just shows the supers as regular people doing regular things. Nonetheless, I HAD to go see this highly anticipated sequel.<br/><br/>When I entered the theater and the first scene appeared, I felt as if I was watching the first movie. It opened up with the same sort of feeling, which makes sense because it is, indeed, The Incredibles. Then, the sequel continues over from the previous movie, and everything started to escalate from there. <br/><br/>An action-packed movie with family fun, The Incredibles 2 is one of the best sequels to ever be made.

"digitalbeachbum","1","0","2","24 June 2018"," I waited how long for this pile of trash?
","I thought the opening scenes were going to lead to something great. The Underminer is where they left off fourteen years ago, but it is a short lived event.
The script slips in to the old ""supers are bad"" again which happened the last time. Huh? WTF? We already knew that ""supers"" were disliked but that was all supposed to change at the end of the 1st movie.
Now you are going backwards again? That doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie is terrible, it could have been amazing, but they made the motivation less than admirable.
A good villain needs to have a complete hate of the Super and must have a personal connection.
Take Batman and Joker? Flash and Zoom? Superman and Lex?
Instead they come up with The Screenslaver? Who hates them why? Because they are Supers?<br/><br/>The Screenslaver hates Supers because their father and mother was killed when Supers disappeared.
Supers disappeared why? Because the Government get rid of them, so why the hatred against Supers and not the Government?
It was the Government which made them illegal.
Doh! Stupid script.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but this movie sucks. This is an example of terrible writing from people who don't get it.
The movie could have been so much more but they lack the ability to tell a good story
This is why Hollowood sucks these days. Everyone is a writer and no one seems to know what the hell they are doing.<br/><br/>Thumbs down and BARF on this movie.<br/><br/>The only good thing is the animation. The graphics are as good as they get from PIXAR.
I do not like Jack Jack who ends up being filler and a deus ex machina to push the movie along and fix all the plot holes.
Sure Jack Jack could have been a great character but when you give a baby all these super powers, then you lose motivation."

"NavyOrion","6","0","3","22 June 2018"," Remember how you felt after ""Independence Day 2""?
","2016. After a twenty-year gap, a sequel to the original ""Independence Day"" is finally released. Audiences flock to see ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" only to leave asking ""20 years, and THIS is the best they could do?"" ""Incredibles 2"" was NOT as bad as that, but it tried. <br/><br/>You'd think with 14 years to work on it, they could have come up with better than this. Director Brad Bird always said he wouldn't make a sequel to his brilliant original ""Incredibles"" until the right script could be developed. Don't think that the release of this film means it did; he just decided not to wait any longer.<br/><br/>A tired rehash of the original movie, albeit with new Jack-Jack antics and poop jokes thrown in, ""Incredibles 2"" indulges in the already-worn-out-its-welcome Hollywood trope of ""Let's do the same thing , but this time with a WOMAN!"" It didn't work for ""Ocean's 8,"" it didn't work for ""Estrogen Ghostbusters,"" and it didn't work here. There's nothing wrong with putting Elastigirl in the action, but if her character is not developed in the process (while simultaneously diminishing the character of Mr. Incredible) then it's just a pointless indulgence.<br/><br/>Combine that with an oversupply of subplots muddying things, and you end up with a movie that sorely lacks its predecessor's inventiveness and heart, or even its fast-paced storyline.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie will make tons of money, from kids who will be attracted to the flashy action sequences (but who WILL likely squirm and whine during some excessively-long pillow talk between Bob and Helen) and the adults who liked the first one and go to see this sequel out of nostalgia. Inevitably, there will be a third in the franchise, though likely WITHOUT Bird at the helm, and even more likely without the 14-year gap. Let's hope it is more like the original."
