","First, I must laugh at all the reviews of people who had no idea what they were watching. We must all realize that all films are not written for all people who watch. Just as I usually do not go see cartoon films, others should give good thought before seeing such an 'artsy' film as Mother!. Hey, if you didn't like Black Swan, think more than twice on this one.<br/><br/>Observation: <br/><br/>There is a fire. Woman's face burning up. When cut to Javier holding a crystal. He places the crystal on a metal stand and we watch the house start healing itself, starting at that crystal. We cut to other parts of the house, as it heals, from fire back to normal. Eventually we cut to a bedroom where we see the bed healing itself and someone under the covers. She arises and it is Mother, played by Jennifer. Odd names for a film, right, but the names are never said in the film. We learn that Him is an accomplished poet, but it seems like he is going through some type of writer's block. Mother's mission is to refinish the house. A lot has been done, but there is always more work to do. <br/><br/>A man played by Ed Harris knocks at the door and Him greets the man and allows him to enter, almost happy someone else is in the house. The man is a doctor, but he smokes and drinks which causes him getting sick, fairly easily. It doesn't bother Him, but Mother is quite concerned.<br/><br/>Soon someone else arrives, a woman played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Turns out the woman is the man's wife. She's a feisty one played convincingly by Pfeiffer. Mother seems confused why Him allows these strangers to stay in their house. The woman doesn't hold anything back when she has a conversation with Mother. The woman asks why they don't have a baby? Mother is pretty taken back by how forward the woman is. This does not bother the drunk woman.<br/><br/>The man & woman seem to find a fascination with the crystal. Mother tells them not to touch it, but eventually they sneak in the room and break it into 100's of pieces. Him becomes enraged! Mother wants the man and woman to leave, but they don't and it's seems Mother is powerless. Mother goes to their room and they are having sex so she leaves. Even though Him is very upset he does not ask them to leave. Are you putting the pieces together? 2 more guests, 2 sons arrive. They fight, one becomes badly hurt & Him, the man & woman take him to the hospital, but Him comes back and tells Mother he died. Soon people start showing up, apparently for the funeral for the son and as more arrive things become chaotic. Every person seems to represent something different. The house becomes a disaster as everyone starts stealing everything! <br/><br/>After everyone leaves Him & Mother have a fight which turns into sex. After Mother says she is pregnant. Him then becomes inspired to write a new poem. He gives it to Mother to read. She cries and tells Him it is magnificent. <br/><br/>People start showing up again to praise Him for his poem. It is at this point things start to become totally chaotic. Let's just say lots of people show up and Aronofsky puts things in overdrive! The insanity on the screen is brilliant and here is why I believe this <br/><br/>Interpretation: <br/><br/>The film is basically an allegory our entire existence, and then some. Him is G*d. Mother is Mother Nature or as Him calls her, home. Him creates man and woman as Mother Nature creates everything around them. The Poem is the Bible. The house is the world. The man is Adam, the woman Eve. The sons Cain & Abel. We then basically witness an insane, quick review from Christ to present time (about 20 minutes), and then the demise of mankind. The film's use of the crystal represents the 'Apple'.<br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/><br/>When we look at this film in its entirety, taking 2 steps back, we see the film summarizes man's existence. The beginning of the film shows he tried before, but failed. Our existence, most of the film, also fails. At the end, we see Him try once again. G*d's dilemma is free will. Him only leads by verse (the Bible), but man's interpretation is what creates conflict, as everyone has their own interpretation, thus anarchy eventually occurs & eventually obliteration. Eden gets a restart, over & over again.<br/><br/>I find the film to be amazing in scope, like Cloud Atlas or A's The Fountain. Like I said earlier, if you don't appreciate films like these, or even Black Swan don't bother. It's simply not your brand. I feel the film is an amazing encapsulation of our existence performed in very unique fashion. The message here is strong. I prefer the avant-garde probably because I've seen so many films. I need to view films that present something new, and this one certainly does. For me, it is a masterpiece. Aren't artists allowed to target their audience? They all can't have happy endings. My 1000 words worth."
"bzarras","6","537","828","11 September 2017"," Thick on analogies and symbolism, to the point of overkill
","I saw this at TIFF and the point this movie was trying to make became clear fairly early on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but as the story developed, the analogies and symbolism went into overkill, to the point where their excessive nature diminished what was an interesting story.<br/><br/>The movie is helmed by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, two actors I'm particularly fond of. The short summary of this movie is that they are a couple who live in a beautiful, remote home. One night they take in an unwanted house guest (Harris), more at Bardem's choosing than Lawrence's. This leads to countless other house guests and invasions from the outside world, often to the detriment of Bardem & Lawrence's beautiful home, and Lawrence's well-being. <br/><br/>As the movie goes on, these violations against the home and Lawrence get increasingly bizarre and excessive. They get laid on so thick that, even if you have figured out the analogy by the midway point of the movie and enjoy the way the movie is getting it's point across, the sheer madness that transpires in the second half of the film is likely to sour you on the overkill applied to the message. <br/><br/>It becomes fairly apparent that the house and Lawrence's character from which the movie is titled represent our planet. Bardem's character represents a creator/God (in credits, his character is simply known as 'Him'). Harris and Pfeiffer, the original, invasive guests, are the original Man & Woman (Adam & Eve), and from there, a lot of the plot initially descends from biblical references and then into His desire to provide for his followers and to be adored by them, ignorant of how detrimental they are to the house and Mother. <br/><br/>At the very end, the house becomes overpopulated with people who are both zealots and warmongers who descend into utter 'WTF' madness while they destroy the home, murder the couple's child, and force Mother to burn down the home she so painstakingly created, killing everyone inside it. After the fire, He carries her out, and recreates the home with a new Mother. <br/><br/>As I said, it's a story thick on symbolism and message. I personally liked what they were going for, but think it could have been a much better movie if they had done it far subtly than with the extreme overkill they employed in the second half of this film. Looking at the reviews, I see a lot of people torn by this movie, and I think for these reasons. Some people didn't clue into the message very well and just thought it was a movie that made no sense. Others may not have liked the pro-environment analogies, while some may have loved how excessive the movie hammered it's point home. Another group likely felt how I did - that the plot and point was unique and interesting, but the sheer madness the film careened into during the second half was extremely excessive.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 6/10, with disappointment that a promising concept wasn't executed more sensibly."
"aminrigi","7","361","576","13 September 2017"," Story of Life from a Religious Perspective
","Him is the God, the creator! Mother is the mother earth. Mother gives form and maintains the structure. God first invites Adam (the old man). Then from Adam's rib God creates Eve. Do you remember the scene in which Man's rib was wounded and he was throwing up?<br/><br/>Adam and Eve break the forbidden crystal (they ate the forbidden fruit).<br/><br/>Then we see the story of Abel and Cane. Cane kills Abel. Then mother's house, the earth, is populated with various religions and various ideologies. All of which pray God (or Him). But they become aggressive. They start to betray the earth. <br/><br/>And then the story of Jesus. Mother becomes Mary. It gives birth to Jesus. But Jesus followers eat him alive. They eat his blood and his flesh (wine and bread). And the story continues. The way the humanity is heading, Mother earth is doomed.<br/><br/>I liked the symbolism in this movie. But to me, as a semi-Nietzschean thinker, mother is the real God. For God is not separated from mother. God is mother's creation. <br/><br/>Mother = Earth. <br/><br/>I finish with this quote from Nietzsche:<br/><br/>""Remain faithful to the (mother) earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue. Let your gift-giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth. Thus I beg and beseech you. Do not let them fly away from earthly things and beat with their wings against eternal walls. Alas, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away. Lead back to the earth the virtue that flew away, as I do—back to the body, back to life, that it may give the earth a meaning, a human meaning."""

","First of all, please don't watch this film if you have trouble understanding metaphors & symbolism.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear that there are quite a number of reviews/rants on this page with people expressing their hate towards the story and how it's been portrayed on screen. It's strange because it looks like they had absolutely no idea what they were watching... it's trivial and shallow to publish a review without any research. However, I do agree that it isn't an easy one to sit through, but some of the greatest films aren't. So again, please don't bother checking it out if your mind is closed, you won't appreciate this masterpiece.<br/><br/>To help deter unaccommodating opinions being regurgitated, I'll try to explain what made the film worth your time.<br/><br/>I believe there are two themes that can be interpreted from Mother!! Therefore, the use of an additional explanation mark is required.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>Religious Theory;<br/><br/>Pretty sure the inconvenient truth to this theory is that when the sh*t hits the fan, mother doesn't like people messing up her house (Earth). Apparently, Darren Aronofsky is not religious but he likes strong environmental messages. He also wrote the script in 5 days.. how long did it take God to create the world? Just saying.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is (Mother) Earth — The house is Earth.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem (Him) is God — Creator of life on Earth, loves attention, and forgives everyone.<br/><br/>Ed Harris (Man) is Adam — Invited by God to Earth (aka house)<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer (Woman) is Eve — Created from Adam's rib (scene where Ed Harris was sick on the toilet)<br/><br/>The crystal is the forbidden fruit (apple)<br/><br/>The baby is the bread at the last supper ""Body of Christ""<br/><br/>Relationship Theory;<br/><br/>An extreme version of anxiety in a relationship that is deteriorating. The tense build-up in social interactions and how someone may view a scenario where they feel left out and forgotten. The jealousy someone feels when their bond is shared. Not paying attention to the needs of one another in a relationship. Having a baby to keep the relationship alive. All these emotions are magnified/multiplied by 100 to the point it's literally terrifying, so crazy that it may make you laugh. Finally, once the love has completely diminished, the only thing left is to leave and start again new.<br/><br/>Either way, this film is unique and original in the way it's portrayed, packaged and presented. <br/><br/>Hope you can appreciate the beauty of this Gothic religious tale / art-house opera and award the actors & production team that helped make it possible."
"inframan","1","8","9","9 April 2020"," Wretched
","The so-called religious symbolism is so heavy-handed it's as though it were written by someone with no imagination or appreciation for the language of the source material. From the opening scenes with the grotesque Bardem coarsely abusing the divine Warren to the flat phony sycophantic behavior of Ed Harris (first time I have ever disliked his performance) and on & on the film plays like a bad high school film class product. I don't know what Aronofsky's problem is but his films sure seem filled with enormous amounts of ugliness, anger & hatred being played out. Yuchh."
"joebloggscity","3","178","294","12 June 2018"," Religious allegories abound but really it's just pretentious nonsense
","Now I'm not one to disparage the director, I liked Requiem for a Dream and loved Black Swan, but this is a stinker and just simply boring. It's all just packed full of cod biblical allegories spread thickly throughout which tries to twist between different types of horror genres, but leaved me unintrigued. <br/><br/>Granted the settings, claustrophobic direction and acting are top notch but it shouldn't mask for what otherwise is a poor uninteresting movie. It unsettles and bores, way too much to care, and as the ending dragged on I was left increasingly frustrated as it refused to just shut up shop. <br/><br/>It's totally split opinion from what I've seen so far, and you'll struggle to find anyone in the middle on this one. In fairness, some credit to the film studios for risking this effort in launching it into mainstream cinemas but without the director it would have rightfully languished on cable late night showings.<br/><br/>There's no point going anymore into this. I simply hated it, and that despite being a major admirer of offbeat horror and psychological movies, but this isn't in the same league as for example Raw or Get Out, which is a shame. I'd recommend you pass on this there are far better films out there to go watch."
"matthewacollier","10","682","1218","16 September 2017"," Aronofsky's mother! will be hated by many, but loved by a precious few
","100<br/><br/>Horrifying. Just.. horrifying. Aronofsky really got me with this one. Not only did he manage to grab me on an intellectual level, but also on an emotional one. This movie is going to be hated by many, I know that now. But for me, this is, hands down, the movie of the year. Every shot, cut, and scream is perfectly constructed to make an immersive atmosphere that never relents in it's uncomfortable feeling, and the acting is seriously award worthy. Javier Bardem is absolutely wonderful, and Jennifer Lawrence... oh man... her performance is absolutely top notch. At first I couldn't quite relate to her character, but as the film progressed, her mindset became my mindset, and we essentially merged into one force of fear and terror that was absolutely unstoppable until the ending. I cannot praise her performance enough in this review. Her emotions leaked from every frame she was in, and it broke my heart and scared me witless the whole way through the film. Aronofsky's pacing is immaculate as well, the whole movie feeling not a second too slow or quick, the events rolling on naturally and in a way that felt very satisfying. The whole way through, I was riveted and invested by the acting and cinematography, which is definitely Aronofsky's best I've seen so far. The entire film is gripping, horrifying, heartbreaking, and absolutely wonderful. Nothing about this movie pulled me out of it. Watching this in a theater was like being in a bomb shelter while the world ended, every sound apocalyptic and every camera shake filling my view. If you can, watch this on the biggest screen you can with the best surround sound you can afford. If you only watch one movie this year, make it this one. This movie is incredible. This is why I study the movies."
"jdavidpayne","1","580","1035","23 September 2017"," a film that fails on multiple levels
","The principle rule of allegory is that it must function on two levels - the plain narrative, what the audience sees or reads, and the metaphorical, the level beyond the seen or read, usually conveying a deeper meaning. An allegory which fails as a narrative is a morality play; an allegory that fails on the metaphorical level is a nonsensical tale. <br/><br/>mother! fails on both levels, and the result is a confusing mess as likely to bore as it is to disgust. <br/><br/>The script is stark, but as opposed to offering up a Hemingway-esque brevity and punch, it instead descends to the level of drive by dialogue, actors delivering short statements with blank expressions and then leaving the room they're in. Granted, the actors only had Aronofsky's script to work with, and he's on record as saying it only took five days to write, which is visible in every scene. An undergrad brags about finishing their paper the night before it's due; a screenwriter should not laud a similar process for his film. <br/><br/>The only film that comes close to the delivery in mother! is The Room, which may very well be the superior of the two. And if you told me that Bardem, normally a captivating actor, had modeled his performance of Him on Wiseau's Johnny, I would readily believe you.<br/><br/>In fact, the only actor who brings any life to this joyless epic is Pfeiffer, whose facial expressions and tone elevate her sniping dialogue far above the written quality. She's also the only one who brings any passion to her role, as Lawrence seems to have been reduced to two speeds - blank expression and monotone speech, or screaming so hard she cracks a rib. All granularity seen in her previous performances is gone here. <br/><br/>The characters portrayed by normally fine actors are so small, so one dimensional, one barely cares about them as people, let alone as stand ins for something larger than themselves. I could muster neither sympathy nor even vague interest in the foibles and woes of this couple, nor their never-ending torrent of house guests. (Judging by the laughs in the theater, I wasn't the only one.) Their tragedies in the final third were grating, not because they were disgusting, or shocking, but because I was never interested in them to begin with. <br/><br/>The setting is a perfect mirror to Lawrence's acting, if not her character. The film takes places in a rustic, half finished house. As before with the script, any attempt at a spare beauty is never realized, and the end result looks like the set designers didn't want to spend too much time on something they knew would literally be ripped apart in the final act. The house is our only setting in this film, so its lack of visual interest is a massive detriment. <br/><br/>The cinematography is likewise lackluster, with nothing special to either set it apart or condemn it. It is filmed adequately. The story and performances were clearly meant to be the jewel here, a situation analogous to purchasing a workable frame only to enshrine pages from the 1988 Albuquerque phone book therein. <br/><br/>And since I brought up analogy, the elephant in the room, the roughshod Biblical allegory. Said allegory falls flat on its face as soon as its analyzed in the slightest. Lawrence is Aronofsky's self insertion character (in the style of bad fan fiction) to the Christian canon, a Gaia character who forms an unbalanced duality with Him, the writer's presentation of the Christian God. <br/><br/>Him is never very godlike, and his standing as ""God"" is simply revealed to us at the end, a classic example of telling and not showing. While observant viewers may be able to deduce his role from context earlier in the film, he is never characterized in a way that makes his stated role fit his perceived role. An allegory is not proclaiming a character to be other than they have been observed by way of a brief statement at the end. <br/><br/>The titular mother, the self insertion Gaia character, has a similar problem - she demonstrates none of the qualities common to portrayals of Mother Earth figures in fiction. Instead, she is aloof, credulous, and dense. If the point intended to be made was Aronofsky's self-proclaimed howl about the treatment of the planet, perhaps he should have created a Mother Earth figure that was remotely sympathetic, or relatable. What we have instead is a distant robot whose demise was met with yawns. <br/><br/>The revelation, easily predicted from the first scene, that this is a cycle these characters have been locked in since time immemorial, fails to shock or elicit a reaction, unless one counts exasperation. It also drives the allegory firmly off the rails, moving our underlying mythology from a Christian creation and eschatology to something more Eastern, with reality a cyclical illusion. <br/><br/>There was an opportunity here for a valid story to be told on multiple levels. We live in an era of man made climate change and contemporary Christianity is ripe for criticism. A more skilled writer and director could have pulled off a tale that would be as heartbreaking as it was true. And perhaps Aronofsky could have done that, had he taken his time and revised even the slightest bit. (However, as this is his second failure in a row that deals with Biblical themes, perhaps not.)<br/><br/>What we are treated to instead is the cinematic equivalent of soda crackers and a brief lecture by an inarticulate first year undergrad about religion and environmentalism. I wish I could end this with the famous quotation from King Lear, but it's not entirely accurate. We were only given the idea of sound and fury, not the genuine article. This film is the shadow of a shadow, and in that, at least, it does signify nothing."
"kirkstraight","8","361","638","17 September 2017"," Art's Not Safe
","Went to the first matinée available locally and I am still thinking the picture over. Will definitely see this one again, if it hasn't left the theatre abruptly. I was certainly horrified by the film, which is a good thing, as I had assumed it was a horror picture. It is, of course, much more than that. Nonetheless, it is NOT The Conjuring or Get Out (both good films, for sure), so just be warned.<br/><br/>By now you are aware that the film has been controversial, also a good thing. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job and her career is certainly not going to suffer for her performance. I am not exactly a JLaw ""fan"" (could live without the Hunger Games), although I will pay closer attention to her future performances, especially if she pulls off more roles like this one (really liked Winter's Bone, by the way). As I understand the Hollywood scene, it is a respectable personal decision to take on a challenging role in an avant garde picture, especially if you have already banked serious money from popular roles in blockbusters. Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Ed Harris also do their respective parts justice--a well-acted film by A-listers, overall. Camera work and special effects are also impressive.<br/><br/>The story is genuinely disturbing in a Requiem for a Dream way, so don't go if you can't handle that sort of thing. Some of the violence is, indeed, OVER THE TOP. Seriously, not for the faint of heart. Aside from the biblical allegory stuff, I found the character portrayals creepy as hell in a (sur?)realistic David Lynch-esque way. Hell is other people!<br/><br/>I applaud Mr. Aronofsky for keeping his vision intact all the way to the big screen. For reference, I just don't need any more movies based on superheros, comic books (except The Tenth or Gen 13), children's cartoons, vampires fighting werewolves, or horror stick about unfriending weirdos on facebook. <br/><br/>You will have to make up your own mind on this one, so please do just that. Even if you end up despising the film, try to remember that, to quote Rob Zombie, ""Art's Not Safe."""

This is like being locked in a cell with a stoned college student who can't shut up and thinks that every opinion they have, is the final word on a subject for 2 hours. Jennifer Lawrence should stick to roles that require her to paint herself blue or shoot arrows. Darren Aronofsky wants to be Luis Buñuel but he's closer to Uwe Boll. He cites The Exterminating Angel as the inspiration for Mother! I agree, in the sense that I did feel like one of the dinner guests who can't leave in Buñuel's classic during the course of watching Mother after paying 13 bucks to see this pretentious, heavy handed waste of time. Do yourself a favor, don't go see this movie, you won't get the 2 hours of your life back if you do. When it shows up on The Movie Channel playing at 3 in the morning in a couple of months, don't even set your DVR to record it.

","I was in the right mood for a smart horror film, they used to be my favorite kind of film until they sort of disappeared, the smart part not the horror. I'm a huge fan of Polanski's The Tenant - it terrified me more than any other film, followed shortly by 2 other Roman Polanski masterpieces, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. There are others - Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Martin Donovan's Apartment Zero, Alex De La Iglesias's La Comunidad, Davin Lynch's Eraserhead and Blue Velvet in particular. Most of Luis Bunuel's work and a few others. Mother! reminded me somehow of some of them but it was just like a tease that didn't really matured into anything.Here everything is outrageously on the nose but not in a phenomenal Ken Russell way but in a rather obvious, unconvincing, ""look at me"" kind of thing. I love Jennifer Lawrence but in Mother! she wakes up at the beginning of the film and she's already panicky. Please, don't misunderstand me, I'm not suggesting a prequel! No, clearly Darren Aronfski gave the audience too much credit or not enough because for me, as a member of the audience, left me cold. I may have winced at the sight of blood but it didn't frighten me. The ""wound"" on the floor? Remember the hole in the wall of ""The Tenant""? Maybe it's my fault. I've seen too many films and young audiences haven't. I've read some of the positive comments and I imagine they are from very young people who feel, quite rightly, they been given something besides Marvel and they have. I only hope they use it as a gateway to discover some of the ""old"" films. And as for Mother! what I enjoyed was the totally unexpected turn by Michelle Pfeiffer. Dark and funny, mocking or better still, paying tribute to Ruth Gordon - I imagine. I left the theater with a desperate need to revisit Rosemary's Baby and you know what? I will. So after all said and done, thank you."

I should think this is the penultimate epitome of pretentiousness and narcissism.<br/><br/>Yes, I got ALL the possible meanings of everything thrust into this amalgamation of horror and pseudo-philosophy tropes.

If you're the type of person who likes to look at a drawing that a 2 year created, perhaps consisting only of a poorly drawn circle, and somehow finds some hidden, deep meanings from that, then by all means, this movie is for you. Make it a religious circle to really make it interesting. Of the 1% of the people who feel this movie isn't the worst ever created, I figure ½ of them are trying to make it appear that they're smarter than everybody else, ¼ of them are internet trolls just trying to stir things up, 1/8 are family and friends of the director and actors, 1/16 are using some serious opioids and the last 1/16th are religious fanatics.

","I really like D. Aronofsky's films. As a whole, he has a solid corpus.<br/><br/>This film, however, had significant structural problems which shake its foundation as a film.<br/><br/>The film is split into two parts...Why? It's not clear. It's also not clear what the two plot-lines mean. There is not ""real"" connection to piece them together and the viewer is pushed to create their own...<br/><br/>This viewer sees a meaningless old testament - new testament relationship. But interplay? Not much. There seems to be a Cane and Able story in the first half. You know what happens... But how this is relevant to the main actors (the husband and wife) who take this couple and, subsequently, their two sons in. The husband and wife host the big family argument. Why? Dunno?<br/><br/>The second half, when J. Lawrence, has her child, we are thrust into a tired boy-Jesus plot line and his subsequent sacrifice a la New Testament plot themes. But why? And what do these two halves of the movie have to do with one another...apart from the first being an old testament story and the second being one from the new testament.<br/><br/>The ending is violent and contrived, yet is a very good dream sequence, albeit Lawrence is not dreaming (or is he?).<br/><br/>Two old Polanski homages, albeit super-heavy-handed, incessantly bombard you throughout the movie...The Apartment and Rosemary's Baby. But is it an homage or just meaningless lifting of motifs? The hole in the wall and the bloody hole (aka vagina) are direct parallels. As is the baby sacrifice or offering in both.<br/><br/>All in all it was watchable. Had some interesting points. Good camera work. Good effects. But the story doesn't hold up on any level, except in the mind of some viewers who need to stitch it together and make sense of it themselves in their own way...Perhaps that was the abstract goal."

","Darren Aronfsky is a director I follow, even since Pi. He's daring and unpredictable. I loved Requiem For A Dream and Black Swan, the rest of his opus has left me puzzled or downright annoyed. Mother! belongs to the later. All the element's were there - Rosemary's Baby written by Edward Albee - that's what I thought right up to Michelle Pfeiffer's entrance, then something happened - The movie falls through a totally unbelievable, hysterical downward spiral. What? Yes, exactly. Jennifer Lawrence suffers, puffs and moans from the very first frame, well second frame. She's afraid from the word go. She could run away but for some reason she never ventures out of the house. Questions like that become a massive obstacle for us to care and feel connected - Think of Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby or Colin Firth in Apartment Zero - co-habitating with a devil, surrounded by sinister neighbors or unwanted visitors. Those films also had sensational scripts and the narrative even when symbolic was always solidly based on the story at hand - Here it feels like gimmicks - One idea and then round and round the mulberry bush. I don't know how many times she shouts at her husband ""Please make them leave"" - Jennifer Lawrence goes through it valiantly and vociferously. Javier Bardem as the egomaniacal husband is absurdly unconvincing - and I'm a devoted a fan - Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who brings something new to the proceedings and a truly startling performance. Other than that, I'm sorry to say no to Mother!"

","These days, we live in a world where most things are terrible and don't make any sense. Yet, a film like Mother! can still come along and disgust audiences. A film so off-putting, Rex Reed declared it ""The worst film of the century"". Make no mistake, Mother! is a profoundly polarizing film. But that is only because it went mainstream. It stars mainstream actors. It's distributed by Paramount. In recent years, the art-house and the multiplex have never crossed paths. But as the era of the blockbuster fades away, it was only a matter of time for Hollywood to return back to it's roots. To bring us back to the late 1960's, where most films meant something. Films that grab you. Films that push serious boundaries. I rarely leave a theater shaken. But Mother! did just that. It is a beautiful, terrifying assault on your senses.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem play a lovely couple. Bardem is a struggling poet, while Lawrence tends to her house obsessively. Everything seems fine on the surface. What's that, you ask? The house has a heart! I admit the deed! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It's the beating of his hideous heart! ... and scene. Thank you for indulging me. No seriously, the house has a heart.. and internal organs. It's a living entity. I heard of the phrase ""Home is where the heart is"" but this is ridiculous. Is it? Lawrence plays someone that wants to be a mother to something. Her house? What happens when adoring fans come rushing in to see Bardem? Unwelcome visitors all! They wreck the house and impede on Lawrence's hard work. This must not go on. To fill the void, Bardem and Lawrence conceive a child. As the days go on, the guest list becomes bigger and bigger. By the film's midpoint, the house becomes a small city of thieves and squatters. After that, I must not share anymore. Because if you're already confused by what I'm telling you.. you don't know what confused is, my friend.<br/><br/>How does one interpret Mother! It's the quintessential art-house/midnight movie. Therefore, anything is plausible. Aronofsky intended it that way. He juggles many concepts and critiques about life itself. Motherhood, paranoia, fame, claustrophobia, selfishness, lust, rage, war, peace, religion, gender, history.. Mother! is whatever you want it to be and more. If you know that going in, this will be a breeze. If you don't, you will loathe every second of this film and I won't blame you. It is a lot to swallow. The climax of the picture is well orchestrated insanity. Arguably, the most intense sequence of events captured on screen since Children of Men. By comparison, Requiem for a Dream is almost entirely palpable. You sit back in your seat and think ""Enough already. This is too much. Wow. It's not stopping. Please stop."". But that is precisely the point. Aronofsky does not let up until you are mentally drained from watching. But at least to ease some of the pain, you see a lot of Jennifer Lawrence's face, up-close. Most of the film is on her face. In real life, she is in a relationship with Aronofsky. Coincidence? No, not a coincidence. This is the mark of a filmmaker madly in love with his star. On an emotional level, that shows.<br/><br/>Mother! is not a film to go into blind.. but that certainly helps the experience. Polarizing, disturbing films are not crowd pleasures by any stretch, but that's never been an area that bothers me. Films like these fascinate me. Their lack of decorum fascinates me. The reactions from the audience fascinate me. On Lars Von Trier's best day, he couldn't have conjured a film like Mother! .. and if he did, he would've have let it be seen in a shopping mall."

It seems like a terrible confession to make but the truth is I couldn't care less about that mother because I didn't believe in her plight and couldn't understand her behavior. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress we all know that but here, she screams and screams while I glanced at my watch with mounting impatience. Borrowing from other, better films, doesn't help, on the contrary, it irritates. Rosemary's Baby came to mind as well as The Tenant, Apartment Zero, Common Wealth.

First Man (Ed Harris: Gravity, A Beautiful Mind) and then Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer: Stardust, Scarface), a thinly veiled Adam and Eve, invade their space, then their sons Oldest Son (Domhnall Gleeson: The Revenant, About Time) and Younger Brother (Brian Gleeson: Snow White and the Huntsman, Assassin's Creed), followed by more and more until they are overrun.<br/><br/>Despite excellent acting from Lawrence and Pfieffer, Bardem sadly is less convincing, the film is an exercise in overkill. From the burned heart turning into a crystal (it would really turn to ash that would float away) to the patch of blood shaped like a vagina that refuses to go away, this is a film that wallows in self- indulgence and, despite what some critics may say, lacks originality. Anyone that knows their bible can see the Cain and Abel and the plagues etc. but the allegories and imagery he has taken from the Bible are ruined by deliberate shock tactics, robbing them of any true meaning leaving a film of no substance where nothing really happens.

Aronofsky says he wrote the screenplay in six days, which just blows my  mind. It is so intricate and delicately designed, that I don't know how  he was able to write it in less than a week. I think it just goes to  show how much of a pure genius Aronofsky is. This is a movie that is  driven 100% by its story and its screenplay. Everything else, from the  camera angles, to the score, to the performances, are in service to  that script. So it's hard to sit here and say ""Oh, well the  cinematography is gorgeous"" or ""Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in the  film"", because their purpose was not to stand out on their own.  Everything they did was to enrich and drive forward this story, and  that doesn't necessarily work for every film, but it absolutely works  here. This film is made by the deep complexity of its metaphors and  allegories, and by its social and theological analysis of our past,  present, and future.

Speaking of misery, as I was watching the film, I wondered if the writer/director harbored a great deal of sorrow inside. Clearly this man feels that the core of everyone in this world is evil.

During that process, he came up with the idea for this film, writing the screenplay in 5 days. He claims that the film is ""a psychological freak-out. You shouldn't over-explain it."" But that doesn't mean that people didn't fall all over themselves trying to! <br/><br/>Star Jennifer Lawrence - also Aronofsky's muse during filming - Lawrence claimed that the film as an allegory that ""depicts the rape and torment of Mother Earth. I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of God, a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an Eve to Ed Harris's Adam, there's Cain and Abel and the setting sometimes resembles the Garden of Eden.""<br/><br/>Sure. That works.<br/><br/>Or it could be about the environment and how we're killing it.<br/><br/>Or it could be about what it's like to be a creator and see your work destroyed.<br/><br/>Or it could be a cover version of Rosemary's Baby that gets way too out of control.<br/><br/>Or you could see it like I did, a movie that somehow got into the hearts and minds of the movie intelligentsia and demanded an explanation when you can see that it wears its narrative beats and allegories on its bloody sleeve. At one point - spoilers if you made it this far - I said, once the baby is born, that's the end of the Old Testament and there will be a break in the action and then they'll start eating the baby like it's Holy Communion. I'm certain that folks were really upset by this scene (my used copy from Family Video has a WARNING - NO RENTAL UNDER 18 sticker), but it's almost like a punchline. Or I'm insane. Probably.<br/><br/>But then why is Ed Harris a doctor? Why do we spend so much time in the laundry room? Why do vaginal openings show up in Ed's back (yes, he's Adam and that could be where his rib was taken from, I get it, I get it) and the floor? Oh the questions mother! will make you ask and immediately regret for putting any thought behind a movie which had to have been a piss take.<br/><br/>This is a movie that wants to be an allegory and then wants to be a narrative film. Like - why does 911 answer the phone like this is in the real world when we've already accepted that mother is Mother Nature? And why does God need a starship (sorry, I wanted to get a Star Trek V: The Final Frontier reference into this).<br/><br/>What's with that yellow water? Oh, that's just a reference to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper. Of course. We all knew that.<br/><br/>While the film had generally positive responses from critics, it got a cinema score of an F*, which suggests that the film goes out of its way to upset audiences. When confronted by these numbers - and diminishing box office returns - Aronofsky blamed moviegoers' rejection of science, saying, ""You have other people who basically believe in the power of an iPhone that they can communicate to 35 million people in a blink of an eye, yet they don't believe in science in other ways. We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you. And the reason I wanted to come is because I was very sad and I had a lot of anguish and I wanted to express it."" <br/><br/>Incredibly, IMDB reports that Paramount canceled the upcoming Friday the 13th film in order to move ahead with this film. I have no idea why both of those movies couldn't exist in the same universe - other than the fact that this film was originally due to come out on October 13.<br/><br/>I love that the director wrote a letter to audiences before the film came out. With phrases like ""From this primordial soup of angst and helplessness, I woke up one morning and this movie poured out of me like a fever dream"" and ""I can't fully pinpoint where this film all came from. Some came from the headlines we face every second of every day, some came from the endless buzzing of notifications on our smartphones, some came from living through the blackout of Hurricane Sandy in downtown Manhattan, some came from my heart, some from my gut. Collectively it's a recipe I won't ever be able to reproduce, but I do know this serving is best drunk as a single dose in a shot glass. Knock it back. Salute!"" this letter is full of as much pretension as the film and made me giggle just as hard.<br/><br/>Has there ever been a film that equates the Great Flood with an improperly braced sink and the struggle of home repair? No. There sure hasn't, up until now.<br/><br/>In case you didn't get that Javier Bardem was God when he says, ""I am I"" and that the end of the world was what we saw at the end by Patti Smith singing The End of the World, well, then now you do.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that people will rent on Netflix and tell all of their friends not to watch. Or they'll be shocked. Or they'll fall asleep (the last ten minutes of this film were a Bataan death march of me battling against ennui and boredom). Is it the most shocking film ever, one that sends millennials crying into their blogs? Dude. In a world where A Serbian Film, The Man Behind the Sun and Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom exist - any number of grindhouse faves like Dr. Butcher, M.D., The New York Ripper and Cannibal Holocaust fit the bill - this film is a trifle. I just love that we're insulated ourselves from culture and art attacking us that we can be upset by such a glancing blow.<br/><br/>Should you watch it? Man, don't ask me what to do. Decide for yourself."
"andrewors","5","202","393","22 September 2017"," Fierce debate, how wonderful
","I have a nagging feeling that the raves come from people in their 20's and/or younger. I maybe wrong but the debate erupting from this movie reeks of youth. Something similar happened with Terrence Malnick's The Tree Of Life. People either loved it or hated it. From my own personal POV the only different between The Tree Of Life and Mother! is that The Tree Of Life was a masterpiece without any visual cope outs and, perhaps, the only commercial concession were in big star names but even then Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career. Mother ! Is not a masterpiece, not to me anyway. I couldn't connect. Was it a comedy of the absurd? When I saw all the people dancing and partying in the house I had a flash back to Blake Edwards's ""The Party""Jennifer Lawrence is a truly gifted actress and beautiful to boot and, quite clearly, she put herself in Darren Aronfski's hands, She, the mother, calls out ""Baby""? Hoping to find her husband - She is a Saint Joan half burned already. That truly puzzled me. Can you please give us time to connect with her? A few minutes. If you remember Mia Farrow's Rosemary - She was, emotionally, so far away from what she's about to confront. Polanski takes the audience through her journey and we're with her, every step of the way. What makes it so terrifying is the veil of normalcy that surrounds the proceedings. In Mother, the surreal takes over the atmosphere and destroys it. We can keep a distance without really participating. The same can be said of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer - They are a welcome, semi-camp addition at the perfect time and then, they disappear. The glory of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer in Rosemary's Baby is that their intrusion is taken all the way through to extraordinary results. And Javier Bardem/John Cassavetes? If you're interested watch Rosemary's Baby again like I did last night, 24 hours after seeing Mother!and then you tell me. In my modest opinion one is a flawless masterpiece the other is just okay."

Because the worst part in The Square, the big flop in it (those who watched it know what I mean), has many in common with Mother's most shocking scene.

"jtindahouse","8","136","261","14 September 2017"," A little tedious to watch, but the concept is brilliant
","Some people would say you have to be a genius to make films like Darren Aronofsky does. I would also add to that that you have be a genius to watch and appreciate his films. By the end of 'Mother!' I felt like I had been hit by a truck. The film is almost hypnotic in the way it beats you to your knees and keeps you there for the entire run time. It's a film that almost doesn't want to be liked if that makes sense. The less you like it, the better it has done its job.<br/><br/>Without discussing the metaphor this would be a very hard film to review (because that is in essence everything), so let's get into some spoilers. As I understand it, Javier Bardem's character is 'God' or 'Him' as he is listed in the credits. The film serves as a commentary on how (according to the Bible at least) all God wants is attention and to be loved, no matter how many people in the real world have to be destroyed, killed or blown up for him to achieve that.<br/><br/>Now, to say that's a controversial subject to make a film about is an understatement. But you have to respect Aronofsky for being bold enough to take that plunge. There are some brilliant film makers working in the world today, but when you consider their career paths, a lot of them have played it very safely.<br/><br/>'Mother!' is quite a tough film to review. If you judged it purely on its watchability factor you'd probably have to go quite low. If you judged it purely on the metaphorical story it is trying to tell, I think you'd have to consider it nearly perfect. I've decided to rest somewhere in the middle with an '8'. The only thing I can safely promise that you'll find about this film, is that it's utterly unique."
"stephaniekgreen","1","70","128","17 September 2017"," Abhorrently bad
","Spoiler/PSA ahead (If only someone had ""spoiled"" the film for me!)<br/><br/>This film is abhorrently bad. I've seen bad films before, but never have I left a theater feeling disgusted, angry, nauseous, and even betrayed. They were pretty tight-lipped about what this film is actually about, and now I see why. It wasn't to guard a clever plot twist (there isn't one), it was because if the audience knew the level of gratuitous horror and violence they were about to witness most would never sign on. I genuinely feel deceived. I would have never gone to see this film had I known. I would've preferred a Saw movie - at least both the audience and the director are on the same page about what is being produced and consumed.<br/><br/>This film ruined more than just my Saturday night. It ruined some of my favorite actors for me as well. Lawrence, Bardem, Pfieffer, Harris (even Kristin Wiig?!) - I actually judge them for their participation in this film. They gave good performances which were rendered completely irrelevant by this grotesque, stupid, and increasingly desperate film. It also ruined other Aronofsky films for me. I loved The Wrestler. It was soul crushingly sad, but it was beautiful. Mother! is so distastefully bad that it leaves me questioning the validity of Aronofsky's other successes. <br/><br/>Spoiler alert! If your idea of a good time is watching a newborn infant smashed, ripped apart, and eaten in front of his mother in graphic detail, then by all means - head to the theaters! To say that this scene crossed a line for me is a gross understatement. As a mother (or perhaps just a human?) I felt physically ill watching this wildly unnecessary scene (I'm sure the director will disagree with me about its ""necessity"" but he's kidding himself). I can't imagine the lies everyone involved had to tell themselves to justify that scene. It wasn't ""profound"" it wasn't ""art"", it was simply desperate and basic and disgusting and in no way justifiable. Even without that scene the movie is completely irredeemable. It is (hopefully) the worst movie I will ever see."

Such combos usually lead to deadly, expansive 'flights of fancy', just plain unwatchable stuff. It's a shame, too, as the synopsis sounded OK enough. Jennifer Lawrence, it seemed, may have thought she was in another film. Darren could've handed her the wrong script as her 'acting' played no significance to the actual film, itself.

"tigerfish50","1","25","41","1 October 2017"," From Eden to Armageddon in 2 Hours
","Darren Aronofsky invariably churns out flaccid potboilers when he attempts to impress audiences with his intellectual virility. From the opening scene of 'Mother', he cranks the Pretentiousness dial up to 11 as a young woman wakes alone in the bedroom of an isolated country house. Her husband is absent, so she wanders about in an agitated state searching for him. After she finds him, their wooden conversation reveals he's a poet with writer's block. Later that day, a stranger knocks at the door, and the poet invites him to stay after learning he's a fan of his work. The next morning, the man's wife arrives - soon followed by a pair of bickering sons.<br/><br/>These six characters proceed to act out a fatuous re-telling of the Genesis myth depicting the antics of God, Nature, Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel. With acting, direction and screen-writing at the level of amateur dramatics, Aronofsky presents God as a vain, manipulative, impotent older man, Nature as his whiny trophy wife, the Creation as their residence and the rest of human history as an out-of-control house party. After Noah's flood is symbolized by some drunken vandalism, burst pipes and a soggy kitchen, mankind's sorry tale grinds on into the 20th century. Eventually it arrives at Aronofsky's puerile imagining of Armageddon, which comes not a moment too soon."

","Don't let my rating effect how you judge the movie, but I just came from the cinema and feel a huge need to vent, so you are going to be my audience. First of all, I have to be totally honest with you. I am one of those people who have to finish a movie before making a judgment and putting a review out there in the world. Second of all, David Aronofsky is one of my favorite movie-makers, director, producer, writer, for a while now. The Fountain is my favorite movie of all times, the only movie I wasn't a big fan of was Noah. Mother! has been on my To See-list ever since word came out it went into production and even more after seeing the trailer. I was so excited to go and see it. This must have influenced my expectations of this movie. Also, and that's where the review title comes from, I might have been influenced by the audience that was in the cinema I was in. The room was almost full, over 200 people and I went alone because I wanted to experience it in my own cocoon, not having to explain why I loved the movie so much to friends who might think otherwise. And yes, I've read raving reviews and also read about people thinking it was pretentious. So why this title? Why just a rating 1? First: how to get a cinema empty? By the time the war broke out, there were only 7 people of the 200 left, myself included. How to miss a point so much with a movie? it gives you little hints, with the chrystal, you must think either he's this or either he's that. There was one point in the movie, I can't recall when and don't want to give any spoilers, that I felt I was questioning myself if I was dreaming or not. I could just not be watching this, was I? It just didn't make sense. Yet, people kept leaving, should I leave? No, I have waited so long for this movie to come out, I should sit it out. There must be an explanation in the end. Then, the wtf moment when Kirsten Wiig appeared and she just felt so miscast in this miss. I'm not a fan of her, but it totally felt as if she just came from any other movie she made and just stumbled into this one.<br/><br/>Somehow I have to give credits to this movie. Even though the images were grainy, some shots were visually stunning, some scenes were fantastically acted, some monologues were fantastically written.<br/><br/>How to disappoint a fan? How to really be pretentious, even though I was ready to totally defend that? How to make a viewer feel so much emotions and not guide them into giving them a place while watching your work. How to abuse the art of movie-making? That last one is meant for a good reason, because making art is an art itself. you make it to make a statement, to evoke emotions, reactions, anything. But it only evoked anger, misunderstanding and for me sadness, because I can no longer just go to the cinema when another Aronofsky movie comes out. For one simple reason:<br/><br/>How can this movie be unseen? I seriously wish I had never ever seen this movie. But that can't be taken away. So that's why I can only give it a 1 star rating. Even though the movie can be seen as art."

","Check out my ratings. Almost 1800 movies. All with a fair scoring!<br/><br/>""If we want something new at the movies,"" he said, ""you give them something new"" and they say, 'What the hell is that?'<br/><br/>That's what Aronofsky said. I'm currently working on my own script(s) and I'll start off with a low budget feature that I'm going to make with my own money. My script has a very original twist that is easy to notice, to understand and it's also simple but it will f.. your head up. Especially if you remember the firt scene of the movie. I just had to think about it for a day. It's all original, not a movie or book has such a twist. <br/><br/>I liked Aronofsky's works. Black Swan is a true 10 movie for me. But mother is not something new. It's a series of pointles acts that are just coming and making no sense. Beside this and beside that every character acts like they are crazy the movie doesn't even care about time! The ending of the movie or any other scene did not explain anything. All along the morbid humor and the pointles violence tried to keep up my interest but it massively failed. Aronofsky is massively failed. <br/><br/>One of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Aronofsky thinks this is something new and it's good he should see a doctor. If you think it was good you should also see a doctor.<br/><br/>p.s.: don't make reviews where you try to explain what happened in the movie while you gave it 10 star. google it and Aronofsky says it all."

I can only assume that whoever wrote this had a breakdown and finished it in a padded cell with crayons. What seems like an interesting story-line, which sees the poet taking in some strangers, who cause havoc, suddenly takes a surreal turn, which just becomes more and more ridiculous.

We saw the film three days after it opened and were one of two couples in the theater (a total of 4 people in the cinema!); the other couple left halfway through the movie. In retrospect, we should have gone with them.<br/><br/>Seldom (if ever) have I seen a film with so little dimension! How Aronofsky could be so pretentious as to claim that the film was about climate change and that Lawrence represented Mother Earth is beyond me! Clearly a victim of her husband's unrelenting narcissism and emotional abuse, her character was more symbolic of a door mat!<br/><br/>The movie raised many more questions than it answered (not to mention, ""Why did we waste our time and money?""). What was wrong with Ed Harris and why was it significant? What was the yellow powder that Lawrence took whenever she had an ""attack?"" Why did Lawrence dumbly accept Bardem's comment ""Where will they go?"" whenever she encouraged him to oust Harris and Pfeiffer (he was a doctor, and they had grown kids worrying about their estate, after all)? Of course, the overriding question is ""What was the point?"" <br/><br/>To refer to this pompous rhetoric as drivel is to insult drivel!

Aronofsky completely loses himself over an idea and forgets to tell a story. <br/><br/>It's not that a film needs to have a certain storyline or points or profound happy endings and all that. It's just a matter of a movie being worthwhile. Our time is our most valuable asset in this world. And this movie just isn't worth the time.
This film is a pointless charade. A tour de force of how a good craftsman can completely decide against giving the audience anything than a glimpse of an idea.. YES this film has a message to you and it is BIG but it is in essence also completely pointless as a film. Keep those 121 minutes of your life and spend them on something worthwhile... I would say the message of this film would be worthy of a 6 minutes short film or the Breaking News banner of CNN. Not a bad message, and not unimportant either.

I've enjoyed all of Darren Aronofsky's films except for this thing. The last 30 minutes are so incoherent that it's not even offensive. It's just stupid. The only way to even get a bit of enjoyment from it is to view it as camp. The house's explosion near the end is what made realize that camp is exactly what this film is and will eventually become.

I've seen very few films (*VERY* few in many thousands) where my feeling can be summed up with the old cliche ""those are 2 hours I'll never get back"", but this is one of them. A cinematic experience I'd definitely not want to repeat again!"

"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","2","61","114","16 September 2017"," This is the worst film I've seen this decade
","Allow me to clarify that this is not the worst shot (except for the framing), written, or acted film of this decade; in fact, the production of this film was overall quite strong, and I think the payoff was anything but lackluster or disappointing. The film also isn't at fault for having a misleading trailer, though thankfully I tend to watch films before I see their respective promotions. However, the build-up for it was unnerving to sit through as an audience member, watching characters whose actions and ideals don't relate to me or anyone else. In that way, it was kind of like The Mist. I wanted to throw objects at the screen.<br/><br/>The characters had no other purpose than to serve this film. That's it. Unlike any other film in history, they don't seem to be in a universe that mirrors ours or is a fantasy version of ours, or what have you. Even if Star Wars or A Bug's Life isn't real, at least they have established the existence of it within the film's construct. Whereas for mother!, if time did not exist before or after the events of this film, it wouldn't matter. Nothing would be lost or gained. There is no understanding of its construct. It simply 'is' and it doesn't seem like the characters have a clue that they aren't in something that resembles our world. I think this is where the biggest mistake is made. Somebody mentioned this would work well as a play, and I actually agree. Not as a movie, though.<br/><br/>I went through my Blu-ray collection and I asked myself: ""What other films represent a universe that a set of characters don't accept, believe, or is not cognizant about its unbounded principles?"" I couldn't come up with any, because eventually they all seem to find their way in, or it just takes the characters time to get the audience to feel out that kind of universe. In that case, the films that I came up with were: The Adjustment Bureau, Stranger Than Fiction, and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. STF is really the only one that comes close, but the awareness factor still kicks in. Not to mention it's actually a good film.<br/><br/>Let me put it to you this way: pick any musical out there, where characters just spontaneously burst into song and dance in unison and music somehow is playing as well. Let's pretend there was a film where this happens, and the onlookers who are not a part of the number start flipping out, wondering what is going on, try and intervene to stop them, etc. but the singing characters are completely unfazed by their attempts and just keep going... and after the song is over, they go on with their lives like that singing never happened (which is kind of how I imagine they ""really"" go). That's what this film felt like, only it plays out more like a Black Swan-esque psychological horror. This film just felt nightmarish: impressive feat, but in the wrong context of being a completely metaphorical film it became a very unappreciative watch. The characters become helpless in their want to bestow basic fundamentals of humanity upon each other, which as I understand this is a point of the film in itself, it just does not work well when presented as an allegory.<br/><br/>Speaking of the context (thematic spoilers ahead), mother! is basically a re-telling of the Book of Genesis, where certain characters and items play parts of the book, and Jennifer Lawrence's character is mother nature itself. Yet again, the problem is the characters for the most part don't know that this is what they are, so when they expect things to pan out like it does in real life and it doesn't happen, they don't have a clue why and don't realize their world had no past, perhaps has no future, and really is just serving one greater purpose: to be a film. This is not what storytelling is about, no matter how clever Aronofsky was in pulling this together (mind you, it all came off as very pretentious). And this wouldn't be such a bad thing if the movie didn't upset you with literally every character, but it did and I could not look past any of it.<br/><br/>By no means did this film fail to do anything that it intended (though people seeing the trailer and expecting a house invasion horror film will be very disappointed), but to green light this thing in the first place and give it a budget seems asinine. To quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park: ""They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" This art house film brings the audience no enjoyment of their theatrical experience, no commentary regarding the fabrication of human nature and societal flaws, no deeper extrapolation of biblical events, and simply it does not make a purpose statement. This has been my least favorite movie-going experience of the decade, even though that is not at fault of the director's execution."
"aristotevsplaton","1","58","108","30 September 2017"," Devolves into simplicity from beginning to end
","I want to state, to begin with, that even when a movie intends to be highly metaphorical and symbolic, its purpose is still to be entertaining. Mother! wasn't.<br/><br/>If the trailer caught your eye, or if you expected to see something scary, you will be disappointed. I have strong feelings about this movie. I think it might be the worst I ever saw. They have to do with the camera work itself, the scenario, the use of symbolism and metaphor, and most of all with the abject simplicity the director fell into.<br/><br/>First the camera work. If you are a lover of Aronovsky, you will be happy to see he hasn't changed a thing from the way he directed Black Swan. The similarities between both movies are so staggering I sometimes had the impression I was watching Nathalie Portman, not Jennifer Lawrence. It is of course an unusual and daring method used, but it ceases to function after one movie. In a way it is disappointing to see a supposedly talented director so unable to innovate and clinging to his own style.<br/><br/>Onto the scenario. The screenplay is tremendously poor and bad. Few words are uttered, but more importantly, they lack any significance. At no point is the audience allowed a glimpse into the psyche of any of the characters due to this lack of exchange between them. Facial expressions are your only clue, and they are static throughout the movie. This is a big let down if you loved Aronovsky for Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>The use of symbolism and metaphors is usual with this director, and so I expected to be fed plenty of it. Only metaphors are interesting and intriguing when they aren't so blatantly obvious. I read some of the comments here, stating that those who didn't like the movie simply didn't understand it. I disagree. It is hard not to understand that the house is alive, and the mother, ultimately, when on several occasions the main character touches it only to feel its pulse, or sees it bleed. It also isn't hard to grasp the religious metaphor there, what with the rituals in the end and the human sacrifice. This is my main objection here. The symbolism in the movie is fed to the viewer, whether you want it to be or not, instead of being suggested. Suggestions are absolutely nonexistent. So much for intrigue and suspense. There is no possibility for the audience to make up their mind about the movie's significance or its scope. This is what I call cheap symbolism, the kind you would find in a 8th grader's essay.<br/><br/>Bringing me to my last point, the simplicity that Aronovsky fell into writing and directing this movie. Nothing was new in his camera work, the movie looks exactly like his last one, the scenario is nonexistent, the characters are plain and without any depth, the symbolism is force fed to you and the evolution of the movie isn't based on anything. This is a poet who, through his latest work, manages to stir up such a wave of fanaticism in his readers that within a single day he moves masses of followers into rage, anger, murder, human sacrifice and cannibalism. Yet at no point are we told about his writing or the power of his poetry. This is like an author telling you about a joke that would be the funniest in the world, without telling you what the joke was. It is too easy and it doesn't solve the puzzle. The metaphors are there for you to swallow, you have no choice in the matter, yet the one part of the movie that could give any sense to the intrigue is hidden from the spectator, and the only valid reason I can find is that Aronovsky couldn't find anything good enough to support his intrigue. It is cheap, easy, simplistic, and undeserving of a 7 as a general grade on this website.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that, as it should, his career will suffer from this."

Sure the director has a very clear cinematic and directorial ambition to accomplish and there are meanings in all the plots, sub plots, etc.and he explains it's an allegory, but please do not forget, no matter how ambitious your artistic aspiration is, your story has to MAKE SENSE! And this is the biggest problem of this movie. The whole plot is an accumulation of crazy mumble jumble and pushes the audience into a lost land. The director forgets the audience goes into a theater to entertain. They do not spend their money to kill their brain cells to understand your over the top cinematic nightmare.<br/><br/>This is not because ""this movie is saved only for those sophisticated audience"" - we have been watching lots of artistic indie movies and this one is simply not that. The glorious, hefty directorial self indulgence simply falls under its own weight.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, you can save your ten bucks to watch something else. I was disappointed to waste more than two precious hours of my time on this flop. And DO NOT always trust a movie critics opinion.

I have to say I saw so many scenes borrowed and repackaged from a little indie film called House Of Good And Evil, which I saw on the SYFY channel a year back. I'm not saying the plots are the same, but I am saying there are at least 10 scenes I found remarkably similar. HGE sticks out as an influence on a few levels, as do several other films, but with that said, this film was a mess and I can see why it only took 5 days to write. I understand the metaphors, but damn, this film went overboard to the point of losing the average audience member. You have to be a huge Aronofsky fan from the beginning to let it slide.

""You are a Genius"", they screamed, as they held the finished script up to the heavens, ""You are the greatest visionary cinema has ever seen!"". And Aronofsky saw that it was good.<br/><br/>This is what I imagine was going through this egomaniacs mind as he wrote this abomination.

Of those critics who endorse ""Mother!"" many seem to be leading their defense of the picture with a vague suggestion that they like it because they're really, really smart, and the rest of us in the audience are dumb, dumb, dumb.

And the audience's reaction to ""Mother!"" is historic in its emphasis.<br/><br/>CinemaScore, a Las Vegas-based polling service which surveys audience opinion of a motion picture on a scale from A to F based on exit interviews with theater patrons, reports an average audience score of F for ""Mother!""

CinemaScore conducted their interviews with movie patrons while they were on their way out of a screening, undoubtedly still furious for having spent a substantial chunk of change on the experience.

Some viewers might remember ""Noah"" as the movie which revealed that giant three- armed monsters made of rocks did most of the heavy lifting as Noah built the Ark—a point later explained to have been subjective, but was suspected by many observers to have been included in the picture as a means of luring in the ""Transformers"" audience.<br/><br/>Starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, ""Mother!"" nominally depicts the disruption of a married couple's tranquil life when unexpected guests arrive at their home. But actually, ""Mother!"" is an allegory—nothing is what it seems. The characters and situations are symbolic, and are designed to illustrate the director's interpretation of events described in the Old Testament. This notion is augmented by the names of the characters—Man, Woman, Him, Oldest Son, Younger Brotherand naturally, Mother.<br/><br/>One of the likely problems with the reception is that ""Mother!"" has been seemingly marketed as a horror picture, a sort of distaff, opposite version of 1968's ""Rosemary's Baby."" The misleading marketing was an error which ""Mother!"" star Jennifer Lawrence took to the television talk show circuit to correct, prior to the picture's release. <br/><br/>But instead of clarifying the issue, the infallibly candid Lawrence effectively further obscured the point by acknowledging that she didn't know precisely what ""Mother!"" is, except that it's brilliant and intense. During post-premiere interviews, Lawrence even actually seemed acknowledge that ""Mother!"" goes at least a little too far.<br/><br/>Which might be the understatement of the week. More than a reimagining of the Book of Genesis, ""Mother!"" sometimes more closely resembles a reimagining of Edward Albee, and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" And certainly there's no disguising the knowledge that during a week when only two new major motion pictures were released to theaters, ""Mother!"" came in third at the box office, and debuted to an audience which by all appearances plainly despised it. <br/><br/>Should you decide to attend ""Mother!"" be prepared to hate yourself later for having wasted a fistful of dollars, on a movie which probably shouldn't have been made at all."

The violent mob in her house, snatches her baby after she gives birth, pulverizes the baby and hungrily eat pieces of it. She is punched, kicked and knocked down by the mob as she tries to save her son. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and Javier Bardam. There are enough crazy, violent, angry anything goes people in real life.

"thomas_john75","1","35","62","15 September 2017"," Excellent cinematography and acting, appalling script
","Basically, terrible. Why Aronofsky thinks I want to see all his anxieties on screen is beyond me. The plot: a husband lets a load of strangers into his home ignoring his wife's protests. They cause all sorts of problems, being abusive, ignoring her privacy etc. She has a baby which is killed by the strangers and she dies. The husband isn't too bothered because he needs the adulation from the crazy crowd/ fans. It loses all realism early on ( I would have kicked out Pfieffer straight away) and delves into fantasy. It's like some sort of surreal nightmare. Aronofskys anxieties on relationships and fame. Do me a favour , keep your anxieties between yourself and your counsellor, don't make a film about them. Show me something inspiring (examples, Neo discovering his potential in The Matrix, Jake discovering his morality in Avatar). Not for me. If you like pretentious anxious nonsense you'll love it.. If you like compelling inspiring stories, maybe Hollywood can make one which deserves the actors in this film one day."

First, Aronofsky claims to be an atheist, yet makes a movie about an unloving God...which is it? No God or an unloving one? Anyway, he uses Creation, Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, and the sacrifice of our LORD Jesus Christ to make a political statement about global warming and the destruction of Mother Earth which then leads to her rage and retribution. God is portrayed as a TAKER. A being that creates with the sole purpose of receiving praise and worship and sucking the life out of everything without giving in return. Gross. Disgusting gore scenes added for shock value. The icing on the cake is a newborn infant sacrifice. YEP. You won't see that in the trailer. I urge you to PLEASE not support this filth with your money.

"sergioschout","1","38","68","18 September 2017"," On my growing list of the worst movie I've seen.
","I get a lot of free movie theater tickets so I see a lot of movies. So I thought why not ""go with the flow"" and see the movie ""Mother!"" The theater was half filled so it was an OK turn out. However I saw over 50 people leave around 30 min in, mumbling and grumbling. So at the end of the film when filing out I heard a bunch of criticisms like "" what a piece of cr**p"" and ""can i get a refund for this x-movie"" and ""false advertisement"".<br/><br/>I completely agree with these assessments and viewpoints. Here is why: *False advertisement: movie is not as it was advertised.<br/><br/>*script: written by a dialectic child, filled with cliche's, fake stuff up the wazoo and is even worse than the worst movie I have ever seen ( for the record that was Himalaya where the nearly 3 hours movie plot is about getting Yaks over the Himalaya's)<br/><br/>*Directing: Honestly even lower than an amateur and novice combined. The eunuch that directed this ""piece"" is less competent than the most incompetent Youtuber.<br/><br/>*Camera position: UTTERLY FUBAR.. but then that is what you get when you have 6 year old ( or someone with a mental capacity of a 6 year old) directing a ""movie"" where your girlfriend plays the main role.<br/><br/>*Acting: From bad to abysmally horrible. The often blank expressions and the hellishly faux script is part of the problem but Jennifer L looked like she was on something when they did this ... erm.. ""movie"". Seriously lady: you need to get that checked out, it is like some bad tick or something.<br/><br/>Publicity debacle a la Irma: this is where Jennifer L is saying that ""Gaia""/""mother Earth"" is punishing the US for voting Trump and that ""she was OK with hurricanes destroying people's houses and belongings"". Not a smart move Jennifer, not a good move. What you SHOULD HAVE DONE to promote your movie was to go down to Florida and HELP PEOPLE. Oh well the mask is now literately on the ground so the people can see who you really are.<br/><br/>Final thoughts and conclusion: AVOID AT ALL COST!!! This is currently one of my worst movie experiences ever."

","Wow, so...yeah...terrible, terrible movie. I have never written a review on here or anywhere online before, have never even been remotely tempted to write a review online before, and yet, here I am. I just feel like it's my duty to help people from making the same mistake that I did by wasting my time and money on this film, because, I mean, on the surface it looks like it could be a good movie. The trailers depict it as a tense horror movie helmed by a capable director and starring an A-list cast. Ed Harris and Javier Bardem are two of my favorite actors and despite some of the negative press that Jennifer Lawrence generates, you have to give her credit, the girl can act. So I can see how a lot of people would be drawn to this movie like I was, but please, if you're reading this, avoid it like the plague.<br/><br/>After looking at some other audience reviews, I see that the typical rallying call the fans of this film are clinging to is that 'if you didn't like it, you didn't get it', and to those people I say: get over yourselves. This movie is not some complicated film that is hard to decipher. It's a relatively straightforward allegory that fails amazingly on almost every level as a movie. Its neither entertaining or (with the exception of Ed Harris) well acted, and there is some truly terrible CGI present as well, as if Aronosky wanted to make sure his film was awful in every possible way. <br/><br/>Listen, when I say this movie is BAD, I don't mean the so-bad-it's- almost-good kind of bad, I mean its the I-feel-like-I-have-been- sitting-here-for-seven-hours kind of bad.

"zkonedog","4","3","3","25 December 2017"," The Most Pretentious Director In Hollywood Strikes Again
","First off, let me say right off the bat: I understand that this is an allegory film. If a viewer doesn't understand that part of things, this film will make absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""mother!"" sees Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), and I'm using the billed names here, living in a falling-down house that she is repairing with Him (Javier Bardem). One day, Him invites a Man (Ed Harris) and a Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) into the house, and things start to get weird. Eventually Man and Woman's two sons, Oldest (Domhnall Gleeson) and Youngest (Brian Gleeson), join the proceedings, and a murder takes place. From here, the events spin even further out of control and descend into complete and utter madness.<br/><br/>The allegory here is that Lawrence's character is Mother Earth, Bardem's is God, while Harris/Pfeiffer are Adam/Eve and their sons Cain and Abel. Once you understand that framework, this film is (at very least) watchable. Without it, the narrative makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Even understanding the allegory, though, can't lead me to a better appreciation of the film. The problem, IMHO, is that Darren Aronofsky is establishing himself as perhaps the most pretentious director in Hollywood. First, he pretty much makes a mockery of ""Noah"" (that film is bad whether you believe the Biblical story or not). Now, he uses similar religious and classic themes in such a messy fashion that it really isn't all that meaningful or thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The message here is that humans are destroying the planet and God is helping them with the task. If that is Aronofsky's view of humanity, then so be it. I'm not overly religious, nor am I an outspoken atheist, so I like to consider myself open to possibilities. The problem here, though, is that I think the ""humans are destroying the Earth"" narrative needs to be mediated by some positivity.<br/><br/>Simply put, I don't want to sit for two hours and watch a film that brow-beats me. At least, not one that doesn't allow for a possibility of change. It very much feels like Aronofsky sitting up on his high horse condemning the rest of us, which feels incredibly pretentious to me.<br/><br/>Had this film done something other than criticize, I think I would have enjoyed it much more than I did. As it stands, however, ""mother!"" to me is just too pretentious to ever deliver an interesting or entertaining message."

"orlando-92843","1","47","87","17 September 2017"," waste of time
","I went to the movies recently with three other people with tickets we purchased at an attractively discounted price. Which movie? Upon reading reviews we settled on ""Mother"". Just a nudge beyond 2 hours long, and one of the greatest waste of 2 hours for a long time.<br/><br/>What on earth is this about? I hated it, as did my fellow movie goers. And then, in that post movie discussion room - the men's' toilet - all were scoffing at what they had just watched. So, the next day, onto google I went and read the reviews again, and found a website that explained it all.<br/><br/>So it's an allegory to certain events, set to a modern semi-horror movie. OK, great idea, but in my opinion, surely there are better ways to make allegories. Hopeless if the allegories are so tucked away that I have to research it online to make sense of it. OK, so now it does, and I look back at so many scenes and i find myself thinking, ""oh OK, so that's what that was about"". And I have found myself saying that so many times about so many scenes.<br/><br/>But in the end, as a movie, it seemed so incredibly disjointed and devoid of understanding. To watch the movie as a standalone story it failed. Sure, make your allegories, but weave them into a movie so that the movie flows, is enjoyable, and you don't have to research to find out what the point of it is!! In my opinion, it failed miserably as a movie for the movie goer who simply wants to watch a movie to escape life for two or so hours. Forget it if you want watch a movie that has another take on good-beats-bad, love-conquers-all, or an exploration of human relationships in all their forms - failed, successful, homosexual, marriage, parenthood, etc, etc. in whatever movie genre - science fiction, romance, horror, crime etc.<br/><br/>Reading the 'explanation', sure, it makes a bit more sense, but if one wasn't versed in the meaning before the movie, it was simply a bundle of scenes put together and you would come out thinking what everyone else did - what was that about? None of the reviews I read before watching it would reveal much about the plot out of respect of spoiling it for some people, so, out of respect, neither shall I. But, I will say, that had I read the plot and the explanation I would have been a lot less scathing of it. So in my opinion, read the plot. The movie will make a lot more sense when you watch it. I can't see how reading the plot and allegories beforehand can possibly spoil this abomination of a movie.<br/><br/>The allegories were too camouflaged. If one has to resort to the web to work out what the hell I just watched, then the movie fails in my opinion. And just how many people will bother to go online to gain an understanding of what they just saw? As for the rave reviews, honestly I wonder if people get so blown away by movies just because they are off center and mystical and contorted in what they are trying to say. Production wise , and acting wise, I have no complaints there.<br/><br/>For me, the only scenes worth watching were the shots of Jennifer Lawrence's adorable seemingly perpetual teenage good looks and the one frontal shot of her wearing a see-through nightshirt. Very tasteful and teasingly hinting at a lovely female form.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I hated ""Mother"". I would never watch it again. Understanding it or not. My three other friends were just as scathing, as were the few people I had the pleasure of briefly discussing the movie with over a few moments of liberation post movie. In summary, the worst movie I've seen in years. And pardon some of the puns in my review. That might make a bit more sense after you've seen the movie."

"PizzicatoFishCrouch","2","193","399","9 September 2017"," Jennifer Lawrence is the most overrated actress in Hollywood
","As the eponymous 'mother', Jennifer Lawrence confirms her status as the most overrated star in Hollywood. She completely takes me out of the film with her blank stare, and hammy, overbaked reaction shots.<br/><br/>I would rank 'mother!' up there as one of her most miscast roles, along with an embittered housewife in American Hustle (Lawrence was decades too young and tried to overcompensate for the lack of life experience and talent by over-acting and screeching) and Silver Linings Playbook (Lawrence's simplistic interpretation of a person suffering from mental issues, by screaming and looking dead behind the eyes, stole an Oscar from the truly deserving Emmanuelle Riva).<br/><br/>To this day, Lawrence's Oscar is the most undeserved, the most egregious case of a terrible, shallow performance beating a terrific one in Riva's superhuman transformation.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky is to pretension what Jennifer Lawrence is to bad acting, so he clearly think he has something to say with 'mother!', and licentiously wastes our time in doing so. But ultimately, his film is as ropey and creaky as the house Lawrence and Bardem's characters inhabit. Ultraviolence is thrown into the mix into the third act in an attempt to evoke a response from the audience, but the allegories are all a bit try hard and on the nose. The result is a maelstrom of GCSE-level metaphors where nothing makes sense that is difficult to watch because it is so sophomorically executed.<br/><br/>The film gets 2 out of 10. 1 star for Michelle Pfeiffer's villainous turn, which evoked more of a visceral response in me than Jlaw's nativity play-esque acting could ever dream of doing. Another star for the ubiquitous Domhnall Gleeson, bravely playing against type and unafraid to bare his teeth.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this."

","I never wrote a review before but after seeing 'mother!' I feel like I'm not going to be silent about this. Well..It is one thing to show simbolism is your movie. Which is okay, and it can be brilliant in the proper way (just like in 'Black Swan'), in my opinion. But this movie was something else. The main story, characters are good, I can see what the creators wanted to do with them. However I am utterly shocked by this amount of disgusting scenes that appeared during the film. I don't get it why the director did what he did. And here comes the SPOILERS: What kind of human being agreed, to shoot a film and then present it to the public all over the world in which a newborn gets brutally killed in front of his own mother by a bounch of strangers? This is called 'mental illness' not brilliancy. I can not understand that no one in the production said something like 'Uhmm, guys I don't think this is a very gainful idea to kill a baby or something. Seriously. How?! Let's talk about Darren Aronofsky. I truly admire and respect him as a director, the work he had done in 'Black Swan' is one of the most extraordinary things I have ever seen. But 'mother!' is sadly the opposite. Yes, Black Swan was full of simbolism, and yet the way the creators, especially Aronofsky presented it was amazing. I feel like in this movie, the writers thought the audience as some idiots who can not understand the main theme of this film. We can, like I said before, we get it why they call it 'mother' and we can understand the easter eggs too. I'm still in shock and I just hope this movie will be banned from everywhere it has been. If you want to watch a great psychological thriller then there is 'Black Swan' of 'Reguiem for a dream'. Now this..AVOID THIS!"

","Try to imagine Darren Aronfski with all his talent, preparing Mother in silence working with great actors, re-polishing the script and without the weight of a huge budget. I'm sure Roman Polanski had pressure from the studio to make concessions here and there but look at Rosemary's Baby and tell me. What concessions? I heard Martin Donovan, the director of Apartment Zero, a few months ago, explaining why he hasn't made an American film in 20 years. It was an explanation I'll never forget. He didn't blame anyone or anything, there was no blame of any kind but a deep and I should say, humble reflection and the fruit of his reflection was expressed, beautifully, in his excitement as he prepares his next film. I remembered his words as I watched Mother! Try to imagine Darren Aronfski with all his talent, giving time for the baby to be totally form and ready to be born. Working with great, new, unknown actors, without pyrotechnics but just the truth within the symbols (if any) - I love Jennifer Lawrence and I would have loved to see her play this role at the time of Winter's Bone - regardless of her youth. I believe that small private dreams/nightmares should be told with a feeling of privacy. Think Roman Polanski himself played the meek tittle character in The Tenant and the journey in Mia Farrow's eyes throughout Rosemary's Baby, Colin Firth's invisibility in Apartment Zero. In Mother there is also a Luis Bunuel touch from The Exterminating Angel but in Bunuel we live the surreal mystery with all our five senses. In Mother, we keep questioning, at a distance. No matter how close you come with the camera. Jennifer Lawrence is lovely but she starts with fear in her eyes and she stays there throughout. Javier Bardem is a sloppy variation of John Cassavetes in Rosemary's Baby. Ed Harris, as usual, superb as the Sidney Blackmer of the situation and Michelle Pfeiffer, who provides the biggest and most welcome surprise in a character clearly based on Ruth Gordon's Minnie in the same Polanski masterpiece. For all of the above I felt, sitting through Mother! A long and irritating experience. Now, I'd like to set a complaint about this, who shall I call?"
"gregeichelberger","1","75","146","16 September 2017"," Absolutely the worst film I've ever seen
","After viewing ""Mother!,"" the latest production by director Darren Aranofsky (""Pi,"" ""Black Swan""), I have say, without fear of hyperbole, that it's the worst film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>There are bad films that you know going into them will be bad, like ""Baywatch"" or ""Mr. Woodcock"" or the remake of ""Vacation,"" ""Alice Through the Looking Glass, the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise or ""Observe and Report"" or ""Mortal Bones"" or ""Bratz"" or ANYTHING with Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Then there are films where you think will be better than they actually are. Like ""Pan,"" or ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" or ""The Infiltrator"" and ""Why Him,"" or the leftist bag of crap, ""Captain Fantastic,"" even ""Bobby."" But ""Mother!,"" ""Mother!"" is in a special class unto itself. I mean, it's poorly filmed, horribly written, badly edited, terribly directed, makes no sense at all and actually made me sick <br/><br/>And it had a cast of Academy Award-winning or nominated actors, like Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. Of course, since that group chose ""Moonlight"" as Best Picture, you might as well smash the award into a million pieces ...<br/><br/>And what plot there is — and this was written by Aranofsky, too — is about a woman, Lawrence, married to a guy 50 years older than her — that would be Bardem — and they live in this dilapidated old house that Herman Munster would have been ashamed of. And he is supposed to be a poet, but cannot write since a big fire. <br/><br/>One day, he brings home a doctor, rude Ed Harris, and his whorish wife, Michelle Pfeiffer. Of course, this Bardem guy doesn't ask his wife anything about it. He NEVER asks her permission for ANYTHING the entire movie! Uh, that's about it <br/><br/>Oh yeah, a few more people show up, but — amazingly — they get increasingly weirder and more disturbing. Oh, and a murder takes place, the old mansion starts to bleed and Lawrence gets pregnant and Javier can write again and becomes world famous. Then more and more and more people show up at the house and destroy everything <br/><br/>At first, I thought to myself, ""Oh, this is a variation of 'Rosemary's Baby,' you know, the strange new people interrupting a marriage, a bizarre pregnancy and a poor goofball who becomes famous."" But it began drifting worse than the last installment of ""Pirates Of the Caribbean,"" that had Javier Bardem, too, you know.<br/><br/>By the first 10 minutes, we wonder why the two leads were even in a passing relationship, never mind married to each other. Plus, the supporting cast is just so annoying, irritating and infuriating, and the leads are so stupid, you have absolutely NO empathy or sympathy for ANYONE. <br/><br/>The worst thing — if that's even conceivable — is that Aranofsky films the two leads as close up as possible — yeah, I always thought Jennifer Lawrence was rather attractive, that is until I had to see every mole, hair, pimple, blackhead, whitehead, dimple and birthmark she ever had. Oh, and then it was shot in ""Selfie Vision, and uses the ridiculous, hand-held, jiggling, seizure-inducing camera technique. <br/><br/>There is nothing real about any of the reactions and Lawrence usually takes all of it with a blank facial expression with eyes half closed and mouth wide agape ... kind of like the women in ""Sucker Punch."" Finally, she rebels, but by then, there are literally thousands of people in the house ... THOUSANDS! People at the screening were walking out in droves ...!"

"MFFJM2","1","31","55","16 September 2017"," Huh..? What a waste of two hours. Spoiler alert.
","Where to begin? The actors in this film are all quite accomplished. The Director/Writer, Arnofsky, has multiple large and unusual films to his credit, if not the critical acclaim he undoubtedly thinks is his due. The film tries to be art, but ends up being only artifice. It's full of allegory, and symbolism, but not for dramatic or literary effect. The viewer is beaten over the head with the allegorical inferences until they lie in a bloody pool, like so many of the characters. A better writer might have taken a few weeks to smooth out the more ridiculous moments in the script, or heighten the few suspenseful ones. A better director might have used the house to better elucidate the plodding plot. The man, Javier Bardham, cleverly named ""Man"" is a poet/writer in an old Victorian house damaged in a fire. He has some sort of writer's block. His wife, Jennifer Lawrence, named ""Mother"" is doing all the work to repair the house. This is where the film departs from sanity. Two additional characters enter this home, unannounced and unwelcome by ""Mother"", Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. Ed is dying of cancer and is a fan of Javier's poetry. Javier's character welcomes them into his home, for ""as long as they like"" without even consulting his wife. It was at this point I decided that the film was set in some alternate universe where common decency and compassion are unknown. Shortly after that two brothers arrive, the children of Harris and Pfeiffer, and begin to fight over a will, until one finally kills the other in the house. The dying brother is carried out of the house by Bardham's character, supposedly to a nearby hospital. Apparently they have no ambulances in this alternate universe. While Bardham's character is gone tending to the fallen brother, the other brother is still gliding around the house, until finally Jennifer Lawrence, a bit of a neat freak, begins to clean up the blood. Apparently, in this alternate universe there are no crime scene investigators, or detectives, or police. The blood has created a hole in the flooring that drips into the basement, making one wonder if perhaps the Harris family doesn't have something else in common with the Aliens, of the 1979 Ridley Scott film, whose blood is molecular acid, other than their utter lack of empathy. Yes, I know, this is art. It's all symbolic. The film continues for another hour full of blood, murder, and cannibalism, but that's art, right? No, it's not. It's stupid, and voyeuristic, and humorless. Some writers will undoubtedly write that they found laughs in this film, well if they did then they need therapy."

The cinematography was excellent and there were some creative shots, but for the most part it was pretty boring. And then came the house guests. Oh boy. The whole story line was just obnoxious. I hated every character. You have Michelle Phiffer who is a horrible human, Ed Harris who is off his rocker, and Jennifer Lawrence who plays the submissive housewife who takes all of their crap. She doesn't stand up for herself or to her husband and it drove me NUTS. I wanted to put my arms through the screen and shake Jennifer Lawrence the whole time and tell her to stand up for herself! After the house guests leave the story became absolutely crazy. Not crazy in a good way. Crazy in a ""why am I sitting here watching this film"" way. While I understood the film in the end, there was absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about this story line to me. About midway through the movie I turned to my friend and said ""maybe we should just leave"", but we decided to stay and I truly regret that decision. The last half of the movie was utter chaos with no light at the end of the tunnel. I felt this entire movie had no sense of direction. The ending was artsy, but totally bazaar and there was truly not a single moment of this film that I enjoyed.

I totally get the point that Aronofsky is making and I appreciate the fact that Paramount Pictures was willing to put up $30 million to make something wildly experimental and violently off-putting.

"blood-lust666","2","36","66","9 February 2018"," Pretentious nonsense masquerading as art
","This movie tries to justify itself through the use of artful imagery and Biblical symbolism, but can't seem to mask its overall misogyny. While misogyny has been a theme in many a horror film, I've never seen it used so blatantly than in this film and all while trying to mask it with a thick layer of pretentious allegorical Creationism. This isn't something I would typically speak out on, but this movie hit a nerve. How Him patronizes and demeans Her throughout; how the guests devalue Her within her own home; how Her debases herself in enough to be treated in this manner by all those around her. It all speaks of male chauvinism. <br/><br/>Even beyond that point, I've seen so many people defend this movie and it's because of the allegorical nature of it. Just because a film is overwrought with Biblical symbolism doesn't make it 'meaningful' or even a 'good' movie. 
Underneath all the symbolism and all the misogyny this, simply put, was a bad movie. It was slow, boring. There was never any tension created to amount to anything suspenseful or exciting. And the plot didn't stick. Yes, the allegory. The whole point was the allegory as the director so diligently drilled into our heads throughout. But an allegory without good storytelling is just nonsense.

It was weird that nobody had names, NOBODY. I figured, well, okay, but that sure makes it hard to grow an attachment to anyone in it. It was just weird crap of Jennifer Lawrence having weird visions or premonitions. Suddenly, Ed Harris shows up behaving more or less like a lout, although Javier Bardem warmly welcomes him. Even though there's zero cellular reception, Michelle Pfeiffer (Ed Harris' wife) shows up the next day and walks right in like she owns the place. Soon after, Harris and Pfeiffer's sons come barging in and get into a violent fight in which one is beaten to death while the other flees. Bardem traipses out, leaving Lawrence in the house all alone with a murderer in the wind, and that night the house is invaded with a dozen more people, arriving out of nowhere to share in the grief of Harris and Pfeiffer over the Cain-and-Abel moment of one son killing the other.

","I do not understand anything about this movie.
What the F* is the point here? Where is the plot? What is the plot?
As much as I like the actors in the movie and even their performance, the movie just left me with unanswered questions. I can live with surrealism. Fuck, I even like surrealism. But seriously, what the f* is this movie about? I couldn't tell.
If it's meant to provoke some thoughts, what exactly it's mean to provoke?
I liked Jennifers tits as much as the next guy, but what does that mean?
There wasn't any cliffhanger, there is no message or the substance in the movie as far I can tell. It attacks most basic fears that all of us have, but to what end?
Creepily, the plot gets less and less believable and surreal by the minute. but that's it, as far I can tel there isn't any deeper meaning, there isn't really plot here.
I was hoping whole time that she would go mental at any moment and started killing people out of absurdity alone, waking up in a mental hospital, explaining her twisted point of view. None of that happened, plausibly she remained sane for the entirety of the movie that carried no message to the audience.
It's like a Picasso painting that nobody really gets but people pretend to just so that they can feel superior to people who don't get it. As far I can tell there is no deeper meaning, no message here.<br/><br/>What is even worse, the movie doesn't even provoke any real discussion, doesn't leave any room for different interpretations which you could argue with you friends.
In the end, all that goes trough your mind is ""is that it?""."

","The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the movie I just saw is that it made me dizzy with the camera. I had to stop looking at the screen twice so I did not get dizzy.<br/><br/>The next thing I feel is because there are directors who tell a story they need to resort to telling it in such a strange way. Everyone has his ways of telling stories, it is evident and in fact is the grace of cinema, but when I find directors who resort to such convoluted ways, they saturate me.<br/><br/>I think the bottom is counting something quite simple, what an artist suffers to create their stories, but writhes it in such a way that it saturates me. I always thought that when you can remove a movie or put minutes and the movie does not affect you, it is that something bad happens. In this case all the second half of the film, I am convinced that if it was extended or cut twenty minutes, all those who are delighted with it, would still be delighted, but that means it is not well made. In addition it is sometimes even predictable. You know minutes before what happens next.<br/><br/>I have many characters left and I do not mean all the extras in the second part. I do not understand the characters of the children or what they want to have with them. I thought I understood Michelle's, but every time I think about it, I get diluted with the film, since I was looking the other way. Bardem, Jennifer and Ed are well, especially her, she is great, telling me that she is not the protagonist in my way of seeing.<br/><br/>Nor do I understand why the film leads to a scary movie, when it does not paint the terror in this movie.<br/><br/>The photograph would say that it is quite well. Yes that accompanies history, so to speak.<br/><br/>But the management, telling me that I still feel dizzy, and that the whole film is shot with the camera in hand, as an easy resource to make you dizzy instead of giving the film that atmosphere and provoke tension in another way. He only knows how to use camera in hand, foreground and move the camera from side to side quickly. I think he's a lot of footage, is too long and I think he has not been able to carry it, he's going to film the film for other issues that do not support anything to the film.<br/><br/>I am convinced that the producer has gotten his hand and forced him to shoot another ending, so that at least I have some sense at the end of the film.<br/><br/>In short or you will look like a disaster or you will be delighted."

An entire film of blatant metaphor meant to feed the writer/director's ego along with 2 hours of his girlfriend grimacing and suffering from indigestion... and I used to think that Jennifer Lawrence was a decent actress. The film might have been salvageable through Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris playing Adam and Eve, since their acting was fantastic despite the poor writing. It was even salvageable after the writer insulted the audience when he included 'Adam' missing a rib, one of their sons murdering the other one, Eve's alcoholic fruit drink and then all of them getting banished from Mother's ""Paradise""... all so the author could be sure that the audience got the boring biblical reference. <br/><br/>Beyond that it was just a writer portraying himself as a 'god' which destroys everything in its life, and ridiculous characters on a bath salts trip... excruciating writing and imagery, full of over-the-top representations. The baby getting its head snapped and then eaten was the height of absurdity. Too much nonsense, and barely any good writing or original plot. <br/><br/>In the theater, the audience burst into laughter when the film ended and everyone was saying that Mother! was the worst film they have ever seen.

Jennifer Lawrence is mother nature, Javier Bardem is god, the old couple are adam and eve, their sons are cain and abel, and Bardem's followers are religion. watch an interview with Aranofsky about his lack of creative control on Noah and it becomes abundantly clear that this entire film is masquerading as a spit in the face to the religious people that were responsible for his lack of creative control on that film.<br/><br/>if you want to see a film where story and metaphors exist in tandem i'd suggest the work of Yorgos Lanthimos. there is an artist who understands that for an audience to buy a metaphor, no matter how absurd, it has to make sense in the world of the story. here, the more the underlying message becomes apparent the less the story makes sense."

And I presume you're beyond editorial support at this point in your artistic pinnacle?). <br/><br/>He then took his current real-life girlfriend, Jennifer Lawrence, (Jen. Run. You're better than this.) and he strapped some electrodes to her for shock value, and he peed all over her and filmed it using only three shots for some film-school-senior-project level fancy: close up, from behind, and point of view. Then he praised himself for making a film that is 'really about how we are treating mother earth'. Yeah. He did that. And he thinks he's smarter than you. <br/><br/>I am not sure if there is enough cocaine in Hollywood to explain the amount of ego masturbation that this film portrays. The whole not-too-subtle story of Artist as God who abuses his muse and is obsessed with praise is heavy handed. You're not a God, Darren. Your art is pretentious tripe, much like the intestines of the baby on the sacrificial table. <br/><br/>The real kick in the labia is the utter misogyny of the film, produced by a group of ONLY males (6 producers, editor, cinematographer, etc, plus the Douche). So, a penis parade made a nightmarish film about motherhood and society's dismissal of the feminine and weren't smart enough to see the irony in not having a single woman above-the-line on the production? You fellas are just a bushel of genius right there.<br/><br/>I feel like I need to wash Aronofsky's spooge from my eyes. I am not going to see another one of his film's until I get at least a dozen trustworthy opinions first, and more than half of them need to come from females."

The plot is thin, like it was written without any thought, overnight, just a bunch of malice towards good people! The acting is honestly campy and embarrassing. The plot is beyond any rational persons time. It is not entertaining, it is not good for anyone to watch, it is just another waste of good money. Money that could have gone to Hurricane victims instead of this writer Director! And Lawrence, what was she thinking? Did she even read the script before committing to it? I have lost faith that she understands what a good script is. She was lucky to hit it big, and now we have to endure her attempts at acting. If she was not so self righteous, and arrogant, she would be taken more seriously. But to align with this film... Obviously she knows she has no talent. It would also be nice to see an actress who is not so full of herself, and actually earn her stripes instead of just lining up for whatever film falls in her lap, no matter who she is sleeping with. Get a brain and get serious about your craft... and the business. Keep your mouth shut, select good scripts, and Earn your respect.

Satoshi Kon wraps that question in a package of insanity and couples it with the warn out tedium of an outdated BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM ripoff from Lionsgate.

"anonveli","4","16","28","27 September 2017"," Aronofsky stepped a little too far out of the box
","What the **** did I just watch? Darren Aronofsky is notorious for making some seriously strange movies. Mother! is no exception to the rule and even takes it to another level. Which I'm not sure is a good thing. This film is certainly geared more towards a niche audience looking to wrack their brain on allegories and I'm surprised it wasn't a more limited release for that reason. I'm not calling the general public dumb, but studios tend to shy away from releasing movies like this out of fear that they won't get return on investment. The story begins with a woman and her husband (no, they don't have names) who live in a home seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Their tranquil existence is interrupted by visitors with questionable motives. Let's take a closer, spoiler-free look at Mother!<br/><br/>The Good: Darren Aronofsky films like to play with your senses, and that is exactly the case with Mother! This film really appeals to them as you hear every floorboard creak, every exasperated breath and even the pulse of the house. This helps build tension and set the mood for events to come. It gives you that gut anxiety feeling when you're hearing every single little noise as things around the Mother gradually become more chaotic. This makes the breaks of silence eerie in a way, because you become so used to the white noise around her.<br/><br/>The Bad: I'm sure there are going to be people kissing Jennifer Lawrence's ass for the next year or so because of her performance. But I was bored with her character and irritated with the way she and others were written. I understand that they were all intentionally written this way to deliver a story, but the characters responses to certain situations just seemed so unnatural. If anyone showed up at my door in the middle of the night, it would have to be a seriously extenuating circumstance for me to let them stay. When others showed up, I'd probably be throwing punches. Maybe that just makes me an asshole, I don't know. I could sympathize with the Mother, but I was hard pressed to find a character that was actually likable in any way.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film seems painfully slow and makes an already long movie seem much longer. I don't need fire and blood raining around me to be entertained but there were only a couple big moments that really got me engaged. Aronofsky has done it right before by balancing drama, suspense and even a little horror (IE; Requiem for a Dream, which if you haven't seen you should). Mother! has all these elements but they seem disproportionate, which tends to make things drag quite a bit.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this film keeps you guessing as to what the hell is going on. The world that the mother and him (Javier Bardem) live in seems to be something out of a dream, yet it could really exist. I really enjoyed the mysterious aspect of the film but I also felt somewhat misled. The trailers made it seem as if this was going to quickly devolve into a devil baby movie, but believe me you're going to be far more confused than that.<br/><br/>So, is too weird a bad thing? I'm occasionally down to watch an indy, artsy film but a few ride that line of being outright strange. This movie tore right through that threshold and actually made me wonder that question; is too weird a bad thing? In some cases, yes. It appears to be a cohesive story but I was constantly asking myself if any of the film is really supposed to be happening or if it's some sort of hallucination. It's not strange like goats talking or anything like that, but just the behavior of the characters and the general setting seem peculiar. In Aronofsky fashion, the last fifteen minutes of the movie will probably leave you horrified and when it's all said and done you're going to feel like you just snapped out of a dream. Nevertheless, there's a message to be gained from the movie and it's an interesting ride to say the least.<br/><br/>The Judgment: I honestly walked out of a dead silent theater not knowing what to think or say about the film, guessing that others around me felt the same way. It took me a little bit to digest the message and make sense of everything that I saw. If sensory stuff or artsy movies irritates you, I wouldn't recommend seeing this film. If your curiosity has gotten the best of you or you're a fan of indy films, go check it out. Personally, I didn't like this movie much at all, but I've seen and enjoyed a few other Aronofsky films so I'm just chalking this one up as a fluke."

","First of all, I was forced to give this....I hate to even refer to this as a film, but film a 1. I would have given it a ZERO! It may be the worst film ever, considering I cannot think of a film of this budget and so-called Hollywood pedigree turning out such a piece of crap.<br/><br/>There is no story here. More like a bunch of actors put together and asked to improv the most ridiculous things they can think of.<br/><br/>The actions and reactions of these characters is frustratingly moronic. If not for the fact that I was going to another movie later in that same complex, I would have walked out, WAY before it ended.<br/><br/>But I still had hope that there would be an explainable motivation for what had previously transpired (good luck with that), instead my dread for this film quickly changed into an almost a hysteria of laughter because the story even got worse. That is of course after some more obscene, grotesque violence (I'm refraining from using the would horror so as not to discredit that genre of film).<br/><br/>I have very much liked some of Darren Aronofsky's films. The Fighter, The Wrestler, both were well told personal stories. I guess the key here is that he didn't write either of these (at least he wasn't credited as a writer) where with Mother, is the only CREDITED writer. Maybe it's just as simple for him to stop trying to be a writer??? In any case, it is the duty of everyone out there to tell your family and friends to avoid paying to see this film, or even wasting their time to watch some pirated version. Instead go out and spend time with your family and friends. You'll be much better off personally and you can rest assured that those that you warn, will be eternally grateful."
"mooviesuniverse","3","16","28","18 September 2017"," The story makes about as much sense as tits on a bull.
","Director Darren Aronofsky's latest starts intriguing but ends up being obnoxious.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Mother, a young woman living in a remote mansion together with her partner whom is credited as Him (Javier Bardem). Bardem is a poet struggling with writer's block. Lawrence is renovating the house. One night a stranger (Ed Harris) knocks on the door. Bardem invites him in but Lawrence isn't exactly fond of their guest. The day after the man's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up. After the couple's sons (played by real-life brothers Domnhall & Brian Gleeson) make an appearance things get stranger to say the least.<br/><br/>'Mother!' starts off pretty well. It's mysterious and exciting at first but somewhere halfway through the movie suddenly turns into 'The Hobbit' (the uninvited guests who plunder Lawrence's kitchen). Afterwards it becomes boring. The movie is filled with religious symbolism and hidden meanings but the story makes about as much sense as tits on a bull.<br/><br/>Lawrence plays her role mostly well. The camera almost never leaves her throughout its 2 hour running time (think 'Son of Saul' although not as extreme). Unfortunately when the story goes down the drain so does Lawrence's performance. During the third act her part is limited to screaming and groaning although at least you still feel sympathy for her. Bardem adds little. Then again the dialogue is severely lacking so there isn't much to work with. Luckily Ed Harris is always good and Pfeiffer really shines. The house also plays a part but it isn't as exciting as you would expect. Apart from the walls that seem to be communicating with Lawrence and a hole in the floor that resembles a lady's private parts there's nothing there.<br/><br/>The idea of following Lawrence that closely works well although Aronofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libatique pass up some great opportunities to insert some elaborate tracking shots. 'Mother!' borrows a lot from 'Rosemary's Baby'. Big difference however is that the latter is a good movie.<br/><br/>Aronofsky wants people to talk about his movie and he will definitely succeed in that. It's different and audacious, especially the climax. Too bad he chooses excessive violence over a coherent story.<br/><br/>That's not to say there isn't an audience for this type of movie. Whether you like it or not 'Mother!' will stay with you for a while."

","After wrapping this flick, Jennifer Lawrence has to be saying ""what was I thinking?"" <br/><br/>90% of this particular movie is fixed either on her face or the back of her head, all with a handheld camera. How fun is that? You'll end the movie carsick.<br/><br/>Lawrence has the unenviable task of looking perplexed, surprised, and disgusted at the constant arrival of unwanted guests in her remodeled Victorian. You'll feel like you're watching Chevy's CHRISTMAS VACATION without the humor. <br/><br/>MOTHER! is a frustrating and unceremonious examination of weird house guests, including Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, who simply want a place to rest their head. Is that tedious? You bet.<br/><br/>Why does Lawrence's husband, Javier Bardem, entertain and house these guests against her wishes? Frankly, like Rhett Butler, we don't give a hoot. <br/><br/>The movie will find you taking deep breaths, not from shock or dismay, but sheer boredom or anger at the appalling insensitivity of Bardem to his wife Lawrence. <br/><br/>Perhaps if Bardem reprised his Oscar-winning role as serial killer Anton Chigurh, our 2 hours of this misery might be justified. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>For two hours I thought I was watching a new ""hip"" version of ROSEMARY'S BABY, but that didn't happen either. <br/><br/>Instead, there is no real closure to this movie and we find that Lawrence has been a simple chess piece in a loop of never-ending abuse. If you really LIKED this movie, you need therapy. It's really painful to watch.<br/><br/>Aronofsky, the Director, likes to throw spaghetti on the wall hoping that enough critics will see the Mona Lisa there somewhere. I suppose if you put 1000 monkeys in a room with 1000 typewriters they will eventually come up with GONE WITH THE WIND. <br/><br/>But this strategy, like Aronofsky's strategy, means that audiences will have to figure out just what he's pitching to us on his way to stardom. I don't want to take that train. It's a very bumpy trip.<br/><br/>My fellow critics have asked the same question: What exactly is the theme of MOTHER!? Perhaps it's a biblical allegory? Or perhaps it's a protest piece from the misogyny suffered by women? Or perhaps it's a statement about the failure of the world to address homelessness? Or the trials of remodeling your Victorian? Take your pick. It's a bunch of spaghetti on the wall.<br/><br/>Skip it and watch ROSEMARY'S BABY, a classic horror flick with a great director, Roman Polanski. It has a shocking finale but it least it has closure. <br/><br/>MOTHER! is so darn vague, it's plot so loose, that it would make a great dribble painting by Jackson Pollock. Don't subject yourself to this cinematic nonsense by Aronofsky. <br/><br/>If you paid good money to see this, ask for a refund.

Her attraction to and love for her husband is never depicted in a way that helps the audience understand her point of view despite the fact that the character is on screen for every single second of the film. I am deliberately refraining from mentioning one outrageous event the character experiences in this film that is the nadir of this character's destiny as victim: you should see it for yourself and decide. In short, I found nothing in this film's story to like and found its treatment of women nauseating.<br/><br/>And if the movie is intended to illuminate the ugliness of humanity, its existence is completely unnecessary in these times when the news feeds are full of world events that continuously report on the ugly side of ourselves. Your eyes may have seen or may see something entirely different in the movie, but the above is my opinion of what is on the screen.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence has the ignominious luck of having been in two back-to -back films that have elicited or are eliciting polarizing reactions from audiences to the choices her characters make and the fundamental premise of each story. In Passengers her character undergoes a journey that had some members of the audience react negatively to the choice she makes at the end and to the choice the male character makes to initiate the story. At least to that movie's credit, the story presents elements that can be used to justify her character arc, even if there can be disagreement about whether you found it satisfying or not. With Mother, alas in my opinion, there is nothing. Nada. Instead, the director has the temerity to imply an inevitability to the character's destiny or fate, intimating that there is a repetitive replicating cycle of a life as a victim. <br/><br/>Some fans have applauded the director for being outrageous and audacious and being gobsmacked by the in-your-face assault of the story elements. Others have mentioned that the film has religious motifs and allegorical elements. Really? I don't get that at all. Is there a single redemptive aspect to this film's story? I did not see one. <br/><br/>By the way I don't think the film's story elements and its treatment of the lead female character can be easily forgiven because these should be viewed as merely being simple ""horror"" tropes. The slasher movies make no bones about the roles played by female victims in the service of the story--some of them revel, revealingly, as torture porn and should be and are dismissed easily as inconsequential in the larger scheme of things as cartoons; but there has also been a slow boil reaction to these films warning us of their potential to desensitize the audience to female abuse and gender stereotyping. In these times when debate rages over the depiction of females in Game of Thrones and lack of female representation behind the cameras and in positions of power in the film world and in the world at large comes this film that depicts the female spirit in the most derisive manner possible. Is this because the movie makers are gambling that the audiences are in fact desensitized and will flock to the film and endure near 120 minutes of a character's disintegration on screen as entertainment? As a certain President might tweet, ""Sad!""<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a prime example of director as auteur. Every line of dialogue and every camera move and element of story should be owned by the director. I affirm the auteur's right to tell a story. I saw and heard his story. I simply did not like any of what I heard or saw."

","As a science fiction fan I found this film to be poorly done in story and how it was told. The evolution of the scenes was awkward and did not flow well. The graphic's were good. I also thought the dialogue was poor. The story seemed random and did not flow well. There was no background on the lead male character. This may be a good story, but this film was not the vehicle to tell it. I would not recommend this film to my friends."

","Wow mother! was a real wild ride. I stumbled out of the theater in awe. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. It is really nice to see directors like Darren Aronofsky take chances like this. What you get in mother! is one part drama one part horror six parts insanity. <br/><br/>The story does not take any time at all to get going, it becomes completely crazy about an hour in and the final 20 minutes will leave you shocked. While I was not totally floored by either main stars performance the acting was surely great. <br/><br/>The problem with mother! is, taken at face value it's totally ridiculous. The things that end up transpiring are absurd and over the top to say the least. Therefore mother! will surely be a polarizing movie. As a small example I went with 3 other people to see it, including myself it was a 50/50 love hate outcome. <br/><br/>As far as the shocking moments in the film, they are a real doozy. There's one scene in particular that will certainly repel some people. In my theater of about 20 or so people a woman basically ran out during this part. When we left she was waiting outside visibly shaken and yelling at her boyfriend. For me as a person who loves it when films push the envelope and cross boundaries, I was delighted by it all. <br/><br/>While mother! is the most audacious original movie of 2017 taken at face value it could be a real bust for some people. After reading into the meaning of the film I'd say I like it even more. I'm giving it an 8/10. A great movie."

","This is in my top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. That is not an exaggeration either. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars and not 1 was that it is directed fairly well, however the story line is truly abysmal. The story is so bizarre and chaotic that you can't really follow it, you will spend the whole time trying to figure out what is going on. There is kind of a supernatural thing going on that distracts the main character from what's happening but it's not clear even at the end whether it's part of the story. I think it was added to sell it as a bit of a supernatural thriller and distract the viewer to make it look like story is actually going somewhere and that all will be revealed at the end, but no. I am at pains to see why such established actors would be involved with such an awful film.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer said she couldn't understand the script which is understandable, it's at that point she should have walked away.

It offers many themes and it could be anything from the desperate need and power of love, obsession with fame and the madness that surrounds it, the purity of new life, it could be anything but unfortunately it feels like nothing. Another problem is that Mother! never grips or pulls you in and consequently the film drags and feels much too long.

"jason-12727","10","13","22","24 September 2017"," A refreshing oasis in an otherwise parched desert of Hollywood remakes (NO SPOILERS)
","10/10 <br/><br/>I loved this film so much, was so shaken and moved by it, that I actually created an IMDb account to post this review. This film is a breath of cold, crisp fresh air for anyone sick of brain dead Hollywood sequels and remakes.<br/><br/>My review is for people who haven't watched the film, so it contains no spoilers. I believe that like a magician's trick, if you know what's going on, the illusion will vanish. You'll miss the magic. You'll won't feel the confusion. Your brain won't be pulling itself apart trying to work out what is amiss.<br/><br/>This is why all the trailers leave the story as a mystery. It pains me to see the director and cast answering questions on the red carpet and in interviews explaining the film away. Sadly, if you are reading this review, you probably already know what the film is about, and you are now cursed never to experience the magic this film has to offer. It's a risky game, to make a film like this. It's a bubble waiting to be popped by the media and criticism whereupon the marketers suddenly backtrack their high ground and feel the need to explain what it's about. By doing this, they poison the well they put such great care into making.<br/><br/>I believe that the true magic of this film can only be experienced if you share the confusion of the protagonist, as I did. I genuinely felt like I was watching events unfold through my own eyes. A state of surreal confusion, anxiety and panic. To be able to transport the watcher into such an incredible and other worldly state, to be able to take someone to such a place, is an amazing feat. And Aronofsky, Lawrence and Bardem accomplished that feat for me.<br/><br/>This was obviously an incredibly hard film to market. Give away too much and the magic is gone. Give away too little and magic has no foundation in which to root itself. Thank you for the director, cast and studio for investing in this. I read that they did 3 months solid of rehearsals before shooting, and I think you can see this passion in the execution, the flow, the near flawless way in which the jigsaw puzzle assembles itself. This is not improv.<br/><br/>What else to say about the film without giving anything away? It's hard. All I can say is if you like to THINK, stop reading or learning ANYTHING about this movie right now. Go on a total information blackout until you are in the cinema. And then strap yourself in.<br/><br/>Might I first address my own assessment of the 15% of people on IMDb who gave this film 1/10:<br/><br/>* Half say the film is too obvious<br/><br/>* The other half say the film doesn't make sense<br/><br/>They can't seem to make their minds up. How can people be giving it 1/10 for being both too obvious and lowbrow and others giving it 1/10 for being incomprehensibly highbrow?<br/><br/>All I can imagine is that the people who thought it was too obvious knew what it was about before they started. For them, the film was perhaps already doomed. <br/><br/>And the others in that group that ""worked it out"" too quickly, then thought it was too low brow for them, I guess their brain switched off and they didn't care to keep looking for the myriad other interpretations of what is happening on the screen. <br/><br/>There are at least 2 very obvious interpretations, and many non-obvious ones. I've read lots of reviews in the days since seeing it (I saw it a week ago) and people really have come up with very interesting ways in which to interpret the story and symbols. For 80% of the film I thought it was about something completely different than my final interpretation.<br/><br/>Then there are those who thought it was incomprehensible. One lady near me got up in the end and said ""Is everyone else as confused as I am?"". I guess she thought she was going to see the next Hunger Games or Transformers. I don't blame her for that at all. I just genuinely feel sad for her because she hadn't switched her brain on until it was too late. She lost her $20 and she felt robbed and I honestly feel sorry for her.<br/><br/>If ""interpretation"" is a dirty word for you, you might hate this film. But let me be clear - this is not an ineffable high-brow David-Lynch circle-jerk that leaves people for decades wondering what the meaning (if any) was. This film has very clear, solid, definable meaning. As well as myriad alternate interpretations.<br/><br/>Lastly, some say it offended their belief system. I can't argue with that one. This film is offensive. It assaults you. It takes no prisoners and doesn't care for your belief system. Because it is bigger than your belief system. It is infinitely (literally) bigger than that.<br/><br/>If you have ever felt that Hollywood was caught in meaningless loop, pay to go see this movie and show your support. The more people that see it the more innovative, adventurous, risky, thought provoking movies we be financed in the future. A major movie house took a risk on this - I can only suggest that anyone who cares about film, get yourself to a cinema and reward them for having the balls to produce this.<br/><br/>If my review gets one more person to watch this film, the time taken to write it has been worth it."

But this one, is not one of them. It is just plain weird. I know it is suppose to be symbolic concerning materialism that has run amok among humanity but it is just too far out there for my tastes. It is written & directed by Darren Aronofsky-Black Swan, The Wrestler, The Fountain- who is actually dating Jennifer Lawrence in real life-they met working on this movie. I read that this movie is loosely inspired by Rosemary's Baby but that is very loosely. There is a baby-but trust me, you do not want to know what happens to him-and there are fanatical people that show up from who knows where. Jennifer & Javier are married and live in a country house-no close neighbors-that Jennifer is in the process of renovating while Javier tries to write. Ed shows up, unexpectedly, and Javier welcomes him, saying it might help his mental block. Ed claims that he is an admirer and a fan of Javier.

"ozborovac","2","10","16","16 November 2017"," Slipknot meets The Seventh Continent
","We can all agree that Noah was a fluke in both concept and execution, right? That movie tried to fuse high fantasy bombast and comic-book style heroes with the endlessly chipper Judeo-Christian Old Testament to not quite godly results . Not satisfied with the copious seasonings of Biblical stories in contemporary Hollywood, director Darren Aronofsky set himself up with a divine mission. To bring forth a new sub-category of movie making that would take a relatively prominent character in Judeo-Christian lore and make a movie that would do the character good, and take the story seriously. Like, really seriously. Well not that seriously, since it does feature sentient CGI rock monsters. But then again, it is a story about how systematically annihilating the human race is a pretty neat thing, so a talkative butte might not be the most eye- catching detail. In any case, the big budget boat movie tanked and questions were raised as to where Aronofsky's career would go next. To his credit, the director always was a risk taker, and having a high-concept film go south is something that was bound to happen sooner or later. Well, his new project called Mother! is here. So, how does it fare in comparison with the director's earlier films? The answer?<br/><br/>Not good.<br/><br/>Plot isn't exactly important for this flick, so only the basic premise is enough to get the gist. An unnamed woman (Jennifer Lawrence) is seen renovating a house. Her unnamed European husband (Javier Bardem) occasionally walks through the house sparking odd, vaguely pleasant dialogue between the two. He is an author, and is dealing with a dry creative spell. She is subtly urging him on to create something new. Another unnamed man (Ed Harris) starts appearing in their house and She can't stand him because he is ruining her Feng Shui or something, but her husband is elated to talk to him because his life story is inspiring. She starts seeing weird Hellraiser-style abominations lurking inside the walls of the house, as her sanity begins to slowly unravel. That other guy also has an unnamed wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) who also starts appearing in the house, and yet again She get angry at Her for ruining her Zen, but the husband is happy because he really, really liked Ladyhawke . Keep adding new unnamed characters, and you can more or less understand how Mother! builds its story. In short, it is that simple premise taken to the logical extreme and topped off with an explosive finale. <br/><br/>Mother! 's major themes deal with creation, privacy, environmental and social decay.The creation angle is visible with Bardem's character as he is a writer who creates worlds that endlessly inspire people, and is something of a God figure in the movie. His wife wants to turn her house into a, quote, ""paradise "". Paper-thin metaphors serve as character building by making the movie a kind of ""best of"" retelling of the bible. Bardem is God, Lawrence is both Mother Nature and the Virgin Mary at the same time (a kind of trinity dealio, I'm sure), Adam and Eve appear, Cain and Abel make their contract-mandated appearance, even Big Baby Jesus is here. Shimmy Shimmy Ya!<br/><br/>The movie takes these characters as a backdrop for an inevitable apocalypse that is visually represented as the slow desolation of the LawDem's house. Revelers start showing up at the house as they slowly start pulling a Wiseau by tearing it apart like in that one Slipknot music video where a ton of kids demolish a house. So if you think about it, the movie is a kind of inversion of Hanneke's The Seventh Continent. Where that movie treated the destruction of the middle class home as a misguided attempt at liberation, this one treats the destruction of the house as a form of despoilment and rape. The contents of middle class life thus become symbols of security and balance, life and purity. This also coincides with the theme of identity loss, as this sub-plot can be seen as a real-life parallel to the lead actress' life who was a victim of privacy breach. As hurtful and shocking that experience must have been, the crude and under- cooked way it was served in this movie generates little empathy to the actual plight. And there is also the subtext of the poor taking from the rich and ruining the world in the process, but that problem is not addressed in any way. On the technical side, Mother doesn't fare great either. Overblown horror lighting and stupefying editing kill some of the more evocative set-pieces. <br/><br/>The acting is generally tepid, as Lawrence fails to assume any kind of acting style besides constant hyperventilation, Bardem seems half-asleep and poor Ed Harris just seems lost. Mother! can be seen as an astute symbol of where movie.making is right now. Precocious movie-makers want to create the ultimate catch-all movie, a film so epic that it will explain the universe, why the rain falls, how do magnets work and why do puppies get sad. Forget the small stuff, it's all about the big picture, man! But watching a movie like this, one can't but feel that it is a spell of doom without trying to explain the how or the why. Aronofsky injected elements of his own life into the movie, and through them we get a glimpse of contemporary anxieties – one where the fear of violent death is on the same page as mild social discomfort. While this might be a solid cross section of contemporary society, the movie itself has gaps far too wide to simply ignore. And that's without even talking about heavier issues that the movie steps into with little to no regard. <br/><br/>BONUS: If you want a fun little drinking game, watch this movie and take a shot whenever the movie cuts to Jennifer Lawrence's face looking bewildered. Try to make it past the 30 minute mark."
"Hawkensian","5","10","16","3 October 2017"," A decidedly inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby that amounts to little more than a series of pretentious metaphors and allegories
","I can absolutely understand why someone would dislike or even hate this film, but let's start with the positives. Firstly, the sound editing is excellent; you hear every footstep and creaky floorboard in the imposing, shape shifting house that is a character in itself. These unnervingly sensual acoustics aid the DoP's extreme closeups, which create an awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere. The performances are good, too. <br/><br/>The problem is quite simply this - what on earth is it all about? Well, Aronofsky says his story is drenched in biblical references, but these complexities are only fully apparent to those who have either read Aronofsky's artist statement or are well versed in the good book. It's also been said that 'Her' represents mother earth while the rest of the characters represent the threats to our planet. This is the kind of over reliance of pseudo-profound metaphors rather than complex, believable characters and narrative that really turn me off. It's better to ignore Aronofsky's self- indulgence and see it for what is - a massively inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby with a semi-interesting metaphor about selfish masculinity at its core.<br/><br/>Now the theme of self-absorbed, self-pitying masculinity could make for a very interesting film, but any possible resonance is lost when a filmmaker communicates this subject through a litany of chaotic metaphorical surrealism. <br/><br/>The reverse is true of Rosemary's Baby, which is rooted in chilling reality with an endearing central performance by Mia Farrow, whose relationship with John Cassavettes's character is human and romantic. The relationship between 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence) and 'Him' (Javier Bardem), on the other hand, is bereft of development; we barely even see them communicate. You could argue that this is because 'Him' represents male self-absorption, but it's difficult to empathise with a couple that have such an odd lack of chemistry. <br/><br/>This dubious central relationship quickly receives even less attention as 'Him' entertains a gradually increasingly large group of hateful strangers who further harass and use 'Mother'. Her treatment caused me to feel some degree of indignation, but I didn't genuinely care because mother! amounts to little more than a sequence of pretentious allegories and metaphors. It's just like watching a bad dream, and dreams don't have the tangibility and resonance of reality."

Mother shows this faux genius for the hack that he is.<br/><br/>Mother is an allegorical Bible class from a man who seems to have cherry-picked a few Bible characters and stories, put them into his scriptwriting software, and danced with glee at the resulting mess.<br/><br/>Mother is possibly one of the most ham-fisted, ""my audience is dumb, so I must not be subtle"" movies I have ever seen. There is no subtlety here. Aronofsky bludgeons you about the head with his allegory (more on that later) with all the zeal of Conan the Barbarian going about a murder spree.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie is essentially nothing but allegory. The story is nothing but allegory. There is no real plot. Nothing that resembles reality. In fact, it resembles more of an art-house movie than an actual film for the masses. And that brings me to my current, most-hated, aspect of the movie industry.... misrepresentation.<br/><br/>The trailers for this film paint a horror story in which poor Jennifer Lawrence and her writer husband are assailed by strangers and things get increasingly weird and dangerous. It is not a horror movie (well, it is horrible) but you get what I mean. People going into this expecting to see a by-the-numbers scare flick will have no idea what they are getting into. They will feel cheated. They will feel misled. They will be right.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the scorn poured by these people on to this film cannot, in good conscience, be felt to be unfair. When you open your tub of Hagen-Dasz and find a dead rat inside, it is hard not to be outraged by the deception.<br/><br/>The only reason I can fathom for why Hollywood does this kind of ""Bait-and-Switch"" trailer/film routine is because they just want more butts on seats. They really don't care about their audience if they try to mislead them in such a way. Money is the bottom-line here.<br/><br/>So, misrepresentation and ham-fistedness aside, is it any good? At best, it is.... meh! You can't really judge this as you would any other film because it doesn't conform to typical film standards. There is no plot, because it isn't based in reality. There is only allegory. Oh yeah, about that...<br/><br/>Wikipedia defines allegory as a metaphor whose vehicle may be a character, place or event, representing real-world issues and occurrences...largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.<br/><br/>I would put it to you that an additional footnote should be added to this description, to wit: Allegory: A literary device often employed by those who like to think themselves smarter than the rest of us but which is usually so poorly implemented as to highlight their ineptitude.<br/><br/>So, Darren Aronofsky, you can take you terrible allegorical Biblical nonsense with a side order of Mother Nature and the death of religion and give me my money back. If I want to see a two hour ""Look at what I made!"" I'll visit my sister's house and let her small children show me the delights of fingerpainting. Truth is, that'd be a lot more fun, and probably way more ""artistic"" than this movie.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Misrepresented nonsense. Brings a new meaning to the term ""Bible Thumping"". More pretentiously thin gruel served up as a main course of a film. Really not worth your time, or money."

"paul-allaer","3","10","16","17 September 2017"," Hints of Rosemary's Baby but nowhere near as good as that classic
","""Mother!"" (2017 release; 125 min.) brings the story of a couple living in a remote house. The woman wakes up, but her husband is up and about already. We later learn that he is a well-known writer but suffering from writer's block, and that she is restoring the house room by room. Then out of the blue a man comes knocking on the door and the husband invited him in, even though he doesn't know him. Turns out the guy thought their place was a bed-and-breakfast. To the wife's surprise and dismay, her husband invites the man to stay the night. Then the next morning, the stranger's wife comes knocking at the door... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Darren Aronofsky, who previously brought us the excellent ""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem For a Dream"", among others. Here he goes in a very different direction and brings us... what exactly? a haunter house scary movie? a psychological terror drama? If you have seen the movie's trailer, you have a pretty good idea what to expect, that is, in the first 45 min. of the movie. After that, the movie goes into a completely different direction. No worries, I won't spoil, but I will say this: I was at times bewildered as to what is going on, at times annoyed, at times fascinated. In other words: the movie is all over the place. It is for me one of the weaker movies that Aronofsky has made to date. Jennifer Lawrence gives her all, and is quite good. Javier Bardem has a difficult role as the inherently unlikable husband. Ed Harris plays a small but vital role as the stranger, as does Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife. An what to make of those final 15 min. of the movie? I couldn't make heads or tails of it, except that I kept thinking about ""Rosemary's Baby"", although that classic is better than ""Mother!"" by a mile or two.<br/><br/>The movie opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (less than 20 people in a huge theater), and that is not a good sign for a movie just opening. Bottom line: if you are a fan of either Darren Aronofsky or Jennifer Lawrence, I'd suggest you check out this movie, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","Spoilers AHEAD<br/><br/>I love reading the take on theme and religion and allegorical nonsense. This is just a bad movie. And I really like Lawrence, Harris and Pfeiffer normally. But not even they could save this. If you pretend really hard, yes, you can see Lawrence as Mother Earth and the rest of the gang as the evils of mankind (war, disease, pollution, greed, blah blah blah) but frankly, it doesn't make the movie any better if your audience misses the point. And if you're writing for the three people who might get it, you're not really someone that should be given the kind of money it takes to make a movie. Seriously, donate it to charity. It'll be better overall for the world."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","21","39","22 September 2017"," The weirdness of 'Mother!' has to be seen to be believed
","'Mother!' is a perfect example of a film that raises such high hopes with one of the best and most disturbing trailers (every bit as much as the trailer for 'IT') of the year, yet turns out to be the complete anti-thesis in quality making it one of the most disappointing, and to me the strangest, films of the year.<br/><br/>It is really sad for me to say this about 'Mother!' Appreciate Darren Aronofsky very highly, though totally get why his films don't click with all viewers, and really liked to loved all his pre-'Noah' films, especially 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream' ('Black Swan' was also great, and while it is one of his more polarising films likewise with 'The Fountain'). 'Noah' for me was a real disappointment, though it was nowhere near as bad as the initial audience response on IMDb (which was of vitriolic hate with severe objections to how the 'Noah's Ark' story was treated).<br/><br/>To me, 'Mother!' is Aronofsky's worst. Was expecting to be terrified and riveted but ended up being perplexed and left completely cold. Although the trailer was one of the year's best, it turned out to be one of the most misleading. Is 'Mother!' irredeemable? No, absolutely not, Aronofsky's films are at least extremely well-made and crafted and he often gets great performances out of well-chosen casts, even if there are other aspects that don't connect. Could it have been much better? Considering it had Aronofsky's name on it, that most of his previous films are examples of great film-making and that it had talent like Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, yes it should have been much better.<br/><br/>Where 'Mother!' fares strongly are in the visuals and the acting, pretty much the film's only near-uniformly good assets. It's a wonderful-looking film, especially in the agile and truly unsettling cinematography that gives a real disconcerting sense that there are things constantly lurking around. The production design is audacious and creepy, the house like an increasingly opening up character of its own, the lighting is rich in atmosphere and the aesthetics are more than accomplished.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence sheds her usual quirkiness and feistiness, and gives a more vulnerable edge here which is not just wholly convincing but also very moving. Michelle Pfeiffer stands out in support in a truly startling turn, likewise with Ed Harris and their chemistry is far more interesting than that between Lawrence and Bardem. Domhall and Brian Gleeson (sons of Brendan) do very capably with little to do.<br/><br/>Aronofsky does bring some dynamic to his directing, if more in the style and atmosphere than in the storytelling and content.<br/><br/>However, 'Mother!' really is let down by that it feels incredibly muddled. Throughout there are a mishmash of tones, whether it was horror, thriller of a psychological kind, allegory and perhaps torture porn, and it all felt thrown in with not much thought in what to do with them. There are moments of an unsettled vibe, but only in spurts. A vast majority of the film has scares that are very much empty and too reliant on done to death old dark/haunted house tropes and at times unintentionally funny, the intense close ups and sudden reveals feel overused and neither provoke chills or sympathy for the protagonist (for all Lawrence's efforts).<br/><br/>The pacing is far too sedate to be thrilling and there is nothing sensual about the film due to the chemistry between Lawrence and Bardem being so lukewarm. 'Mother's' content is obvious a lot of the time, and the symbolism and allegorical elements came over as excessive, heavy-handed and overblown. It was not the matter of not getting them, it is the way they were used that has put people off and that it is hard telling what Aronofsky is trying to say. It was also not the matter of hating things that do things differently, have seen my fair share of unconventional films and have been impressed.<br/><br/>While Aronofsky succeeds in the stylistic elements and some atmosphere, the storytelling doesn't work here. The momentum is creaky constantly and the whole telling of it is strangely muddled at best and incomprehensible at worst. Particularly bad is the last half an hour, which descends into ridiculous and incoherent chaos and outlandishness. The dialogue is stilted and rambling and the characters are very thinly sketched, especially Bardem's, though Lawrence's is also too passive and is not easy to root for. There are exceptions to the acting, Bardem looks bored in his role and Kristen Wiig is completely out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, a disappointing film (didn't hate it, just didn't care for it) that should have delivered on creepiness but instead delivered on excessive weirdness that it has to be seen to be believed. It is not hard to see why it has polarised critics and audiences alike. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie starts well and I enjoyed the first third of the movie. I got the message and emotion of the movie by then... great... we all got it. But then the director could not stop himself and goes completely overboard. The movie goes on and on with numerous unnecessary metaphors that do not serve any purpose except being smart. The storytelling becomes patronizing and stops making sense. It killed most of the emotion I could feel in the first third of the movie. I found the second half of the movie sad, not because of the story of which I was detached from by then, but because I could feel the director's obvious thoughts in every scene that served nothing."
"GiraffeDoor","2","4","5","15 December 2019"," I would rather watch the video for the Blondie song on loop for 2 hours than ever watch this again.
","How could they let this happen?<br/><br/>Apparently a very polarizing movie. One side says it's dense and incoherent, the other that it's a lot more subtle and nuanced than it might appear on an obvious level.<br/><br/>Something I keep hearing people say about certain movies is ""dafuq did I just watch?"" And today I am one of them.<br/><br/>While watching the end of this today (I began it over a week ago), I thought to myself that I would say something like ""one of those movies that's either super clever or complete trash with no inbetween"" but no. I am not going to give this movie the satisfaction. If there is anything to admire in this movie's writing then it was so over my head that I have to strain my neck to see it.<br/><br/>With so many generic, paint by number horrors/thrillers on the market it can be so nice to find something a bit different. Something audacious, something that defies easy categorization and targets the more patient viewers, not the ones that can't take anything different. Even if it isn't a resounding success that it tried to be something fresh will surely win it some points right? But the darker side of experimental art is that it can go so horribly wrong.<br/><br/>I have no intelligent criticisms. This incoherent mess of inexplicable events with infrequent supernatural elements seemingly shoehorned in is simply too much. It feels like a parody without any sense of humor. At least ""Epic Movie"" had some fun with itself. It's not even sort of fun in how campy and over the top it is, it's like a 2 hour music video without any memorable music. Apparently they used next to no music which I would admire normally since nothing seems to ruin an otherwise good horror than the over use of its score. But that was sadly wasted here.<br/><br/>It keeps its cards close to its chest, but the situation drags on for so long on the same basic idea that you think this must be going somewhere toward some big twist or reveal. Some movies are daring and cool for keeping it mysterious but this just feels the writer kept a dream journal, cherry picked the stuff that sort of felt spooky and just slapped as close to plot as he could around it to cover his tracks, hoping that some of the audience would just assume it was deep. I want a deep movie, I'm not trying to hate on parallel cinema or the avant-garde, but we need to be wary of things that are so style over substance.<br/><br/>I thought at one point maybe the reason I don't get this movie was because it was playing on a very feminine mentality. This wife and soon-to-be mother has married a poet admired by many and only wants to build a household to raise his kids and be near him. But she finds she won't be able to avoid sharing him with his followers as easily as she thought. Tons of visitors being bizarrely bad guests is this movie's favorite gag (or horror equivalent) and it gets old fast. I try to be the best feminist I can be, I get women and girls are just people like me but heteropatriarchal culture maybe gives them a perspective I can only obliquely appreciate. Though this was indeed written by a man I believe. But it can't be that. That only begs the question of...everything else.<br/><br/>I sort of want to admire how it was almost disquieting inexplicable the whole thing is for its first two acts. You get a firm feeling there is something going on that people aren't talking about but it doesn't really work, I guess in part due to no groundwork or good characters.<br/><br/>The movie begins with...well she's sort of on fire. And then there's some kind of house magic. This is a supernatural element but it almost feels like an afterthought. There is an excellent non-supernatural movie in here somewhere they didn't even try to chisel it out. Every marble masterpiece was once just nondescript marble in a chink of rock. And here, they've just left it in.<br/><br/>Early on in the movie I was a bit distracted by how in-your-face the cinematography is. It's almost comical. Almost. I decided early on this movie was made of superior stuff. There was a pretty good atmosphere of quiet dread, or there would have been if they had had less artificial dialogue and better camerawork. Then people come to visit and...I can't even. They don't even try to justify it, it's like they got the wrong script at one point and started making a different movie and didn't edit it out.<br/><br/>And the final act...this bizarre crescendo of craziness. It feels like a creepypasta but extra pretentious. They get so deep into it as a plot with the magical elements so well established that you expect to get some kind of explanation or resolve. But you do not. It seems to think its edgy and challenging but it's just lazily exploiting macabre and emotional tenderness.<br/><br/>And finally Ms Lawrence: is she physically able to play a character in a way that doesn't make me want to punch her in the face? Every role she takes should have gone to Kristen Stewart. There, I said it. Bring on the dislikes, but I am sick of seeing her get all these roles. At least a better actor didn't have to get dragged down with this sickly, arrogant, over-ambitious yet poorly thought through, pseudo-intellectual mess.<br/><br/>The possibility it could be an allegory, let alone one about genesis, never occurred to me. I must be that oblivious. But even if it is allegorical so what? What am I supposed to get out of that? Allegories can be so cool, like Animal Farm, but Animal Farm had a lot of pertinent points to make about freedom of expression and how there are more than two sides in political struggle. How do any parallels in this narrative with Genesis absolve it of anything? I already know genesis and even if it is a variation, it is a lazy variation. The mother is presumably meant to be some Gaia analogue because she's a fertile woman and is fixing a house. She doesn't ""give and give and give"", is it even her name on the deed? Her husband isn't remotely god-like and if that's the point then why have him there? Is it a comment on the artificiality of religion, the heteropatriarchal biases of culture and how we mistreat our world? Well that's swell but when you're talking about feminism and environmentalism you need more nuance than ""they're really good things"". The check list of allusions to the bible aren't clever or or interesting, they just seem plagaristic. Literary allusions are cool but they need to be worked into a story that already has substance. The apparently motiveless destruction and abuse by the fans is shallow exactly because they are motiveless. Mr. Aronofsky has realised the delight of a parable: you can do whatever and just tell people its deeper than it looks, character motivation doesn't matter...<br/><br/>It seems this movie is trying to tell us this: the world is in a bit of a mess, we are not treating the environment we live in well even though it is ultimately what sustains us and we are not learning from our mistakes.<br/><br/>But that's the gist of a thousand elementary school assemblies across the world. And they at least got to the point without artificially stretching it to two hours. A 6 year old dressed in a paper mache planet Earth may not be the best actress but at least she's kind of adorable which makes her a lot more fun to watch than most of Lawrence's performances.<br/><br/>I am quite convinced that this movie really had nothing new or pertinent to say; just a very loud way of saying it."

","""Mother!"" follows a couple (Lawrence and Bardem) who live in solitude in an expansive farmhouse that the wife has painstakingly restored from a fire. One evening, they are visited by a doctor (Ed Harris), whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) follows. The dynamics of the home are turned upside down, and chaos ensues.<br/><br/>I won't attempt to give a full plot summary here, as it's truly a waste of time. If the cryptic promotional materials and slim premise are enough to intrigue (as they did myself), then give the film a go. The first half of ""Mother!"" is just shy of brilliance, with bizarre character interactions, wry humor, and phenomenal performances from all involved. At times, the dynamics between Lawrence, Bardem, Harris, and Pfeiffer give one the sense that they're watching a zany stage play, and the actors (especially Pfeiffer and Harris) clearly have a ball with this. As the film progresses into its second half, it shifts and expands in ways that are unabashedly over-the-top, and Aronofsky quite literally pulls the rug out from under his audience. <br/><br/>The film is stuffed with metaphors that are clearly Biblical, but there are numerous bents and other influences spilling in, most notably ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which seems to be a prominent influence Aronofsky wears on his sleeve here; that said, ""Mother!"" is a very different film from it. The second act is chaotic and grotesque, and it's effective up to a point, but it brazenly crosses the line that the first act so cleverly toed; and perhaps that's the aim here, but it's not as enthralling as what comes before it. <br/><br/>Overall, I found ""Mother!"" at times riveting and consistently well-acted. It moves from being delightfully off-kilter and sinister to fiery pandemonium, the latter of which doesn't have the same consistent pull as the former. It is no less a thoroughly weird and engrossing epic that demands attention, but I personally found the second act to run itself thin. 7/10."

"ThomasDrufke","4","14","25","18 September 2017"," A Metaphor that Doesn't Work in the Slightest
","There are certain movies that just aren't my cup of tea. Mother! is the type of movie where your reaction could be predicated on what you expected. Having watched only a little bit of the marketing campaign, I didn't entirely know what I was in for. With that said, Darren Aronofksy has a distinct style in each of his films, with each being highly divisive in nature. Mother!, which could be one of his simplest and yet ambitious films to date, is perhaps the only film of his that I just can't come around to.<br/><br/>Because of how difficult it is to discuss the film's plot without giving anything away, I'll just say this is the part of the review where you turn back if you have yet to see it. (SPOILER ALERT). This film is about mother earth and god. Yep, Aronofsky has made another film tied into the bible, except this time, It's a complete borefest. I say this with the utmost respect for the filmmakers, as I can always appreciate a film that does something different with its plot structure, but there wasn't a single moment of Mother! in which I was invested. If Aronofsky set out to make an uncomfortable experience than he can consider this film a success. Seemingly only using soft- focus and close-up shots of his actors, there isn't a single moment of comfort in the entire film. That can work in a movie, if the story is good enough (see. Requiem for a Dream), but if the film is simply plotting along to get to that big exclamation point ending, then it's just not that good.<br/><br/>Fittingly, the reviews have been pretty mixed so far. I figure a movie which mostly deals with humans ripping Jennifer Lawrence's earth apart and poorly treating their surroundings isn't the easiest audience or critic pleaser. However, I expected more from this film. Labeling it as a horror-mystery is certainly deceiving. Was the mystery supposed to be on what the film is actually about? Was the horror just supposed to be those last 20 minutes when everything goes to sh*t? I often talk about how an ending can save a film from being mediocre, but I think it can just as easily take an okay film and turn it into a complete let down. I think that's where my main complaints lie with this film, is that it's not at all what I wanted it to be, and the metaphor they were going for (while an interesting idea/premise) isn't executed in an interesting way.<br/><br/>As I said, I can always appreciate how original some art-house films can be, and Mother! is certainly no different. But the execution left me feeling dull, unimpressed, and downright bored. So even if there's some cool ideas, I can't give this a positive review.<br/><br/>4.0/10"

But that's OK, see, because it's this METAPHOR for how CHRISTIANS are raping the earth (mother!) by a blind devotion to a patriarchal god. So, you know, male ego/bad, female creator/good. Christians/bad, seculars/good. <br/><br/>So here we have 1) Aronofsky manipulating the theater going public using shock value to sell a movie to line his own pockets 2) That shock value being at the expense of a woman's body 3) Traumatizing the general public 4) A man speaking for women 5) A filmmaker normalizing binary stereotypes (newsflash: all humans have an ego and all humans are capable of being creative) 6) Creating an ""us vs. them"" smug superiority of non-religious people thinking they are morally superior to religious people (not necessarily, folks)<br/><br/>So now the discussion/controversy is all about RELIGION and the BIBLE and how men SUCK and women are AWESOME and how STUPID religious people are, but it's not even women telling the story and it's USING THE VIOLATION OF WOMEN'S BODIES to make a point. What it IS is traumatizing women watching and normalizing violence against women's bodies that are apparently metaphorical objects to represent ""nature"" in allegorical tales. It's white male progressive finger pointing using ""standing up for women"" as cover to promote a wholly unproductive (not to mention reductive) black and white view of ""religion."" <br/><br/>This film is supposed to be this super clever bait and switch. Like, ""we are going to trick you into watching a film that you think is a horror film but is really this feminist film about how we should all be nice to nature because it's female."" If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck--it's some man making millions off of psycho-porno-pathic violence against women for entertainment. But it's 2017, and Aronofsky wants to think of himself as progressive, so this ""allegory"" is how he's keeping himself in denial that he's being just as exploitive of women's bodies as every other horror film.<br/><br/>It's just crap piled on crap piled on crap masquerading as some sort of profound allegory. But it's just crap. And offensive."
"joshbarton15","4","13","23","17 September 2017"," How not to get over writer's block by Darren Aronofsky
","Marmite films, the ones you'll either love or hate, are a rarity these days. Films that polarise audiences certainly have a place in the world, their subjectivity often leading to intense discussions regarding what exactly it is they represent. Darren Aronofsky's mother! had some striking promotional material, the poster featuring Jennifer Lawrence's Mother with her heart ripped from her chest being the one that stuck with me the most, and it reportedly divided audiences at the Venice Film Festival with half giving it a standing ovation and half booing it. For these reasons, I was definitely intrigued to see Aronofsky's latest.<br/><br/>A couple's tranquil existence is disrupted and their relationship tested when a number of uninvited guests arrive at their home.<br/><br/>For the first hour or so of mother!, it's safe to say I was fully invested in the mystery surrounding the narrative and characters of Darren Aronofsky's film. It's clear from the very first shot that this isn't going to be an easy film to sit through, the image of a burning woman certainly striking a chord but then completely juxtaposed within seconds as we begin to see the tranquil surroundings of Mother and Him, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>As their peace is eventually disturbed by a string of strangers, who begin to arrive in their numbers, refusing to leave or acknowledge Mother's place as the homeowner, my intrigue grew more and more. The visions of Mother and the weird behaviour of both Him and their guests surely had to have a worthy pay off.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Aronofsky's film takes a bizarre turn for its final act and it left me on the verge of hating this film. You'll struggle to see why mother! warrants an 18 certificate until the final act and, when you do see why, you might just be scratching your head like me. There are some very distressing moments put to film here so I warn you now, if you're easily offended, this might not be the film for you. It might be open to interpretation however, I just sat in my seat questioning what exactly had just happened before my eyes. Maybe mother! is a film that I would need to watch again to fully understand but right now, I'm not a fan.<br/><br/>That's not to say I didn't appreciate anything about this film because there are some very good performances on show for a start. Jennifer Lawrence may have her haters but, for me, she's one of the best young actresses working today and she showcases her talent with a performance full of paranoia and vulnerability. Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer make for an extremely mysterious trio, each of them honing in on a behavioural trait to cause Lawrence's Mother to fret so much.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's mother! is a home invasion thriller the likes of which have never been seen before. The film may look gorgeous and feature some fine performances however, when the film decided to opt for the batshit crazy route for its final act, it lost any hope of me marking this as a modern classic."
"mpeters1615","3","18","34","15 September 2017"," Reminiscent of Rosemary's Baby Except No Has Any Names
","The depraved religious impulse that animates this film is disturbing on two levels. First, as a testimony to the human mind's dark confusion that spins out an endless parade of demented frenzies of sacrifice and worship, and second, that the writer/director holds hostage any entertainment value until you are willing to accept his demented cosmology. But, I did love the feel given by Aronofsky's medium of 16mm film. Also, following Jennifer Lawrence's every move for practically two hours from six inches away was worth the torment."
"nanagladys","3","17","32","15 September 2017"," Very disappointing
","Lets start this by saying now..this movie is NOT a horror movie !!If you want to See a Hollywood blockbuster scary flick then it is not for you ! I had tickets booked for opening night,I had no idea what it was about but still I was so excited to see this movie, the trailer made it appear fast paced and thrilling, sadly this movie was neither. As the film dragged on and got more and more strange all sorts of questions were going through my mind.. Is she dreaming? Is he some weird cult leader ? Are these people really there? There are lots of questions unanswered, what was the yellow powder she was drinking ? Why didn't she just go ? And finally the last Question at the close of the film... Erm what ? There were an awful lot of people who just plain didn't get it. In a sense its achieved one thing and that is that people are talking about it. Personally I felt it tried so hard to be ""deep"" it was pretentious, just overdone long winded and strange, really strange. I had to add this because I really am disgusted by a few who are not capable of making a point without being insulting. there are those who love this movie and those who don't, as with all movies its not for everyone, however because some feel its not a great movie does not give those who do the right to be insulting. sure have an opinion ..about the movie, but not other users, it doesn't make you look smart or by saying that those who disliked it have less intelligence and are therefore beneath you. It just makes you look pompous and shallow. OK I'll get off my soap box now ðŸ˜ž"

It's raw artistry of the highest order, a reminder that Art is better left as unchecked as possible."

"makleen2","3","20","39","3 October 2017"," A Pretentious Danse Macabre
","Mother! (2017), staring Jennifer Lawrence as the titular character and Javier Bardem as her husband, Him, is writer/director Darren Aronofsky's nihilistic allegory for Biblical creation and the rape of nature. Though marketed as a psychological thriller, Aronofsky told Vanity Fair after the Toronto International Film Festival the film is ""about how it must feel to be Mother Nature."" It was partially inspired by Shel Silverstein's picture book The Giving Tree. No, really.<br/><br/>The story itself isn't very interesting. A writer lives with his much younger wife in an old octagonal farm house on the prairie. Uninvited house guests interrupt their solitude. Their transgressions worsen, climaxing in a murder that leaves a permanent, bloody scar in the floor. Things settle down again after Mother becomes pregnant, but then crescendo into an orgy of violence and depravity as the writer's fans take over the house and begin worshiping him.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say for what audience Mother! was intended. People who enjoy long, boring interludes punctuated by moments of extreme violence? It's not for the squeamish or easily triggered, but it's not a work of genius either. For my part, it was painful to see talented actors and actresses, including Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, wasted on this pretentious monstrosity.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, and especially in the final act, Mother is marginalized, tormented, brutalized, and violated. At one point, her clothes are torn open and she is repeatedly punched in the face. Finally, her heart is torn from her burnt chest. I think it's a little bizarre that A-list actress Jennifer Lawrence, who prides herself on playing strong female leads and on being a role model for young women, would agree to star in her boyfriend's deranged snuff film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to call her a hypocrite, but after reading her explanation in The Telegraph, all I could think was, wow, this person is really dumb. Aronofsky compounds that feeling when he explains that he wrote the script's first draft in five days, and that it stemmed from his frustration at not being able to do anything about ""living on this planet and sort of seeing what's happening around us."" Oh brother. Lawrence and Aronofsky's combined net worth is $145 million. They're powerless to help the planet? Try planting a tree or picking up some trash on the sidewalk.<br/><br/>The pernicious belief that the earth would be better off without human beings is fashionable among radical environmentalists, and illustrated in Mother! by Mother's constant pleading and begging Him to get rid of their annoying house guests and return to their solitude. Yet without humanity, there is no theater, no movie, no audience, and no point to be made. As Nietzsche says in his essay On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense, ""Â…this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life."" <br/><br/>I bring this up simply to illustrate that what we're seeing on screen is Darren Aronofsky's own self-defeating revulsion and disgust at humanity, not some clever point about how nature is harmonious without human beings. Aronofsky has clearly cast Javier Bardem not as God the Father but as himselfâ€“the creator of this film and someone who harbors deep resentment toward humanity.<br/><br/>Audiences have strongly reacted to this film. I saw one couple leave during the infanticide scene, but overall I found it incredibly boring. If I wasn't writing a review, I probably would have walked out of the theater as well. When Mother wakes up the morning after having sex and declares ""I'm pregnant,"" someone in the audience actually started laughing. I had a hard time staying awake until the end.<br/><br/>When Alejandro Jodorowsky's Fando y Lis premiered at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, a riot broke out and the director's car was pelted with rocks. It was banned by the Mexican government for its sacrilegious depiction of Catholic ritual. Like Fando y Lis, Mother! also features surreal scenes, cannibalism, and a female protagonist being brutalized by a frenzied mob. Will Mother! have as much impact in today's America? Or will audiences simply react with revulsion to its grotesque Grand Guignol and miss the religious symbolism altogether? <br/><br/>Overall, there's not much positive to be taken away from this film, although I did appreciate the setting. Everything had a raw, earthy look and feel. Real texture. I love when the characters literally dig into it and organic wounds open up as though the house itself is alive. Once again, style trumps substance in 2017."
"zzeynepozsen","9","10","17","21 October 2019"," You can see the art behind the scenes.
","Actually this movie isnt my favorite movie but i wanted to talk about it because I couldn't choose my fav. Anyway,Mother is a American psychological horror? film. jennifer lawrence and Javier Bardem are starring.The plot follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple. The main place is lead characters's house.Mother was directed by Darren Aranofsky. most of the people who watched the film did not understand the message. The movie is satire to religion to god, every scene, every detail is a hidden symbolic passage. example: In one scene a man is in the bathroom and his back appears bruised, it means that he is Adam and his back is injured because God took his rib to make Eve. What I understood from the film is that it shows that God would be a selfish being that while man destroys the world and nature he only cares about being worshiped. You need to watch the movie and at the same time associate that part of the bible it is referring to, and which bible character each actor represents so you can see the art behind the scenes.ðŸ˜‹"

","I had the misfortune of not knowing what this movie was about before I saw it. I was surfing for a movie to watch I came across it and it sounded like a horror flick. The joke is on me- the horror part was due to it being so bad. <br/><br/>I get it- those of who wonder how someone like Al Gore who's carbon footprint equals a small failed Soviet state is able to waddle his way around the world preaching are horrible people. However, I did love the environment until I saw this movie. Now the ice caps can't possibly melt fast enough for me. Any topic responsible for a movie like this is evil. <br/><br/>After the movie I did some research. Polar bears were seen weeping the week this movie was released. They were so distraught that 100s of them forgot to eat and many of those died. Whole species of animals drew straws to see who would kill themselves off so they could be labeled as extinct. FACT. Think of that- a movie so bad that millions of animals and insects etc got together and tried to make their species extinct. <br/><br/>This movie was more pretentious then the board of the SF Museum of Modern Art. At what felt like hour 16 of this movie I started praying for an asteroid to finish us off. And I don't even like asteroids. <br/><br/>The acting was horrible, the idea that they were setting us all up for this big OMG moment was pathetic. I am currently looking for an attorney to represent me in a lawsuit against every one that did not warn me about this movie- So, if you saw this movie before me, rated it about a 4 and did not do everything humanly possible to warn me that is was horrible then I will be seeing you in court!<br/><br/>Good Day Sir or Ma'am!

And as an aside, Michelle Pfeiffer was fantastic."
"evanston_dad","3","5","7","21 January 2018"," Hot Mess
","Apparently I'm a moron, because I was supposed to see in ""Mother!"", Darren Aronofsky's latest exercise in hysteria, a Biblical parable taking us from Adam and Eve all the way through the apocalypse, with some commentary about climate change and Man's destruction of the Earth thrown in for good measure. I of course got the general Biblical vibe because it's pretty hard to miss, but I didn't take it quite so literally as a retelling of the Bible from A to Z, because how boring. Like what we really need is yet another retelling of a Biblical anything.<br/><br/>Though it shouldn't have surprised me, because this is the man who gave us a whackadoodle version of Noah's ark. I liked that one, because who doesn't want to think that the orcs from ""Lord of the Rings"" made an appearance in the Bible? But ""Mother!"" is a big pile of hooey, and a deeply unpleasant one to experience at that. <br/><br/>I wanted to like ""Mother!"", because it's been so divisive and it's way more fun to see brilliance where other people miss the point. But I was left feeling like this movie is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying......well, we all know how that line ends don't we?<br/><br/>The formidable talents of Jennifer Lawrence are wasted on a role that requires her to do nothing but run around getting increasingly annoyed that people are trashing her house. It's a repetitive performance in a repetitive movie that moves in fits and starts. Aronofsky runs out of ideas early on and decides that the way to add variety is to ratchet up the volume one notch at a time until everything crashes down in a flaming pile of carnage.<br/><br/>So I missed the Adam and Eve thing, but I did have some other interpretations of the film. One of the most straightforward examines the subservient role a woman plays in a marriage, especially when married to an artist. Another seems to explore the futility in our troubled times of trying to keep the world out of our perfect and idealized versions of home and family. But really the movie exhausted me too much to put effort into following any of these interpretations through to their conclusions.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

After an hour in the movie descends like a lead weight into an abyss, with mayhem and craziness. It just doesn't make sense and becomes irritating and annoying beyond belief. A sterling cast are wasted on this guff and the writer needs to go back to script school. I gave up on this tosh after 90 mins and did not have a hint of a notion to find out the climax.

","It is a parable. And one of the most impressive films of the last decade. A film about poetry, poetry itself, and about people. About art.

Symbols and violence and fear and profound vulnerability. A manifesto more than a masterpiece. Great performances and a so, so clear message. As warning . And as verdict. But, more important, as precise definition of the near reality. Sure, a Darren Aronofovsky film. So, far to be comfortable. But it has the virtue to be exactly what you looking for.

"antesdespues","10","80","190","7 September 2017"," Highly symbolic, highly disturbing, highly rewarding
","I attended the premiere screening of 'mother!' and the entire audience left the cinema speechless. Potentially Aronofsky's magnum opus, 'mother!' benefits from rich religious and environmental symbolism with so much more bubbling under the surface than the majority of mainstream cinema today.<br/><br/>With a genius marketing plan - the film itself is shrouded in secrecy, with intriguing trailers which actually give away nothing - 'mother!' exceeds expectations and takes turn after turn, each more shocking and tantalising than the next.<br/><br/>Aronofksy prefaced the screening with an apology for what we were about to witness, but that we will ""feel better tomorrow"", while Jennifer Lawrence noted its biblical and environmental themes. That doesn't give away anything, though. It's almost impossible to describe it - go and see for yourself -- but give yourself some time after to decompress.<br/><br/>Lots of discussion will emerge after this film's release, and that's a good thing. It's esoteric but not alienating, and covers such a wide scope of themes that everyone will pick up something different. I found the film to be feminist in nature, and a brilliant comment on a woman's societal role in the modern era.<br/><br/>Though the acting is top-notch, the film's overall message makes 'mother!' a winner. The sheer pathos of the film overrides it's slightly clunky dialogue, and Aronofsky's assured direction will set this film to be the most-discussed movie of 2017."
"trublu215","6","38","84","10 September 2017"," An Extreme Dose of Lynch and Kubrick come with Aronofsky's Very Pretentious Mother!
","Mother! tells the story of a young woman and her older husband as they move into their dream home in the countryside. One night, an older couple shows up at their door and all hell breaks loose from there on out. Now, Darren Aronofsky has been a personal favorite since Requiem for a Dream. His sense of style and perfection to his craft always resonated in his films. The hiccup of Noah was understandable but this film is a film that just should have been better. While I did love a lot about this film, there was almost an equal amount that I didn't. <br/><br/>First off, I loved the sense of dread the film gives off. It is less interested in giving the audience jump scares rather than making the story and images linger in your mind like a bad dream. I loved Aronofsky's visual style here especially in his set design. The house is a character in and of itself (not to sound totally redundant). I also loved the cinematography. Much like Black Swan, this is a very sweeping spectacle of camera work that is intoxicating. As intoxicating as the technical aspects of the film are, the actual story, script, acting and overall pacing leave much to be desired.<br/><br/>Mother! is most certainly a film that plays with your mind but I wouldn't necessarily call this a psychological thriller. This film is a horror film that the minds of Kubrick and Lynch would bring you, not Aronofsky. The script is bare minimum, the story is paper thin and the acting is wooden and overall plain. There are no stand out performances like there was in Black Swan, The Wrestler and even Noah. It falls flat and that really takes you out of the film. Javier Bardem is another very strange casting choice. You'd think he would knock this performance out of the park but it really was quite opposite here. Truthfully, the actors don't seem like they're interested in the work until the final 15 minutes of the film and by that time, I had about given up.<br/><br/>Overall, Mother! is a very strange film that Aronofsky had seemed to not put that much thought into. While I do plan on watching it a second time to get the full effect of it because the last 20 minutes or so is a real mindf*** that is bound to throw everyone for a loop and/or anger a lot of people. Either way, this one is bound to be a divisive one among cinema lovers and Aronofsky fans as I doubt many average movie goers will take to this."
"lmsnyder-163-36782","4","12","22","18 September 2017"," Don't believe the trailers!
","Went to see Mother! earlier today, and quite honestly, I feel like I've been lied to. If you must go, a warning...do NOT believe the trailers. Mother! is not a horror film, it's not a home invasion thriller, and it's probably not like anything you've ever seen before. Mother! is a two-hour exercise in cinematic torture. OK, maybe that's a little harsh, but I don't particularly enjoy being yelled at for 120 minutes that humanity is destroying the planet. And that's what this art house film disguised as a ""home invasion horror"" film is...a biblical allegory with an environmental message. The last third of the film is very difficult to watch and some of the visuals are more than disturbing. And I've seen some pretty horrific stuff over the years. <br/><br/>The mistake with Mother! is in the marketing. If you go expecting a standard horror film - even an ""out there"" horror film - or a home invasion thriller, you'll probably hate it. At the very least, you might feel like you got played. You might even have a WTF moment...or many of them. But I'm not suggesting you stay away. What I would suggest is reading up on the film first. Read some of the good reviews out there that provide some explanations about the purpose of the film and the meanings within the movie; it will not ""spoil"" anything. If you know what the director is trying to convey, you might better appreciate the message. In my opinion, if you don't know what it's supposed to mean, you'll probably find yourself wondering what the hell is going on halfway through. <br/><br/>This film is from controversial filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, who also directed Black Swan. If you think Black Swan was a bit strange, surreal and just a little off, you haven't seen anything yet. So yes, go see it for what it is - an art house film full of symbolism. But prepare for it first, or you may have to see it again just to understand it."

","You'll either hate this movie, or you'll fall in love.it's utterly hard that you may stand in-between, simply a biblical play of man creation journey, symbolised in Him, God & Mother nature representing life of mankind, throughout the journey, you see man, loves, harms, kills, forgives and regrets. A fair dramatical line was drawn (but was nothing but a an empty cup to pour the core of the real story), which why I give it 9/10 as I wished the drama would've had more weight in the series of events. Aside from the dramatical line, this movie is a a theatrical oeuvre, certainly not a bare amusement, and not a boring churchical lecture. To me, the director (and he's well known of his - of a depth - movies) painted a shocking, sometimes disgusting, yet brutally artistic and meaningful picture; a movie that you shouldn't necessary like, and ironically enough I'd quote a scene from the movie where all the seekers reaching their hands to Him and the priest chanting: ""His words are for you!"", so certainly for those who give it the rotten deal in reviews; ""This movie isn't for you"". Definitely recommend for those who likes symbolical work, and appreciates real art."

However, the execution and the delivery of the film is not great. Unless you know about the concept, you will be confused, annoyed and eagerly waiting for it finish, as step by step it turns into a madness. This film is a lot of missed out potential. This is what happens when someone is overly concerned with pushing a message rather then making a good film. Let's get another close up of Jennifer Lawrence's face. Darren Aronofsky should stop pretending that he is a higher visionary and start trying to tell an interesting quality story instead."

"etcerebral","10","11","20","14 December 2018"," Illuminating Human Atrocity
","Let's begin with the title's tone and purpose: a surrealist representation of human behavior and cultural phenomenon. The film follows with its two, constant components: husband and wife. Husband is a seemingly loving writer who represents the narcissistic perspective; the characteristics of human psyche that include delusion/egotism/cultism. Wife is the seemingly weak lover of her husband who has deep love for her partner that is unmatched by his, concluded by one of her final lines ""You just love how much I love you"". Wife represents the idea of constant rationality; the outsider ever looking in upon a situation. The film proceeds with a visitor who is then invited to stay in their home, easing the viewer (us), into the strangeness that ensues. We meet visitor's wife who is intrusive, rude, and completely self-centered. The way she guides Wife into allowing her to do ever increasing, obtrusive things represents how sane/rational individuals will allow such travesties for the sake of accommodation, keeping an even keel, hospitality. As the plot becomes more and more unreasonable and surreal: the murder of the visitor's son, the wake party, and finally the coming of the fans, we are brought along Wife's disquieting intrusion of her home, the rational passengers. As events unfold: the coming of many fans, Husband's fall into narcissistic egotism (feeling God-like), around his sensationalized work, caring more for these random intruders than for the care of Wife's impending labor, the plot's timeline shortens and condenses. We finally see scenes of sex trafficking, glorified sacrifice, and finally the accidental murder of Wife's infant (which I must add I will have nightmares of because the literal imagery used here was heart-stopping). The point here is to portray the horrific violence and insanity humans are capable in the name of an idea, disconnected from the actual violent acts being committed. As two working examples: the holocaust occurred under the vision of ordinary people but because events progress slowly, incrementally, people can accept ever increasing insane ideas like mass murder because it is spoon fed over time. Another example would be how Charles Manson was able to systematically convince normal individuals to murder strangers in horrifically violent manners. The practice of human sacrifice, the idea that we deify Jesus' death, what boils down to the murder of one man, someone's son, that individuals now glorify as the symbol of pure ""goodness"". The point of this film is to bring into the light the true inhumanity/insanity/incredulity of acts that have been accepted by our civilization simply because we were given the time to adjust and give them explanation. This film, in my opinion, was orchestrated very smartly and complexly to take its viewer on an emotional ride into the revelation of human atrocity."

"sampah70","4","9","16","12 February 2018"," Pretentious. Infuriating self indulgence.
","The movie started with some pedophile likeness, pretty young girl (Jennifer Lawrence) and an old guy (Javier Barden aka. discount Nicolas Cage). How the movie seems to encourage pedophilia was make me sick, maybe there's a reson behind this, but I started to dislike it and ticked down my rating.
As usual, JL played an awkward incompetent pretty girl, oblivious absent-minded, disctracting and panting most of the time. She strangely attracted to an old guy (discount Nicolas Cage), also incompetent and doesn't really care of anything outside his dream world.
The couple didn't have any proper communication between them (make you wonder why they had even fell in love in the first place), that and some coincidents lead to a cliche misfit situation and more coincidents which dragged soo long you'd felt itches on your stomach.
If you weren' nauseating enough, then the good 'ol camera shaking (which doesn't have a slight justification for a drama like this), will make sure you to dislike this movie even more.

"CANpatbuck3664","4","8","14","19 January 2018"," Mother! is Ambitious but it Fails With Messy Execution and Pacing Problems
","I'm one of the first people to jump on critics for excusing an incoherent and uninteresting plot because a movie is an art film. Excuses are used, buzzwords like ""artistic"" are thrown around and they make claims like you need to ""meditate"" to understand the ""subtlety."" I will give this movie credit for being visually impressive with the limited locations that they are working with. The setting they use for the house does have a good atmosphere and with some bottle films, you can't wait to leave. With Mother! you understand the metaphor (which I won't spoil) and I was fine spending the run time in this location. The use of CGI is limited but it isn't terrible and from a cinematography is really good. I fall on the negative side for this movie but I'm not afraid to give praise where credit is due.<br/><br/>The other bone I'm going to throw Mother! is that Jennifer Lawrence puts this movie on her back and carries it as far as she can. Her character is a little one note, but you can't help but sympathize with her. Her effort is commendable, there isn't a deeply written plot or character to work with, so her charisma has to do the work. Javier Bardem is a decent leading man and while I was annoyed with his character, it wasn't his fault. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are both solid and get the job done. Pfeiffer is deliberately grating but that's what she was given to work with. Kristen Wiig is an odd addition, but the movie had already gone downhill at that point.<br/><br/>Now that the positives are out of the way, I completely get why people were furious with this movie. I knew what the movie was about going in, so I knew what to look for and it helped me understand the plot better. If I hadn't known that, I would have despised Mother! Sure, some of the translation is effective but the movie wanders off on its own path to try and string things together. This doesn't work, much like Noah (which I was mostly mixed on as well) I feel like Aronofsky just gets to pick and choose what he wants and that doesn't lead to a cohesive story or an accurate portrayal of the text. Mother! stumbles repeatedly because of this and by the ending of the movie, I had run out of patience and wasn't willing to give it anymore participation points.<br/><br/>The other thing with this movie is that its extremely uneven with its pacing. The first half of this movie has so little action of consequence that it becomes boring and then the ending ventures so far into making the message the showcase, that the plot is left in the dust. The pace is frenetic in the end (usually that's a good thing) but its too late and just makes you realize that they didn't set things up for this payoff properly. Also if you got the overall metaphor for Mother!, that ending is as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. It isn't well handled and although I agree with the message, you don't get extra praise for just having a good message if you don't explain it so the WHOLE audience can understand.<br/><br/>I like the ambition of the project and I respect Aronofsky and his team for swinging for the fences. The guy clearly has his own style and he's not content to just make the norm for the audience. These are good qualities but that doesn't make Mother! any less of a mess. There are kernels of good things in it but at the same time it feels like a vanity project that got away from the creative team. They clearly had big ideas and I can be sympathetic to them because the studio completely hoodwinked the audience in the marketing. This is an INDEPENDENT ART FILM, not a HORROR MOVIE and that's not on the people involved in making this movie, its on the studio. Even with that concession, the movie didn't work for me and by the end I was exhausted with it. I can't recommend this to anyone except professional critics, the rest of the audience is going to walk away from this like I did, confused and angry."
"afgenovese500","10","16","33","17 September 2017"," Intense emotions and a Biblical undertone
","I can understand that this movie is polarizing. Either is your cup of tea, or it is not. However, I do not appreciate some of the one-star reviews that do not make not even a little effort to recognize the achievements of this movie (others are legit).<br/><br/>First of all, the emotional tension. The confusion. The contrasting exchange of visions from the characters. This is what I think the director had in mind. We are feeling the confusion that the mother is herself feeling. We are seeing everything from her POV and as she does not understand what is going on, but only guesses, so are we. <br/><br/>In terms of interpretation, anyone familiar with the Bible will see the heavy allegorical elements and metaphorical events. I will not dwell into interpretations but I tend to agree with those mentioning the old testament and the house as a metaphor for our world (and mother -> mother nature). <br/><br/>Sometimes plot is not all that you need. Sometimes you just need to enjoy the ride (ask David Linch). Some people like modern art museums, some people do not. It is all about filling our subjective gaps and feel the emotions that the artist is generally pointing us towards, sometimes subtly, sometimes aggressively. Our subjectiveness is meant to be part of it. <br/><br/>Some people are more sympathetic (or responsive) to modern art (or trained in it) than other, which explains why art is often polarizing and niche. Totally get that and respect it. For me, it was definitely my cup of tea. Time will tell where this movie stands.<br/><br/>p.s. whoever complains about the misogyny of a character, you are talking about a fictional character. The director is not misogynist, the movie its not. The character is. Because that is what the character portrays."
"kamenhaven","10","19","41","17 September 2017"," A technical accomplishment with Dunkirk-levels of ambition and scale
","I'M NOT HERE TO REVIEW THE STORY. I suspect conversations and debates surrounding the story of Mother! will be going on for a very long time so I won't add anything to these discussions as this is one of those abstract films that can be subjected to numerous interpretations and no two individuals will have the same reading of it. What I will talk about it are the technical achievements of the movie, which is so mind-blowing it alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Purely on a technical level, Mother! was an impressive feat. Having not seen any of the trailers I was under the impression that this was going to be a small indie movie set in a single location (a house). And it certainly begins that way, lulling you with its slow-burn pace and the intimacy of its humble premise. But there is a joy in completely surrendering your expectations and preconceived notions of how good a movie is into the hands of a masterful filmmaker and just going along for the ride, trusting that the director knows exactly what he is doing. Because where the movie goes particularly in the 3rd act is absolutely insane, crazy, ambitious and filled with the kind of imagery that rivals some of the best set pieces of some of the biggest blockbusters we've seen this year. It redefines what we think about single-location movies - that a single location isn't bound by limited space and with great writing and smart tension-building you can craft an excellent big-budget set piece in a small place.<br/><br/>The sound design and foley work in particular are top-notch. The cinematography is also excellent, with the camera deliberately closed-in on Jennifer Lawrence's face in every scene as the narrative unfolds from her POV, its movements increasingly more erratic as the suspense escalates. Geography of the house is well-established so you always know exactly where you are when things go crazy. As for Jennifer Lawrence herself, this is one of the most un-Jennifer-Lawrence-roles she has ever played. She's very grounded, understated and restrained throughout the film, making all the scenes where she demonstrates her Oscar-winning acting chops all the more shocking, impactful and affecting. This restraint is prevalent in almost every aspect of the film. It never reveals more than it should or overplays its hand unnecessarily. The storytelling and editing is tightly focused and disciplined, as not a single minute of film is wasted. Every plot thread introduced is paid-off. At every turn, the movie under-promises and over-delivers, every shift in tone (did I mention Mother! is also darkly funny?) and surprising revelation a desired and crescendoed effect.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talks and conversations being devoted towards the layers of meaning and symbolism embedded within the story of Mother!. Is the movie an allegory for the bible, environmentalism, the creative process and its pitfalls or Hollywood celebrity/ fame- worship? Or is it an honest but painful artistic depiction of Darren Aronofsky's own personal love-life? Regardless of your interpretation, there will be one universal reaction - WTF did I just watch? Half of us will defend, champion and marvel at the viciously thought-provoking choices of the film (myself included), while the other half will hate the movie and declare it a piece of trash and a waste of time. I won't begrudge the latter for arriving at that conclusion, because it's not for everyone. But for those who want to experience a film that's unlike anything you've ever seen and executes its bold, daring and uncompromising vision with such amazing production values, then you at least owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance and decide if you'll hate it or love it. Because this is going to be the most talked-about movie of the year and it deserves to have you be a part of that conversation."

"Tweekums","9","6","10","30 October 2019"," Completely bonkers in a way one is likely to love or hate but unlikely to feel indifferent to
","This strange horror film is centred on a young woman; she is married to an older man. He is a poet and she works to repair their home, which was previously damaged by a fire. The house is remote but one day a man turns up claiming to have mistaken it for a guest house. The poet invites him to stay the night against his wife's wishes. The next day the man's wife arrives, she almost immediately starts asking our protagonist awkward questions and makes her feel uncomfortable; still the poet won't make them leave. Things only get worse when the guests' two sons arrive; they fight and one is accidentally fatally injured... the nightmare is just beginning.<br/><br/>I suspect this is one of those films that viewers are likely to really love or really hate but are very unlikely to consider 'merely okay'. The sense of unease is gradually introduced but quickly escalates to an early act of violence. Then things relax and appears to bet better before turning to a nightmare. There are plenty of scenes that are likely to disturb the viewer; especially towards the end. The young wife, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence, is rarely off screen is clearly uncomfortably and that feeling is likely to be shared by the viewer. The story may be a biblical allegory; something that isn't immediately obvious but grows increasingly apparent but you don't need to be religious to get it. As mentioned before Lawrence is great; she is supported by Javier Bardem who is equally fine in the more ambiguous role of her husband; a character who enjoys the adulation of his fans to the point that he neglects his wife. The rest of the cast are sold too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes their horror more than a little bit weird."

","I feel obliged to write in defense of Mother, Aronofsky's misunderstood minor masterpiece; three days after watching it, I still feel emotional tremors and deep uneasiness the film had caused in me. What causes movie-going public to so readily disregard a film that gives us something unexpected? Are we so lazy and complacent nowadays, to the point where the constant barrage of blandness from the mainstream media now causes us to recoil from the material that requires a bit of thought and emotional engagement? Mark Kermode's ""diminished expectations"" phrase comes to mind. For those expecting cheap scares of most recent horrors, I sympathize, the trailers were clearly trying to market this as a horror in order to put bums on seats. Of course it could be viewed as a horror, but just as Polanski's horror films are never just that, Mother! too offers so much more. Kathryn Bigelow recently said that it would be a shame not to use this medium to bring important issues to the front. Aronofsky is doing the same. <br/><br/>Rightly billed as the proper successor to An Inconvenient Truth, the movie has in it elements of Gaia, the theory invented by James Lovelock, the esteemed British scientist who warned us years ago that Earth, if pushed too far, will restore its natural balance by neutralizing the antagonizing agent, i.e. the human population. In fact, all of our negative traits are exposed in the third act: an insatiable appetite and propensity for violence and destruction, the hunger for the satisfaction of the ego, mindless celebrity and/or deity worship, an assumed right to claim ownership, readiness to bow to collective madness and, when given an opportunity, an utter disregard for others and the world we live in.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was perfectly cast for her role; her impotence to avert the oncoming disaster by rationality alone, was almost unbearable to watch; her innocence, honesty, emotional investment and trust she had placed in her relationship is continuously trampled on; she could almost be seen as a metaphor for powerlessness of the scientific community's consensus on global warming in the face of climate change deniers - no amount of reason or counting on the willingness to do what is right is enough, the loudest ones usually prevail.<br/><br/>Mother is a film for our times, it should be seen widely and I hope its magnificent heroine continues to contribute to its ticket sales, even if her fans might expect something a bit more ""mainstream"". It's not meant to be subtle, it wants to grab you by the shoulders, shake you and infuriate you. It perhaps wears its message on its shoulder a bit too strong, but that's not a criticism in my mind, it is a message that needs to be shouted out and this film certainly does just that.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

"jameeljubran","10","5","8","14 March 2019"," the mother movie 2017
","The mother movie - 2017<br/><br/>In this analytical essay, I will focus on one specific reading of this movie, that could possibly help to appreciate and understand some of the parts that put this psychological mystery together. In order to do that, I will use the proposotion that mother! can be read as an allegory. This means the ideas and the characters of the movie represent something else. They refer to meaningful concepts and stories that exceed the storyworld itself. The possibility of an allegory brings me to the following statement: Darren Aronofsky's mother! Is an intriguing religious allegory, in which specific sequences and characters mainly refer to biblical stories, persons and ideas.
The characters :
When the movie approached its shocking finale, it became clear to me that the male lead actually represents God. In the very beginning of the film, we see how the concept of creation goes hand in hand with the deeds of Javier Bardems character. After he touches a mysterious glowing stone, the house actually starts to 'live'. Green vegetation replaces the dust, the darkness and the silence. The house thus awakens, and so does the character called mother (Jennifer Lawrence). The temporality here (creation and awakening go together) is the first clue mother is actually mother earth or mother nature. I will come back to that observation later.
When you read the biblical book of Genesis, you can notice that the beginning of mother! resembles the process of biblical creation. Both stories elaborate on the possibility of making something out of nothing, using the performative power of a mighty entity. One interesting difference is at stake here: in Genesis, the voice of God is enough to start the process of creation (Genesis 1); in mother!, Javier Bardem needs a mystical stone to bring life into the house. This can be seen as a limitation; the God of mother! needs something else to create, he can't do it all by himself. This suggestion becomes more solid if you keep in mind that Bardems character turns out to be a poet with a serious writers block. The principle of first creation is followed by hesitation and doubt. What to do, for example, when the people wandering on earth try to kill eachother?
In my opinion, the case for the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4) is really strong here. The two sons entering the house are the sons of the first people on earth, Adam and Eve (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer). We hear a testament prejudiced the younger brother (Brian Gleeson), causing the other son (Domhnal Gleeson) to kill him out of hate and jealousy. It's also possible to see some reflections of the Jacob & Esau-story (>Genesis 25) here, as that story contains the specific element of heritage and prejudice, granted by the father (Isaak in Genesis, Adam in this story). My interpretation is that Darren Aronofsky is combining the stories of Cain & Abel and Jacob & Ezau. The narrative purpose of these references is purely suggestive: in mother!, conflicts are not caused by an evil entity (there is no snake, no devil), but by the very people God created. Evil resides in their nature, in their urge to revolt when (subjective forms of) injustice occur.
There is one character that represents real justice in this movie. The paradox of mother! is that this character isn't God. It's mother. When the movie is about halfway and all people (all but 'God' and mother) have left the house, mother confronts God with the fact that he doesn't want to make love to her. There is much more ambiguity in this question than what meets the eye; if Bardems character actually IS God, it would make sense he isn't interested in love-making. We have to take into account though that God 'became' a man of flesh and blood too; at least, if we continue thinking in christian characters, ideas and metaphors. In that case, a 'higher', metaphysical entity can actually have sexual desires. Another uncomfortable paradox... and you can definetely feel that discomfort in the painful scenes Bardem and Lawrence share.
God and mother do make love together, and this deed is followed by the strangest cinematic pregnancy I have witnessed in years. When mother wakes up the next morning, she just 'knows' she is pregnant. Her belly starts to grow, and everyone who watches this movie will confirm it doesn't take nine months to give birth this time...
The only explanation for this strange kind of affair is a religious reference once again. If mother symbolizes Maria in this sequence, the narrative contains the new-testamentical birth of baby Jesus (Matthew 1). Written and visual proof for this hypothesis follow, as there are people bringing gifts (referring to Matthew 2:11) and Bardems character starts mumbling about the 'beginning of something very special'. The climax is as intense as it should be: after a magnificent competition in staring and awkward eye-contact, Bardem takes away his son and give him to the people who are destined to do the most horrible thing. This is Gods offer to humanity, followed by Bardems completely inhuman urge to 'forgive' the people who just... well... if you saw mother!, and I hope you did at this point, you know what happened.
I will close this part of the discussion with one specific remark on the end credits. My statement is that Darren Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote his allegorical characters. Javier Bardems character doesn't have an actual name until the end credits state he's called 'Him' (note the capital H). About ten minutes earlier, the very same character proclaims the following line of dialogue: 'I am who/that I am'. This line of dialogue corresponds with a biblical phrase in Exodus 3:14. When Mozes asks God on Mt. Sinaï what his name is, Gods answer equals the only direct clue Javier Bardem gives concerning his true identity. Furthermore, Brian Gleeson and Domhnal Gleeson (they are brothers in real life too) are listed as 'the younger brother' and the 'Oldest Son' (imdb). All the guests visiting the house get characterizing titles to; there's a Zealot (!), a cupbearer, a fool, a wanderer, even a Good Samaritan (Luke 10)... none of these characters has an actual name, but all the characters have a methaphorical one.
The house :
As you can see in soome of the more surrealistic shots of this movie, the house seems to have a heart. In my opinion, the house represents planet earth. God is the owner of the house, while mother! (Lawrence) is the protector of the house, the protector of life. Note how mother tries to restore everything in the house that's broken or destroyed.
We ourselves are the unwanted guests that populate planet earth. We think we can afford to do anything, because the owner of the planet told us we could(ór we decide by ourselves we can). When Lawrences character asks the people in the house why they destroy everything and why they act as if the house is theirs, the guests all give the same answer: because the owner lets them, because he wants them to share everything. You can detect some serious criticism of religion here: I read these dialogues as a protest to the claim (of many believers) that anything is possible, just because God's on their side.
This is not a movie about truth or falsehood. It's not about the question of Gods existence. Maybe it's about the Death of God (yes, Bardem dies), but only on short notice; when the house is destroyed, the process of creation can begin again.
The ending of mother! thus brings Aronofsky's last movie Noah back in the picture. After the flood (the end of the house/world an all the people on it), God has the surreal possibility to start all over again.
Conclusion :
It's important to emphasize that mother! Is open to many readings. My interpretation isn't final at all, but I sincerely hope I have convinced you it is possible to interpret mother! The way I did. For me, the possibility of a (nearly perfect) religious allegory absolutely enriched this movie. It made me think about the screenplay in a completely different manner, and it enabled me to make sense of sequences that I probably wouldn't understand if I hadn't seen the clues I described in this essay."

","Took me 1 year to finish this movie. The first time, I lost interest from the first 10 mins and fell asleep. About 2 months later, I tried again starting from the beginning and fell asleep at around the same 10 min mark. 2-4 months later I tried again. This time from the 10 minute mark and fell asleep around the 30 min mark. Another 2 months later I caught it on hulu. Watched from the beginning and made it to the 30 min mark again. About a month or two later I put it on to intentionally fall asleep and it worked. 10 mins tops I'm out like a moth on a lamp. Today marks my approximate year since I first started watching it. Started from the 30 minute mark, it was 10:30 am so i could stay awake. Read some reviews to get a better idea of it with all intentions to watch entirely. Ate a whole box of fruit loops and drank plenty of coffee. I am may be homeless next week, so I didn't want to miss another opportunity. So glad I completed watching it. I don't believe it was exciting but if it were to have enlightened the purpose at the 10 minute mark, I would have made it through the first time. Excellent movie. I did finally come to love it. I don't like how he says ""it starts as a home invasion because everyone has a home"". Nope, not here, not anymore. Plus, everyone does not have a home, generally speaking. Shows the small rich world he is trapped in. The movie is a fine way to look at religion from all angles and not just one. So, yea. Now I fight to keep my apartment. Peace."
"ccmax","8","5","8","9 September 2018"," Excellent performance by Jennifer Lawrence
","I am not a film critic or pretend to understand what that even means exactly. I just like movies and whether I feel one is good or not is purely subjective. 
This film hit a nerve and not because of all the symbolism or what the ""true meaning"" of it was. I have never so closely related to a character in a film than I did with Jennifer Lawrence's performance. 
I was riveted by her character and the panic, anxiety and pain of her situation. It was as if it were scripted from my own dreams and nightmares (though it went much further than my subconscious mind ever has!).
The emotional turmoil and anxiety of being powerless to control 'others' from transgressions of your personal space and property was expertly portrayed. The connection for me was so intense it was disturbing to say the least.
So if a film is meant to relate to the viewer on some emotional level (isn't that really the point?) Mother! did for me specifically in regard to Ms. Lawrence's role."

"Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","10","14","30","19 September 2017"," A masterpiece of bleak truths through the scope of a surrealist's nightmare
","The amount of hatred for this film's ""nonsensical"" elements are astonishing. Though the entire film consists primarily of symbolic surrealism, I found the meaning of almost every sequence to be quite straightforward and cohesive. <br/><br/>A woman wants to maintain a tranquil life with her husband, but much like what happens with most relationships at some point, other people start to come into the picture and shake things up. To me, everything that happens in this movie is simply a symbolic progression of that ""shaking up"". It's really not that complex or abstract. These thematic elements remind me most of my favorite film of all time, Zulawski's POSSESSION, while the woman's descent into madness at times reminds me of another one of my favorites, Polanski's REPULSION. Though the film has some really great influences that it feels like it's wearing on it's sleeve, it certainly does an excellent job of maintaining it's own nightmarish world.<br/><br/>I've gotta say, I never thought after Aronofsky's mainstream acclaim, that he would make a movie like this. I figured he would have gotten all of his furthest-tier bleakness out of his system with Requiem For A Dream, but MOTHER! sits in a category alongside R4AD. Along with movies like Irreversible, it qualifies to place itself on a shelf with some of the most unpleasant movies one could possibly view. For this reason, I think that many people are unable to recognize it's mastery. When a film from the heart is this dark, this heavy, this discomforting, people simply can't accept it. It's too real. It's an effective and purposeful nightmare, but an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>The typical elements of filmmaking go without saying. The cinematography and directing are beyond. The whole cast induces discomfort, fear, and anxiety effectively... some more than others. There is no weak cast member. It's a completely claustrophobic film... but that's the point.<br/><br/>This is the best film I have seen come out in 2017. Good Time comes close, but Good Time is literally just a good time in comparison to this. I will definitely watch Good Time more times than I will probably ever watch Mother!, and I will definitely recommend Good Time to more people than I will Mother!, but Mother! is a more masterful film.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has delivered us yet another masterpiece. Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan, and now.... Mother! He is truly one of the greatest of our generation."

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","4","15 May 2018"," Holy Mother of God! What a weird psychological movie!
","Watching this horror movie from director Darren Aronofsky on Mother's Day, is probably not the best thing to do! Without spoiling the movie, too much, it's no comfortable sit popcorn flick. It's more like a nauseating 'Doomsday' want to abort, kind of a film. It's gloomy, disturbing, and highly annoying. However, it's something, you should had expect by now; seeing how Aronofsky's movies has always been hard sit. Still, as dark as his 2000's film 'Requiem of a Dream' & 2008's masterpiece 'The Wrestler', were; it did had an overarching message about hope & some uplifting moments sprinkle throughout the film. This one, not so much. Without spoiling too much of this movie, Aronofsky had turned everything good about believing for better days into a negative. It come across, as very nihilism & way too unpleasant. It will certainly turn off, positive thinkers and sensitive religionist people. If that wasn't enough, the director also, has a pessimistic misanthropy view on humanity as a whole. Focusing way too much on humanity's depravity and abuse of the natural world. Because of that, this movie has barely any redeemable characters. Most of them, are very unlikable. So, it was really hard to care or invest in what happening in the movie. If that wasn't enough, the film is also a miscarriage of sophistical ways to use surrealism metaphors in a dream-like settling. Aronofsky's writing is way too on the nose for it. Not only that, but it's really not that hard to see, where the director was going for, when he dreamt up, this fever nightmare, one night and wrote it in five days. The story of an unnamed woman (Jennifer Lawrence)'s anthropophobia mental state is being tested when uninvited guests kept on, arriving at her house is obvious, a retelling of the Bible told from nature's feminine perspective. Even, having the events set in modern day, was very poor attempt of hiding that. There was nothing really smart, in the way, Aronofsky's metaphorical scarf was trying covering the religious environmental message. I guess, that why, Aronofsky gave up, half way & just expose everything to the masses. At certain parts, the filmmaker even spell it out for you, like hinting at the apocalypse toward the end with a throwaway line of dialogue or having obvious visual tipoffs as the unnamed writer/poet (Javier Bardem) rubbing ink on the forehead of his fans or showing the infamous baby eating scene. Aronofsky is treating his audience members as if they were simpletons who can't interpret, worth anything. Not only that, but Aronofsky couldn't stop his damn mouth, before the movie was released in press interviews. He pretty much spill all the beans about his film, before people saw it. Because of that, there wasn't really anything, too surprising in the flick for people. Anybody that read the bible, knows, how it would end. 'Mother' really does lacks subtlety and nuance. So, it came across, as very predictable for a film built as a mystery. The story doesn't stand out on its own. Despite that, with its mute color choices and low lightning, the movie does a good job on making certain visuals from cinematographer, Matthew Libatique seem haunting. Even the sparing use of CGI from Andrew Weisblum and his crew kinda works for that behalf. All of those filmmaking tools really does made the house, seem really creepy. Another thing that works was the use of close ups. It really gave the feel of anxious and claustrophobic for the viewer. Yet, it's could had been, better used, if Lawrence's character's reaction was a little more emotional driven, than bland confusing stares. It made the film seem more hilarious than scary. To add on that, Aronofsky's misdirection for the over the top, gimmicky, quick paced action really does ruin the slow gothic 'Lovecraftian' fear of the cosmic unknown. It also really desensitized the viewers from feeling, the pain from more ground issues, such as the atrocities that have been done in the name of religion. It was very disconnecting in every way, despite how well-acted, the performers were. No wonder, why this movie nearly bomb at the box office. It felt like absurd Freudian wet dream, too extreme & esoteric for mainstream audiences. While, personally, I cannot recommended seeing this movie. I know, that 'Mother' is indeed, better, suite for art house crowds. However, even with that; overall, the movie is not worth worshipping about. It's a bitch to sit through."

","Why does everyone feel compelled to review something as the best or worst thing ever. Really? How is that even remotely useful to the reader? It's not a review -that's a rant. 
For those of you who don't get it, there's a little something called experimental filmmaking. It's been around for about a century, and not designed with mainstream Hollywood consumers in mind. They're art house films, and if you walk blindly into an art house theater, please don't whine because you didn't get a watered down derivative literal narrative. Artists like Darren Aronofsky and David Lynch have been at this craft for quite some time, and they know literal narrative is not hard to pull off. Symbolism, surrealism, multiple layers of perspective, that's a considerable challenge. If it's not for you, it's not for you, but it's tiring to see a convenient dismissal when someone doesn't connect with a piece. Having said that, I don't think this was Aronofsky's best effort. I thought the main concepts and core storyline were fantastic, but felt would have been best realized as a short film and condensed to 40-50 minutes. The themes were repeated to the point of being redundant, and though the point was made, it could have been made more efficiently. I don't see Aronofsky ever eclipsing ""Requiem,"" but this was a solid effort."

I had a breakdown in the bathroom asking people for help (No one helped me, I looked like a nut job). I could not even drive and was sobbing in the park lot for a queasy ten minutes. A film has NEVER done that to me. I have NEVER been shaken up like that. From an outside perspective, I keep asking myself was I so upset. I'm into horror movies and the goth and the macabre.

","Too much work to give names to Man, Woman, Him and Mother? I guess so when you write such a lame script in 5 days.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky should have stuck to only directing on this one, of which is very well done, but even there, I hated the pace. This film should've been played at 2x speed, or edited down to 90 mins max, not 121 mins. He should have left the writing to the writers of his other films that were stellar - Requiem for a Dream, Pi and The Wrestler. <br/><br/>But to come up with such a lame, pointless, slower than a snails paced plot full of holes and questions, is not art. Those of you who think this is what this was, have a vivid imagination that took over, zero credit to the writing for that, unless leaving plot holes, convoluted scenes and a genre identity crisis in the last 20 mins is your meaning of art. Seriously, what's the point of that yellow powder? No, it's not a metaphor. Neither is a chunk missing from Man's ribs or Woman's attitude a metaphor for Adam and Eve. Then there's the ridiculous last 20 mins of the film where you go from a ""quiet dinner and table for two"" to a war zone to zombie cult garbage. Ease up on the Carfentanyl, Darren.<br/><br/>Films are supposed to take you on a journey, where it shows conclusion or you come up with your own, it's a journey. All this was, was a walk into a brick wall, then repeat after 2 hours. It left me wanting more, but not from this film. I wanted it to either start some journey for my senses, or finish up quickly to be done with.<br/><br/>All I got was feeling sorry for Mother's OCD panic attacks and feel her pain for unwanted guests. I didn't need 2 hours to get that point, or the last 20 mins of mishmash garbage.<br/><br/>I would have rated this a 1/10 for the lamest writing I've seen in some time, but bumped it up to 4/10 for the stellar performances from the lead cast, and outstanding directing. Those areas deserve much more, but the writing is that bad."

","What you will learn from this film is what the words Metaphor means and what the word Allegory means.
What you will also learn is that mental torture-porn movies are now a genre ( The killing of a sacred deer falls into this category also).
If you enjoy actors walking around a house iterating sentences with a question mark after every one of them , and as a result will make you question every part of this film too, then it might be your cup of sedative. 
As I gradually understood the allegory and metaphors, I was instantly shaken into thinking what a pompous , arrogant, supercilious director mister Aronofsky has to be. I can just see him thinking to himself,, ""Oh how clever am I ,woohoo"". Of course, some viewers of this film will not be so annoyed or irritated because no doubt the obnoxious apprehension might titillate the reptilian brain. My advice, drink a nice coffee and eat a nice cake and talk to your goldfish, or if you don't have a goldfish, just talk to a wall. You will be better served."

A lot of way too obvious fake ""developments"" and quotes but really nothing. <br/><br/>When you start noticing that it's forced and not once but X times you are completely out of the ""flow"" (in part because it stopped existing long time age) and you have to force yourself do continue watching just to be able to say that you saw it. In between you read and answer a lot of e-mails, go to eat, go to online chat, catch yourself actually procrastinating but you know that you have to finish it for the sake of finishing it. Becomes a chore.<br/><br/>I'm sure that in his mind he was doing something ""mythical"" and probably wouldn't listen to anyone at all. Ended up with Aronofsky himself repeating a variation of ""it's controversial"" in attempt to sell a few more tickets, betraying that he's fully aware that even that is fake.<br/><br/>The reason why it tanked at the box-office is not that it's ""controversial"" but simply boring."

","I wish Aronofsky would stop twisting themes from the bible for his films. I get it. It's a rich well from which to draw. But, in my opinion, Aronofsky failed on Noah and he fails in Mother. This film is tedious and I kept watching the clock to see how many more minutes.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert... <br/><br/>If you are going to watch this film, I suggest you understand Javier Bardem plays God, Jennifer Lawrence plays Mother earth, Ed Harris plays Adam and Michelle Pfeiffer plays Eve. Also their sons Cain and Abel are involved. If you know the premise of the film, you can better understand AronofsTky's storyline.<br/><br/>As to borrowing from the bible, why re-create the real story? The real thing is insanely beautiful. For those of us who believe in a loving God as first person of the Holy Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the film Mother falls grossly short. God is depicted as a writer who loves humanity, with an insatiable need to create. But his character is written far too simply to lend itself to any depth. God is both Mercy and ... Justice. As to Mercy, the film's quicky interpretation of Jesus' sacrificial Passion is just ... I have no words.<br/><br/>As to Justice, God does not see the elements of nature as just ""things that can be replaced"". All of mother earth, its minerals, plants, animal life, are considered extremely valuable and mankind will have to account for its poor stewardship of these minor kingdoms.<br/><br/>I give it 5 points for the message of humanity destroying mother earth, while she simply offers herself up, time and again. We indeed need to change our ways on land and sea. I also give it points for depicting Mother earth as entirely dependent on humanity for how she fares. She really is entirely dependent on us. In the film, Mother rose to destroy ... we see it happening in stages right now. <br/><br/>Yes, yes, I understand some may read this and think, holy cow woman, stop expecting a film to fit into your ideology. The thing is, when you twist someone's faith into your own personal artistic impression, it's probably a good idea to have in-depth knowledge and treat with care. Imagine if someone inaccurately, and woefully inadequately, did a twisted artistic impression based on religious themes from Islam or Hinduism. Surely we must treat these things with the respect they deserve.<br/><br/>I wish Aronofsky would finally make the film Tiger based on the book by John Vaillant. Both he and Brad Pitt are attached to this project. I know Aronofsky would do a great job on this. Cover nature, but leave your artistic impressions of God."

We both were with the mindset that it was gonna be a generic horror movie, something better actually, like Babadook.<br/><br/>At the beginning there was not really a connection between me and the woman, but as the movie plays you will enter her mindset, it's crazy how you connect with her, and that's why it works so well as a psychological terror.<br/><br/>The director grabbed all the human phobias and values and used them as a way to ""torture"" the audience, it's a wild ride, nothing like i have ever experienced, and this is the first movie in years that i actually feel the need to write a review in here.<br/><br/>It's a weird movie where you can get your own conclusions (maybe that's the reason why a lot of reviews here are negative) and besides that, it's just living hell, it's like you payed to watch a movie for fun and come out with anxiety and paranoia, very few or no movies can do that to you.<br/><br/>Both my girlfriend and other people left the cinema, not because the movie was bad, but because it drains you, The first part is uncomfortable, the second part is ""happy"" but at the same time is scary because you know there's still a lot of time for something bad to happen, the third part... its living hell, it drains the spectator, you just want that confusion to stop but it actually gets worse progressively, just frenetic, when you think you already reached the end of the horror hallway the movie opens way for a new one way worse than the previous, the visuals get pretty disturbing, both in a visual and psychological way, i was like ""Now way that can happen, it would be to bad to put that in a movie.."" and later that actually happens. I got out of the cinema blown away. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR SENSITIVE PEOPLE !!! if you have anxiety or cant control your feelings don't watch this, it's too much.<br/><br/>Resuming: it's a weird vibe horror movie (if i can call it horror..) <br/><br/>It's amazing, people hated it because they saw political <br/><br/>statements from the director there.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Him. Mother. Man. Woman. When those are the identifiers of the four main characters (none have a real name), one might assume that the filmmaker is lazy. However, after watching the latest from the psycho-creative force known as Darren Aronofsky, we understand that names weren't necessary, and even if they had been, he was probably too mentally exhausted from finding ways to torture those characters and confound the viewers. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is discomforting and creepy while the second half is downright crazed and deranged. You won't find many story details in this review, as the fun is in the shock. Most of the film is through the eyes of Jennifer Lawrence, and we share her confusion and disoriented state. She is married to a famous poet played by Javier Bardem (yes, the age difference is acknowledged). While she spends her days refurbishing their stunning country home, he battles severe writer's block. Needless to say, their domestic bliss goes wrong  but it's not the kind of wrong we've ever seen before. <br/><br/>Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (both Oscar nominees) confine us in excruciatingly tight shots resulting in further disorientation and claustrophobia through most of the film. By the time we get a single wide shot of the home's exterior, we've just about given up hope. And once Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, we kick into full ROSEMARY'S BABY mode  only more frenetic and hyper.<br/><br/>It should be noted that it's not a traditional horror film – heck, it's hardly a traditional film at all. It's built on confusion, and metaphors abound. Aronofsky seems intent on causing endless post- viewing discussions and debate over what it ""means"". A case can be made for commentary on ego, fame, Mother Nature, deity/religion, and a sign of the times – the entitled ""takers"" of the world. The most obvious explanation is that the price paid for creativity is quite dear, and often causes a release from reality. There is a vicious cycle occurring here and our realization happens after the crescendo of insanity that is the film's peak.<br/><br/>WTF moments are too many to count, and Ms. Lawrence pulls off what has to be the roughest on screen pregnancy we've seen. It's a real treat to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in form after being out of the spotlight for four years. The score from Johan Johannsson is remarkable and there are ground-breaking visual effects (easy to miss during the audacious, frenzied second half action). Aronofsky is clearly provoking us, though it's abundantly unclear to what end. His previous twisted, mind- benders include REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and BLACK SWAN  both of which seem like mainstream family fare in comparison. This is a love it or hate it project, and most will likely fall into the latter. But for those who embrace the deranged and audacious, the love will be everlasting."
"aranvermont","Null","54","158","7 September 2017"," the best horror film in the last decade; a masterpiece!
","Just saw mother! at the Venice Film Festival and what an absolute pleasure it was to watch. What an absolute pleasure! I won't get too much into the plot as to avoid spoilers, and quite honestly the less you know about this film the better the viewing experience will be. This grandeur horror film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Kristen Wiig, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Domnhall Gleeson and Brian Gleeson. Star studded enough for you yet? The film (loosely) is about a young pregnant woman who lives with her poet husband in the countryside until unexpected guests start to invade her home. Sounds like your typical home invasion horror movie, right? Wrong. Darren Aronofsky has created something completely different here. Something absolutely amazing that provoked such a haunting reaction in me that I haven't felt since the first time I watched the star gate sequence in Stanley Kubrick's masterful '2001 A Space Odyssey.'And yes, I am comparing mother! to 2001 A Space Odyssey, because mother! is simply that masterful.<br/><br/>The film is steeped in allegories and mystical symbolism and satires a variety of themes. The film itself starts off relatively calm until the visitors arrive and invade their home (I must be brief as it is vital not to spoil this film.) However, in its second and third act, the film derails into some of the most terrifying, disturbing and absolutely haunting piece of art ever put on film. It is most definitely the most controversial film since A Clockwork Orange, or perhaps Gaspar Noe's shocking rape revenge film 'Irreversible.' I have watched films all my life and never have I seen something in the last decade this truly scary.<br/><br/>It is the type of horror that goes right through your skin, and your bones, and psychologically affects you. Combine that with beautiful art, breathtaking performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Michelle Pfeiffer in particular, and absolutely lunacy, you get this brilliant avante-garde piece of filmmaking, known as 'mother!.' mother! is truly the best horror film of the last decade without a doubt, whilst also being the craziest. mother! is sure to be a divisive movie, some may label it pretentious and some may label it as weird and disturbing for the sake of being weird and disturbing without having any contextual justification towards its haunting scenes of violence and gore. However, they could not be so far from the truth.<br/><br/>mother!, simply put, is a masterpiece, and I honestly cannot think of a film in the last decade that has scared me and disturbed me as much as mother!. It is a must see movie."
"cameronsfx","1","39","110","11 September 2017"," More crap from Aronofsky
","Jennifer Lawrence hasn't acted well in most anything other than Hunger Games, and, let's face, the last two sucked. Joy was about as Joyless as one can get. Passengers was pretty boring. Anyway, this flick is another critic darling from the plagiaristic mind of Darren Aronofsky. Black Swan stole a lot from Requiem of a Dream. Lawrence is too young to play Javier Bardem's wife. She is. He's 48 and she's like 25. And, let's remember, Jennifer only got the job because she's Aronofsky's girlfriend. <br/><br/>Natalie Portmann did a great job in Black Swan, but Jennifer is her usual overacting self in this poorly-made sludge of CGI-infested garbage. The CGI looks fake. Even Aronofsky said Lawrence was pretty bland in rehearsals. See Wikipedia if you don't believe me.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer, given little to do, steals the show as the house guest showing you exactly what a movie star looks like. The movie really needed a gifted actress like Portmann to pull it off. Jennifer just doesn't have the acting chops to make it all real during the movie. She looks confused, out of her element and, at times, disinterested. Even Roger Ebert said this wasn't Lawrence's finest hour.<br/><br/>And, God, is this film BORING! Aronofsky's constant close-ups of Lawrence, showing off his girlfriend maybe?, does the viewer no favors since Lawrence is best being Jennifer not delving deep into a role like Michelle Pfeiffer or Natalie Portman. Let's face it, Lawrence stole her Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook. She was basically herself with Bipolar things in her life. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, nailed it.<br/><br/>If you are expecting great things like Black Swan, you won't get them with this flick. You'll just waste 2 hours watching Lawrence try and act while Bardem goes nuts."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","10","22","6 October 2017"," Welcome to the Crystal Maze
","Darren Aronosfsky's mother! is like no other film you'll see this year: guaranteed. As a film lover, an Aronosfsky film is a bit like root canal at the dentist: you know you really need to go ahead and do it, but you know you're not going to be very comfortable in the process. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence (""Passengers"", ""Joy"") plays ""mother!"" doing up a dilapidated old house in the middle of nowhere with her much older husband ""Him"" (Javier Bardem, ""Skyfall""). he (sorry. He) is a world- famous poet struggling to overcome a massive writing block. The situation is making things tense between the couple, and things get worse when He inexplicably invites a homeless couple ""man"" (Ed Harris, ""Westworld"", ""The Truman Show"") and ""woman"" (Michelle Pfeiffer, ""Stardust"") to stay at the house. As things go progressively downhill, is mother losing her mind or is all the crazy stuff going on actually happening?<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence can do no wrong at the moment, and her complexion in the film is flawless: it needs to be, since she has the camera constantly about 3 inches from her face for large chunks of the movie: I sat in the very back row, and I still wasn't far enough away! Her portrayal of a house-proud woman getting progressively more and more irritated by her guests' inconsiderate acts – a glass? without a table mat??! – is a joy to watch. As her DIY 'paradise' is progressively sullied my 'man' and 'woman', so her distress grows exponentially. <br/><br/>Some of the supporting acting is also superb, with Ed Harris and particularly Michelle Pfeiffer enjoying themselves immensely. Also worthy of note are the brothers played by real-life brothers Brian Gleeson and Domhnall Gleeson: the latter must never sleep since he must be *constantly* on set at the moment. One of these guys in particular is very abel! (sic). <br/><br/>Whereas the trailer depicts this as a kind of normal haunted house spookfest, it is actually nothing of the sort: much of the action (although far-fetched) has a reasonably rational explanation (a continuation of my theme of the ""physics of horror"" from my last two reviews). The film is largely seen through mother!'s eyes, and the skillful cinematographer Matthew Libatique – an Aronosfsky-regular – oppressively and relentlessly delivers a uniquely tense cinematic experience. For me, for the first two thirds of the film at least, it succeeds brilliantly.<br/><br/>Aronosfsky is no shirker of film controversy: having Natalie Portman perform oral sex on Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan"" was enough to teach you that. But in the final reels of this film, Aronosfsky doesn't just wind the dial past 10 to the Spinal Tap 11. he keeps going right on up to 20. There are a few scenes in movies over the years that I wish I could go back and ""unsee"", and this film has one of those: a truly upsetting slice of horror, playing to your worst nightmares of loss and despair. While the religious allegory in these scenes is splatted on as heavily as the splodges of mother!'s decorative plaster, they are nonetheless extremely disturbing and bound to massively divide the cinema audience. I think it's fair to say that this DVD is not going to have ""The Perfect Gift for Mother's Day"" as its marketing strapline.<br/><br/>Which all leaves me where exactly? For the first time in a long time I actually have no idea! This is a film that I was willing to give 4*'s or less to while I was watching it, but as time has passed and I have thought more on the environmental and religious allegories, and the portrayal of the cult worship prevalent in popular X-factor celebrity, I am warming to it despite my best instincts not to. I'm not religious, but I would love to compare notes on this one with someone with strongly Christian views.<br/><br/>So, I've provided a rating above, but I reserve the right to revisit that again at Christmas to see if I can resolve it in my mind as either a movie masterpiece or over-indulgent codswallop. <br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man for the graphical version of this review. Thanks)."

When I say I was intrigued by the divisiveness, I mean... it's always interesting when you're presented with a movie that has almost as many 1-star reviews as it has 10-star reviews. My prediction, based on the (deliberately) few reviews I skimmed, was that there were two camps: the people who thought this was BRILLIANT, TOP-SHELF ART AT IT'S FINEST... & the people who thought it was NAUSEATINGLY, NARCISSISTICALLY OBTUSE.<br/><br/>I went in expecting to be in the first camp, only to find myself FIRMLY grounded in the second upon finishing the movie.

There are some disturbing images; that has been true with each of Aronofsky's films that I've seen. The movie is unsettling in its tone & doesn't rely on jump-scares to get there. But ""horrifying"" is grossly overselling this piece, & I mean that sincerely. Maybe the most controversial thing about this movie is the fact that it can present the sort of disturbing imagery it presents (no spoilers) & still somehow manage to make it so unbearably stupid that you end up LAUGHING. <br/><br/>I love a film whose central thesis sticks with you; I love a film that makes its way back to you, days or weeks or months later, & asks you difficult questions or stirs up difficult emotions or just generally reaches into you & makes a vital change. <br/><br/>Meanwhile: Mother! didn't make me physically ill - although I think it came close! My two cents: you inevitably have better ways to spend two hours. I know you do."

This film writer should have tried to present something that would make viewers want to watch more of his films, but by delivering such a piece of shÂ… he only put them off.

Some people say it's brilliant, with all the allegory references but all that mother nature and God, Adam and Eve, etc, makes me wonder what am I suppose to learn from this? What was the purpose of this film on which they spent a lot of money to make? A waste of money, actors and visual effects. 
After an hour and a half of watching this filth I thought that the only character we're supposed to care about didn't moved me at all and I don't like the actress too much either so here goes another big minus on this. 
I'm still a big fan of Aronovsky but my brain hurts after watching something so excruciatingly vile. I watch foreign movies, I am in love with this art but I feel bad and ashamed to call this a movie/film. 
Please, don't try say it was good because, aside from the allegory some are so aroused about, I will ask you what should I take from it, learn even, and you will remain silent. I want my old Darren back, the one with vision, aesthetic and morals, the guy who made me dream of making my own movies someday. I miss you mister Aronovsky, I miss your captivating mind and all the hard work you put in some of my favourite movies like The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Pi.

","There's the good Darren Aronofsky, and there's the bad Darren Aronofsky. I should have checked first. It's easy to do. A minute or two on IMDB would have told me what I needed to know. A careful examination of the DVD box would have been a tip-off. I committed two hours of my time based on 5 seconds of observation and paid for it. I thought with Javier Bardem and Ed Harris in the movie it would be OK.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has made some fine movies, and he'll probably make others. You can add Mother to his list of stinkers.<br/><br/>I can hardly bring myself to comment further, other than to say that if you like to drown in self-pity and celebrate all things lost, desperate and hopeless, Mother is probably for you. Maybe the movie is meant to be a black deadpan comedy. The same joke over and over again gets tired, though.<br/><br/>If you look at Mother as a standard horror movie it's long, morose, and not scary. It's just violent and gross.<br/><br/>It's sad to see top professionals taking themselves seriously in a miserable, ridiculous movie. I'll take a bad low-budget horror movie where there's some fun anytime.<br/><br/>P.S. After watching the movie and eating a late dinner, I wrote this and went to bed. I had the sickest dream.

Its plethora of symbols, vivid imagery and powerful references taclking some of the most fundamental uncertainties of the modern man truly gives one an ambudance of goosebumps.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this movie is not for everyone. You are either going to love it for its remarkable artistic value or despise it for its confusion, lack of cohesion and traditional movie narrative. <br/><br/>I do believe that this movie breakes the boundaries between artistic genres and reshapes the picture of what we have in our head when someone says ""a movie"". Much like with paintings and good books, you won't always have the clear pointers toward what the author meant, and most of the time it is up to you to make your own conclusion. That is what this movie is all about and for that reason I have to congratulate Mr. Aronofsky for pushing the limits and defying tradition in the world of cinematography.<br/><br/>To conclude with, even if this type of movie is not your cup of tea, you are surely going to enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's extraordinary acting skills, the only thing both sides of audience are (probably) going to agree on."

","In a large, old, unfinished house in a secluded area somewhere in the U.S., a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) has her life and sanity unraveled as her poet husband (Javier Bardem) allows several inconsiderate people into their home because of his insatiable need for attention. Chaos ensues including that of the supernatural.<br/><br/>When I had previously told a fellow cinephile of my intention to see ""Mother!"", he said he thought the movie was ""batshit crazy"". At the time, I thought this comment was a warning. In the end, it turned out to be an understatement.<br/><br/>How do I hate this movie? Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>1) It is so bad that even Jennifer Lawrence cannot save it.<br/><br/>2) Ditto for Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>3) When it became clear that the movie's end would be soon, I felt an elation like I have for films I truly loved. In those other films' cases, the conclusion was a grand culmination of the greatness that preceded them. In the case of ""Mother!"", the joy was felt knowing that the mental/spiritual torture would soon end and the two-hour term of purgatory would finally be complete.<br/><br/>4) Catholic priests ought to consider recommending this film when they must issue penance at the end of confessions. But in fairness, this should be only for the most terrible of sinners.<br/><br/>The ""story"" is reminiscent of the most repugnant of terrible sitcom episodes which take sadistic joy in tormenting a main character. This film is four times the length of such episodes; thus the sadism is extended to the viewers. While the viewer would most sympathize with the Lawrence character, there were times I wanted to see someone give her a Cher/Moonstruck/""Snap out of it""/double-slap followed by ""leave your idiotic, pathological, egomaniac husband NOW!!!!"" (As an aside, there are also equally horrible cartoon comedy sketches that also follow the mean-spirited sadism mentioned above. As they take place in a much shorter period of time, their vile repugnance is more concentrated.)<br/><br/>Director/writer Darren Aranofsky has done fine work in the past (""The Wrestler"" (2008) , ""Black Swan"" (2010)) as a director and superb work (""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000)) as a writer/director. Those other films also took very unconventional directions but there always seemed to be compassion for the main characters rather than a twisted sadism as in the case of ""Mother!"".<br/><br/>There is no shortage of pretentious social climbers who would likely declare that one should keep an 'open mind' when approaching films like this as well as other forms of 'artistic expression'. To that, I would respond with a memorable quote I saw on a billboard many years ago: ""A great many open minds should be closed for repairs.""<br/><br/>The best summary of the film would be expressed by yet another quote - this one from the late, great Dorothy Parker: ""What fresh hell is this?""<br/><br/>Appalling. Truly appalling."

The state of bafflement you're in for the first half of the film or so is a major aspect of what makes this unique and enjoyable.<br/><br/>This is not for the ""general audience"" crowd. This is for the midnight freaks who want weirdness and psychedelia, and want it served up extra edgy and disturbing. This is for metalheads, the hyper-intelligent stoners; this is for Gaspar Noe. If you fail to understand what's happening on screen, you will hate it. You may still end up hating it because you may find Aronofsky's vision profoundly disagreeable, offensive, or even blasphemous. In which case you probably don't fit into the ""midnight freaks"" category anyway, and hence have already been warned. <br/><br/>This film ultimately works because it avoids certain mistakes that weird films - especially allegories - often make. It's not preachy, it's not inconsistent with its own logic, and it has good pacing and a satisfying conclusion (as much as I love you, I'm looking your way for that last one, Holy Mountain). To say that the acting is first-rate is a gross understatement. And for how baffling it appears to be at first, it requires a laughably small amount of shared cultural knowledge (of the broadest kind!) to ""get"".<br/><br/>So when I read all these fools complaining about not having understood what's going on and hating it because of that, I just have to shake my head because it's more of a reflection on the capacity of today's average moviegoing audience than it is on the film.

","My wife and I watched this film last night and enjoyed the first half. The second half then descended into unexplained and utter chaos and madness. I would never subscribe to the theory of an underlying religious meaning unless Darren Aronofsky told me so personally. l do believe the film's underlying message is about a deteriorating relationship between a egomaniacle husband and his wife, whom he treats badly while always putting his wants and desires first and that this failing relationship is spiraling out of the control of either one.<br/><br/>Having said that, all the aforementioned chaos and madness is hard to explain and does little to substantiate the relationship theory. Our only rationalization is that Jennifer Lawrence's character was slowly losing her mind and we were seeing things from her tortured perspective. I found this to be a very unsettling film that really amped up my annoyance factor and produced many moments of utter incredulity."

","Yes, you've read all the positive reviews about how thought- provoking this is, and about how it dares you to ask questions instead of providing you with easy answers. But the reality is that this is a very pretentious movie. It's exasperating to watch - not because it doesn't provide answers, but because none of the characters behave in a believable way. At all. Sure you can say they're not meant to. It's all part of the plan, right? That's garbage! From the outset, the characters don't act like real people. It feels like a set-up right from the start, and when the ridiculous third act happens, you're just like ""man this is such BS"". <br/><br/>Sorry, but this is a completely inane movie. Yeah you can pretend you're getting all the deeper meanings, but it's just a confused orgy of nonsensical imagery masquerading as 'deep' cinema. Only worth watching if you're in the mood for some avant-garde baloney pretending to be a movie."

","Well. That was a bad movie.<br/><br/>So I'm a big fan of Mr. Aronowskis work. And I love the genres of mystery, drama and surrealism. Alone and in combination. In this case however, it doesn't work. Maybe Mr. Aronowski has been abducted by aliens and replaced by a clone? This is so far off his other work.<br/><br/>Even though the story is meant allegorically and is presented in a somewhat surrealist way, it's set up in an inept way. It doesn't know what it wants. Whether to be realistic or confusing or surreal. It breaks suspension of disbelief. Many of the lines don't work, don't fit. The dialogue seems out of place, like everyone is just monologuing.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is a huge disappointing. The is no chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence. He is unsympathetic and feels misplaced in the movie. The relationship between them never feels real at any time. His attitude is just not something you want to see for two hours. Maybe as a supporting cast he would have been OK. And wow is that guy ugly. Jennifer Lawrence, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer do a good job of acting, but constantly seem at odds with the movie and the dialogue written for them.<br/><br/>The production value, sound, set etc is OK, but everything looks bland. The coloring of the movie is somewhat boring and does not resonate with the story.<br/><br/>The resolution and ending makes sense in some way, but feels odd. I think if you for some strange reason find the movie appealing, you will probably feel that the end is satisfying, but Bardem really tries hard to make it as unpleasant as possible."

","Mother! Is a film that is perpetually confusing, crazy and nonsensical. This is a film that I think no doubt will make you think and wonder what you were just watching and maybe get to you. I will say the first half of this film before all the lunacy begins is not too bad, it looked as there was a disturbing thriller sheeting out as we see the characters in this house evolve and your looking to see what will happen to these as they have let these strangers into their house not knowing who they are and if their safety is in jeopardy. Instead though as the film moves on from these few characters it then turns into a whole bunch of people coming into their house like an infested pile of rodents coming all over the place that cause all kinds of havoc to theist house and life. This becomes so thrown all together that not only does it not make any sense it turns into a fiasco that doesn't care how out of place it is. I get that this is a film with many metaphors attached to it like the two main stars representing God and. Mother Nature and Adam and Eve as the first people to come in and then there are all these other people populating and taking control and damaging the environment. There's metaphors all over the place here whether it's religion, biblical references, the destruction man causes, how fame or popularity takes over our lives and sense of privacy, the nightmarish idea of having people all over your house destroying everything in there.How do these ideas mix with this film I guess the viewer needs to figure that out cause the way it was representing itself definitely made it very difficult to put these concepts together cause of how crazy the plot turns into, I really couldn't see at all the metaphors for any of this at all by the end. This movie felt more like it would have done better as being a short cause it would have been able to throw all it's concepts together in a quick time frame but for a feature length film it definitely doesn't work to it's own advantage."

I think this film starts with that position and further suggests that the artist uses the love of his spouse or lovers as creative nourishment, even as he lives for the love of his audience. <br/><br/>One thing it brought to mind is that the spouses of artists who stay with them a long time tend to be pretty tough cookies.<br/><br/>Anyway, I found it tough sledding, even as an absurdist allegory.

Yeah, call me simple minded or whatever. I don't need to be like all these pretentious schmucks saying how beautiful the interpretation of yadda yadda is in the movie..

I was in too deep to abandon the movie by then. And now i feel i wasted 2 hrs of good sleep.
By the way, I'm not a Christian so all these so called interpretations of how God is (being a narcissist), Adam & Eve, yadda yadda of course wouldn't reach to non Christians cause that's not how we interpret God. Only Christians (& white people), would depict God with having human qualities..

"alexnicolaeva","9","14","38","15 September 2017"," A genius movie that no one gets!
","It's a very difficult movie to explain, but I will try to deliver my theory for people to understand it from such perspective; those who saw ""Mother!"" should understand where the evidence is coming from. I'm not a religious person at all, so I'm not seeing connections with religion in every movie. However ""mother!"" was mostly about it. <br/><br/>At the beginning I thought that it would be a detective story or typical Darren Aranofsky's film about how someone is getting crazy. At that moment I thought that Javier Bardem was playing a silly guy, who was so innocent to understand that you should never invite people who you don't know to your home!! But I was wrong. <br/><br/>The whole movie is Allegory! And that's what you should keep in mind while watching it.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was representing ""Virgin Mary""(that's why the film is called ""Mother!"") and also the ""Home"", ""Earth""... Simply ""Hera""- goddess in Greek mythology. That's why she had such a strong connection with the house! Trying to protect it from all of those guests trying to destroy it. She was getting crazy and feeling sick, when the house was being destroyed and hence she saw the blood in the house only in those moments etc.<br/><br/>""Him"" played by Javier Bardem was representing a ""God"". That's why he was so generous and kind to people, sharing his home, food and whatever they want. His House was representing the whole world(earth) of the God where he invited all of those guests.<br/><br/>Guests that were coming were people who used the kindness of god, but couldn't resist sins and instead of living in peace and respecting God and Her, they started to slowly destroy the ""World"" that she was making... The man who was dying, but still abusing alcohol. His wife was tempting ""Her"", adding Lust and Pride in the world. Their Sons who were pure representation of Envy and Wrath. And finally guests on the funeral, who didn't have any respect for ""Her"" and the ""home"" that she made.. <br/><br/>Very important moment was when she got pregnant, she never had sex with Him - like Virgin Mary and God; and immediately after it got pregnant.<br/><br/>After God wrote the poem he gave people happiness. And for those who came to the house Freedom, Hope, Blessings etc. However instead of using it in a good way, people started stealing things, destroying house, fighting and killing each other; delivering sins like ""Gluttony"", ""Greed"", even more ""Envy"" and ""Wrath"". There were even sects formed! With his photos in one place forming an altar, where Her child was sacrificed in a similar way that Jesus Christ was killed! <br/><br/>After she gave birth, there is a moment when she is getting tired, but he waits still without need for any sleep! Because he is a god, he doesn't need it and he doesn't burn in the moment when the house(world) is destroyed. He takes the only thing that survives -""Love"" and makes a new world with a new ""Muse"" and same beginning! <br/><br/>There is no devil in the movie as devil lives in people - us. Humans like us were those who destroyed the world in the movie. And humans like us are slowly destroying our planet now and that is what was happening for thousands of years! <br/><br/>It's a genius movie full of allegory and metaphors that not everyone could spot, but it is definitely a masterpiece!"

-American treasure, the well-groomed Jay Bauman<br/><br/>I despise this movie, and it's not because it's vehemently anti-Catholic and misanthropic.<br/><br/>No, I hate this movie because it's terrible.<br/><br/>Finishing the movie, I perused the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, reading positive and negative alike. The common themes from the positive were: ""bold"", ""thought provoking"", and ""engrossing"". The common themes from the negative were: ""poor plot"", ""ugly"", and ""misogynistic"".<br/><br/>I think the positive reviews are hilariously wrong, and the negative reviews are a bit misguided.<br/><br/>In storytelling there is always a battle between the subtext and the text itself, that is, between the ""meaning"", ""point"", or theme against the story itself. The fun of a movie with rich subtext is digging through the text to uncover meaning. mother! is nothing but subtext. There is no text on top. It's just a series of images and symbols to interpret. Even the characters are mere symbols (God, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, etc.). That's probably the primary reason the movie received an F Cinemascore. There's no story for normal audiences to latch onto. Instead, they get a steady stream of metaphors and a final thirty minutes of blood and guts untied to anything an audience will care about.<br/><br/>Watching this at the tail end of my Bergman quest (at this writing, having seen 37 of the 39 on the Criterion set) is interesting. Bergman's movies are often full of symbols and imagery, but they are tied to characters that feel exceedingly real in stories that make literal sense.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, instead, decided to make a movie where nothing made any literal sense. And the movie just seems to create holes all over the place. Abel dies, and a couple of hours later there's a wake in the house. Mother gets pregnant, and it feels like she reaches full term in an afternoon (""It moved!"" she cries in the ninth month as though she's missed the past four to five months of pregnancy). God finishes the New Testament right then. Mother reads it, but publisher has already read it?<br/><br/>I often say that it's the audience's responsibility to have a second side of a conversation with filmmakers. To figure out what the filmmakers are trying to do and say and engage with them on the filmmaker's chosen level, not the audience's preferred level.<br/><br/>So, okay. Aronofsky doesn't want to tell a literal story. He wants to make some kind of metaphorical and experimental film. Does it work?<br/><br/>Nope. Not in the least. So, we don't have characters. We just have a series of symbols that walk and talk. Is it difficult to discern what they mean? No. It's incredibly simple. It's obvious from the moment they walk onto the screen. Does the audience need to try at all to figure out what Aronofsky is saying? No, it's there on screen without any effort. Hey! It's Adam and Eve! Hey! It's Cain and Abel! Hey! It's the flood! Hey! It's the Bible! Hey! It's religion! Hey! It's humanity polluting the planet!<br/><br/>I've never been the biggest fan of Aronofsky. I once called him a crazy person who can barely shoot a scene. However, he does have a certain verve and daring which is nice. People seem to confuse daring with talent, though. Just because a movie is daring doesn't mean that it succeeds. I don't even think performances are any good.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence spends half the movie as a passive naif and the other half screaming. Javier Bardem is so disassociated from the action at hand that he never actually builds a character (not like Aronofsky wrote him a character to begin with). None of the other characters are around enough to actually form a feeling at all. The closest is Ed Harris as Adam...I mean Man, but he's one-note.<br/><br/>The movie's also really dark. Not tonally (well, I guess it is), but visually. It gets really hard to see what's actually happening on screen.<br/><br/>I found literally nothing to recommend about the film. There's no story because the movie's all metaphor. The metaphor is thin, obvious, and uninteresting. The final act is unmoored from any emotion so the shock is threadbare. It's poorly acted. It's ugly to look at. It's aggressive in its simplistic nature."

It starts out feeling like a horror drama, or the makings of one, but then goes off in a very strange, unexpected and highly original direction. There is a palpable tension throughout, and an unnerving, strange dream-like quality, with a real sense of dread. Later on, towards the end, the movie completely flies off into something like an insane surreal nightmare, an assault on the senses,and is very shocking. The ending is incredible. The movie says a lot about the human experience and especially relationships, love and selfishness; this is the emotional core seen through the eyes of the lead actress. The acting is great, especially the lead actress who is absolutely superb, as is the set. The filming style, and sound work, are at times intentionally disorientating, adding to the surreal sense. It's an absolutely gripping experience and very psychedelic. Despite much intense darkness and carnage, there is also goodness, beauty and truth, so in a strange way, in parts it's a wholesome experience. Bear in mind this movie is working more on a subconscious level and a lot of it does not make logical sense. You may well hate it. Incredible."

","The Mother! is not working as a drama, is not working as a thriller, and is not working as a mystery. Someone who finds illumination or some ""spiritual"" enlightenment or such feelings watching Mother! has imo a good and vivid imagination, which of course is no bad thing.<br/><br/>Mother! is imo the first fail of Aronofsky, because of the strong acting it is still watchable, but compared to his masterpieces like Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, The Wrestler, Black Swan, this is a rather weak movie. More interesting than most contemporary Hollywood stuff of course, yes, no doubt here, but Aronofsky did not fail as a director but as a writer. Still the single scenes without all the esoteric tam tam are strong, emotional and captivating, but putting the movie as one piece together the movie fails (imo of course) because of the story.
I don't know what other people read but this story is a very simple story overloaded with some pseudo-esoteric varnishing.<br/><br/>Well in times of Wicca, Mother Earth fetishists and other back to nature adepts, Mother! is a movie of zeitgeist.

","Aronofsky once again proves his insistence on lumbering through exhausting mixed metaphor with the poetic subtlety of a 6-year-old with a sledgehammer as he attempts to 'say something' while saying absolutely nothing at all. And why he felt the need to publicly explain the not-subtle-at-all 'meaning' proves that he is clearly more interested in the commercial success of this 'serious art film' than his own artistic integrity. This is not 'art' film, and in fact is barely a coherent film at all. The performances are flat and inhuman. The cinematography is mostly very drab and lazy with a few interesting shots. The audio production is good, but certainly not good enough to carry this stupid film on its own. Ultimately, I think the fatal flaw is Aronofsky's desire to pick up a weighty philosophical lens and use it to examine absolutely nothing about humans and instead gives a them a treatment of tiresome contempt, which really only works as comedy. Unfortunately, the guy has to blabber on about how serious the film and its message are, so I even find it difficult to give him credit for that.<br/><br/>Spoiler Warning (if there can be spoilers for a film with such predictable non-plot)
If you have any knowledge of Christianity, the film's central conceit will be apparent within 5-10 minutes, and then you will watch as it is tediously played out toward an unsatisfying, nonsense conclusion. God is an artistic sociopath whose creations will destroy his most beloved creation, the world, over and over (I guess?). God as an insufferable toxic 'artist' with his muse 'mother earth' is a tired idea which frankly misses the point of religion entirely. The film dips its toes in deep moral and philosophical waters, but then seems content with standing there with wet feet staring back at the shore. Maybe it was just a problem of marketing, but I can't help but feel that the mis-marketing is due to the insistence of Aronosfky's own artistic ego."

","A decorator (Jennifer Lawrence) and poet (Javier Bardem) live in a secluded home, far from the madding crowd. The problems begin when a man obsessed with Bardem's work (Ed Harris) arrives and is allowed to stay against Lawrence's wishes. The problems worsen for poor Jennifer Lawrence with the arrival of Ed Harris' wife and children. By the time an unconventional wake and an orgy of fan adulation come around, the madding crowd has created a full-on nightmare.<br/><br/>There is much debate over what Mother! is as a film, whether it's any good, or whether it's unfair to split such an artistic expression into a binary good/bad decision. The problem with A.O Scott's definition of Mother! as a divine comedy is that the film is only funny at a couple of unintentionally amusing points. Clues that it might be an art film in that it gets quite boring at points and often doesn't make much sense. To give my two cents, Mother! is an experimental horror that just doesn't really work.<br/><br/>A major problem with the film is that it fails to fully capture the creeping dread necessary to captivate the audience. Perhaps the most intense and uncomfortable set-piece is an impromptu house party, and as a weary host of such endeavours I could relate to Jennifer Lawrence's increasing exasperation with the strangers invading her home. The same thing is recreated later in the film, with ten times the intensity to half the effect.<br/><br/>A large part of the growing anti-climax is the absence of a score, one of the most crucial elements of horror and an artistic decision that smacks of writer-director Darren Aronofsky feeling he is above the genre. Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique have shot largely in Super 16mm, making the whole thing feel like a grainy flashback. While the intention is a closely personal feel, this decision is also strained as the film events become increasingly removed from reality.<br/><br/>A misguided pretension is even more marked in the final act, as the chaos veers from the vaguely plausible to the completely insane to the utterly incomprehensible. Ultimately Aronofsky follows a tried and true route of the laziest horror hack by substituting increasing amounts of gore and panic for character depth and pathos.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's prior work has contained engaging character study, and psychological horror Black Swan was so much more effective because of a complex central role. The characters in Mother! are not named, a sign of Aronofsky's interest in wider themes over plot and structure. This can feel like a lost opportunity, as the film initially does a good job of convincingly keeping Lawrence inside the house as it turns from a sanctuary into a prison.<br/><br/>The grandiose cinematic metaphor at the heart of Mother! is open to interpretation, whether it represents the chauvinism at the core of mob mentality or man's selfishness leading to the very destruction of the earth beneath our feet. Lofty aims, but the cart is put before the horse; without the scares and overall tone befitting the genre, it's hard for an audience to engage with these higher ideals.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence always brings a radiance to her screen performances, yet there are only so many ways a character can express indignant shock. Perhaps the best performance of the film is Michelle Pfieffer as a narcissistic and belittling houseguest, the portent of things to come.<br/><br/>christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible"
"jadepietro","4","4","8","16 September 2017"," Mother Load
","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5) <br/><br/>GRADE: C- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A familiar horror genre formula that is given a high class treatment, even if the bizarre script makes no logical sense whatever. <br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: A psychological thriller in which a couple deals with strange goings-on.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's mother! is a film that comes with no capital letter, an exclamation point to inform moviegoers that there will be much emotional tension, and a whole lot of surreal Biblical images with which to contend. Too derivative of Rosemary's Baby to be called original. the film does follow that formula of a damsel-in-distress horror movie with dark psychological tones. It does showcase some fine acting, strong production values, and intense visuals, but it is real miss, as movies go...and a mess too.<br/><br/>While the film has been called thought-provoking and disturbing by some critics, the only thought it provoked from me was, ""How can this film make any sense to anyone unless it's a really a dream / nightmare? The characters' behaviors are so bizarre, the time frame confusing, violent actions have no repercussions, and the outrageous plot leaps, no,...vaults over, any logical sense of reality."" No, I won't divulge the actual answer to that question, if you indeed make it to the end of this overwrought exercise in filmmaking, but instead I will add another thought, ""Did anyone involved in this movie stop and say to the director that his screenplay is laughable rather than scary and so over-the-top it strains credibility? Couldn't anyone say no to this dumb script?""<br/><br/>An opening scene provides a short prologue that makes one wonder about the film's meandering plot almost immediately. We meet our soon-to-be victim and soon-to-be mother (Jennifer Lawrence), hence the title. Nothing seems right from the outset. Everyone around her is automatically suspicious or seems to have ulterior motives, including her poet husband, unnamed in the script. He is played with (possible) customary menace by Javier Bardem. The duo seem the oddest of couples right from the start: she, being his supportive obedient muse, and he, the tortured artist type. They buy a secluded country home far away from neighbors (always the first mistake in this genre), although it seems that everyone materializes out of nowhere and is stopping by this depot on a regular basis: First a stranger/ literary fan (Ed Harris) visits and is conveniently invited to stay the night, followed by his shrewish wife (a scene stealing Michelle Pfeiffer). Next comes their two gonzo sons (substitute Cain and Abel, played by Domhnall and Brian Gleeson), and then an array of hundreds of others drop-in. (I'm not exaggerating, trust me.)<br/><br/>￼mother! is a psychological horror genre film seen as ART, all in capitals. The film mixes nightmarish suspense, due to the director's strong vision. Even if the story is very lightweight and a tad pretentious, the overall result is still visually effective. (You know that you are suppose to be experiencing ""high art"" when the characters are named Him, Her, Man Woman.) But the film cannot camouflage its base origins as a typical horror film all gussied up to create those bumps in the night (which never materialize) and wallow in its shock appeal. <br/><br/>mother! slowly builds on its psychological tension to its bizarre and surreal Grand Guignol conclusion. The first act of the film focuses on the main character's possible motives and odd behavior while the second act becomes a frenzied rush of violence and gore to appease the horror crowd. Moviegoers, overly familiar with these scare tactics, will have a been-there-done- that vibe. It's a real mishmash, but an artful journey into madness. Mr. Aronofsky sets up his action and intensifies his subject with overt religious symbolism and gruesome images that may shock and offend his audience. His hellish hallucinations, of which there are many, resonate, even if his own screenplay lacks imagination and cohesion.<br/><br/>The cast play out their roles with much energy and passion. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent and plays her every-woman with much verve. Mr. Bardem gives his one-dimensional role some needed depth. Mr. Harris and especially Ms. Pfeiffer round out the ensemble with solid turns.<br/><br/>Yet the film's underlying theme, that fame and obsession can corrupt one's soul, takes a backseat to the non-existent scares and chills. As written in Mr. Aronofsky's jumbled script, Mr. Bardem's poet character remains an enigma throughout and his actions may show a vain and unloving husband or a confused helpless artist allowing his ambition to run amok. Ms. Lawrence's title character is part doormat / part romantic. We know opposite can attract but we never feel that there is any connection with the couple. Their give-and-take moments lead to a completely laughable (rather than horrifying) and unsatisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>mother! is far from great cinema. Yes, it is a skillfully well-crafted horror film, even if the script is all over the place. It remains a major disappointment from a talented director. The film's title may end in that dubious exclamation point, but perhaps a question mark might be a more fitting punctuation.<br/><br/>￼NOTE: The poster truly captures the grotesqueness of the film and its in-your-face shock value very well. The false sense of beauty and innocence is set off balance with the bloody surreal image of that bleeding heart and the blood-soaked virginal white dress. Superb use of contrast and style. Actually, the poster is better the film. Watch that instead!"

","Directed by Darren Aronofsky, ""Mother!"" is another one of the Aronofsky's attempts at psychological thrillers, the previous being ""Black Swan"" (2010), which was widely praised as a masterpiece. However, ""Mother!"" is a huge let down.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a nameless couple, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, who live in the woods in a cliché setting straight out of every scary movie ever. As Lawrence's character gradually begins to hint at being pregnant, strangers start to show up at the couple's door asking for an overnight shelter.<br/><br/>When the strangers eventually succeed in entering the home, they seem to have different intentions. With a selfish and somewhat famous poet for a husband, Lawrence's character seems to be the only one that can combat the home invasion.<br/><br/>None of the main characters in the movie receive names, which makes it seem like Aronofsky is using symbolism to tell another story underneath the main storyline. This is where the movie gets confusing and loses its main focus.<br/><br/>Too many long shots at arbitrary actions by characters and different noises in the background are extremely irritating to the audience. If Aronofsky is trying to build tension, he has succeeded. However, he also misguided the audience into paying attention to countless insignificant details.<br/><br/>There are random cuts of the sound of a beating heart throughout the movie, which is later revealed as a crucial element in the development of the plot. Aronofsky's attempts to foreshadow the plot, however, conflict with the main storyline and thus backfires.<br/><br/>While the movie seems to have good intentions by seemingly supporting 21st century feminism, it doesn't succeed at it. The film at first portrays the mother figure as a strong, independent woman who is trying to multitask for her family, since her husband seems to be preoccupied with his career and fame.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, the mother becomes powerless, helpless and despaired. The mother eventually turns into a selfish and monster-like character that refuses to do anything for anyone but her child.<br/><br/>For those who are familiar with classical psychological thrillers, ""Mother!"" is comparable to ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), which has a similar narrative of a mother protecting her child. However, the narrative of ""Mother!"" seems to fall flat of presenting the audience with a thrilling storyline within the first hour. The repetition of shots bored me and I felt like I was checking my watch every couple minutes to see how much longer it was going to last.<br/><br/>Until the final act of the movie, nothing extraordinary happens. One could potentially watch only the final 30 minutes of the movie to understand the plot, actually be scared and feel any kind of connection with the mother character."

The only scary thing in this movie (since it is supposed to be a horror) is the fact that I watched it!<br/><br/>This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever had misfortune to spend 2 hours of my life on and even had to pay for it!!! And I've watched some really bad movies! This is the first time in my life that I've witnessed entire movie theater stood up after the movie finished, with blank look in their eyes, wondering what the hell did we just watch. Even asking other people if they understand what the hell this movie is about!!!<br/><br/>Completely pointless, no story line, confusing, hard to watch because of idiotic camera filming at Jens face all the time... At the end all you want to do is sue somebody for time and money wasted. <br/><br/>I cannot understand how did all those A-list actors and actresses thought - ""This movie is great!"" - after reading the script!"

"luischarbel","10","5","11","22 September 2017"," A challenging movie that asks but doesn't answer
","As you've probably seen, this movie divided everyone. Much like every piece of art, it asks something of you, it shows you things you may not want to see and then asks you for meaning. Meaning in movies is almost always taken for granted. A movie is a narrative and just tells a story. With mother! this is not the case. There is a narrative but in a very Aronofsky style, allegories and metaphors are plenty. Whether you like them or not, Whether you get them or not depends very much on you, you as a person, your beliefs, your experiences. Like every piece of art it will always mean something different for everyone. Some people like some art, others don't, it's natural. I can only speak of my own experience, and my own meaning. It's definitely a movie that will be talked about for years to come, for some it will bring exasperation and disdain, for others it will bring acclaim, for others it will bring confusion. And that is the purpose of art. To be talked about, to be analyzed, to be remembered, for the right and the wrong reasons, by people who liked it and hated it. It succeeds in being art, but art is not for everyone."

It's at its best an interesting take on the Christian god and what his existence might be like to him. At its worst , Mother! is a pretentious, pompous, bloated, wanna-be-artsy-fartsy two hours of trying to be brilliant, witty, and clever.

"spookyrat1","5","2","3","5 November 2019"," Oh Dear Mother!
","Yes, it's a biblical allegory and yes, it's a film that will polarise. It's really not all that original and pays all manner of homages to directors such as Pasolini, Bunuel and Polanski (In other words, in its own way, it's pretty derivative.). In my opinion it really only has one thing going for it and that is a fantastic performance from Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Take a look at the main poster/DVD cover. That clues you in to what you are going to be dealt with in Mother! It's a close-up of Lawrence's face. Be prepared for around 90% of the cinematography, being hand-held close-ups of mainly faces. It makes for a dizzying, claustrophobic experience as we follow Lawrence and any number of her unwanted guests around the confines of the large, country house in which virtually all the onscreen action occurs.<br/><br/>The biblical references and parallels are obvious and arguably different for those expecting a more traditional horror movie. But have no misconceptions, this is no Rosemary's Baby. I just didn't enjoy the story of Mother's continual mistreatment, degradation and fate dealt out by her poet husband and his growing band of sycophantic fans, admirers and general hangers-on. It really was unpleasant and not in the least bit entertaining. But I can't deny that Mother will provoke discussion and debate, so it does have some merit.<br/><br/>Most deserving of merit though is Lawrence. She totally carries the movie and is virtually in every scene. Forget Javier Bardem; his role probably could just about have been played by any reasonable actor. Likewise Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer come and go and are really just there for their names. Lawrence however gives an acting tour-de-force and is just so watchable. Considering her contribution and the film's content, it is completely understandable that she would want to have a break from acting, as she did, after completing this film.<br/><br/>The greatest mystery with Mother! is not the storyline. For me, it's how Jennifer Lawrence ended up being nominated for a Razzie Lead Actress award for her role. it's the most laughably daft decision the Razzie organisers have ever made. All they succeeded in doing by this unwarranted slap in the face for a very talented actress, is to most deservedly get the proverbial egg splattered over their own metaphorical faces."

"ejohnson2","4","2","3","5 October 2019"," Not Worth The Explanation
","When you create a movie that absolutely needs to be explained to the viewer for them to understand what they have seen...that's a problem. If you watched this film and didn't google an explanatory synopsis of it then you are probably mostly confused with a small glimmer of understanding that you have witnessed some religious symbolism. That's correct. I doubt anyone who watched this admittedly visually interesting film understood 90% of what they saw in a cohesive manner when it ended. Bits and pieces struck a chord with me as religious allegories but by the end I couldn't tell you how they fit together and that was frustrating. Even the blog I read explaining the film didn't understand all of it. And it was a pretty thorough account of what I thought I had seen.
If I was only judging production and acting this might be a 9 of a movie. Jennifer Lawrence was great. But when the film makers know their audience won't understand most of what they viewed by the end of the film that just bothers me.

"Pagespinner","8","2","3","14 September 2019"," Aronofsky's allegorical horror is his best film this century
","A poet and his seemingly mentally unstable wife live in isolation - him staringly seeking inspiration, her doing up a house which has seen better days - until they open the door to a stranger, and to a great deal else.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky made a name for himself with his first feature, Pi, a moderately successful cult film, followed by a powerful if straightforward adaptation of Hubert J. Selby's Requiem for a Dream, before directing and mostly scripting a series of less impressive outings (The Wrestler and Black Swan being particularly overrated) ending in the dreadful Noah. Certain critics are still keen to keep praising him as a director of vision, but the ideas have just not been there.<br/><br/>Until Mother! that is, a sporadically nerve-jangling, hardly-dare-watch home invasion drama (though an unusual one, it has to be said) that aims to be an allegory on the Human Condition, touching on themes of mental illness, the role of women, relationships and abuse, the pitfalls of celebrity and fame, mass psychology, the origin of religious cults and goodness knows what else. The basic plot bears some resemblance to the story of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath had it been directed by Ken Russell, with Javier Bardem as a self-obsessed Hispanic Hughes and Jennifer Lawrence, through whose eyes we see events, as a kind of timid, interior-decorating Plath, as well as a possibly unhinged and unreliable narrator.<br/><br/>It's an ambitious project and to an extent it works, making Aronofsky's best film to date, though the climactic violence takes a very unpleasant turn, and the viewer may be left wondering why there is no police involvement earlier on, as well as longing for a reasonable explanation of events."

"maxmalley","10","2","3","1 February 2019"," One of a Kind
","Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is not what one would expect for a typical horror movie. It transcends the genre, if even it could be considered horror. The film follows a couple who seem to have a perfect life with a house too big for the two of them to live in. Their lives were, the audience believes, completely mundane... until there was a knock at the door.
This first knock on the door is really what sets the whole movie in to motion. Jennifer Lawrence's character is disturbed that a complete stranger showed up to their house that is located in the middle of nowhere, while Javier Barderm's ""Him"" (that's literally his name, no names are given in this film) is elated that the stranger wants to talk about his poems that have garnered many fans. To say much more than the titular ""mother"" is quite upset at the uninvited houseguests that follow in the footsteps of the first visitor would take away from some of the best points of the film.
Be prepared to be totally bewildered after your first viewing. That's part of the charm. Keep your eyes peeled for religious allegories as well, which are subtle enough not to be too overt. It was fresh to see a filmmaker who has been in the public consciousness for a while take a risk in something that is made. I urge anyone reading this review not to be turned away by the admittedly odd premise, but strap in for a ride that will have you unpacking what you have watched in this film for a good while."
"xcvb_2003","8","2","3","23 October 2018"," Weird but Interesting Experience.
","Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Mother is a movie about... well... a shit-ton of things depending on how you see it. It's an allegorical movie filled to the brim with symbolism and I'm glad I didn't have a clue what this movie was about.<br/><br/>There is a lot to appreciate about the movie. I loved the cinematography, the claustrophobic framing flowed properly with the movie, giving you the feeling of being trapped and anxiety as you follow Jennifer Lawrance through it all, very sparingly giving you a wide shot so you can breathe. There are long sequences in the movie which are relentless and chaotic, brutal and insane, taking you for a ride you definitely did not expect. There's a lack of music but it was in favor of the experience. Proper use of surround channels and good sound design aided in immersing you in this weird trip.<br/><br/>Performances are pretty much great across the board from the main characters. Jennifer Lawrance and Javier Bardem both were amazing. Supporting characters like Ed Harris and Michelle Pfieffer delivered their stuff properly.<br/><br/>Now, I can't get into the story since I don't wanna give anything away but it's interesting, to say the least. Sure the way it's all executed might seem pretentious and too much of an artsy film where Aronofsky's head was probably stuck up his ass trying to make this BUT if you give the movie a chance, it can be one hell of a weird experience. I was hooked in trying to figure out WTF is going on, and while my brain went somewhere else, I had an interesting time with the movie. When I learned what was actually going on, a lot of things just clicked naturally.<br/><br/>If Aronofsky's ""Noah"" was taking things too far (as I recall a lot of people were butthurt over it, I enjoyed the movie), this is on a whole another level. I honestly loved the experience. It was sometimes too slow and I'm still trying to figure out all of the things and not all of the symbolism was good or perfect or genius or whatever. But with Aronofsky's brilliant direction, I would definitely recommend this if you wanna watch something different, something that will stay with your mind for a while after finishing it, something you might wanna watch again in order to get everything.<br/><br/>And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10. Weird, but Interesting."

Mother spends her life painstakingly restoring their home following a fire. Her peace is destroyed by two characters, played by Michelle Pffeifer and Ed Harris who are a married couple, welcomed into the house by the Poet, who immediately start undermining mother and ignoring her requests and boundaries. The film escalates from there. <br/><br/>Let start with the one unquestionable part. The performances from all the cast are great.

Being honest, I did miss the principle idea about it being a mother earth and the incomprehensible damage that we are doing to it, despite how painfully obvious it seems once it's brought to your attention. Other ones I did pick up on though, the parable for Christianity and as a treatise on creativity that other have mentioned. I did think the initial scenes were about having children . . . though I seem to be alone with that one. I have to admit, I'm still thinking about the film a couple of days later, which I probably a good sign, but can I say that I was genuinely entertained whilst I was watching it ... no, not really."

","Darren Aronofsky is a talented director and writer, and has never been one to shy away from complex and disturbing cinematic experiences. With that being said, Mother! simply misses the mark and is a massive waste of talent, money, and overall my time. <br/><br/>Folks, I will not beat around the bush with this one. Leaving this movie I asked myself ""Maybe Aronofsky is just a cocky writer who is entirely too full of himself?"" Leaving ""Black Swan"" I remember being ecstatic about the trajectory of Darrens career, but now I am simply appalled. <br/><br/>Trying to spin this as a commentary on the relationship between nature and man, or as a metaphor to Christian idealogical stories is simply a disservice to actual cinema. Aronofsky uses shock value to try to get his point across, but in doing so loses the original story he was meaning to tell. I was totally taken out of the movie, and felt the whole time I was witnessing something for akin to an Eli Roth piece. <br/><br/>Overall, I almost walked out of this movie. It is pretentious for the sake of being pretentious. It is bloody and messy for the sake of being bloody and messy. I walked away intellectually stifled and emotionally angry.

"Kirsty2515","2","2","3","5 March 2018"," That's 2 hours of my life I am never going to get back!!
","I'm not really sure where to start with this. I've seen a number of Darren Aronofsky films and I've generally liked them. His movies always give you something to think about, however this was a whole different story. I honestly feel like I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a poor re-telling of the bible that tried to use shock tactics to impress the viewers.<br/><br/>From the Cain and Abel story line, to the word of God spreading, to the birth of Jesus, the film is packed with biblical allegories and metaphors, however it feels like the hole in the floor that is meant to represent a bleeding vagina, the people killing the baby then literally eating his flesh and the crushing of mother nature's burnt heart to reveal a crystal, has all been added to the film in order to give it the dark tone it needs to earn the horror tag that it has and to shock the viewers and give them something to talk about after they have watched it.<br/><br/>It felt like the movie came in 2 halves, it was almost like Aronofsky got half way through and realised the film was awful and that he need to add some form of action, sex and gore to it to make it something.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie should have been enough to make this a great film. Lawrence and Pfeiffer are fantastic and bring the tension that the film is hoping for when they play opposite each other, but for me they were let down by their male counterparts. Bardem and Harris, although both great actors in their own right for me did not stand out in this film at all. If anything, their characters irritated me.<br/><br/>As I watched this movie i tried to keep an open mind and stick and give it a chance to get better. I did manage to get all the way to the end however I honestly lost my will to live somewhere in the middle section. <br/><br/>I've read a number of other reviews that claim if you don't like this movie you are not intelligent or don't understand the art that you have just been exposed to. I completely disagree with this. I think if you disliked this move you are probably an honest person who isn't trying to make yourself sound like you are some pretentious movie expert who sees something that extortionary in this film.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel there are a number of much better films out there that deserve the praise that people have given to this."

","... I am so glad I waited to watch this on video, I am shure that my fits of laughter at each new allegoric discovery would have at the least encouraged others and best infuriated most, mainly as I am slow and had purposefully not forewarned myself in any way toward this film. I need to say that I liked Mother!, I especially like the title the exclamation point is critical to the title sincerity! I also need to point out in earnest I appreciate Darren Aronfsky for many of his films and for the fact that he does not skimp on star power. I have always enjoy Ms. Lawrence, Javier, and who can have any kind of problem with Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris. All that said Mother! is a very bad dream, one that it is very hard to rouse from in a manner that allows the dreamer to fully appreciate the twisted depth. Laughter was the only response that I could muster... the loudest and most ruckus outbursts were at totally inappropriate times. A bit of a spoiler note here... one should not and can not in public laugh at the killing and mutilation of a complete innocent as I did. (If that statement ruined anything, well, by the time it happens you really should have seen it coming!) Darren A. has been known for his, how do I put this, his interesting and disturbing interpretations of Biblical myth, more than once and in more than just this movie. Who am I to judge? I would recommend this movie to those who can get outside of the nightmare and appreciate the art (?). Unfortunately at this point, I am shure the jadedness of these reviews (my own included) and all the deep and thoughtful explanations offered so expertly have clouded the impact available to me as I first watched this film Give it a shot, go ahead, scream, puzzle, laugh if need be and enjoy the star power and the scenery... what the hell?"

This just fits the bill. 2017's mother! should qualify it for The Disaster Cinematic Universe and give it a 2027 sequel titled either 'mother! 2: Ragnarok' or a simple 'The Disaster Artist 2: mother!'

","Betrayed by a callous marketing campaign., mother! faces unreasonable expectations like its central character.

Studios seem to do this with films they don't know how to market. It's a cynical and short-sighted strategy. As much a I tried to divorce mother! from it's ad campaign, I couldn't avoid disappointment. I am an Aronofsky fan and a lover of horror and was disappointed to some degree on both fronts. <br/><br/>Mother! is less horror and more audacious allegory that can be seen from space. It's book-ended by Him removing the charred heart of Her and placing it on a pedestal in his office. At no point did mother! resemble real life. I was initially galled by the obviousness of of it's symbolism. Biblical signposts are all but announced through a bullhorn. That said, mother! raises some interesting questions. It's the creation myth as endless cycle of violence. <br/><br/>The more I've thought about mother!, the more grateful I am that it got made. It articulates something vital and makes us think. I almost can't believe I'm saying this because I initially found it to be a straightforward allegory with a heavy-handed environmental message. The notion of God a an egomaniac beholden to his fawning followers is rich. Mother! has stayed with me."

"wemme","6","1","1","12 January 2020"," Exciting chaos, slightly stale
","Mother! is a purely allegorical film. In its foundation it mixes biblical allegories into a story about mother nature. The intent of director Darren Aronofsky is completely lucid. He wants the audience to reflect on the history of humanity and its impact on our planet, as well as of how our relation to God is ultimately what makes us destroy each other and our home. There are many layers in this film however I can't say that I experience the layers to be particularly deep. Mother! is so concerned about its metaphors that it neglects in creating fully fleshed characters and doesn't contribute any poignant ideas to the conversation about climate change. Yes, we have destroyed our planet. Yes, we have an unheatlhy relation to religion. Then what? This wouldn't be an issue had it been that it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. It comes dangerously close to being goofy at its climax.<br/><br/>What saves Mother! is actually the ways in which Aronofsky choses to portray and visualise the metaphors. Watching the house deteriorate symbiotically with The Mother and all the visitors that arrogantly and violently storm their home was thrilling. The allegories were excellently portrayed by the actors, I think especially Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem were fantastic. Mother! is anything but boring and manages to entertain all the way through in quite a ride. It marvels technically and I celebrate any filmmaker that tries to do something new. But Mother! doesn't fail by technical marvel, it just leaves me seeking a refreshing statement in a battle it clearly wants to participate in."

","This must be a ""Horror"" film. It might be that I don't like it because it was so painful to watch. Is that a success as far as a ""Horror"" film goes? By the end the story piled on so much pain on the poor ""Mother"" I nearly began to laugh. Think about how people can invade your life and magnify it by more and more until it spills over into farce. This might have been the film makers intention.......?
It left you wanting believe that some circle of horrific existence was in play. At the end it was already to roll again, unfortunately. It was like Fawlty Towers with blood and gore, where irrational visitors cause havoc and mayhem yet without any laughs. (Was there a zombie disco in the poor ""Mothers"" home? It only got more progressively insane, to the point of ridicule.)
The ""Mother"", in this case Jennifer Lawrence, remained stoical in the face of her husbands need to feed his artistic ego. She was too beautiful to look too affected by the growing invasion of her lifestyle. It was if the Writer/Director had an idea about some sort of realism at the start and then added so many horrors to the story that became top heavy with misery; from people who were just bad mannered to God knows what else. It tried so hard to be utterly painful for the heroin and it was a fantastic success in this respect. Making it the same for the viewer was not a good idea.

It's a difficult feeling to describe.<br/><br/>It's imagination candy. It's not so much about the things you notice each time you watch it (and there are plenty of them), but rather the new ideas it conjures within your mind each time you watch it. You may even find yourself re-watching it just to have it play in the background while you think about other things. It's that powerful.<br/><br/>A lot of people won't understand the power of this movie as obvious from all the 1 star reviews. I hope if you're one of the people like myself who will truly connect with this masterpiece, that you aren't turned off by the reviews before you get the chance to behold this beautiful gift."

","Watching this film was indeed like watching someone's actual nightmare and putting it in a movie. If you want to be entertained then this is not the horror movie for you. I wanted to be entertained, instead I was extremely uncomfortable and angry watching this nightmare on film.<br/><br/>I have read several of the other reviews prior to writing mine and I see we have some supreme intellects who have graced us all with their education and superior powers of metaphor and allegorical breakdown.<br/><br/>However, I am not here to impress total strangers on the internet. I am also not here to insult total strangers on the internet.<br/><br/>I will say that this movie did not satisfy my desire to be entertained or my desire to get a good scare. This movie was for people who join satanic cults and kill babies. Those kinds of people really exist in the world and this film is an homage to them. Jennifer Lawrence has gotten caught up with the wrong crowd and any children who love her and admire her should stay far away from this movie and probably should run in the opposite direction if you ever see her in real life.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky really did a great job with the movie Black Swan. I love that movie! It was entertaining and had some good scares. As I said before, this movie is devoid of those qualities. This movie is a recruiting tool for lost souls who may be susceptible to choosing Satan and rejecting God. Take it from me my brothers and sisters, reject this movie and put your faith and love in God. Satan can get at you through movies and music. Which side do you think Hollywood is on?"

My bad.<br/><br/>Lesson learned that I should read a more detailed plot before choosing a movie.<br/><br/>So I am very torn how I feel about it as had I known the REAL characters, I may have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>Still feeling very angry for Mother and randoms in her house.

"someharmindreaming","9","1","1","15 May 2019"," Not a horror film. Not an allegory. A straightforward retelling
","I came to this film with no great expectation and a vague memory that it was not actually a horror film. The opening scenes were psychologically and visually intriguing enough and the arrival of the 'Rosemary's Baby' elements with Harris and Pfeiffer was duly unsettling but when for me the big reveal happened with the Cain and Abel fight it suddenly lost the feel of pretentiousness and showed itself to be very clear that it was not trying to be some oblique allegory but a head-on modern dress translation of the Biblical story basing around the 'vain and callous' Old Testament deity that many cannot help but read into the texts but is almost never given a rounded portrayal.
There is no 'allegory' it is quite literal. Same as Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet' is not an allegory for Shakespeare's. I understand that this was marketed as a horror film but it is no such thing. Neither is it 'trippy and surreal'. It is just a high concept exploration of the Creation story but with a Gaia figure as his first unnurtured creation. I cannot see this as a politically eco-movie as everything that happens is shown to be cyclical and inevitible in a nod to current cosmology.
I can only say that it carried me along willingly to it's entirely predictible and satisfying end. It did so elegantly and with a sure-handed momentum that ratcheted up the pace and the emotional resonances and never gave me time to notice flaws and hit no wrong notes for me. I am a little unsure of Javier Bardem as cast but Jennifer Lawrence it is impossible for me to imagine another actress carrying her role so affectingly.
A minus point for me was that Harris and Pfeiffer DID carry the resonance of Rosemary's Baby into the movie and this feels like an accident that should have been avoided. Their age seems to be more to reflect the strange biblical scholarship that has Adam living for a thousand years rather than to be in itself creepy. They did the OPPOSITE of the Polanski characters in completely ignoring the nubile young wife and the association should not have been allowed to be drawn and mislead viewers into thinking the film was something it was not.
The psychological horror elements were otherwise well marshalled and properly disquieting. The criticism that it leans heavily on Bunuel's 'The Exterminating Angel' rings true but it would be more of a criticism if it were the 1000th film to do so.
I am completely at a loss to understand how anybody can look for signs of the Jennifer Lawrence character having a mental breakdown or drug induced hallucination. It is not that film. It is simpler and far more satisfying than that. I understand why horror fans are disappointed and Christians hostile but it seems to me to be the first cogent exploration on film of how the Old Testament deity is not 'fit for purpose' in the modern world and as a film it needs to be absorbed and engaged with."

"extremesteamkeys","5","1","1","29 April 2019"," Awash with absurdity, Mother! just tries too hard...
","Mother! is a film that tries to pose questions to its audience and intentionally leaves them unanswered. For the most part this is acceptable, but there are several scenes that are not tied well enough together in the narrative - and this leads to disappointment - the scene with the cellar door springs to mind here.<br/><br/>The movie, is okay, but I can't help feeling it's trying to be bigger than its boots - it try's to weave mystery, suspense and horror into a seamless blend but ultimately blurs the boundaries between the genres so much so that you lose focus. It seems like it's crying out to be an artistic masterpiece, but perhaps trying a little too hard.<br/><br/>The narrative is convoluted - it's not super difficult to follow but many of the questions that it leaves open ended answers to are unavailing - the questions that it needs to answer to make a decent amount of sense it just doesn't, and the questions it does not answer just seem pointless.<br/><br/>It's not absolutely terrible, and some people will love it. I however did not. For these reasons I consider it be worth about 5 stars, which is average - but I can see how one could argue for or against the film at least 1 star in either direction. I don't think it's worth any less than 4 stars but it certainly is not worthy of more than 6.<br/><br/>5* - Average"

","Everything about this was quite simply terrible. The camera work was so bad that I actually felt physically ill during and after watching the film. Due to this I spent occasional moments of the film staring at the emergency exit sign in the cinema just to try and not feel dizzy. I'm not even being over dramatic here, I've just never had a film make me feel so unwell before.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire film literally nothing makes any sense and you think there must be some clever twist coming to explain it all - regrettably this never arrives. As it turned out both me and my sister wanted to leave the film throughout the majority of it but didn't do so because we both thought the other was enjoying it!<br/><br/>Even if a 5 year old had written this story, it would be considered a poor effort. Had I know what the concept was then I would have gone to see such rubbish in the first place.<br/><br/>Watching this was a complete waste of 2 hours of my life.

Watch it for Javier Bardem and the antics of Michelle Pfeifer."
"bluluminous","9","1","1","16 February 2019"," The Muse (spoilers)
","When I watched the film the first time, I was genuinely in a state of shock. During the movie, my writer's mind kept asking: ""what the flip is happening?"" Is the Poet an ET? Is the Poet a creator of a virtual world after an apocalypse? Then as the movie came to a close and I reflected after the breathless, intense, emotional and horrific last 20 minutes, I was like 'Duh'. This is a brilliant film. The Poet is ""God"" of creation, his creation, his art (poetry in the film but could be applied to any form of art like fiction, directing, acting, painting, sculpting, etc.) The house is ""Just setting,"" as the Poet/Him says in the film. It is disregarded as just background. The Muse (Jennifer Lawrence) is the ""Inspiration"" and the one who restored the house after the fire. The Muse is confused, angry, and annoyed by the invasion of first the Couple who enters the house. Each time the Muse changes something or acts she has a fit where is sees glimpses of the burned down house and we hear the sound of ringing crystal. She takes medicine. The Poet makes love to the Muse, and she says she's pregnant. A creation, an innocent new thing. But by then we had witnessed the utter destruction of the house and people involved in all kinds and types of human craziness, zealotry, veneration that makes no sense but the Poet loves it. To him, human suffering, craziness, chaos fuels his desire to create which in turns fuels the zealotry, veneration, and chaos from humanity which results in even more human suffering. The Muse just wants to be comfortable and alone with her house and her Poet and also now the baby which they both created in this pairing of Inspiration and outlet (the Poet/artist). But by the birth of the baby, the Muse no longer trusts the Poet because he cares more about being worshipped, venerated, and sought after by his fans. Anyway, this movie is not for the shallow thinker or for someone who does not have the perpencity toward creation of their own like some form of art. They will not get the film. However, people who see films not only for entertainment value but also to be shocked and provoked into thinking in deeper ways, past the scenes, into the symbolism will appreciate what the creator of the film was trying to convey."

"crom-dubh","8","1","1","8 September 2018"," Intense experience!
","I am shocked at the number of 1/10 reviews for this film, and not because I don't expect difficult films to be misunderstood by a lot of people, but because this is 1. a film by a director notorious for making films like this, and 2. because it's fairly obvious throughout that the film is not to be taken at face value. From the very first shots of the film we're told we're going to be dealing with heavy allegory and symbolism. If anyone didn't get that, it's entirely their fault. If anyone has seen any of Aronofsky's other films and expected something other than the type of experience this movie provides, it's entirely their fault. <br/><br/>That's not to say you have to like or appreciate this film. But I see a lot of people who seem to dislike it because they didn't get it or thought it was pretentious. That's honestly lazy. Art is almost synonymous with pretense. I hate to be that guy, but if you can't handle that, you're best sticking with safe films that don't ever stray outside the surface level narrative comfort zone. God forbid anyone try to make a film that does something different, explores ideas through unconventional means. I think people want to have their cake and eat it too: they like the idea of films that are different but then when they actually see one that is profoundly different, their reaction is to say ""WTF, I want my 2 hours back!"" <br/><br/>Suffice it to say, this is a crazy film. I was really impressed with all aspects of the production. I honestly went into this expecting to hate it. As a full disclosure, I am definitely not a fan of Jennifer Lawrence. I find her to be one of the most overrated actresses of all time and I had yet to see her do anything that remotely impressed me. I won't say that I now love her, but she did really well here, as did the rest of the cast. The direction and staging of every scene is incredibly well done. The characters are all so adeptly calculated to be as loathsome as possible. Michelle Pfiefer's character in particular will probably just make you seethe with hatred every time you see her. And that's the point! On a certain level I understand why some people hate this movie, because it's supposed to frustrate you. If you can't get past that, then look elsewhere. If you are the kind of person who can really look through your reflexive reactions and see the intent of the film, know that it is trying to have a certain effect on you, and allow yourself to appreciate how well it is doing that, then this is probably your movie."

But I can't see how anyone who enjoys movies can give this movie 1 star? The acting is great, the cinematography with those claustrophobic close ups and the use of sound are brilliant. Everything in the movie aids in building the sense of stress and confusion so well. The biblical allegories are genius and make a lot of sense with the plot of the film. The visuals are intense and the themes are at times disgusting but the whole film pulls together a really interesting message and leaves you thinking about it for days. The more I read into the biblical allegories of all the characters the more captivating the movie becomes. I do recommend watching the film before trying to figure out the meaning online or reading anything Aronofsky said about it.<br/><br/>It's hard to recommend but well worth the viewing if you enjoy out of the ordinary films."

","I was interested in this film the moment I saw the trailer. Aronofsky has a unique story telling ability and Jennifer Lawrence (despite people not even giving her a chance for god knows what reason) always impresses me with the roles she embodies. The trailer was ominous and vague and definitely intrigued me. However I didn't see it right away because it basically flopped during its release and I was nervous about being disappointed. Now the film is on Hulu and I finally gave it a go one night when I was home alone and I have to say I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater with stupid jump-scare-hungry kids.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as a heartbreaking nightmare. It starts off somewhat normal in somewhat of a reality; it has a timeless feeling and the overall tone is calm and serene. Over the course of the film, their existence is more and more disturbed until their entire world goes up in smoke (spoiler alert, literally). I was nervous about JLaw just playing JLaw and I wouldnt be able to separate the actor from ththe character, but she does a great job of capturing my heart in the beginning and then breaking it by the end. <br/><br/>Was I ever scared during this movie? Probably not. I dont think it's fair to call it a horror film and it only sets people's expectations off course from what it's trying to convey. If you want to see a metaphor for Mother Earth's creation by God and destruction by humans, see it. <br/><br/>To everyone that said ""it's oversaturated with symbolism/no pay off at the end/no point to the story/ect."", stick to your Michael Bay movies and bye."

","If you absolutely hated this movie, you also probably think it's ok to carve presidents faces on sacred mountains ""Just to show we were here."" You also probably think it's ok to pollute 'just a little' and argue for plastic straws. There's no denying what's happening to Mother is happening in real life to our planet. Yes, even its most insane moments are happening a thousand fold every day. Now, if you went in blind not knowing the allegory, which is how I went in, it is still a damn freaky movie. The feeling of helplessness, of losing everything you built while your husband does nothing and even seems to be enjoying it as he coddles and forgives the perpetrators without offering any defense. As hands grope at you and the stain of blood on your land can never be washed clean. To have your son ripped apart and eaten before your eyes... it's called 'empathy' and lack of it is the root of this world's problems. Whatever you believe is the method for how it happens, doesn't matter, but it has happened before. Over and over again God creates an Eden and over and over his most beloved creations destroy it. This movie is traumatic and disturbing and certainly has made a needed statement. It was shot well and acted well. Why an 8 then? It was a bit long and well, I don't like having to look up what the hell a movie is about. Sure some veiwers knew what was happening (my brother-in-law knew what was up in 'Shudder Island' before the ferry even got to the island). Some may have read about its meaning and instead of using this to inform their experience they called it 'pretentious art crap'. Again, empathy. Put yourself in her place.

It made me relate to the woman on the most mundane level - the supportive wife, the self-obsessed artist, the house - the temple of the their love, being desecrated by his ego. I saw it as a grotesque critique of the relationship model - giver/user. So even just that layer was fine with me and made me feel my time was well spent. Also the evolution of the society, with the false idols it creates and then starts killing in ""their name"". It was interesting story told in a way that worked for me.

","His choices can be often quite confusing.Firstly,Why he chose to put Jennifer Lawrence in a wig.a bad one at that, was distracting, at least for me. He clearly avoided shooting her C,U.'s voiding her hair line most of the time. 
The English are so fantastic with THEIR wigs, why are American hairdressers so bad. Also there was much too much hair. Also her last hair style was clearly done by a professional.<br/><br/> As for the film it did keep my attention throughout but in the end it was a big SO WHAT. It was so marginally trying to be a take on the Adam and Eve fairy tale of the Bible, but that just did not cut it for me
 Aronofsky like to confuse his public. As he did in Black Swain. I have argued with so many people that totally missed a very important aspect of the mother daughter relationship. Their is a quick shot of the Mother, (Hershey) on top of her daughter during sex scene. Very quick flash back. This would suggest that the mother was a molester of her daughter which explains their current dynamic.
 
 He does get great performances but in short much to do about nothing"

","I can't help feeling that the story of ""Mother!"" was written by someone who never got over being rudely intruded upon when they were in the bathroom.<br/><br/>""Mother!"" is chock full of phobias including some most of us can relate to with invasion of personal space the most prominent. For me it is an effective horror story until about the three-quarter mark. Then it ends up in the same kind of mess as Ben Wheatley's ""High Rise"".<br/><br/>Writer/director Darren Aronofsky started out with a fascinating scenario. A successful author simply called 'Him' (Javier Bardem) moves to a large secluded house in the country with his pregnant wife, 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence). It seems they both welcome the solitude. However when he invites a stranger into their home it leads to more and more unexpected guests arriving and also the arrival of hordes of the author's fans. He seems to welcome the attention while she feels besieged.<br/><br/>Before the script and film heads way over-the-top, there are some nicely observed touches, especially the uninvited guests who turn nasty when they are rejected, and Bardem's author who seems prepared to sacrifice just about anything for adulation and flattery. On the other hand, Mother slowly cracks up as gatecrashers pop out of every crevice.<br/><br/>There is confronting nastiness in ""Mother!"" But that's fine; it's a horror movie. What isn't fine is that it all becomes rather tedious, eventually giving way to Peter Greenaway inspired excess - ""Baby of Macon"" comes to mind. At the end there is even a touch of that mother of all round-trip horror movies, ""Dead of Night"". <br/><br/>According to an interview with Jennifer Lawrence, there is subtext in ""Mother!"" including allegory for the rape of Mother Earth plus references to God as well as Adam and Eve. Signals I found difficult to receive out of the unrelenting chaos. I'm surprised we didn't end up with a Blake Edwards-style pie fight - that's what he seemed to do when he didn't know what to do next."

"harrylosborne","3","1","1","5 January 2018"," Tedious, pretentious, and ultimately annoying
","Apparently director Darren Aronofsky is incapable of producing well-received films without interspersing them with films that fail to please: whilst The Wrester and Requiem for a Dream have been acclaimed by critics, his other titles, such as Noah and Black Swan have only succeeded in aggravating people with their big picture connotations, loosely portrayed through clunky storytelling and often needless CGI.<br/><br/>Mother! was a film I was looking forward to; Bardem and Lawrence headlining an all-star cast, with Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer also featuring - a promising cast, with a further intriguing trailer. However, just as with most of these big budget cast pictures, the film falls flat in its entirety, providing only a laboured view on a pseudo-religiously connotated story. <br/><br/>From the very beginning, the confusion is immediate. A visibly stressed relationship between Bardem and Lawrence is apparent, with the former a struggling (but obviously revered) writer, and the latter painstakingly rebuilding and remodelling Bardem's family home. Approximately every 156 minutes, Lawrence's character seems to be either having a panic attack or drinking a strange yellow concoction, with little to no explanation for either. Upon Ed Harris' introduction, their lives begin to muddle with that of Harris' (and his wife, Pfeiffer). <br/><br/>At this point in the film, the effort to try and continue watching is made even harder by Lawrence's refusal to speak for herself, as well as the overbearing use of audio to paint a deeper picture. This theme is present throughout the whole movie, and yet never lends itself to the element of ""horror"" that this film was supposed to have. <br/><br/>By halfway through, I was aware of the ""deeper meaning"" the characters were supposed to be making us aware of, but by this time my investment in the film was so minimal that even trying to enjoy the events spiralling out of control was borderline impossible. Ultimately, Aronovsky only managed to provide a cinematic experience akin to these other films eluding to higher meanings (see: The Fountain), and failing to tell an engaging or enjoyable story at any point in the film."
"stevehanisch","5","1","1","4 January 2018"," Well. I don't know. You figure it out for yourself.
","After my last two reviews, I was going to blow my brains out if I didn't watch a good movie. So, I had heard this was a good one and very polarizing to people. Check and check, let Ol' Sandwich weigh in. Well, sad to say my search for a good movie watch continues. Oh also, I may spoil some things in here for you. So, SPOILERS AHEAD. Actually, I definitely will. Whether you care or not is another entirely.
The cinematography was great. That's about the only great and normal thing I can say about this movie. Overall, it felt like a two-hour student film from a filmmaker who has been around the block. Like he just said fuck it, let's do this random thing. What pisses people off these days? A film with no real story? Check. Sex? People are over it, alright then no sex, but tease it the whole time! Check. Jennifer Lawrence screaming the entire film, check. Drugs? Incest? Murder? Any of these things really fuck people up anymore? No? Alright, well what about killing a baby and then eating it. What? That'll be sure to shoo funders away and scare off audiences. Perfect! Throw that in there! Alright, let's get this shit rolling!
After reading and reflecting, it's a biblical tale. Javier Bardem is God, Jennifer Lawrence is Mother Earth, Ed Harris is Adam, Michelle Pfeiffer is Eve and the House is the Earth. Everyone else is humanity just taking and ripping shit to shreds. That being said, there's about two hours and one minute left to fill. Most of the movie is meandering madness and bullshit. Like I said, it feels like a student film where there's no real point, all artsy shots and shit that will piss people off. That being said, there's a soft spot in my heart for people who go ""fuck the man"" and that's precisely what Aronofsky did here. Fuck your expectations, fuck your preconceived notions, fuck you and your (at least) twelve dollar movie ticket. I mean, that takes some set of balls. Obviously this guy wanted to make this movie, it's his little passion project. He wrote it in five days and the entire thing was done two years later. At the very least, you can't trash his love for this project.
But I sure fucking can trash his project. Fuck you for marketing this and selling it to a major distributor. Produce this thing solo, release and say this is my passion project and is not to be seen by anyone because it's not really a movie. It's an art project. It's an exercise in an filmmaker's self-indulgent motion picture and a complete waste of my time. At least I saw some Jennifer Lawrence tit in high definition 4K. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer can still get it. I'm not joking, go watch it.
Rotten Tomatoes, what do you have to say? ""There's no denying that mother! is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though it may be too unwieldy for mainstream tastes."" I mean. I guess. Basically, if you're a film buff, go ahead and watch it. If you're a mainstream film fan or anything in between, go ahead and just forget about this thing. It's an exercise, a student film by a veteran filmmaker. I don't know that it really has a place in any genre or tone and take that as you will. It's ballsy and for that, I respect him and the movie. For the last two hours of my life and six bucks however, eh. It's gone. So far gone. But hey, look at me! I'm watching critically acclaimed movies! If I say I like this movie, does that make me cultured and high-class? Or just a hipster that's like, ""The baby represents..."" fucking yack. It's been so long since film school at this point and there's a lot I don't miss about it. Like overanalyzing lazy metaphors. I feel like I need a shower after this film. With Jennifer Lawrence. And Javier Bardem can come too. He's such a great actor, I'm not above it.
Aronofsky said when he wrote this, it flowed from him like a fevered dream. That's what it watches like too. That's the best summation I can come up with. So, if you have the flu, like I did watching it, you're in for a hell of a trip. Don't need no booze, don't need no drugs, just some good ol' DayQuil and a touch of influenza and you're off on an adventure!"

"jeremyefass","Null","1","1","25 December 2017"," The true horror is that this movie is non-fiction
","In short: This movie depicts the story of the entire human race, told from Mother's Earth's perspective. Her home - the earth - is overrun by a mob of humans who eventually consume and defile everything in sight, including her most precious natural resources.<br/><br/>What makes this movie brilliant is that Aronofsky has managed to turn Mother Nature into a relatable human character, giving us viewers the opportunity to see through her eyes the true horror of our consumptive nature as a species and what we've been doing to the planet.<br/><br/>The biblical allegories play well into this theme too, as many of the Bible's stories touch on humanity's destructive and sinful nature. The movie includes references to the great flood and the crucifixion, among others.<br/><br/>Pairing Mother Nature with a God character (Bardem) as the entity responsible for humankind is what carries this story to its fullest potential. It further humanizes Mother Nature by placing her in a dysfunctional relationship, and his power to attract humans like flies to light helps emphasize her helplessness over the human race running rampant in her house.<br/><br/>For me, the most memorable scene in the entire movie is the brief shot of the baby's half devoured carcass. Many people hated the film because of that sequence, but I contend that the film's message probably required it. In that brief shot was every precious resource we humans have consumed from Mother Nature, reflected back at us in a form that we could understand. And horrifying, just as it should be.<br/><br/>Beautiful film overall. Relentless. Lawrence and Bardem were fantastic in their complex, pseudo-human roles. <br/><br/>I eagerly look forward to future work from Aronofsky. 10/10"

This movie is not for those faint of heart; I would never encourage my family or friends to watch this movie and I will warn as many people as I can NOT to watch it.

I do love a good horror! For what the writer felt like made sense on paper, actually didn't make sense on screen. Neither was it remotely entertaining, or even worthy of ever being made.
However! For someone who is rarely ever offended, the ending was totally despicable, highly offensive and upsetting.

What finally did it for me, was the fact that a newborn baby was used as an offering, as a trophy, that the newborn baby was also killed by having it's neck snapped being crowd surfed amongst a bunch of religious nuts. If that wasn't upsetting enough, the baby's flesh was then eaten by said nuts! I felt sick! I worry for the state of mind of the person who wrote this movie.

I haven't seen the Emjoi movie but I feel like I would have enjoyed that more. (Not really but I'm struggling to find something to compare this to in terms of terribleness).
Though I suspect that you'll really enjoy it if you have a high enough level of pretentiousness.<br/><br/>It's a bizarre movie that makes little to no sense. To be clear I enjoy the occasional bizarre movie. There is the kind of bizarre you might enjoy and then there is this horribleness.
I stuck with it because it felt like there might be an explanation for the confusion but then they just dialled up the confusion. It always felt like there was something coming that might make sense. It was frustrating that it never did.
I've seen bad movies before but never have I felt so robbed of time in my life.<br/><br/>I see other reviewers here and on other sites going on about how it's art and other such rubbish. It's not. 
As for the enlightened few who find this amazing and consider us cretins for not getting it... I suspect they're the same people who pretend to love this kind of drivel in an attempt to come across as intelligent and arty. All the while not really getting it as much as everyone else. <br/><br/>I've quite liked a few of Darren Aronofsky's films but this is inexcusable.

I found the movie enjoyable on many levels, though difficult to watch at times because of the emotional darkness and graphic scenes. I wish I could give it more stars, but in the end, I felt the movie didn't respect the audience enough. It was looking down on them, and even had built-in defense mechanisms. It was built for high ratings, and contrived to convert low rating into controversy. I personally thought it should get neither a high nor a low rating. It was a movie with a great idea and brooding atmosphere, but was somewhat dragged down by the acting of Jennifer Lawrence who appeared much too self aware and the execution of the allegory felt mechanical. But, the energy of the movie picked up by the end, with the final scene that included the newborn making for a masterful ending. Javier Bardem was excellent, as well.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky ticked all the boxes for artistry and mystique, but forgot to invite the audience along.

"alltowerpodcast","10","9","25","16 September 2017"," Oh Mother! where to begin
","The film Mother! is difficult to review without giving much away. I think the best way to start is to say it's not a horror movie at all. I feel it's more in line with a psychological thriller/mystery/metaphor . The performance by Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding and she raises the film to a higher level by simply being her. She is the main focus of the movie and although everyone else brings their A game she just seems to raise above. There are several meanings which can be drawn from the film and some are more obvious than others but I think this is the type of movie which will be studied for years to come. The film footage and angles add to the levels of suspense and are masterfully executed and the overall feel gets into you keeping you on edge with Lawrence's character. Keep in mind that even though this in not a horror there are parts of the film which are difficult to watch. I hope you found this helpful!

","I must admit that I had relatively low expectations for mother! after reading so many negative reviews, but it really is a well-crafted, intelligent, and symbolic film. The cast is strong, the characters are intriguing, and the story is both terrifying and thrilling.<br/><br/>At first, mother! seems like a horror film with strange and confusing plot points scattered throughout, but the second half turns in such a way - albeit insane - that the plot points/allegories/metaphors become clear. While the last 30 minutes or so of the film may be extremely disturbing to some, it wraps up the plot perfectly.<br/><br/>I think the reason for so many negative reviews is the film is almost overwhelmingly symbolic and uses many different Biblical themes to progress the plot, which some may not prefer. It would benefit viewers to have some knowledge of the book of Genesis prior to seeing mother! but that really isn't necessary to enjoy the film. <br/><br/>I'd recommend mother! to anyone not easily disturbed who understands and enjoys symbolism and metaphors in film.

","I just left from viewing this film, and I have to say it is really one of my new favorites. Please do not listen to the negative reviews; judge for yourself. <br/><br/>Let me say, this film is NOT going to be for everyone. First, some are not going to appreciate the ""in your face"" punch that they get by a movie that calls God on the carpet. Second, and what I really think is happening here, is that most current films are so dumbed down that when an intellectual film comes along it is almost always greeted by really harsh criticism. I mean, it is was really disheartening to sit through the previews prior to film because they served as reflection on just how bad and simple most films are today. I believe what is happening with the reviews on here about mother! are that most have become accustomed to being presented with simple, easy to follow plots and easy to follow story lines- which this film is not there to offer. <br/><br/>Please, just judge it for yourself. It truly and excellent film. <br/><br/>On a side note, I have to say I am COMPLETELY confused by all the references to Rosemary's Baby. This film is nothing like, nor does it even have a storyline or plot connection to Rosemary's Baby. The ones comparing this to Rosemary's Baby (in my opinion) completely missed the plot and storyline of this film."

People should of been warned that ""mother!"" is not grounded in reality.<br/><br/>You probably won't ""get it"" because you empathized with Lawrence's character, who felt frustration, anxiety, loss, and anger. She didn't ""get it"" either. Still, it doesn't matter whether you loved or hated it, because we all felt the same emotions; we all searched for and discovered the same answers.

","Mother! (2017) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Usually this is where I put my plot description but it's best that you go into Darren Aronofsky's latest knowing as little as possible. Lets just say that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are living in a large house all alone when a surprise visit sets them off into madness.<br/><br/>It really shocks me that Paramount would try to push MOTHER! onto the masses. For starters, the majority of moviegoers today do not want to think and they certainly don't want to see a movie where everything isn't explained. In fact, most people need everything explained in the trailer before they'll even go see a movie. A movie like MOTHER! is something that never explains itself and it constantly keeps you guessing from one scene to the next. What's it about? It's really hard to say as every viewer is going to come away with something different. With all of that said, it's easy to see why the film bombed at the box office and why those who did see it gave it a F rating.<br/><br/>what I loved most about this movie is that the setting is just so perfect. You've got a large beautiful house out in the middle of nowhere and it's surrounded by beautiful grass and trees. From the very first scene we can just tell that something isn't quite right and Aronofsky puts us in this beautiful place with confusing surroundings. What makes the film so special is the fact that nothing is ever explained and with each new plot twist your brain just becomes more confused as to what's going on. We know something is happening and we know something bad is going to happen but you're constantly trying to guess what.<br/><br/>Of course, a movie like this wouldn't work without a terrific cast to pull it off. Lawrence turns in another terrific performance and I thought she as fabulous at showing how fractured this character was. We're often questioning her mental state and I thought Lawrence managed to make you feel for the character and go along with her confusion to everything that is happening. Bardem actually steals the show with his fiery performance and I really loved the rage and anger he brought to the film as well as another side that I won't spoil to prevent giving away aspects of the plot. Both Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer were also terrific but, again, I'll hold off commenting more to prevent plot points.<br/><br/>The cinematography is terrific and on a technical level the film is quite flawless. The story is a very interesting one and one that keeps you guessing throughout. The performances just seal the deal. With that said, the film certainly goes downright insane at times and the ending is just one that will have you staggering out of the theater. I must say that I thought the finale went on a bit too long and that it would have worked better had it been edited down a bit. Still, MOTHER! is a film that I really loved and one that I really respected but at the same time I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to."

It isn't a film to take literally and the experiences are either boiled into a shorter time to represent many things that have happened over a long time, or the experiences are largely contorted in the protagonist's head.<br/><br/>This means that the frequency of events makes them unbelievable to a dark-comedic level and many events seem less literal.

","A couple with a substantial, acknowledged age difference live a quiet life in a nice house in the middle of a field, surrounded by forest. She(Lawrence, giving her usual solid performance. So much of it, here, is anxiety, especially communicated through her eyes, and it's great. A lot of people who hate this, disagree on the quality, and I can see how that would make you despise it, given how much of this is her reacting. She's loving, and accepts a huge amount of micro-aggressions, constantly undermining her will and wishes) has renovated it. He(Bardem, going expertly between sinister and charming. He's a poet, who desires praise from fans) is dealing with writer's block, which fills the air. That tension is greatly increased once people start showing up uninvited, and their rudeness gradually rises to the unbearable. You won't believe what happens next. No, really. That's not exaggeration. Unless someone gives you a detailed rundown of the events of this, it will constantly surprise you. Don't let them. Go into this with as little info as possible.<br/><br/>The hand-held camera is in fact not shaky, and yes, there is still great cinematography. The people who claim otherwise haven't watched Polanski. And you know what? Aronofsky hasn't yet mastered that style. I hope he does in the future. The pacing definitely isn't as tight, though he clearly put effort into that. Yes, there are a lot of close shots, uh-huh, a lot of them are of Lawrence, and, yup, her body is treated like a gun is by John Woo. I wonder if that was decided upon before the director and start began dating. If you've watched 2 or 3 of his pictures, you should know if you are or aren't into his stuff. If you don't like artsy, this isn't for you. He woke up one morning, and this poured out of him. You can tell. This is a divisive film. The second half is, indeed, completely insane. Some will hate it. I, like others, loved it. And long before that, dream logic and surrealism run the show: if that bothers you, stay away, rather than complaining that the movie isn't realistic. Don't buy chocolate ice cream and get upset it isn't vanilla. The trailer told you as much. There's a ton of allegory... it's as if Darren woke up manic one day, thumbed through the Bible and underlined every single passage he thought would be compelling to put in this. Then you have a lot of events that are very current. This mix is... interesting. Many call it a failure. It could have been. In lesser hands, it would be.<br/><br/>There is a lot of disturbing content, a moderate amount of frequently brutal violence, and a little swearing in this.

"FargoUT","9","7","19","17 September 2017"," Aronofosky's allegorical spectacle is one of 2017's best films
","Mother! is a divisive, masterful allegory, and even after my initial viewing, I've been going over at least three different ways of interpreting what occurs over the two hours. No review of this can really be given without spoiling the film's story, since giving any details will reveal the nature of the beast. For those who would rather be surprised, avoid reading much on this before you see it.<br/><br/>Many people will be put off by the imagery displayed here, especially in the latter half of the film, particularly a visual representation of sacrament/communion in a very disturbing scene that is only shocking if taken at face value without acknowledging the inherent religious symbolism. For people horrified by this depiction, people consume the blood and flesh of Christ on Sunday every week, so maybe the horrified response is misdirected (I've often thought it bizarre that we eat bread and drink water/wine as a representation of eating Christ, and shown here hammers that home). Aronofsky mocks the absurdity of Biblical scripture, and perhaps those offended are merely protecting their religious beliefs. I can't be sure, although my gut tells me people simply missed the point, which is astonishing, as Aronofsky is not a subtle filmmaker -- he practically bashes the audience over the head with symbolism here. <br/><br/>When viewed from a metaphorical perspective, much of this becomes quite comical. This is quite darkly humorous at times, although the imagery makes it difficult to laugh over. A woman destroying a piece of the house mentions she wants to leave a reminder that she was here -- a very funny twist with shades of environmentalism and ecological warfare. There are several layers of meaning which Aronofsky deftly envelopes into a story of chaos. <br/><br/>None of the characters have names -- these are not characters, but archetypes. Jennifer Lawrence is very good as the titular ""Mother"", although she may the weakest part of the film's cast simply for having to play the thankless victim role. I don't imagine many others could have done anything different, although a warmer actress might have worked better for what is asked. Javier Bardem is great as always as the poet prone to writer's block. Titled ""Him"" in the credits (capital H) suggests his divine nature, but that is only one reading of his character.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer steals every scene she's in, going just this side of over-the-top, and Ed Harris is good as her devoted husband. I particularly liked the glimpse of his injured torso just before Pfeiffer shows up. Domhnall and Brian Gleeson (real life brothers) show up as the two sons of Harris and Pfeiffer (hammering home the Adam/Eve/Cain/Abel metaphor as one kills the other). And Kristen Wiig makes a surprise appearance as the poet's publicist. I'm not sure what Biblical character she is meant to represent, possibly a blend of several, or possibly missionaries?<br/><br/>Lastly, this is Aronofsky's showpiece, and his work is phenomenal. With an amazing sound design (Oscar worthy) and close-up, hand-held camera-work to retain the proximity with our heroine, Aronofsky is working on a whole different level than most filmmakers. We watch ""Mother Earth"" get pummeled quite literally at one point which horrified me on several levels -- we do this to our planet, and it disturbed me to see it portrayed this way. Certainly not a condemnation of Aronofsky, but moreso of humanity as a whole. We are not good stewards of this planet.<br/><br/>As an enormous fan of Aronofsky's Grand Guignol style of storytelling, I didn't know what to expect from Mother! I left the theater smiling just as those around me left shaking their heads in contempt (I overheard one couple say it's the worst thing they've ever seen). Perhaps they missed the point or, if they understood it, didn't like the depiction of humanity as greedy consumers of the world. I'm not entirely sure. All I do know is that I loved this film, and give props to Aronofsky and Paramount for producing this truly bizarre, outlandish spectacle."
"GettrEal","8","7","19","15 September 2017"," Mother! You had me but I never had you.
","From the start of the movie I had to make an effort to keep from thinking I am going to be watching a newer version of Rosemary's Baby. Even before that I got sidetracked by the Marquee which, for some reason, made me think of John Lennon's song, ""Mother"". Moving on back to the movie, the eeriness was immediate. Waking up was eerie. Glancing around the room, looking for her husband was eerie. Walking out the door, still searching, almost mechanically, the entire sequence was eerie.<br/><br/>So, off to a good start. Even better, halfway through the movie I realized I was still asking myself questions in order to get to the bottom of the mysteries that still were not clear cut. I am sure that Aronofsky was succeeding of keeping the story moving along so wonderfully. I found myself suspicious of characters and activities. That's all I wanted for now.<br/><br/>While Mother (J-Law) was obviously the main focus in the middle of all the characters, everyone else kept her and me moving through our strained paces. Little things like background noises and unfamiliar images were enough to keep our attention and me on the edge of my seat. I soon started to hate interruptions by new nerve rattling characters. Small gatherings moved in and out as did the characters. Brazen, brash characters driving her over the edge and me glaring at them with a deadly stare that I had to distract myself from.<br/><br/>Jennifer owned this. She was magnificent and yet, I felt so bad for her personally because her investment in Mother was obviously heavy. I saw an interview with her and Aronofsky in which they both described how much of a strain this movie was having on her. She had to break away from scenes to read books (or portions of) that helped bring her back to reality. I am glad she stuck with it but for her own sanity, I hope she doesn't do another Aronofsky movie or any other that requires so much from her. If you remember how Heath Ledger may have lost his life due to his in depth characterization of The Joker, you get an idea of my reference.<br/><br/>Aronofsky definitely got his money's worth from all the actors and the props. Nothing was wasted in this movie. Otherwise slight, background noises, character developments, shadows and lights figured in to make this a great scare-affair.<br/><br/>Getting back to my earlier reference of Lennon's Mother, there were a couple other songs that came to mind. A very raucous scene not long before the finale reminded me of Revolution #9 because of its mysterious incantations and mental images. And for a finale, take it as you will, the closer was wrong in my opinion and should have been Joplin's Piece Of My Heart. But no harm...magnificent movie.<br/><br/>Since I rarely go to horror movies, giving this an 8 is about as good as I can give it, and that's a great thing."

","In cinema there are two principal genres obsessed (and I chose that word carefully) with morbid content: pornography and horror. In the current line-up of pretentious filmmakers, perhaps the worst contemporary director Lars Von Trier has chosen to combine those genres with such morbid crap as ""Anitchrist"", but Darren Aronofsky limits himself to horror in this incredibly poor effort.<br/><br/>He succeeded in hoodwinking superstar Jennifer Lawrence, but most viewers will not be so easily swindled. The shaggy-dog narrative fits comfortably into a horror genre I enjoyed in the '70s, the modern version of the Old Dark House and Haunted House traditional genres in which a stately or decrepit mansion became the anthropomorphic protagonist: see for example ""The House That Screamed"" or any number of European and British productions of that era. Of course it all dates back to Poe and ""Fall of the House of Usher"".<br/><br/>But Lawrence IS in fact the house in question, not a real character but just a gimmick. We the audience identify with her and with the escalating predicaments Aronofsky puts her through, none of which are credible or even momentarily believable. Considered a great filmmaker, he actually uses a rickety, stagey structure here, with cast members suddenly appearing at the front door throughout, a hint that Lawrence is trapped in the house (she is the house it seems) and making their entrances as lame as a circa 1929 (or Silent Era) film adaptation of some drawing room comedy or drama play.<br/><br/>Casting Javier Bardem as her hissable, self-centered husband also helps to sink the project early on, as his behavior and unwillingness to support his wife on even the simplest or most obvious points is written off by his macho image and poor acting (like Aronofsky, Bardem is ridiculously overrated, a Kevin Spacey without the sexual aberration baggage). <br/><br/>Piling on special effects and trendy audience baiting red meat (cannibalism in a horror movie, anyone?) Aronofsky throws in many a red herring to explain the nonsensical action. Is Jennifer a ""Gaslight"" victim of a tyrannical husband? Is what's happening all just an imaginary figment of her crazy mind? Will we be treated to horror's crummiest explanation, that it was all a dream, with the requisite cliched ending of the dream starting over again? Is this a conspiracy by some demented home improvement company to get Jennifer to constantly order materials for repairing her abode?<br/><br/>No, it's just another garbage movie emanating during a decadent era of a once-mighty Entertainment Industry, made by a clown looking down at his audience, a practice popularized over five decades ago by Godard, who is turning out to be far more influential, in bad ways, than one ever would have prognosticated for the Nouvelle Vague innovator circa 1960."

"darkreignn","2","3","6","14 October 2019"," Incredibly pretentious
","I've been wanting to watch ""Mother!"" ever since I saw the first teaser trailer years ago in theatres. I had no idea what the movie was about because of the minimalistic tone of the teaser, but that intrigued me all the more. For one reason or another I missed out on seeing this movie in theatres, but that was probably for the best, because ""Mother!"" is one of the most boringly heavy-handed and pretentious films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>From start to finish, ""Mother!"" will lull you into a gentle slumber. Even when the happenings start to get wild and wacky, the film still seems to move along at a snails pace. It doesn't help that the goings on are completely unbelievable and utterly ridiculous. Look, I get what Darren Aronofsky was going for here. It's really not hard to understand what he was trying to convey through the visual medium of film, but it doesn't suddenly excuse the fact that at some point he stops telling a story and starts pleasuring himself all over the screen.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with religious metaphors that are beat over your head so much that by the end of the movie I wouldn't be surprised if you had a concussion. At first the religious themes are mildly subtle (as subtle as one brother killing another and then running into the wilderness can be), but by the final 30 minutes, all realism is thrown out the window for instead a collage of scenes that satirize Christianity, including the Catholic faith. And I don't have a problem with this; believe me, when it comes to Catholicism, there's a lot to criticize. But at least do it in a way that's not immediately noticeable and extremely blatant. I mean, the story stops so Aronofsky can throw in a million different critiques and references to Christianity, so much so that by the end he is basically remaking the book of Genesis.<br/><br/>Now I won't lie: there was one scene that actually made me gasp in surprise because of how suddenly the violence occurred. In a better movie, that scene would've changed the entire trajectory of the film. Unfortunately, because ""Mother!"" commits to being a metaphor instead of having a plot, the moment, while shocking, has no lasting impact on the viewer or the narrative. It ultimately serves no purpose, and neither does this movie.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I am a horror fan fanatic I have seen pritty much everything you can imagine and none of which has disturbed me including hostel and saw. This movie however has truly upset me. The director clearly has only made this film simply for the shock factor it made no sense what so ever. the abusive, manipulative, self absorbed man who the director claims to be god is just absurd. It is merely a film about the physical and mental abuse of a woman and no one not even her husband(him) cares. The scene with the baby is what has disturbed me the most, it was horrific and unnecessary. Why show such a horrid scene other than to upset the audience why would a person make such a movie? Why would he want to upset the audience. Jenifer Lawrence a great actress has belittled herself by accepting this role why would an actress accept such a horrific and disgusting role that shows the abuse of a woman and the murder of her child in the most truly disturbing way. This film was not made for enjoyment it was made simply to horrify people and and to make them feel sick. There is no logic no sense, to even suggest that this is meant to be in reference to the bible in any way shape or form it is an insult to humanity. I will give this film zero credit it deserves no credit no recognition and if I had my way I would destroy it so no other living human being could be truly disturbed by watching this completely disgusting film. The director should never be allowed to make another film. If you want to watch a woman being abused and demoralised and the murder and cannibalism of a new born baby then please go ahead. But this film to me personally is a massive slap in the face and insult to all human beings the fact that we accept and allow these films to be made and advertise and make us pay to watch such an abomination says a lot of about us as a society. Others may have enjoyed this film. Myself personally I will never give this film credit never speak of it to anyone it deserves nothing. I would not have written this review because it does not deserve to be talked about or written about.

","When I watched The Human Centipede I thought that I had hit cinematic rock bottom. Who would make a movie about a mad scientist who sews faces onto bungholes and then feeds the faces through the bungholes? Why did those three poor souls have to be sewn together into a centipede? Why did they have to suffer such a fate? Why was no one able to save them? Who would even make a movie like that? I wished that the end of the movie would be a cheap it-was-all-a-dream plot scheme where the mad scientist wakes up after having a nightmare about his aspiration to turn humans into a centipede after his failure turning three dogs into a dogipede. Alas, that wasn't the case, so I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with The Human Centipede because it was a disgusting movie with a ridiculous plot. But, a plot it had. I can't say the same for Mother. Mother is the epitome of sitting through two hours of Jennifer Lawrence grunting and panting and running around barefoot and then, when it is all over (thank God), you are left wondering what just happened. Among the things that make more sense than this movie are North Korea's foreign policy, flat earth theory, and the fact that Donald Trump's hairdresser still has a job.<br/><br/>To briefly summarize this....er, movie...I'll say that it opens with Jennifer Lawrence looking like she is in the Saint Barnabas burn unit. You then spend the next hour and a half watching Jennifer Lawrence watch Javier Bardem entertain strangers who watch Jennifer Lawrence watch Javier Bardem in their house while the strangers prostrate themselves before Javier Bardem. Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris randomly show up as...well, nobody knows who they are because it's never explained, just like pretty much everything else in this movie. Michelle tells Jennifer Lawrence that she needs to spice up her underpants wardrobe, Ed and Michelle boink in a guest bedroom, and then they leave. The movie climaxes with poor Jennifer Lawrence trying to kick pacifier-sucking electronica fans out of her house while being chased around by said electronica fans. The denouement, if you can even call it that, is ridiculous and is never explained. I know it doesn't make sense now, but don't worry, nothing will make sense if you decide to sacrifice two hours of your time to watching this debacle.<br/><br/>Instead of watching this movie, I highly recommend that you spend two hours trying to set a pile of bricks on fire with a cigarette lighter. It will be more entertaining and you will feel more fulfilled afterward. The two stars I awarded this fart of a film are for the sound editing."

Mother could be classified as a movie which has the most uncomfortable watching experience ,as well as, the most breathtaking one. 
The allegory in this movie is a beautiful work of ART. However, It does need a lot of time to grasp the idea and enlighten the metaphors. I personally thought Jennifer Lawrence did a good Job playing the ideal biblical woman, but was hoping for more rage when she became angry. The story could have been the ""best movie of the year"", if Darren Aronofsky(the director) briefly explained to the audience what actually happened because many people would not understand anything about ""Mother"" after finishing the movie. That is why I think only 50% of audience reviewers liked it. 
This movie is definitely one you should think long and hard about.

","I'm only giving this movie a 4 out of 10 because of the decent acting by Ms. Lawrence and Mr. Bardem. The script was really weak (it's no wonder, really, it was written in just 5 days!) and they tried their best to bring it to life, but it just... didn't work.<br/><br/>When you want to make something metaphorical, no matter if it's a movie, a novel, or even song lyrics or a poem, it has to make sense both from a narrative standpoint as well as a metaphorical standpoint. That is, even if the viewer, listener or reader doesn't understand the hidden meaning behind it, they'll still enjoy the content as it is.<br/><br/>This movie fails both in narrative and metaphor.<br/><br/>On one hand, it doesn't tell any story. After you watch the movie, try asking yourself, what did you just watch? Try to describe the story as a beginning, middle and end. Does it make any sense to you? Please, don't think about the metaphorical meaning behind it, just think of it as a story. What is the plot about? If you can answer that question, please tell me, because I can't. We have no idea who the characters are as characters themselves. We are only left to trying to guess what the author wanted them to mean and that's it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is obviously a metaphor for environmentalism... or at least I'm guessing it is because some things just don't add up. Is Jennifer Lawrence's character Mother Earth? Or is the baby Earth? Is Javier Bardem's character God? Yes? What about the house? Is the house Mother Earth? Then, who's the mother supposed to mean? Is Jennifer Lawrence's character the Holy Spirit, with Javier Bardem (literally) playing God and the baby being Jesus? It's just confusing. It's all bits and pieces and it doesn't match any religious backstory that I know of. Of course it's easy to pretend you understand the movie, but do you really? I feel like not even Mr. Aronofsky does. I'm not going to lie, it's a good idea for a story, but it just feels like a concept that never really came to fruition.<br/><br/>At least, for one thing, it goes to show that no one's a true genius. Just like George Lucas gave us Star Wars and Indiana Jones but also gave us Jar Jar Binks, Darren Aronofsky gave us Black Swan but also gave us Mother!. You just can't always win."

It is something more akin to what I would expect to see when attending the theatre. <br/><br/>If its cold outside and you are snowed in and you have read all your favourite books and can't make it out to some other form of entertainment then yes you could watch this.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of popcorn movies i.e 99% of other movies made for cinema then you really shouldn't waste your time watching this as it simply will not appeal to you.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that it has been wrongly advertised but whoever is in charge of the press releases for the picture has done a very good job with the material they have been given.

"moonspinner55","4","3","6","8 October 2017"," Apocalypse House
","Writer-director Darren Aronofsky's typically audacious and unnerving, though hopelessly demented and baleful psychodrama is sure to divide critics and audiences with its in-your-face amalgamation of sheer emotional duress coupled with violence brought on by panic and fear. The whole film is full of suppressed anger about to boil over, paranoia churning itself slowly in the gut until it becomes a crippling affliction. An isolated country house is being renovated by a married couple with hidden emotional issues; he's a famous poet suffering a case of writer's block, she's a giver who always puts her husband's needs ahead of hers. Mistaking the couple's home one night for a bed-and-breakfast, a man who claims to be an orthopedic surgeon charms the husband enough to be invited to stay the night; in quick succession, the stranger is joined by his aggressive wife and then by his two belligerent sons, whose angry altercation results in death. This is merely the first part of the story; Aronofsky gives us a bit of a reprieve midway wherein old wounds have peacefully healed, but it's just the calm before the next storm. ""Mother!"" has been called a religious allegory, its location representing the Garden of Eden and the wife standing in for Mother Earth herself. The rampant, heavy-going symbolism is already being debated, as well as the film's circular ending--but how is it as an entertainment? Aronofsky stumbles early with his script by introducing a central female character (Jennifer Lawrence) who--for the sake of the story--must be vacuous and shell-shocked. Still, turning feisty Lawrence into a human prop doesn't do her or the film any favors. This is the kind of idiot role lesser actresses than Lawrence might have turned down (the kind of part that lost people's interest in Renee Zellweger). The character of the wife must be paralyzed with an inability to jump into action if this plot is to unfold the way it does, and yet we end up not having any attachment to her or sympathy for her since she isn't allowed to be spirited. As the husband, Javier Bardem has even less to work with; he's volatile and irrational and narcissistic--all for the author's own sake--and we lose touch with him almost immediately. One might argue that's the point, he isn't meant to be likable--he draws strangers to him while rebuffing the one person who loves him--but all this is in the service of a mechanical plot which, in its very inception, is muddled, maddening and insipid--an apocalyptic nightmare with seemingly no boundaries. Aronofsky, who reportedly wrote the screenplay in just five days, is playing fancy-free with his own private set of rules. He's amusing himself by toying with viewers, but this could eventually backfire on him. If in ""Mother!"" the earth suddenly split apart and swallowed the house, that would make about as much sense as what does happen in the picture. Aronofsky is a filmmaker with great talent but no discipline, and ""Mother!"" is his folly; inflated with ego masquerading as imagination, it also showcases a nasty, bitter side which may be nothing more than contempt for the audience. *1/2 from ****"

","In an age frequently dominated by generic and banal movies, it is refreshing to see that such good filmmaking still exists. Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is not only the best film of the year, but it is also a timeless piece of art that will still be just as relevant for generations to come. ""Mother!"" is, at its core, a film about the endless generosity of nature taken advantage of by mankind. This film is packed with so much symbolism and so many layers of meaning that one couldn't possible begin to dissect it all in one viewing. The unorthodox style and brutal honesty of the film may turn some viewers off, but this is a very important narrative that we must not shy away from. Aronofsky is well aware of the fact that history repeats itself, and unless humans decide to take responsibility for our actions and stop the endless assault on Mother Nature, we might wake up one day to find that she has no more love to give.

It's not quite that easy to see how the connection evolves.<br/><br/>A couple of two very different characters, a lovely, younger, and a bit more compliant young woman is married to a sophisticated, more mysterious older man who casts a spell on her. She's hesitant to cross him, and though he supposedly loves her, we can see that the devotion doesn't really go both ways.<br/><br/>In the opening scenes, we see their relationship is at best tense, with her asking reserved questions, almost afraid to say the wrong thing. He looks tired bored, ""uninspired"", waiting for the new idea, the new ""spark"" to strike. This occurs when a couple comes in to shatter to pieces what little peace is in the house. It's a this time moment that I wonder whether the film should have called house, but then by the end, I realized ""mother!"" was after all a better title.<br/><br/>Things move slowly, as we see the dying man capture the writer's attention, and if he was barely paying attention to her, he's has now fallen under the spell of the newcomers. These multiply before we realize an invasion has come in after a tragic events, and any semblance of sanity and a sense of home is destroyed.<br/><br/>Jennifer's character eventually gets pregnant, starting the second act of the story. Once again, things get settled, and both the child creates some type of bond between them. He's also inspired to write a new book. What happens next is where things go wild. Mobs arrive, worshiping whatever word is written in his book. Fanatics go to extremes, leading to a warlike atmosphere, which could destroy everything and everyone in the home.<br/><br/>It's at this point where people are either say they like or hate everything that we have seen so far. There's nothing wrong with the performances, both Ed Harris and Michelle Pfieffer are dark and creepy, not a model family, in spite of having been together for a while and having two children. Everyone who wanders from the outside comes him with some type of darkness attached to them. People make passes at her, other violate their privacy, destroy or disrespect their surroundings. Truly, it all fits the whole; however there are bits that could have been executed better.<br/><br/>""Mother!"" is not a boring or particularly challenging film. It has big ideas, powerful sections, and overall it works, though it might not please all who see it."

","I wasn't going to review this because it's not a film that you can be ambivalent about - you're either going to get it (and by that I don't necessarily mean immediately twigging the whole biblical back story) or you're not. The acting is outstanding and the concept is stunning, but that won't make people like it. I'm hoping that the reviewers on here who thought that this was about a couple living in a house missed the beginning and either left half way through or fell asleep before the end... Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticising the people who don't like this film, but you need to accept that just because you don't like something it doesn't mean that it's bad and that everyone should feel the same way. This film doesn't exploit anyone, and it certainly isn't just another excuse to show violence against women - if you accept that it's allegorical and that mother and the house represent Mother Nature and the planet we live on then the violence makes sense. To sum up, a great film worthy of 10 stars but one that at least half the people that see it are going to hate. It's a pity there isn't a separate Oscars category for the most divisive film, this would win hands down!"

","mother! is written & directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Gleeson and Domnhall Gleeson.<br/><br/>A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. (18 cert; 121 mins)<br/><br/>As I'm writing this, it has been a few days since I experienced Darren Aronofsky's psychological experiment; mother!, yet the thought of this incredible film remains. I'm still working out the various allegories in my mind during day-to-day life, the impact of mother! is still felt.<br/><br/>mother! has received a lot of backlash from audiences since its release and I can understand why. It's a tough watch, in fact the first two acts are slow-burn, which means the average movie-goer will lose concentration. Don't let the negative reviews and underwhelming box office numbers put you off, though. this is a thought-provoking film and a very ambitious and brave move by Aronofsky. It isn't an invasion horror like the trailers lead you to believe, and perhaps that's where most of the backlash comes from. This is one of those films that will try to disorientate you, but after some research, it becomes a work of genius. Within its disturbing final act is a clear message.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence seems to be getting some heat for her acting style. According to the majority, she never changes the way she acts in all of her projects. Now, I could agree for some of her films, but in mother! she is literally put through hell. I can imagine it was difficult to bring these scenes to life, especially those in the final act, but she performs remarkably well and consistently throughout. I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with her. Javier Bardem plays a rather mysterious character, who disappears every now and then but reappears in the strangest way. It's hard to put into words how this film makes you feel when watching, but I'd stick to what I mentioned earlier about being disorientated. Javier has a hand in this feeling, and I think he brought a lot to the role. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are simply brilliant. Again, bringing a sense of suspicion that constantly gets weirder and weirder as the story plays out. The Gleeson brothers have fairly small roles but play quite an important part in the grand scheme of things. This is something to read further into after having seen the film. What I can say, though, is that they were a fine support act.<br/><br/>Moving on to the visual side of things; the house set looks stunning. We see it as it's being decorated and furnished by Lawrence's character, so there's a lot of details documenting this process. Part of why the house looks and feels so real is because mother! was shot on Super 16mm film. A format I will always highly praise for its extremely natural capturing of light and the grittiness that kisses the screen in the upscale. Utilising close-up, over-the- shoulder and point-of-view shots, Matthew Libatique puts us right into the story. They even went as far as to build the set so that the camera could move freely in a 360 degree fashion. We see everything as mother does, and that's something I really appreciated. Finally, the visual and special effects, though minuscule, were bitingly real. I can't, and won't, go into the specifics, but there are some scenes that felt too real. but not in the bad way. It wouldn't have impacted me the same way if they were handled differently.<br/><br/>This is usually where I'd mention the composers work on a film. But, seeing as there's no score for mother!, I'll talk about the sound. Composer JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson spent about a year writing original music for this film, but after test screenings, both he and Aronofsky decided against using the score. JÃ³hannson wasn't entirely out of the job, however. With his music being very ambient, he ended up working as a sound consultant alongside Craig Henighan to create the 'sound' of the house. There's the expected knocks and creaks, but it's when mother starts to break down that we hear sounds (such as glass) stretch out further than they realistically could. I found this really quite unnerving; a unique and interesting way to tackle sound design. That said, I would love to hear some of what JÃ³hannsson wrote originally, maybe a cut of the film with the score? Either way, mother! worked very well with its absence of score, I liked that as a viewer I didn't have something telling me how to feel. It all felt very raw.<br/><br/>There's really not much else to say. I've not experienced much else like it, apart from Denis Villenueve's Enemy back in 2013. Many people will say that if a film makes you search up the meaning afterwards, it's a failure. I respectfully disagree. I like to go deeper into the story, and I find it fascinating reading other people's theories and impressions. Think back to Donnie Darko, that still sparks conversation even after 16 years.<br/><br/>I think everyone should give mother! a go. Form your own opinions. It will always be divisive. People who love it will love it. People who hate it will hate it. This is the beauty of filmmaking. I'm in no way religious, but I found the concept simply brilliant and the execution, though disturbing, fantastic.<br/><br/>Verdict; A dark, disturbing psychological thriller that thrives in a mysterious tension. mother! is an exhilarating ride of biblical proportions.<br/><br/>mother! â€“ â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… (9/10)"

","'mother!' is the darkest film Aronofsky has ever released. I went to see this film with hardly a clue of what it was about. What I watched unfold in front of me was beyond anything I have ever seen on film. <br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, particularly Michelle Pfieffer as the Woman, and Jennifer Lawrence who gives what I believe to be her bravest performance to date as Mother. Keep in mind that the film is an allegory, so expect a hefty amount of symbolism throughout. I don't want to give anything away, but just know that the climax for this film is completely insane.<br/><br/>You will either appreciate this film for what it is, or you'll find it pretentious. Either way, one thing is certain: You have never seen a film like 'mother!'."

","Paramount Pictures deserves to be panned (and roundly) for advertising this as some sort of home invasion horror flick, as it is nothing of the sort. Our showing here in Gloucester had a sparse crowd of about 70 or so people, which works out to its poor box office returns.<br/><br/>The film itself is a huge religious and environmental allegory. Javier Bardem is ""Him"", the creative force stalled and wed to ""Mother"", the world gifted to him and currently barren, as she has to fuel his creation through inspiration. Him needs outside inspiration as well, and this is where Man begets Woman, and so on. It comes off as slightly pretentious, but it does work. We move through early biblical works and side warnings about humans lacking care for the environment, and then sashay into various commentaries about fame, fandom overrunning celebrities, people in general being callous and selfish and so on.<br/><br/>""mother!' takes a hard turn in its last segment, but you have been warned when Mother says she is going to ""prepare for the Apocalypse"", and that's what you get, in all its horror, violence, selfishness and degradation. Eventually Mother (Earth, Nature), is pushed to her limits and burns the whole area down, only to be rebuilt.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 7 for its use of sound (no music anywhere, just ambient sounds and natural sounds) and Bardem playing the creative, selfish force to a tee. Lawrence is an observant force, trying to preserve herself and ultimately vengeful when people destroy everything carelessly. The final sequence is absolutely incredible, covering everything from Abu Ghraib to refugees to riots to wars to dark religiosity and so on.<br/><br/>That said, this is NOT a movie that should have been released to the masses, but instead given a small, art house release. It was mislabelled and there is simply too much going on here to serve as popcorn fodder. On this point, I often felt as I was the only EATING popcorn from my high perch in the theater, and the sound was intrusive on the surroundings. Yes, really. See this movie with an open mind, bear in mind its intense religious allegories and go from there."

","If you love analyzing things, especially psychologically and philosophically then this is the movie for you.I immediately left the theater thinking I knew exactly what it was about and apparently there are a million theories on it, including a very convincing biblical allegory that the director leaked.I thought it was a metaphor of Narcissistic Disorder, similar to Black Swan, which he also directed. I would argue that the husband(Him), a struggling poet, is a case study in Narcissism and his devoted and codependent, pregnant wife(Mother)is a classic example of narcissistic supply. First of all, none of the characters have names. They are merely fans of ""Him"" and therefore, are all technically His supply, with Mother also being his muse. They have no identities outside of what their relation is to ""Him"". Mother realizes at the end that he never really loved her, he merely loved how much she loves and adores Him. She also feels that she gives and gives more, but that it is never enough.He admits that it never will be.Mother also points out that it's all about him. Mother spends the movie hovering in true codependent fashion, trying to control His environment so he can create His masterpiece. Mother is clingy and wants the narcissist's sole attention, even though she has it most of the time, as they are holed up in a secluded house together and he feels suffocated by her attention.Mother is beautiful and the cerebral-narcissistic husband wants nothing to do with her sexually. He rejects her repeatedly. I have to suggest that perhaps the title, ""Mother!"" refers to the narcissist's unhealthy attachment issues with his own mother, which is stereotypical of the disorder and has developed a Madonna-whore complex where he desexualizes his wife. Freud wrote, ""Where such men love they have no desire and where they desire they cannot love.""(Spoiler alert) In the end,""Him"", in true narcissistic vampire fashion, drains Mother of her life and discards her for His new supply, keeping his harem of ex-supply as a trophy in the form of a jewel. There are so many other comparisons.If you like to debate, you should totally go see it. I have to warn you, it is either a love it or hate it kind of movie, but I think it's kind of brilliant.I will admit that I spent most of the movie in a state of ""what the hell is going on?"", but if you want a movie that gives you a great conversation starter, go for it; otherwise, I'd stay away because you'll be disappointed."
"tasintsunami","10","6","17","23 September 2017"," Aronofsky's Masterpiece.
","Disclaimer: Darren Aronofsky is one of my favorite directors. With that said however, I am very critical of his work, simply because of the standards established by some of his films. He has once again established a new high-watermark. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the trailer for the film has resulted in a number of people thinking it's a simple horror film. And while it does share some characteristics of those films within the genre, it's not a horror film. I think the trailer is responsible for a lot of the negative reviews of the film. <br/><br/>A host of other negative feedback has been as a result of the religious allegory employed in the film. The film begins with Bardem placing a crystal in a display on a mantle, in a burned out house. When he does, the house no longer wears the scars of a fire. A burned corpse in a bed is revitalized, and Jennifer Lawrence awakens. In the story, Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence play a married couple, who live in a grandiose house. Bardem is a poet, who suffers from writer's block, and Lawrence is in the process of repairing the house after a fire. While not immediately known, viewers will soon arrive at the realization that Bardem is the God of Abraham, Lawrence is Mother Nature, and the house represents Earth. Across the early part of the story we are introduced to, albeit sans names, Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel. Aronofsky's also provides the viewer with the creation of Eve from Adam's rib, Eve eating from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise, and the death of Abel at the hand's of his brother Cain. Paradise, in this case is Bardem's writing room. After the death of Abel, family and friends gather at the house, and proceed to disrespect both Lawrence and the house. After such disrespect of the latter results in the bursting of pipes in the kitchen (The Great Flood), the family and friends leave. <br/><br/>The allegory continues in the second part of the film, with Lawrence's pregnancy. The pregnancy, along with the interactions with the family, inspire Bardem to finally breakthrough his writer's block. The subsequent work (The Holy Bible) further heightens Bardem's fame as a poet, as well as results in a plethora of fans seeking him out and visiting the house. All. Hell. Breaks. Loose. As Lawrence watches in horror, the house is overrun. As she scrambles from room to room, we are witness to the transgressions of humanity across history. (Wars. Genocide. Religious persecution.) Eventually Bardem finds Lawrence and both find safety in the writing room (Paradise). Lawrence gives birth to a baby boy, and asks Bardem to dismiss everyone from the house. He refuses. When Lawrence falls asleep, Bardem takes the baby to show to everyone in the house, where the baby is subsequently killed and then cannibalized by those in the house. After a struggle, Lawrence escapes to the basement, and lights the house on fire. With the exception of Bardem, everyone dies. The film ends as it began, save for a different woman in the bed. <br/><br/>The religious allegory is obvious and a little-heavy handed, although I've been involved in discussions of the film with people who didn't pick up on it. However, the film has multiple allegorical levels interwoven throughout the film. While I understand the ""attack on religion"" argument, I disagree with it, as I would suggest its nothing more than Aronofsky holding up a mirror to religion. But it's not just religion. It's a mirror for a patriarchal society. It's a mirror for willful ignorance. Ultimately though, I believe it's a mirror for a society that abuses the Earth. The religious allegory is nothing more than a convenient vehicle to drive home the message of environmental conservation. After all, Mother Earth is the protagonist for a reason."

","Mother! is a film that has been subject to a lot of criticism. Films that are a big metaphor or carry over an allegory are always subject to polarizing reviews. I believe this to be in part by many lazy people passing off half witted ideas as ""art"", which in turn leads to true art being dumped on. Mother! is not a film for everyone, it really isn't. You will either love the film, or leave confused and resentful towards it. This film is a metaphor for the bible, and the destruction of Mother Earth. Jennifer Lawrence is Mother Earth, her husband is God, Harris is Adam and Pfeiffer is Eve, while their children are Cain and Abel. The glass piece Bardem holds in his office is symbolic of the ""forbidden fruit"", which 'Eve' ultimately is tempted by. More people flock at the home until a party goer destroys a sink causing a leakage, indicated the flood that wiped out civilization. But after 'God' writes his new work, symbolic of the New Testament, more people retreat to the home. After a very disturbing and gruesome ending, the home is destroyed, just to be rebuilt again, showing the never ending cycle of the destruction of Earth. The ending is a doozy and as someone who enjoys horror, blood and guts - this will leave you emotionally shaken. I was borderline in tears by how utterly shocking it is. This is mainly a story about how we take and take from Earth, using up all its resources and hardly, or in some cases never, giving back to it. This film does a spectacular job of displaying not only the story of the Bible, but how we as a society are selfish, destructive and sometimes undeserving. This is without a doubt a masterpiece."

","I had no idea of the magnitude of what I was in for with this film. I went in knowing as little as possible. The trailers convey so little of what this is, and that's definitely for the better. It's one of those films that sneaks up on you and becomes something so monstrous, startling and impactful that you can't remember the last time a film struck you that way and you also might wonder if you'll ever have a cinematic experience like it ever again. It left me speechless for two days before I could review it.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence gives an uncharacteristically innocent and vulnerable performance here, one of her best ever. Javier Bardem is magnetic as her older husband. They live together in a secluded pastoral house when their privacy is soon encroached upon by an uncouth Ed Harris and an odious Michelle Pfieffer. To reveal more would be to give away a bit too much. Let's just say it builds into something allegorical in a way that you just don't see coming. I would argue the best way to prepare for this film is to read as few reviews as possible and just go in cold.<br/><br/>Out of respect for the squeamish and even those not all that squeamish, I will warn you there is a moment of undeniable barbarism near the end, and possibly the biggest reason this film is so virulently hated by some. But other than that, there is not much to be offended by. The work of this filmmaker is academic and metaphorical. Nothing is spelled out, nor should it be. It's a film that is open to several different interpretations, which obviously depend on what you find. Like I said, it's best to just go in cold and emerge with a foundation upon which to parse Aronofsky's stunning creativity that takes place here.<br/><br/>There are moments when the film's excesses might seem preposterous but once you understand that the film's events are meant to stand for something much more universal, the excesses are no longer a flaw but rather a detail that is captured in the filmmaker's sweeping, devilish brush. What humanity has done to the world and what its fate might be in turn, is the biggest question ever grappled with by Aronofsky. He has done it before but not like this. From a distance, this film might look entertaining but also conventional. It is considerably more than that. Bravely recommended to everyone and to the highest degree."

While the metaphor this film's story is portraying is hinted at throughout, it's only at the end where you get the meaning of this disturbing screenplay. And it blew me away. <br/><br/>Because of what the film's trailer is implying (that it's your typical horror film), a lot of this movie's audience will be polarized by the plot and conclusion. But it is more so a psychological thriller than anything else. The movie is very well acted, brilliantly shot, and excellently directed. One critic said that it was the most ambitious film to ever come out of as major studio, which is something that few directors could be trusted with. Aronofsky was the perfect choice, I will be looking forward to his future films. mother! deserves a 9/10, because it is a movie that intelligent film-lovers will analyze and talk about for years."

"jcdugger","9","11","38","14 September 2017"," Mother!...You wanna find hell with me...
","I couldn't wait to see Darren Aronofsky's new film, as I'm a big fan of (most of) his work. I thought Requiem for a Dream was a near-perfect film, one of my all-time favorites, 10 out of 10 on my list. The Wrestler and Pi were both very, very good, 9 out of 10's. And I liked Black Swan as well, 8 out of 10. The Fountain, I'm sure I just didn't understand it, I couldn't even finish it. And Noah was complete dogsh1t, if you want to know how I really feel. So where would I rank ""Mother!"" you ask? I'd put it in the Wrestler/Pi category, a strong 9 out of 10...this is a really good flick! It doesn't quite reach the heights (or lows, shall we say) of Requiem, few movies can, but this is one nice piece of art in its own right. It makes you feel so uncomfortable at times, you want to leave the room, but at the same time, you can't look away. This is a rare gem. <br/><br/>The similarities to Rosemary's Baby is obvious, you could almost say it is a love letter or a sequel to the 1968 flick. I'm not sure I completely understood all of the imagery and what was either religious or supernatural overtones, so I already can't wait to re-watch it a few times at home. The ending has a nice twist to it as well. Highly recommended to those who love good film.<br/><br/>By the way...Intentional or not, ""Mother!"" has a lot of similarities to the song of the same name by Danzig, at least that's what I read into it. (The song is never played or mentioned in the movie, nor would it even fit.) Watch the movie then read the lyrics though...it's wild to see some of the lines and how they match up with the movie. Almost makes you wonder if this song was used as some of Aronofsky's inspiration for the movie.<br/><br/>Great movie!...9 out of 10.<br/><br/>JD<br/><br/>(IMDB: please bring back the message boards!!)"

It shows how humans have spoiled the planet with their contradicting beliefs, religions, ideas and concepts and competition to satisfy their creator. There is an embodiment of Adam and Eve and their sons and how one of the sons killed his brother and became marked with that shameful crime. The house is the Earth and the Mother is trying to save that house from all the madness. The great thing is that you don't figure out all the symbolism right from the start.

","A lot has been said already about what the movie is about so without going into too much detail I will express my humble opinion. There are many possible lectures about this movie the obvious one is that ""Mother"" is nature, Him is ""God"" and pretty much nature destroys creation when attacked forcing God to start over again.<br/><br/>A second interpretation could be an insecure woman who tries to create a whole universe around her and his husband; but he is not happy in that confinement so she ends in her craziness she ends up destroying everything she cannot control.<br/><br/>I love movies that make you think; and the first interpretation is an ""ECOLOGIC"" one; but far from subtle. Aronofsky is not David Lynch; his metaphoric expressions have very little subtlety but he gets to the point (whichever it is).<br/><br/>The second interpretation; makes the movie the complete opposite to ""Rosemarie's Baby"". <br/><br/>Perhaps this is just a writer creating a story taking elements from religious symbols (Adam, Eve, Cain, Able, Jesus, Communion ) and failing to reach his goal.<br/><br/>Acting is very good; but the over use of Lawrence face feels too much. She is a great actress; but I do not think he was the perfect match for the role. Barden is great as always; he is one of the best and most intense actors around. Under using him is a real sin. <br/><br/>More screen time for him and Ed Harris should have made the movie fantastic.

","If we assume this movie is about the story of god, religions and the creation, The idea of showing how religions can create, expand and be used by different people using the example of a hilarious book written by a brilliant writer is a good idea.<br/><br/>However, to connect these two phenomenons together, some exact, solid, understandable and logical links are needed. in this matter, the movie was unbelievably awful. For example, we couldn't see how people went mad. maybe it was not important that why they went mad, but it was certainly crucial to find out how. People can't just get together in a house and suddenly decide to take walls down and steal the belongings of the owner. I mean yes, maybe people rush over each other to have a piece of a dress of a highly respected religious man but we know how that happens during history, we know they even get mad and kill for it but there is no logic when people of a modern society suddenly act like medievalists. leaving that for audience to guess is not smart at all, it indicates that the plot has nothing to fill that gape.<br/><br/>Similarly, How those leaders in the crowed came to be leaders, who were they? why them? and more importantly there is no need even for a man with the need to be worshiped by his fans to sacrifice his own house and family. Even if we accept based on religious stories the god did that(by sacrificing the greatest archangel), there was a disobedient on the table which was missing here. There was too many missing links and too many rushed conclusions without any logic to support them. Now, if we assume the movie to be about man and the nature relation and selfishness of man, we can't even find similarities in that case! And if it is just a dramatic thriller movie(which I don't think it is), it is a very awful one again.<br/><br/>I don't give it 1 only because of the general idea of criticizing the religious story of creation(the only possible reason of making this movie that comes to my mind) and the good performance of Jennifer Lawrence."

","Long-awaited ""Mother!"" is a challenging film. It's far more complicated and rich than the house-invasion horror-thriller it starts out as.<br/><br/>Despite having directed only seven feature films, Darren Aronofsky has become one of the most interesting and important directors of our time. Now returning after a shot at Biblical adventure-drama ""Noah"" (2014), Aronofsky delivers a film full of allegoric storytelling. The performances of Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are impressive. Aronofsky's screen writing and direction never allows the viewer to get away from the hellish nightmare that unrolls. Longtime Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique (who's worked with Aronofsky on six out of his seven full-features) delivers some exquisite cinematography that adds power and discomfort to the story. Having considered the movie after watching it, I've reached the conclusion that I need to watch again, as there's too much substance, and too much references, for me to grasp at a first viewing."

"yoyodyne2222","10","5","15","30 September 2017"," Step back and use your imagination.
","It's the story of the history of the world. It features a god who can do nothing but write, but recently can't even do that. It features mother (Earth) who provides the place where everyone, including the god, lives but is not respected by those who live there. And lastly, the humans, who are enamored with the god's writings but trash each other and the Earth from the moment they arrive. As they multiply, their atrocities towards others and the Earth also multiply while various religious people spout the words of the the god. We then get a nice walk-through of the worst horrors of the 20th and 21st centuries.<br/><br/>And as the world is destroyed the god does nothing to prevent it: ""It is just things"" he says. He doesn't care if things are destroyed. He only gets praised for creating, not protecting. Even after the son of god is sacrificed he tells mother that maybe some good can come of it. The whole thing culminates in mother, using oil she (or us) finds locked away deep underground, torching the place.<br/><br/>Or it's the story of weekend guests from hell, a self-indulgent artist, and his suffering, unassertive wife. Take your pick.<br/><br/>All the actors are working at a high level, but especially Jennifer Lawrence, whose every emotional state plays convincingly on her face. The cinematography and special effects are great, especially the camera following JL around from about a foot in front of her head and the sound/visuals during her labor contractions. <br/><br/>A classic."
"Polaris_DiB","10","5","15","27 September 2017"," Allegorical Descent into Anger
","Expectations and frame of mind matter, and based off people's reactions, I came into Mother! expecting something like my experience with Knight of Cups -- a visually arresting and self-involved film that I was mostly just glad managed to get produced in this Age of Marvel, but otherwise didn't care for and wouldn't need to see again. I did not go in expecting to 'like' this movie so much as respect it.<br/><br/>Instead, I loved it. I enjoyed almost every minute of it. It's pretty much the sort of experience I look to cinema for, and the sort of experiences that are the reason I'm into film in the first place. If movies like this didn't exist, I would mostly stick to other media.<br/><br/>I think there are legitimate criticisms of this movie -- I personally didn't like the ending, largely coming from a place that I disagree with Aronofsky's beliefs in a cyclical universe (that he showcases in The Fountain and Pi as well, so I know it's his thing). But that disagreement comes from the statements he was making, rather than the fact that he was wrong to attempt to make them.<br/><br/>As for what that statement is, if it isn't clear earlier, it's transparent by the time the frog bounces out from the blood-dripping wall that we're in allegory logic, the space where characters are types of energy and cause-effect is metaphysical as opposed to any sort of Newtonian rules-based system. The topic of that allegory is about as much about motherhood as Finnegans Wake is about a funeral; it's a reworking of the Bible the way Finnegans Wake is a reworking of Genesis; it's a rip-off of Rosemary's Baby the way Finnegans Wake is a rip-off of Tristan and Isolde; and it's a criticism on the egoism of fame the way Finnegans Wake is a criticism of alcoholism. Let this statement not stand as a comparison of QUALITY -- Finnegans Wake is incomparably better a work than Mother! -- but I use the analogy because too many negative reviews of this affix their criticism to only one track with complete dismissal of the others. But the whole is larger than the parts.<br/><br/>Where you go from there is a largely angry, exasperated, and fearful mood piece about the self-destructive and bestial behavior of human beings, with a question mark as large as the titles exclamation point about why God lets all that happen, and finally a bittersweet and sort of hopeful / cynical exhaustion over the idea that it all renews to happen all over again. Take from that what you will and experience the rest for yourself.<br/><br/>As for entertainment value, after decades of engaging on the subjects of tastes, entertainment, and escapism, I've learned I'm more at a loss than anything at understanding why brain-splodey headshots, squiddy toilet monsters, and cult rave raid battles fail the spectacle any more than space wizards, superheroes, and murderous clowns. I enjoyed just watching the movie, I didn't have to analyze it to fill the time of experiencing it. I have nothing I can offer there but vague platitudes about the unaccountability of taste and something about target audiences. If it's not your thing, I know I'm not going to convince you.<br/><br/>But there are two arguments against this movie that are invalid.<br/><br/>People are complaining that Mother! is too 'stylized.' Mother!'s camera is a forced perspective -- just to the side of POV (of which there are a few key shots punctuated about), the visuals of the movie reside entirely in the peripheral vision of the main the character. This isn't too stylized, this is something ONLY CINEMA CAN DO. You don't get that uncanny feeling of something just out of your vision in any continual protracted sense from any other medium. If that's forbidden from cinema based on your arbitrary rules of 'style', then cinema ceases to have anything interesting going for it. One reviewer who liked it quite a bit mentioned ""It makes you desperate for a wide shot"". Who else felt desperation? The main character.<br/><br/>People are complaining that Darren Aronofsky is pretentious. If only more directors were pretentious, so that we'd get these visceral experiences that sent the audience I was sitting with (sold out show, post-bad reviews and flopping news) cringing, gasping, groaning, gagging, and eventually tumbling out onto the street talking about it -- love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Pretentious is a movie designed only to sell toys claiming some universal meaning because it follows the beats prescribed by Joseph Campbell without reading the book to learn that the format is only the capsule -- meaning is the capsule's filler. Stylized is a movie throwing three layers of lens flare and grading firmly orange teal to avoid laying bare the overcoverage that allows the producers to undercut the director and DoP. Mother! was a movie made by a person's decision to risk it with a personal voice. I'd rather watch movies with a voice I hate than a movie lacking voice at all."

Believe me this is not the worst movie that's a big stretch. Is it because they didn't understand it? No I won't say that. it's totally fine if you didn't enjoy it, the movie is disturbing and it has some pretty graphic imagery. It's not something you'll want to go to a Sunday matinée with your mom or take someone on a date to. I have to shout at whoever did the marketing for this movie because I saw a horrible trailer for Mother! during my screening of IT and I thought ""Wow what a sad trailer"" It kept using fake quotes like THE SCARIEST MOVIE YOU""VE EVER SEEN! They've already alienated the Horror audience because those people who loved IT probably went to see this and got something completely misleading. Someone convinced me to go see it and I just said bring it on. I was not prepared for what I watched. This movie is a ride, and it had me almost the entire time. I wanted to hate it so bad for it's in your face, constant use of close up shots and directing choices, but it was all done for effect and I appreciated that by the end. I was also afraid the message was too forced, and that it may have been too pretentious, but the more I think about it the more I start to like it. The performances are engaging, and it really evoked emotion out of me I was honestly surprised. I kept grabbing my seat and squirming from how uncomfortable and uneasy I would get from certain scenes. Aronofsky, whether you like him or not committed to his vision and put it on film. He had all these feelings about the world and knew people were gonna spit on his movie, yet he took the chance anyway. You might enjoy this movie if you don't figure out the big truth too early. If you figure it out too early you'll feel like it's beating you over the head with it. If you're like me though and you just let it take you for the ride, you might enjoy yourself. I recommend not looking up any spoilers or information because it really does add to the experience if you end up enjoying it. And if you don't like it, you won't resist talking about it. You can't deny this movie will provide fun discussion for weeks regardless if you love it or not. You know you did something right when your audience is split and it gets them talking about it. Not in Zack Snyder DC Comics kind of way either. Form your own opinion give Mother! a chance and join the discussion!"
"CineMuseFilms","8","5","15","17 September 2017"," an audacious absurdist masterpiece of political and religious satire
","Art cinema and genre film are often regarded as opposite ends of the movie spectrum. One flaunts filmmaking rules, the other depends on them. When they are blended, the result can be confusing, challenging, and very refreshing. The film Mother! (2017) is an example of a filmmaker deliberately provoking audiences with a multi-genre exploration that defies labelling. Calling this a horror drama does not even come close to describing the way it ramps from a story of domestic abuse to home invasion, demonic possession, messianic madness, and then explodes into a supernatural fantasy of biblical proportions. Be prepared for a wild ride.<br/><br/>Talking of plot wrongly implies that the film's narrative is based on logical progression whereas it feels more like a never-ending nightmare. It's held together by imagination not logic. We meet an unnamed couple in a sprawling isolated country mansion: Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young home decorator, and Him (Xavier Bardem) a famous poet whose writing has, like their sex life, dried up. One evening, two people arrive unexpectedly: Man (Ed Harris) is followed later by Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and soon the couple are making themselves at home, much to Mother's discomfort. More people arrive and violence erupts among the strangers. The house is cleared, the sex life and poetry resumes, and fame returns. People line up to hear Him speak and the crowds keep getting bigger. Mother becomes a captive in her own house as her tummy swells with new life while the crowds spill into every room. They revere the ground on which Him walks, hang off Him's every word, and souvenir anything they can carry while she is in fixated panic at the disintegration of her world. The crowd's adoration turns to greed, then carnage, while Mother gives birth in a full- scale war zone compressed into a house. The new life is shared among the hordes as the apocalypse descends. It's totally crazy.<br/><br/>The originality, absurdism, and audacity of this film are breathtaking. It makes more sense if viewed as a montage of interconnected visual metaphors, loosely assembled according to taste. There are clues that help decode its possibilities. For example, being nameless renders the cast into avatars for universal stereotypes, so the film is not just about a house full of people. History is littered with belief systems and their damage to humanity, while the birth is Mothers' single unifying power that is ripped from her arms in an horrific Biblical allusion to 'feeding of the masses'. The score is virtually non-existent, allowing natural sounds free reign to create a mood of Gothic claustrophobia. The camera-work pulsates with hand-held rhythms and variable depth of field that isolate different planes of psychological and physical reality. The constant camera close-ups on Mother's face or over her shoulder assumes her viewpoint and makes this a feminist experience of a 'man's world'. The casting is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence's youthful Madonna face becomes a powerhouse of depicted terror while Xavier Bardem's turns into a stencilled visage of divinity, a self-absorbed messiah.<br/><br/>Whatever else it may be, this film is also a masterpiece of political and religious satire. Completely unbounded, it can be taken as a weird horror film or read as a meditation on gendered existentialism or an absurdist parody on the saviours that arise in every society throughout history. It is also completely here and now: when Him survives the dystopian chaos that he has created, ask yourself: who does he remind you of?"

","Before going into the movie, I had a seen a review saying that the movie is very polarizing and you'll either end up hating the film or loving it. I find myself in the ""loving it"" camp. The same review had also mentioned that Darren had given a press release explaining that this was his fever dream in response to climate change deniers and what not. And I think having that preface did help. I think if you go in thinking this is just some standard, twisty horror film (which the trailers do kind of make it out to be) then it would be easy to go ""What the heck is going on"" especially when the second half goes balls to the wall crazy. Knowing the whole film is this allegory helps to connect the dots and pick up on things.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is stunning. Because the film is so divisive, I don't know if its going to be much of an awards contender. But in the very least I would love to see some noms and wins for cinematography, production design, special effects. Jennifer Lawrence also gives a tremendous performance. And...wow is it ever a brutal performance. They really put her through the ringer.<br/><br/>One negative I do have though is that the film doesn't settle on one tone. The first half is more subdued. It still very much has a thriller vibe, but its not very in your face and the second half (as I mentioned earlier) is just absolutely dialed up to the max. It almost feels like with the snap of a finger the entire tone changes.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the film was really interesting. And it was thought provoking. For sure, I don't think the film is going to be for everyone. There are some scenes that are quite shocking to watch. But for me, it was so different than a lot of films out there.<br/><br/>*I tried to keep my review as spoiler free as possible.

","I've seen a lot of criticism of this film - mostly from people who seem to take the goings-on literally, as if its a standard home-invasion thriller that goes 'incomprehensibly artsy'. Its clearly an impressionist piece that certainly makes a very strong impression - and among all the other bland and horrifically boring films out there, its beyond me that anyone could bash Aronofsky for going against the grain. <br/><br/>The script is subtle and effective. If you have any leanings towards feminism and concepts of gaslighting, male dominance, gender inequalities in relationships, then you'll squirm with how effectively the layers start to build. There is no let-up - it builds, and builds, and builds, until it pushes you completely off the edge. It ties it all to themes of circular causality, how primal instinct struggles to ever find its place. <br/><br/>I got so caught up in the central characters frustrations that towards the end, there were moments that had me in tears, where I actually wanted to sob. I can't say it was a pleasant experience, but I applaud Aronofsky for doing something different. <br/><br/>If I have one criticism, is that Aronofsky's approach is very masculine, in terms of how visceral and extreme he takes it. I'd loved to have seen the same ideas explored by a female writer/director. My fear is that some of the points and ideas raised about male dominance will be buried and distracted away from by the more extreme moments and eventual climax.<br/><br/>Overall though, a great film, with excellent production design, camerawork and sound design."

From some of the '1 star' reviews I read I personally feel this is a harsh review, i have seen some bad films but it would take a lot to give it 1 star. I will be completely honest while watching the film and even at the end my thoughts were 'I have no idea what just happened' I did then once I got home spend some time googling the plot, some would say 'if you need to google a film to understand it then it can't be good' others may say 'if you kept thinking about it that much you had to find out more, it must be good' so I will leave you to your own opinion. I however after watching a film love reading about it after and I will not say what I found but it did clear everything up and then made me enjoys the film more. Although the film itself is confusing without understanding it I was constantly engaged through the whole film and was left in suspense completely throughout.

I personally feel that we are now moving towards a new genre of horror, how many more poltergeist movies can you watch? I have now seen a couple movies which are not the usual 'horror' genre and I am glad the horror setting is changing, every person will view things in a different way which I like.

"PyroSikTh","7","4","11","19 September 2017"," After Attempting to Explain it to Strangers, their Blank Expressions said it all
","On the surface, Mother! is a movie that meanders around for the first couple of acts, not really doing or saying a whole lot. Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with Him (Javier Bardem) alone in the country in a nice big house. She spends her time renovating the house, while He spends his time trying to find inspiration for his next great work. One day a stranger (Ed Harris) appears and He invites him in, much to Mother's annoyance. The next day the strangers wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) appears and starts causing trouble. Their squabbling children (Brian and Domnhall Gleeson) arrive, there's a murder, and more people start to invite themselves into the house. It escalates and escalates until it reaches the most bonkers, surrealist climax that lacks any logical or narrative sense. On the surface, Mother! is extremely hard to digest and understand, because on the surface, it literally makes no sense. The climax is without logic or realism.<br/><br/>But Mother! is not a surface-level movie. It's not the straight-forward psychological thriller the marketing made it out to be. To explain requires MASSIVE SPOILER WARNINGS. The key to unlocking the mystery and surrealism of Mother!, to ensure that that bizarre climax makes any semblance of sense, is understanding who Mother and Him are; who they represent. Mother is mother nature, the binding lifeforce of the Earth. She maintains the house and attempts to turn it into the perfect paradise to live. He is God, the almighty, the biblical omnipotence, crafting works of words and relishing love and worship lain before him by his followers, who he invites into his world freely despite their destructive, corruptible nature. Once these keys are in place, it unlocks the rampant symbolism the movie is filled with. The stranger becomes Adam, the stranger's wife becomes Eve, their squabbling children become Cain and Abel, the secret room becomes hell, the broken sink becomes the great floods, his works become the old and new testament, Her baby becomes Jesus, the rave becomes Sodom and Gomorragh, the publisher (Kristen Wiig) becomes Islam, and even this feels like I'm just scratching the surface. There's so much in the movie to unpack and rearrange.<br/><br/>But to truly tap into Mother!'s surrealist genius of concept and execution, you realise the biblical allegories aren't even the end of the themes and messages the movie attempts to convey. Every scene, every moment, every action by every character serves a symbolic purpose. One level deep it's a biblical narrative, from Genesis to Revelations. Go deeper still and you find themes relating to environmentalism, feminism, the creation of art, and abusive relationships.<br/><br/>All that said, the third act is just completely bonkers. I can't even put into words how off-the-wall, batshit crazy the third act really is. It loses all sense of subtlety and narrative cohesiveness in favour of rampant, down-your-throat symbolism and metaphor. It completely spoils the surface-level enjoyment the movie could have enjoyed had it reigned it in a little bit and kept just a little more realistic. Instead we get Mother scrambling from room to room into ever-increasing amounts of WTF; from an open warzone in their living room, to cack-handed references to Global Warming, to women in cages being raped, to a full-on riot between anarchists and police.<br/><br/>Even as I woke up this morning, Mother! managed to stick with me. I'm not even sure writing all this out has helped me to unpack what I witnessed last night, and I feel my opinion is mired by the experience still being a little too fresh. Aronofsky doesn't care if you cheer or boo his movies, as long as you do one or the other; as long as it causes enough of a rise in you that you feel compelled to tear it apart or applaud it, the movie is a success. Love it or hate it, there's no denying Mother! was successful in that regard. It is a movie that will not be forgotten any time soon. It has people talking about it and discussing it, and will continue to for quite some time.<br/><br/>For me, I feel more positive towards it than I do negative. The allegory, particularly early on, is well-handled, and it's complex arrangements of multiple themes and messages surrounding this allegory is nothing short of genius. It's just a little let down by it's final act that throws narrative cohesion out the window, in favour of a montage of surreal situations seamlessly stitched together in an escalating fashion. It becomes a blunt force trauma to the head of symbolism that lacks subtlety or nuance. I wouldn't say it feels out-of-place because the whole movie builds up the sense of weird, right from the opening sequence of the burning house being restored, but I feel it didn't have to go full bananas - deliberately alienating mainstream audiences - to get it's point across. I give Mother! an imperfect 7/10."

It's about the struggles of the disparate but necessary aspects of a -single- mind trying to create within the confines of contradictory elements within it, and the challenges faced in repeating that process. As such, it does its job very well.<br/><br/>This movie is a comedy in the Greek sense, in that the artistic process runs through its calamitous paces to be reborn anew with hope for new creation in the future. In this way, it is a very hopeful, inspiring film.

","In this world if you buy fruit and it is rotting you take it back for a refund. If your new phone breaks..same..refund..and so on. Only with films, music, plays, concerts or mainly anything 'creative' or 'art' based do you pay your money without some form of guarantee. Cinema going, D.V.D and blue ray purchase are expensive interests and there are more of us poor people than wealthy. Movie piracy is the only guarantee those with little money have against the multi billion dollar film industry if a film turns out to be 'not' as advertised or in your opinion crap. 
 'Mother' in my opinion is an astounding film..I have not been affected by a movie so deeply since at age 16 The Exorcist scared me senseless ( not long after leaving the Catholic faith I was it's targeted audience ). I am 52 now and maybe Mother hit me so hard due to my Theology degree and my Catholic upbringing. Not 'getting' this film does not make people stupid and getting it does not make you intellectually pretentious..firstly this film was misleadingly sold as a horror film..it is NOT A HORROR FILM. If i had opted to watch this instead of 'IT' I would have been very annoyed and felt cheated. This in my opinion is why people do illegally download and in this case I understand why. 
 A friend recommended this to me..it has been out awhile. I knew about it but I let the critics argument sway me away from seeing it... Mother is a totally personal experience. At one point a fan of the poet says ""I feel these words were written especially for me""..and the poet says they are. Rather like the scene in John Lennon's Imagine where he speaks to a fan who has been wandering in his garden. Mother is a completely subjective and personal film written for all of us..some people will hate it and others will praise it. Like life it is up to you to make what sense of it you can."

Though there's a birthing scene toward the end of MOTHER!, as there is in the final half of STAGECOACH, the Advent of Darren's Baby is a tedious exercise in the use of heavy-handed religious symbolism by way of comparison. And while MOTHER! probably has more peep-holes and voyeuristic themes than PORKY'S, they come off as totally sophomoric and lame-brained when put up against the thrills of that Campus Classic. Probably Earthlings would be much better off in the long run if we all sacrifice a few bucks and send the stimulus-deprived Mr. Aronofsky video disks of cinema masterworks such as STAGECOACH and PORKY'S.

","This might just rank as the worst movie I have ever seen. I get the ridiculous amounts of allegories, but the director completely fails to provide any kind of point or moral lesson. It's a story with no takeaway.
The movie has two parts, split by the creation of the poem. The first part is probably the better part. It makes the viewer uncomfortable, as the house is invaded by strangers. However, the allegories towards the creation of man do not seem to actually serve any purpose, other than to explain the roles of the characters in the second part.
The second part clearlh intends to shock. However, it fails to do so entirely. The escalation is so sudden and so extreme, it immediately disconnects the audience from the movie. Any immersion, any suspense is immediately destroyed. This leaves you watching an absurd movie, almost comical in how silly it is. I have never felt so unengaged and bored watching people eat a baby, and that's saying something.
The cyclical ending removes any point from the movie. Apparently, everything you saw, all the horrors, the destruction, the baby-eating... it's just the circle of life, it's normal, it has no consequences at all.
Ultimately, you're watching strangely visualised biblical allegories, with some other religions strewn in a little. It leaves you unsatisfied, and wondering what you could have done with those 2 hours instead. Build a gingerbread house maybe, that'd give me more fulfillment than this movie did."

In the perspective of the Earth, which is represented by the house in the film, humans are very disturbing things and I started to be in agony why humans have to exist. I really got shocked after watching this film. However, I thought the film could get better if the symbols were less outright. Despite the film has some flaws, the film was strong and gave me a strange feeling after watching it."

"hhard","9","0","0","6 January 2020"," Certainly unique.
","This movie has me thinking, months after watching it. It certainly is unique, well directed and shocking. I emphasise that last point. Sometimes I wonder whether stuff like this should even be made. I wonder when something has gone too far. Maybe mother! did just that. I'm not sure. From a technical perspective this movie is a 10. Great acting, excellent directing and intense pacing, adding to the uniqueness (the constant focus on Lawrence's character's face, and the lack of a soundtrack, certainly does make for a unique film). But then there is the brutality and grossness used to get the message across, which it does but at what cost? Sure it's a piece of art but it's kind of sick. This film really hit hard with me. It really is a great film and anyone with a pretty strong stomach and a decent perspective of life it's a good watch and might make you think. It's definitely not boring. It's probably a really good film, I just don't really know what to give it. Well, I mean that a tv the end of the day it is a movie, a story, a piece of artistic entertainment. Enjoyable perhaps, moving maybe, 'makes you think' is great. But in a world with so much negativity I don't know if the extent of this is fully necessary. Maybe it is. Maybe mother! has to be shocking and gross to get the message across, so many movies are. I honestly don't really feel right giving it a rating because it seems different to a lot of movies I've seen. I'm only 18, but really like movies, and this one has stuck with me more than anything really. To be honest I'm really just giving it a rating as a form of cataloguing the films I've seen as I venture deeper into the wonderful world of cinema, not that I would soon forget 'mother!'. That being said, technically this film really seems special, morally, I'm not really sure. Anyway, it's a 9 from me."

","I get some of these allegories, including the biblical ones. Mine is Nietzsche's eternal return. One knows before the very end that the crystal is the essence of the Man's eternal return. And that the Man is coming back, and that the fire started everything in the first place. To Nietzsche, the question is always not whether one actually returns eternally, but whether one would live such a life as to want to do it over and over again. Well, why wouldn't the Man? He does absolutely nothing while the Mother cleans up after him, after all of his messes, and after all of his invitee's messes. And those messes are enormous, but the Man never lifts a finger. The Man feeds off the adoration of the public and the Mother but has nothing to offer other than his words which do not feed, quench thirst, or provide shelter. The Man is happy and narcissistic and has all of his needs fulfilled. Needs for love, needs for adoration, needs for a home, needs for immortality through procreation. As usual, what does the woman get out of this? Pain and heartbreak. But she keeps on picking up, and picking up, and repairing. When one woman wears out and enjoys the peace of death, another is right there to take her place. Just like any other abusive relationship."

"Cinemagoer77","3","0","0","26 July 2019"," Watch this from an allegorical mind.
","You must view this film as an allegory completely and not from a real stand point. Look for the meanings behind every item, set piece, and character. He is God, Mother is Earth or Nature and you will start to see the entire allegorical telling of the bible beginning to end from Aronofsky's mind. Mother is creation personified. For the overall point of the movie, keep in mind, Mother is the protagonist for whom we are to sympathize with. The entire adam and eve (a pretty stone was the apple), cain and abel, flood happen symbolically then He develops writer's block but winds up writing the new testament eventually symbolically it's poems. People keep showing up like He is a celebrity so much that it hinders his relationship with Creation. Keep in mind there is a reason the writer chose to use this nature between He and the visitors and why it is told this way allegorically. The visitors even cause disturbance as to hinder He from his Creation to the point that Mother has to literally shut them out of her presence. There is like 20 minutes of humans acting up. Away from the mob, Creation gives birth to a son behind a closed and blocked door.
The baby is Jesus as strangers are frenzied to see her new son..He tells creation the people need to see the baby despite her fear of them. (shouldn't this be Mary?) He winds up taking the baby to some strange room with mostly unquestioning human beings. They wind up passing the baby around as Mother finds them and you hear the baby's neck break, killing him. If these are Christians, christians didn't kill Jesus in the bible, accidentally or not, the Romans delivered his crucifixion execution. The symbolism meaning doesn't match the bible if you ever read it. Mother hears this and is frantic for her son and barrels through the seemingly brainwashed people until she comes to an alter where the baby's carcass is found. She sees the crowd eating the baby's remains. I assume this is Aronofsky's view of the catholic tradition of the bread eaten as the body of Christ. So mother become's angry enough to start slicing people up for killing her son. So Creation cared about one person? Not He or anyone else? If so what is the meaning? But we get that Christians and He don't care like a non-religious symbol does. ..They wind up turning on Mother, and beating her. None of this allegorically even makes sense lol. God's humans are now beating up Mother. I felt this was odd and could not see the allegorical meaning and how those scenes fit into the bible allegory. Word is this was meant to be earth's inhabitants polluting the world so I guess Aronfsky just threw that in there and made them Christians lol. He tells Mother the people should be forgiven. Mother is distraught and winds up going to a place that will burn up everyone and ignites flames burning all including the house, except He. Mother awakens and is burnt up. He is there caring for her but she had enough of being used by He, exclaiming He never loved her. What's that Aronofsky biblical God is a narcissistic fan loving being? Remember Mother is the protagonist not He. Anynow, He is saddened briefly as Mother wastes away turning to ash. He digs into her chest and pulls out a stone (the one similar to before that got eve and adam kicked out of the house (eden) and places it on a mantle as the incinerated house is renewed again. He is just powerful this He. The screen fades or some other technique is used and we see another young woman or Mother all over again. Which you have to ask why heavily in allegorical tales? So why does He do this all over again? He is self serving narcissist. If Aronofsky read the bible, this new Mother won't happen like that..or is aronfsky saying you can't trust the bible book doesn't matter now * sigh If only Aronofsky was better of a worldly artist since he is so darn artsy his atheism didn't shine through. He seems devoted to twist the bible book to fit something in his own mind. Remember Noah? It was worse than the bible book..if you think the flood story is crazy aronofsky went crazier. What was the point to that movie? the use of allegory required a purpose..to give it meaning..so watch it a few times and realize this one man's view point. Those saying it is open to interpretation it almost isn't because the why comes up ..why the He and creation relationship dynamic, why the believers are a nuisance..those have meanings..some of the symbolism is used incorrectly..creation not Mary gives birth to Jesus ..ok so then why? Eventually allegory makes sense. Someone said this is art, well art is made for anyone to enjoy..When you look at a picasso, you see different things but no reaction would mirror this comment section. It is not a smart person's movie either. Allegory tales can change people what does this do? this movie is bold but it has no long carrying meaning for the world. A smart film if you don't like christianity wouldn't be this one. Watch an evolution video it is similar but without the blatant disregard toward specific humans beings on this planet. 3 stars for acting..and some of the sets."

The wonder diminished slightly by the increase of intensity. If Jennifer Lawrence's face bothers you, then don't bother. (This film is predominantly her face or the back of her head.) It is because of this, that it may be considered by some, to be her best performance to date. Javier Bardem invites you in, placates convincingly before inviting you right back out. His range emotionally provides more layers to the why cake. To try and describe this film to a friend once finished, will take a mastery of the english language.

","In no specified location, a seemingly happy young woman resides in a large country house with her husband where they live in tranquility, until the arrival of a mysterious couple. Though the guests are mildly pleasant and affable, there are indications that something just isn't quite right...the discovery of what that is will be an experience that viewers are likely never to forget. Director Aronofsky clearly favors extreme close-ups which are effective in creating a palpably tense and claustrophobic atmosphere, before eventually spiraling into an ugly, interminable abyss of madness and despair. Bardem, Harris, and especially Pfeiffer are all convincing, but this is Lawrence's show and she gives the kind of gut-wrenching performance that echoes the very reaction of the audience. Fluctuating between riveting, confusing, and downright appalling, the gamut of emotions on display here are simply exhausting, but buried somewhere beneath all the mishmash and chaos are some poignant allegorical themes...deciphering them is not a task everyone is likely to embrace.

","Firstly, I want to start off by saying this movie was very confusing and chaotic. Movies are supposed to tell a story that the audience is supposed to be able to follow and understand, or at least tie up any confusion in the end. This movie was so chaotic and messy, that the writer of this script had to explain the elements after the movie was released. Even then, his explanation was still messy. For someone who is allegedly an atheist, how can you say this movie is based off the characteristics of God? In no way, shape, form or fashion was this even close to the nature of God. This writer puts out these movies to deceive many by putting out his interpretation of the Word, then wonders why so many people are confused. He needs to just stop making movies like these.

","Its ok to have a movie that its weird, sometimes inscrutable and different. Movies like these have surprised and shocked the public for years, but, with time, end up becoming classics because buried under all this seemingly random madness there was a strong idea, a coherent vision and a lot of talent. Of course I am speaking of movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and definitely not about movies like Mother!<br/><br/>Mother! tries to be smart and symbolic like good movies are, but the weak script and the poor, obvious ideas and metaphors behind it all just end up conforming a film of low intellectual quality.<br/><br/>Yes, we all understand its a metaphor of the Bible. The problem is that creating a good metaphor in fiction is difficult. It cant be obvious. And it has to be woven in the story in a way that it doesnt conflict with the overall idea of narrative. In other words, it needs to ""make sense"" with the story, the characters, etc. Thats part of the art of it, of the craft.<br/><br/>And Mother! doesnt have any of that. Aronofsky chooses, instead, the easy way: ""Just lets throw this metaphor here and see what happends.

","I loved the metaphorical storytelling. Seeing Javier Bardem as God and Jennifer Lawrence as Mother Earth but visually represented as husband and wife told so many analogous stories at once. Bardem's depiction of a writer tortured by lack of inspiration and Lawrence as a homemaker rebuilding their world. You see such a symbiotic tranquility and disproportionate adoration in their relationship until man played by Ed Harris and woman's Michelle Pfeiffer intrude on the garden of Eden. Chaos ensues shortly after, which metaphorically represents how mans' population increase on Earth led to things like jealousy, violence, theft, pollution, and the destruction of natural resources. People long praise the writer/creator for giving them a place to worship Him but tear it apart and disrespect his wife, Mother Earth as they worship Him. I loved Kristen Wiig's cameo appearance of the writer's publicist and her representation of the church. This modern, metaphorical and literal translation of the Bible is genius and I would not only recommend but I'll watch again today because it's just that good. Some people will absolutely detest this movie because of it's literal interpretation of some of the more morose biblical themes are hard to watch. However, the reality is it's hard to watch because it's the first time the story of the Bible has been told through the eyes of God's first creation, Mother Earth."

","It was Thursday, when I suddenly decided to watch the movie ""mother"".
I already knew Darren aronofsky mostly from his best one ""requiem for a dream"" ; and I also knew that I must expect something big in this movie, so without any mindset and background about what I'm going to watch i hardly dragged myself into it. It's always been hard for me to watch a new movie and have a new experience.
I don't wanna lie but after watching about 30 minutes of it i got so sick and tired of continuing it, it got worse and worse and I just wanted to stop and turn it all off but something inside told me that it's almost over and hang on just a little bit.
Honestly during the movie I was in agony.
Finally it finished and made me feel relived; so after watching and before rating it I decided to give it last shot and read a review about it to see what it was all about so while I was scrolling down the reviews and looking at the stars I faced with one who's been given it 10 stars, I got so curious of how this person saw everything complete in this movie and gave it 10 stars, so I started to read
and all of a sudden paradise has become materialized in front of my eyes and I released what great a masterpiece I had just taken for granted.
""The ultimate peace of art""
At the first glance looking at what Darren did in this movie isn't so obvious and comprehensible it's about a man and a woman and some unexpected irritating gusts without invitation , it goes on and on and things will become more and more weird ,bombing, stealing, preaching and on and on, you just don't understand what's going on in this crazy house !!!! but there is an interpretation for all the events in that house and that is bible,world,disaster, God, and Mother Nature; therefore due to all the phenomenal
Philosophical matters which has been delicately shown off in this movie I strongly suggest you to read bible before watching it. Because without that knowledge this movie will get completely meaningless for you."

","Hmmm... well, this was...interesting? It is definitely an experience. Mr. Aronofsky is most absolutely the most psychotic director of our time, period. If you are a true fan of his, this movie will probably be on your repertoire, and you will end up liking it, more or less anyway. However, the second half of the movie is downgrading. The first half, is immaculate, a fastidious build-up, and then it just started going downhill from there. It was half-baked, the point, or rather the metaphor didn't stick, didn't hold up. He had it going for him regarding the idea, the goal, but when it came down to plot development....yes, lackluster much? It was of course disappointing, because this movie had and has such potent and perfervid potential, and it was such a shame it didn't live up to its full potential. I also didn't get the movie at first, I don't like that in movies and their directors, where the director and its cast and crew are the only ones who can comprehend, interpret and fathom the true nature and aspiration of the film, but I have to hand it to him, he knew what he was getting into when he had decided to take up on such a contentious, controversial and debatable issue: religion; which we all know is a very touchy subject for all. Mr. Aronofsky went overboard with the latter half of the movie, I think it was because he got carried away with the messedupedness, and trying to overdo himself, that he lost it, his train of thought of what the innate, inherent goal of the movie was in the first place. Jennifer Lawrence was astonishing, particularly and especially in this one folks. I was amazed by her sinuous and avid performance. She gave me a mature, adult professionalism in this film, that now I feel high reverence for her. She did not come to play, and you can see that she took this role seriously and gave her best. To sum up, in my opinion, the movie was overall good, despite it addling and discombobulating me a lot of the times throughout its runtime. I would definitely recommend it to avid watchers, who are looking for something thrilling and different. But do not have high expectations, because then you will be disappointed due to the fact that they will, most probably, not be met."

We did need something new on the table and this film provided, but it has a lot more going for it than its shock factor. <br/><br/>Much of the audience finds the religious imagery used too indulgent in the artsy fartsy - but the retelling and reshaping of these classic stories go hand in hand with the emotional core and messages of the film, which becomes increasingly tense. This film may be too intense for some to even sit all the way through, but the layered themes and storytelling will provide one much to think about after the viewing.

I have been waiting a decade, for him to make a film, that would rival requiem, and mother is the film he had to make.
And the film Jennifer Lawrence's agents wished she did not make. Aronofsky uses his influences, but never steals. Mother puts aronofsky in a rare position. Making art within the studio system, and never compromised. The mainstream will never be OK with people eating a baby. Thank you for an excellent film, and introducing Hubert Selby Jr to me. Subversive cinema hits every note, Lawrence won't make such a dangerous film again in her career. And you won't see a baby getting eaten at Hoyt's cinema ever again. Mother reminds me, film is awesome, and aronofsky is one of the great american filmmakers in the industry. My one dream is aronofsky makes another Selby film. The only director who could successfully make last exit to Brooklyn, does anybody know who owns the rights to Selby's the demon, it would make an awesome stand alone sequel to requiem for a dream.

","I finally got around to watching this, not sure whether I was going to like it or not. For reference, I go for big, well-made action movies and good crime thrillers as much as I'll like an intense drama or surrealistic piece like this one. So I never really know. I don't care about genre; it just has to be good.<br/><br/>I've liked all of Aronofsky's other films, except maybe for Noah (too much animal CGI and it was forgettable).<br/><br/>mother! is not a film I'll forget. It was like watching someone's dream.<br/><br/>In the beginning, I thought this was maybe a ghost story. Mother can never leave the house. She feels its beating heart when she embraces the walls. Similar to ""The Others,"" I thought maybe she was a ghost and didn't know it, but I wasn't sure how it was going to work out. Anyway, that wasn't the direction it took and not what I thought for long.<br/><br/>There have been some great reviews on here, sussing out the allegory that is mother! to be about both religion / creation and relationships. I've read some great theories that the film condenses Judeo-Christian monotheism - Him (Javier Bardem) is God, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is nature, and the guests (Ed Harris and Michele Pfeiffer) are Adam and Eve, their warring sons Cain and Abel. <br/><br/>I have to admit, while I definitely detected religious overtones, I didn't glean anything that specific, but I agree with the reviewers it's there.<br/><br/>The other theory is that this film is a relationship parable. A study in two people coming together, trying to start a life, have a child. Maybe so, but I think it's so much more.<br/><br/>By no means have I read all of these reviews exhaustively, but I haven't seen either of the theories that were so acute in my mind while watching. One, that this is a parable about the creative process. Aronofsky is, after all, a writer, and there is an autobiographical element here. To be an artist sometimes means to be selfish, to take from others what you need, to shut them out, to take inspiration where you find it, even if it isn't fair to your loved ones. When you consider the fragility of the crystal, the preciousness of Him's workspace, his distractedness and self-concern, this film comments that making something, while wonderful, is a fragile and emotional and tempestuous thing. It is a little bit of hell to go through to get to the promised land.<br/><br/>As the film progressed, inasmuch as I felt the creative process parable shining strongly through, I also perceived a brilliant commentary on humanity, something universal; we destroy what we love. After ""Him"" finally completes a new poem, fans show up at the house and grow in numbers to swamp the place, become mindless devotees tearing everything apart. Their love for Him and his work devolves into decadence, then chaos and destruction - the people bring about an apocalypse.<br/><br/>Certainly this theory dovetails with what others have said - that this is an environmental statement, or this is religious / biblical. The ending, for me, is telling, since the selfish artist wants to start all over again, full fell knowing the hell through which he puts his muse. <br/><br/>But that's just me. Like ""Him"" says about his poem, the words mean something different to everyone. That could be commentary on the Bible bearing multiple interpretations and spawning religious sects. It could be a comment on art, how beauty lies with the beholder. It could also be a comment on the film itself, that we each will see it how we see it, and there's no wrong or right in that."

","There is a lot to like about this film. The performances are wonderful, and I usually don't like Jennifer Lawrence at all. Javier, Ed Harris and the rest of the cast are all delightful in their absurd way. The cinematography is breathtaking. The symbolism is a bit much though, and in the end, where the film fails is story. Is it about a would be mother so controlling that she lashes out at her husband, a famous writer, who she thinks is neglecting her? Is it less in your face, and about how we self destruct ourselves with wanting pride? Is it how we destroy the earth, as some other reviewers have stated. I for one, do not believe it has anything to do with mother nature, since we are never in nature, and never see it destroyed. All that is destroyed are things, we, humanity create. Therein lies the problem, it is not clear, and I hate films that leave it up to the viewer to decide one what it is about. As an artist, regardless of our mind, and our want to create something that says what is on our mind about how we view a particular subject, WE MUST make our vision understandable to the audience as a whole so that it can be understood, appreciated and hopefully applauded. Great art is one that transcends boundaries, needs no major explanation for the mass majority to get its meaning. This film could have been something a bit more, if it in itself knew what it was."

"stevebj","8","0","0","20 September 2018"," Strange and bizarre, but thought provoking.
","I wasn't very interested in Mother! when it first came out. I remember the trailers never really grabbed my attention, and I hadn't heard much about it. On top of that, the only previous movie I had seen from the director was ""Noah"", and I didn't like that very much. So, I never saw this movie when it was in theatres. Recently though, I watched a review for the movie, and I realized that a lot of the audience for the movie was torn between loving it and hating it, and that really intrigued me (Some people even hated it so much that they left the theater not even halfway through). I had heard there was an interesting twist at the end, and that the movie wasn't what anyone ever expects, so I finally decide to give it a shot.
The movie revolves around the main character, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), and her husband (Javier Bardem), who is a famous poet working on his next piece but has a bad case of writer's block. One day a stranger claiming to be a doctor shows up at the couple's home looking for a place to stay, and against Mother's wishes, the husband insists that the stranger stay with them. From here on out, the movie essentially gets stranger and stranger as a series of bizarre events unfolds, each one being even weirder than the last (I'll leave it vague to not spoil too much).
At the surface, the movie may seem completely random and strange, but underneath all that is where a lot of heavy symbolism lies. And actually, a lot it is pretty on the nose if you are willing to pay attention to it. The movie is essentially a retelling of the bible through the eyes of Mother Nature. Mother represents (you guessed it) Mother nature, and her husband represents God. Unfortunately, I had already heard from a friend before seeing the movie that Javier Bardem's character represented God, so I was able to catch on pretty quick when watching it. I think for me though, I really enjoyed going into it with some kind of direction.
Overall, the movie was very interesting from start to finish. There were never any parts where I felt bored and I'm certain that has to do largely with the way it's filmed (the camera is constantly looking directly at Jennifer Lawrence, or over her shoulder), and how each section of the story is depicted. Once you catch on to the story being a re-telling of the bible, you can feel like it's predictable, like you know what's going to happen next, but the director always puts a strange twist on how its represented (albeit even demented, i.e. the death of Christ). The movie has a sort of dreamlike feeling to it in how the events of the story can feel random or sudden, and once learning the director wrote the screenplay in a surge of inspiration over 5 days, I think its clear why that is. That's not to say that the movie feels rushed, incomplete, or shallow, in fact I think it's the very opposite. I think because it was written during a surge of ideas, the movie brings up a LOT of interesting things. It feels like there was a lot that was trying to be said. Whether the director did a good job of that though is kind of left up to the viewer. I definitely was left thinking after the movie had ended.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone. I think it takes a certain kind of viewer, and that shows in the over-all reception for the movie. But for those that think they might be interesting in something like this, a movie that doesn't hold your hand and has strong symbolism, I think most will probably love it."

It's unbending fidelity towards being metaphorical, combined with it's inability to quite perfectly work out the kinks of that metaphor, and it's habit of taking it's self so seriously makes this a movie that would be perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to lampoon. The whole thing hovers precariously on the precipice of total ridiculousness but in my opinion manages just barely not to go over the edge into farce.

","This is one of those movies you are either going to love or hate, me, I loved it. Although this was mostly marketed as a horror movie, it really isn't, or not in the traditional sense at least. The film has a real art-house feel to it, being not only visually interesting, but using angles and closeups to create a feel that is just as tense as it is uncomfortable and it fits the tone and plot perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence is of course the main focus of this film and although the performances by all the actors are really good, she does carry this film, at times actually giving it the feel of a one woman show. If there is one thing that did kind of bother me, especially in the last 30 minutes or so, is how on the nose the symbolism becomes; I mean by that point anyone not kicked by a horse would have figured out what was really going on, but I really didn't feel it was necessary to spoon feed the viewers that much. That aside though, great movie, I was thoroughly entertained throughout; definitely won't say it's for everyone, but if you have a taste for really dark, artsy and thought provoking films, you will definitely find a lot to love about this movie."

"punisherversion1","7","0","0","6 September 2018"," What it's like to go insane
","Mother!:
Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Darren Aronofsky's work. I love The Wrestler and I was moved by The Fountain and was blown away by Pi. I was excited to see this movie on that basis alone. I wanted to venture into the movie theater to experience it but I was unable to. I had to wait. During the waiting period, I got a plethora of thought pieces and opinions on the movie. The director himself even went out there and explained everything that this story symbolized. I really wish that I hadn't known this. I almost wanted to come into this film cold. I might have been better able to grasp onto the story better from the beginning. It allows me to know what to look for when you first get into this movie. It gives you very little to go on in the beginning and that is a necessary thing. This movie feels like you're going insane along with the Jennifer Lawrence's character. <br/><br/>The main thing to understand is that this movie is designed to be experienced but not necessarily thought over. The camera is fluid and stays with Jennifer Lawrence the entire time. You experience these events through her eyes. It is utterly confusing and eventually becomes insane and horrifying. You can't take your eyes off of it. This movie starts off as a sweet drama between a husband and wife. The wife wants nothing more than to spend time with her husband and fix up their idyllic house in the woods. The husband on the other hand wants to write and create and bask in adoration. This takes on a life of its own as her husband ignores her and the chaos that begins to ensue around them. The house starts to fall apart and you are led into madness as the house starts to tear itself apart. <br/><br/>It does take some getting used to in the beginning. If you don't want to allow this film to wash over you and roll with the punches it appears to be sharing, you will find things to pick apart as this is not a traditional narrative. You don't learn anything about the characters other than the basics needed because it's not necessary for things to work. They wash over you and pull you along. The confusion is part of the process. When her world goes to hell, you're experiencing it right along with her.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, everyone is fine. They're given cyphers to play and we imbue what we want to with him. Jennifer Lawrence is very meek and mild in the beginning but eventually the hidden rage comes out. This movie is a genuine mindtrip. I'm not sure I can watch it again. I don't think I would get much out of it in that regard. I can recommend it but my recommendation comes with stipulations. You have to be okay with a movie being something you flow with. Be prepared to be confused and be okay with that. Give it time and it works its magic. I give this movie a B."

Acting is top notch. Mother! IS atmosphere, settings and sounds. Music spoiler: no suspense music at all. Only one song can be found in this movie. It fits. This movie does not need any reinforcing Jaws themes. It is a journey into the unsettling reality of a young woman. Well done. Something different.

My understanding solidified as the film progressed, punctuated by eureka moments and exclamations on how creative it was. I was sadly off the mark. However, after reading Aronofsky's inspiration for the film and other interpretations, I have come to the conclusion that we all were right.<br/><br/>It's about creation.<br/><br/>Whether it be Art or Man. The process is the same.<br/><br/>Watch it... Be patient and you won't be disappointed. Or maybe you will... But you will do exactly the same thing I did.

","The movie was well written for the most part. Once I made it to the end I realized what she meant when she asked if she was going to lose him. I can see how some can be satisfied by the ending but I'm not. I'm a bit confused cause when the first intruder came and he was explaining how he got the crystal from the house burning down Jennifer Lawrence's character seemed to know the truth about it. But then at the end she seemed confused to who he was and what was happening till the last second when she told him to take her love. The writer really made me feel frustrated for her! There was several times I wanted to scream at the screen and shaking her for not leaving him or knocking the crap out of everyone! I was really happy with all of that but I was expecting a real twist at the end. Not really sure what but just feeling pretty disappointed on how it ended. I should give it a 5 out of 10 because in all the visuals, suspense, characters, and writing was really on point.... just when you watch a Jennifer Lawrence movie, you kind of expect a more powerful ending. I get the message the writer intended, and if I knew what to expect for the ending before starting, I'd probably be more ok with it. I wouldn't take my low stars as a reason not to watch. Everyone has their own way of seeing things and one can see this movie and storyline very powerful as it does have a message. I never let a bad review keep me from checking it out myself."

Superb acting from Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence.

","I personally am not familiar with most of the religious references some people claim but can hardly explain. I had to read a handful of long reviews to understand the parallels; yes I now see that this is heavily influenced by the subject, but no, that's not the whole point and I think most people are judging from the wrong perspective. This is more, yet so much less (which is not always a problem).<br/><br/>I personally loved the chaotic 2nd half when everything ""picked up and went to sh*t""; it's like riding a roller coaster in the dark-you know something's coming and it sure did! May not be what you anticipated or the right timing, but after going through hell and back, you can proudly say ""THAT was SOMETHING""!<br/><br/>I see it as an exaggerated tale that intertwines magic with reality about an abusive relationship-a fairy tale if you will. 
I picked up right away that the couple WANTS DIFFERENT THINGS, which is one of the most common problems in a relationship that some will compromise (Mother) and some will ignore (Him) until it's too late. He envisioned a different life; he wants fame and life under the spot light with her as merely a tool he couldn't navigate without, while all she wants is a simple life with him. You can put this story under any age and context, with or without the craziness, and still makes sense.
The second thing I picked up is that he seems to be able to manifest his desires through the house; it's as if they're in some sort of metaphorical battle to see who will rule the house which represents the life they (supposedly) want together, with the girl constantly losing control by being a pushover (sad, but true in an old ""silenced wife"" sort of way). He wants to live passionately-drama, excitement, inspirations, the struggles and everything that comes after fame, eventually losing himself and the control over his fans-while she wants none of that, which forces her heart to shut everytime she pays close attention to the house (the life they built together) as he abuses her.
At the end when she can't take it anymore, her only option is to end her life and all the chaos (killing her husband as a revenge is just a bonus). He, who thought he can have it all, ends up with nothing and finally questions his self worth, but with her dying glimpse of love, he reassures himself and restarts the losing game.<br/><br/>Honestly I was hoping the story took a different direction, in which she's a schizophrenic who's fallen onto the verge of insanity (hence the meds) from a seemingly normal, yet deeply wounding relationship, in which nothing past the sex is real (Who wakes up certain about pregnancy?) but she kills herself at the end anyway, ending both dead. Or they can use that in conjunction with the magic crystal & god-like analogy of a man who may carry some guilt for the death of his ex-wife, yet still go about his life repeating the same mistake hurting others along the way..."

About the movie:
I LOVE the environmental message here, it's genius!!! And I'm not exaggerating. Maybe people who go around killing animals for sport and throw their trash in any water source should be made to watch it! They need to see the pain in Mother's eyes and how she becomes helpless so she has to kill her own self.
God is again portrayed as someone not likeable, like almost everywhere (thankfully not in supernatural). His ego is so big and he's lost in his own brilliant mind. Last scene with the baby was wow so terrifying and gross.

I feel like the director had his start and his finish planned out and believed he could throw anything in the middle but still wrap it up neatly.

","While not described as a mental-health drama, I couldn't help notice so many parallels with people suffering from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Narcissists crave drama, chaos, and adoration.

In other words, this is what it's like to live with a Narcissist...<br/><br/>More generally, the wild ride was very surprising (it starts slowly and becomes progressively more manic) and I also was not expecting it to become so surreal.

","Mother! written and directed by Darren Aronofsky is a rather less than self indulgent art designed piece. The first half is surprising and rather good as watchable although we are wondering what the film is about and what's going on but the second half (around when ""mother"" becomes pregnant) is a chaotic, indulgent and eventually rather disgusting mess.<br/><br/>Aronofksy unsettles us from the start with a shot of a woman apparently burning to death. Then he dazzles us as a derelict house is brought almost magically back to life before our eyes.<br/><br/>It is here than an unnamed young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her significantly older husband (Javier Bardem). Their agreed division of labour is that she will restore the house while he writes. But he's blocked and can't write a word. Their idyllic-looking relationship in this idyllic-looking house is beginning to crumble.<br/><br/>Mother! is a strange film but things apparently just happen without any plot or sort of reason. First people barge into the house where we see Jennifer Lawrence's character having any sense and wanting them to leave, but Javier Bardem's character thinking that everyone who enters are fans of his (as they mention he is a big ""writer/poet"" of some sort) as he seems to be more of a push over and doesn't care that people (especially towards the end) are destroying his house. What made little sense and was bothersome is the lack of names. What we don't get is why no one asked for their names.<br/><br/>Mother! isn't as deep or bold as some claim, at parts it is quite unique and watchable to see chaos happen but in the end, we are left with wondering as to what the point was. Also featured a lot of close ups with clear camera focus, especially towards their facials."
"cameron_straughan","8","0","0","23 June 2018"," The troubled marriage between God and Mother Nature
","I understand there's been a lot of discussion and speculation regarding what Mother! is about. For me, having just watched it on DVD, it is perfectly obvious that the film portrays the troubled marriage between Christianity and Mother Nature. In the film, God (Javier Bardem) is a self-absorbed poet who quickly - proudly - writes the bible and gathers overzealous followers while Mother Nature (Jennifer Lawrence) is neglected, ignored and made to suffer, despite the fact that she is always working in the background. Along the way, there are allusions to Adam and Eve (in particular the ""apple""), Cain and Abel and the seven deadly sins. <br/><br/>The film is very effective, although a bit too obvious at times, as it sets about clearly demonstrating how Christianity has lead to widespread, thoughtless and ultimately self-destructive environmental devastation. In particular, the film portrays humans (God's creations, and intruders in Mother Nature's home) as above nature, detached from nature, conquers of nature and beyond reproach. This is demonstrated in the horrible way that God's ""guests"" treat and speak to Mother Nature, and the complete lack of respect they have for the home she is working so hard on. Nature, on the other hand, is portrayed as dark, foul and disturbingly mysterious; it is something to be immediately changed according to human needs and whims. For example, some guests suddenly start painting the house while others lounge and roam wherever they like. Emphasis is placed on receiving immediate forgiveness for any sins against nature; God continually defends the guests' actions, while Mother Nature can't believe what she is hearing. Having worked in the environmental sector for eight years, and studied culture and environment as part of my Master's degree, I know that Christianity has a lot to answer for when it comes to caring for the environment. <br/><br/>As you can tell, thoughts and reflections flooded in, as I watched the film, despite being under duress. I had to return the DVD before the local library closed. I kept checking the time on the DVD player and then glancing up at the clock; I was cutting it close. I kept thinking to myself that if I didn't start to get into it, I could turn it off and return it before I received a fine; I wouldn't miss a thing. However, I stuck with it. I got the feeling that Aronofsky was going for a Buñuel -style social satire with deep religious undertones (bringing to mind Viridiana and The Exterminating Angel, in particular). While I could see some similarities in intent, Aronofsky's approach was much more obvious and at times over-wrought; he lacks Buñuel's subtle, dreamlike intertwining of reality and surreality. <br/><br/>At times, I lost patience with the film, but was compelled to keep watching. As an autistic person, I found the sound design frustrating - even painful. That high pitch whine occurring whenever Mother Nature takes her yellow ""painkiller"" sent me diving for the volume control - in fact, I almost stopped watching. I believe the repeated consumption of yellow substance, coupled with the noise pollution, was meant to symbolize the slow poisoning of nature brought on by the arrival of more and more uncaring guests. Despite challenging both my senses and my patience, the film slowly drew me in and did something rare for a film these days - it made me think. While watching, I was making all sorts of connections and comparisons, theories and conclusions, as I worked to figure out the director's intentions - which slowly revealed themselves. <br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I found the ending deeply satisfying. History forever repeats itself and God, much like his foolhardy creations, does not learn from his mistakes. Over all, I thought the film was essentially a darkly surreal, Reader's Digest version of the Bible. The fact that I felt passionately impelled to write something about Mother! immediately after watching it really says something - and, incidentally, the DVD was retuned on time."
"shakercoola","6","0","0","23 June 2018"," Atmospheric drama engulfed by outrageous surrealism
","Mother! is a phantasmagorical horror about a self-centred writer, and his young homemaker housewife, who live in seclusion in the countryside. The film progresses by way of a home invasion with the husband's consent. It succeeds for an hour as a kind of filmic explication of anxiety and dismay, builds good tension and atmosphere. There is a human centre which sadly vanishes when further layers are added: abuse, black comedy, surrealism, and in the end it is either perceived as unwieldy and obtusely indulgent, as I found it, or enjoyable for its sheer violation of usual conventions. There isn't an onscreen chemistry between Jarvier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence - they are not believable as a couple, but each perform well, particularly Lawrence who does well as the shrinking violet, playing against type. All in all, Mother! is a thought-provoking and original story about mysogynystic violence but it hould have left black humour at the door."

"dmvalentino","8","0","0","19 June 2018"," Aronofsky's Fallible God
","Mother! landed with a giant thud in 2017, at least at the box office. Critics reviewed it generally favorably. Even half the public who saw it rated it positively, though they might not have liked it. And it's easy to see why viewers might be put off by the film. It starts off as a hot, confusing mess. You also might interpret their dislike as a comment on the film's seemingly critical portrayal of major organized religions, given how it depicts God's creation and His imperfectability and stubbornness in going about trying to get it right for all eternity. For that's exactly what this chaotic film is all about. With religion as context, you can make sense of the film from the beginning the very first time you watch it.<br/><br/>Now, as caution, what follows explains the film in the context of a religious interpretation, and doing so tells you what happens in the film. If you haven't yet watched mother! you might want to do so before reading further, or not; the choice is yours.<br/><br/>In the film, the writer (Javier Bardem) represents God. He has written the world into being, the house. Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), who you might regard as mother earth, mother nature, etc., busies herself maintaining God's creation. While she does, she awaits God's further creations. It's been a long time since he as written a poem, producing tension in the house. In his writing room, which is off limits to mother, he has an object, a crystalline artifact; it has great sentimental value, as it seems to represent something that came before. <br/><br/>Eventually, Adam (Ed Harris) and Eve (Michelle Pfeiffer) show up. Adam comes first and the writer invites him in as if an old friend, to the discomfort of mother. Eve follows. There appears to be discord between the two, and they are very bad about obeying mother's house rules, which involve no smoking in the house and no going into the writer's room. They violate both. <br/><br/>In the writer's room, they admire the crystalline object, but through carelessness, they drop and shatter it. Then sets off the destruction of the house, creation, and all those within. For it's now that the house begins filling up with people, the first two of whom are oldest son (Cain, Domhnall Gleeson) and younger brother (Abel, Brian Gleeson). Younger kills older over an inheritance dispute. Mourning, and more people, follow. Eve taunts mother about her not having children. She, in turn, accuses the writer of neglecting her sexually, which he remedies immediately. <br/><br/>The next day, she announces her pregnancy. Overjoyed, the writer finds the inspiration he needs to complete his next great work (the scriptures). People receive these with great joy but read into them what they want to hear. Acrimony ensures in the now overcrowded house. Mother gives birth (son of God). The writer shares the child with the people to mother's great horror. They worship the child but also tear him apart and devour him (communion with God). <br/><br/>Finally, amid unbelievable turmoil and conflict among the people, the house catches first, reducing creation to ashes. The writer comforts a scorched mother and extracts her heart from her (the new crystalline artifact). Mother awakens as she did at the opening. The house and the surrounding grounds are restored. The creation begins again (presumably to devolve in the same fashion as all the preceding times).<br/><br/>mother! has been billed as a horror film, which it isn't. You certainly might find much of what goes on horrifying, as you probably find what happens daily in the world horrifying. But most wanting to watch a horror movie expect to have their socks scared off. mother! isn't that kind of movie, and maybe that's one reason it didn't fare well at the box office. The other reason is that, well, it at first seems confusing and pointless, until you figure out what you are watching. For some, then, it might just be offensive. <br/><br/>However, if the film as a weakness, and it does, it is that the characters aren't the kind audiences can connect with emotionally. Mother and the rest, rather, are archetypes illustrating creation mythology, God's hubris in believing He could create beauty and still give the creatures of his creation free will. Kind of hard to establish a relationship with these folks. Visually and intellectually, though, the film should certainly warrant and reward the attention of questioning and thoughtful viewers."

","Watching this film, I like so many others felt frustrated and lost. I minored in film in college - I was acquainted with film criticism, but still the film left me bewildered. Like one review here I was also reminded of the advice I had read years earlier from Kurt Vonnegut who reminded us that all art however abstract must exist also to entertain an audience. Perhaps that is part of the problem with Mother - the audience that is entertained here must be both a sophisticated moviegoer and well educated in abstract film making. Like the casual viewer of abstract expressionist art who occasionally pronounces ""My six-year old daughter could have painted that!"" Mother requires a good amount of background in abstract film making to even approach it. I did not give this film a rating solely for that reason. Though I failed to understand it - I also admit that my familiarity with abstract film making is weak at best. 
No doubt this film could have been better advertised to emphasize that it was not meant as realism because it never should have been compared to ""Requiem for a Dream"" which was entirely realistic.
To extend my analogy further even if by comparison you can appreciate early Abstract Expressionism in the form of, for example, Willem De Kooning's ""Woman I"" it becomes increasingly difficult to appreciate his later works which are entirely devoid of realistic elements. Similarly Arenofsky's efforts with Mother when compared to abstract expressionism resound - it becomes clear to understand why a Director as he/she matures might want to become more abstract. Abstraction allows you to display more ideas simultaneously with greater flexibility and exploration of method. I have no doubt that if I watched this film a few more times I would eventually get some of his major points and come to appreciate his methods but this is not a film for a general audience."

The large house that is shared by mother and the writer is invaded by the creatures from his imagination that will end in his best-selling books.<br/><br/>The film was successful in demonstrating the lack of boundaries that exist between the writer and his wife, as he allows the characters to take over their lives and she refuses to say ""no"" until it is too late. ""The poet says it's everybody's house,"" remarks one of the numerous interlopers who ruin the life of mother. And the film moves forward to its inevitably apocalypse.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the message of the film was strung out in too many violent and ghoulish actions. The birthing of mother's baby and the ensuing cannibalism were over-the-top and completely unnecessary for the filmmakers to make their main point. <br/><br/>The film needed streamlining and the ability to use economy, as opposed to repetition of similar scenes.

I've had some doubts that it will be too artsy and too tough on my nerves, but yet again I trusted myself and challenged my intelligence. 
I believe that to every viewer of this movie the director should go and say: ""You're going to watch a dialogue between ""Mother Earth"" and ""God"". And this will NOT be a spoiler. This will help a lot of people to view this film the way it should be seen - a deep conversation about our humanity , meaning of life and our place on Earth.
Outright I should say that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are truly magnificent actors in this film. Their performances are INCREDIBLE! And such is the script and direction of Aronofsky. His deeply emotional way of reflecting on universal topics and translating them to the audiences in painfully creative manner really brings his art forth.<br/><br/>And what a home this filmmaker builds in front of us! The house is also a main character in this film. The constant transformations of the interior and exterior mirror thousands of years of life on Earth. We, viewers have to be indeed grateful for the intimate way visuals change in the movie. I really loved the way the director shows us particular details and how they represent greater ideas. Matter and mind are more or less the same in this film.<br/><br/>The sound and cinematography are compelling and add to the whole cosmic experience. I can't say who can express better such topics than Aronofsky. All the allusions to the Bible and to the state of our modern society are on point and the realism with which these topics are represented is truly astonishing. At the end of the movie, when things get really heated the poetic part steps back in order for us to see and hear the crescendo of our interpersonal relationships. It is certain that the author has some messaged to the role of God on Earth and they are firmly stated, no matter if we agree with him or not. Also, ""mother Earth"" is represented with deepest emotions and care. The intrusion of our humane nature onto this place we call home is visually represented in a striking way. <br/><br/>This movie is an experience, not a mere entertainment product. At some point it is a survival to watch it and stay with it. But it truly will mesmerize every viewer who goes into the theater to learn and absorb new ideas and viewpoints. I can only recommend to watch it in solitude because it is a compelling masterpiece."

One day, a mysterious couple (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) turn up at their door to take refuge in the home and a series of strange events begin to occur.<br/><br/>While undoubtedly thought-provoking, Mother! is equally as sensationalistic and divisive in the way it handles its themes and symbolism. This is definitely not a film for mainstream audiences and seems to be intended for those who enjoy the surreal work of filmmakers David Lynch and Lars von Trier. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job conveying her confusion as to what is happening around her, almost as though she is channeling the film's audience itself. As a whole, this is a difficult film to review correctly as it contains so many complicated metaphors and references that few would actually understand. It may require more than one viewing to properly take in everything it is trying to say.<br/><br/>I have no rating for it."

","Is a movie with no limits when it comes to everything that is grotesque and absurd in life that I do not recommend for watching.The story is basically about a couple where he is a writer that is searching desperatly for inspiration and she is an obedient housewife. When the wife announces her husband that she is preagnant, his inspiration is back and he manages to write the perfect novel that touches every man in a different way. That leads to an unexpected visit from a large group of fans at the couple's house. Things get out of control and the fanatical admirers begin to destroy and steal everything from the house and at one point they even start killing each other. In the fight his wife is getting into labour. Her husband helps her to deliver the baby, then he hands the baby to his fans who in the general hysteria is killed and then eaten by fans who can not control their hunger for the life of their idol. Eventually the woman who is destroyed burns the house."

","I didn't get it, the idea of the movie (the ending) is very difficult to accept, if it would end like a nightmare or just end without ""reply"" it would be more acceptable. I mean why it has to begin again with a new wife, and why is that jewel restored again from the old wife! in fact I like the surprises in the movie but the end was a big fail, it feels like they didn't had much time to produce a perfect end so they did it like lets ""lets do t again""
""Him"" was so respectful writer in the movie only, but the fact is ,he is mean, selfish and freak, everybody can do what they wants with your belongings, even if its your wife or your new baby!! this is retarded idea against loving your fans and your writings.

"cruise01","6","0","0","20 December 2017"," Mother! Creepy and weird direction and a plot that is difficult to say what its about with a hidden message in it.
","Mother! Is by far the strangest psychological horror film to date. It is not for everyone and everyone will either have a like it or hate it reaction to the film. Screenwriter/Director Darren Aronofsky take on the film does have a religious theme in the mix which some would be able to pick out the references in the plot. <br/><br/>The plot is difficult to discuss without giving away spoilers. The less you know the better the film will be. It is difficult to even discuss what the movie is about and is best to view it than hear about it. All I can say is Jennifer Lawrence's character and Javier Bardem are a married couple living in a country side house. Until, guests arrive and there loyalties are tested. Plus the film does build some mystery with its eerie direction. And it raises a lot of questions throughout. Such as the visions Lawrence's character sees? Why cant she ever go outside the house? And why is Bardem's character so inviting to strangers? <br/><br/>I like the theme and twist when the plot comes together. Some may have different perspective with what the message of the plot is trying to convey. The final half hour of the film is were it is all at. When chaos happens and it gets violent very fast. And to discuss what goes on here would not even make sense. Besides it is a crowdfest of violence. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky direction was decent. Yes, it was good building up the mystery plot which they did a good job hiding it in the trailer. And the film can mislead the audience if they are expecting a horror movie from it. When you see the film the direction and plot is completely different than it is suppose to be. Think of 2009 film Knowing, were the plot shifts into a completely different direction but besides the mass destruction and end of the world theme. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was great. Playing a character that is soft spoken and sweet. But you learn very little about her character besides she takes some kind of yellow drink when her visions appear. She sees images of blood spurts on the ground that gets bigger throughout. Javier Bardem was also good as well, and his character is also kept a mystery. Why is he so inviting to strangers? How do these strangers have a connection to him? <br/><br/>The film does have an eerie direction. In matter fact, there is no music score in the film. It is all plain silence and noise from the set and actors. And also you never hear a characters name or do not even know what these characters names are. It is all left for the audience interpretation. <br/><br/>The movie can be slow moving. Which the audience will need patience for. If you have patience to see the plot fold together than it is for you. If you do not care to see Lawrence walking around the house and seeing all these suspicious activities from people or objects than I suggest you skip this one.<br/><br/>Overall, Mother! Is a fair psychological horror film. It has an eerie direction. The cast was wonderful. The plot is slow moving and requires a lot of patience. The twist and theme is fairly okay which does leave it open for the audience to talk about. It is also one of those films that you do not really care about seeing again.<br/><br/>I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars."

Jennifer Lawrence as mother and Javier Bardem as Him. <br/><br/>They live in an isolated house in the middle of nowhere when one day a guy visits them. <br/><br/>Then things go bonkers with the whole thing from Lawrence's point of view. the people are intrusive, they act as if this was their house not hers.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","10 October 2017"," Plot devices, all
","Extra spoiler warning â€“ the following is intended ONLY for those who have watched the movie!!! <br/><br/>While there are interpretations galore (among which are psychological, biblical and theatrical), everything bazaar, puzzling, exasperating etc are not plot twists, and not even red herrings. They are there simply for one reason, as plot devices to propel the movie towards the conclusion: confirmation of one main theme that has always been there, right from the beginning and throughout the movie. Even the two top-notch actors Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, who have been enticed by director Darren Aronofsky to join this project, are playing roles that are merely inconsequential plot devices, their superb acting notwithstanding.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a prologue: a horrifying fire that burns down a beautiful house in the middle of nowhere (which has a full-circle, echoing closure at the end), a plot device. Next comes an outwardly idyllic existence of a couple living in this partially restored house. Jennifer Lawrence's (I'll use the actors' name as the characters have no name) focus is the ongoing restoration work (currently painting) so that her poet husband Javier Bardem can continue to tap his inspiration juice in the ""paradise"" that she is trying to create. Two things seem to be bothering them. Lurking in the background, they are childless (not sure whose fault and how much that really bothers them). More conspicuous is his constipation, figuratively speaking, with reference to his poetic creativity. Still plot devices, although getting a little warmer.<br/><br/>Next comes the unannounced visit of a couple (Harris and Pfeiffer), stranded travellers that Lawrence sees as an unwelcome intrusion to their privacy. Bardem, however, welcomes them to stay, particularly when Harris turns out to be a huge admirer of his work. It looks for a moment that there is a significant story developing. But when the two sons arrive with an ensuing family feud ending up with one of them being killed, it gradually becomes apparent that these four are just, yes, plot devices.<br/><br/>This leads to the first of the two set pieces (if I can call them that), a vivid, annoying, irritating an ultimately exasperating ""invasion"" of their house. This first one is Bardem generously making the house available for the mourning gathering of the dead man's family and friends. What this brings out is Lawrence's helpless resentment that whatever she does is not good enough for him (despite his apparently sincere claim that she is his true muse), a man who feeds on the admiration of his fans.<br/><br/>The fight of the couple, however, leads to aroused intimacy and her pregnancy. But again, apologies for sounding like a broken record, this is mere plot device. The happy event clears the block of his inspirational juice, eventually triggering the second set piece that is outlandishly huge and maddeningly surreal, as if Aronofsky had gone out of his mind himself and completely lost control. But no. The director is firm on his course of bringing out the only main theme of this movie. The muse may have sacrificed everything for the artist. Unfortunately, the artist lives only for the devotion and admiration of his fans. Nothing else matters to him.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the movie has perfect closure which clarifies the mystifying prologue, with an added message: what you have witnessed will go on and on, again and again."

","Mother! is more like Oh Boy! I knew this new one from Darren Aronofsky was going to be a rough one and give it time, that's exactly what you're going to get.<br/><br/>Aronofsky is the man behind such spiritual films as ""Noah"" and ""The Fountain"" and psychological thrillers like ""Black Swan"". You'll find both genres here. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays the wife of a very well-to-do author played by Javier Bardem. If you're wondering if the age difference is mentioned, it is. I mean she looks like a child bride compared to him, it has to. <br/><br/>But anyway, these people are secluded in a house some place, and the silence that exists between them is deafening and its not just because the house creaks or because Bardem's writer has a case of writers block. It's between them. <br/><br/>And really what starts off this mystery even more is that an orthopedic surgeon played by Ed Harris and his wife played by Michelle Pfeiffer they just show up out of no where thinking the place is a bed and breakfast.<br/><br/>Bardem seems cool with them, but we're following this as the Lawrence character completely taken aback that Bardem is being so hospitable or that they are being so abrasively shitty house guests. <br/><br/>Part of where I think the marketing for this really gives you the wrong idea is that this is a bizarre dark comedy more than it is a horror movie. The first hour really is having to deal with worse house guests than Bill Murray in ""What About Bob?""<br/><br/>The mystery is fairly engaging though mostly because you do feel what's missing between the Lawrence and Bardem characters and you're wondering if these house guests are filling it or making it worse. <br/><br/>At about the hour mark the question really does arise though of whether this movie is trying to say something or if it is something of a vanity project and to that I think the answer is basically both. <br/><br/>Aronofsky includes everything from religious and political allegory, the addiction and cost of fame, being in an emotionally abusive relationship, trying to raise children in such a volatile time as this, and there's so much more. <br/><br/>It's a lot and the last 45 minutes or so is somewhat effective in the downright brutal and disgusting imagery it shows, while at other times it really is just disgusting and you'll want to leave all together. <br/><br/>It's the jumble of things that makes it hard for me to recommend this movie because despite it being called a horror movie, this is more just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks kind of filmmaking.<br/><br/>That's not to say I don't admire the commitment, especially from the cast. Lawrence is perfectly confused and horrified while Bardem, Harris, and some of the most haunting work done by Pfeiffer in a while fill everything out really well. <br/><br/>But like I said, this is a movie more of ideas than it is horror. Those ideas are portrayed later on in metaphorical form as horror but I doubt it's what most people are going to be expecting and I doubt many others will see much point in wading through Aronofsky's many converging ideas. <br/><br/>So I give it 6 out of 10.

"kuldeepghosh","10","5","16","30 September 2017"," Even if you are not aware of the biblical context this is an amazing work of art. Aronofsky has lived up to his promise after Black Swan
","One of the strangest stories I've ever watched on mainstream cinema. How could a story from the bible possibly transform into something like this! The viewers are free to come up with any interpretation of their choice - My interpretation was also very much off (couldn't even tell while watching it for the first time that it's from the bible). Yet watching the sequence of events as they unfold is a deeply unsettling experience. This psychological thriller has the power to stir up one's worst fears, takes exploitation and abuse of another individual to a whole new level. <br/><br/>At some points, Javier Bardem, who plays the husband and a famous poet, seems to be one of the most generous and compassionate beings, caring about others needs much more than their own. But as the movie progresses, one starts to question that same compassion which seems to be border on madness, when he is shown completely oblivious of the feelings of his own wife while caring for others. She pleads with her husband to pay a little attention to her suffering. After her newborn son is killed by an unruly mob, who are actually fans of her husband's writings, her husband says that they must find a way to forgive them all - at which point the viewer becomes convinced that this is truly madness and not compassion anymore. She stares at him in shock and disbelief as he utters these words. When she burns down the entire home, killing all the people in the crowd and badly burning and scarring herself in the process, her husband looks at her lifeless body in a way that suggests that he is thinking what else he can extract from her. Jennifer looks at him, still madly in love, and murmurs there is nothing else left for her to give. Javier peers at her heart, to which she responds ""Go ahead"". He then digs into her chest and pulls out her heart, which turns into a shining stone in his hand, which he then places on the mantle like a trophy for everyone to see.<br/><br/>The final scene of the movie - where the girl wakes up in the morning to discover her husband isn't beside her - is same as the starting one, just that the main character (Jennifer Lawrence) has been replaced by a new and innocent looking girl, suggesting that she will be the new victim of the same pattern of abuse that Jennifer went through.

","This film is unexpected and an experience like none I've had in the movie theater recently. This is exactly why I enjoy Darren Aronofsky's work, I go to the cinema to be blown away, see something I've never seen before and he's so good at that. It's a difficult watch in parts I won't lie but I certainly wouldn't consider it horror like some were saying. It's suspenseful, shocking, some will absolutely love it and others will despise it. I loved it because it comes at you like a ton of bricks or a car that's gone out of control - it grabs you and doesn't let go. Its a cerebral thrill ride, a mystery of epic proportions until the end, at which point your brain is scrambled eggs.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem were incredibly good together, I worried if they would have any energy between them, so I was pleasantly surprised by that. I think Lawrence has matured greatly as an actress and leading woman, she grabbed the reigns on this film, commanded it and held it strongly for the entire film. She's evolved and its obvious, Aronofsky rightly just let her shine and she did. People hate her for whatever reason and that's cool but you can't deny her talent. I couldn't even begin to consider who could've done this role as well as she did. Javier was wonderful as always, truly one of the greatest underrated actors working today. <br/><br/>Michelle Phiffer and Ed Harris were a great addition to the film and I realized how much I miss seeing Michelle on film. I'd like to see her get nominated but I doubt it. Jennifer may or may not get nominated, I think its 50/50 but I definitely don't see a win. I could be wrong on both counts.<br/><br/>I'd be lying if I said the film didn't have its issues because it does, but I still really enjoyed it. There were lots of other surprises which I wont spill here and I hesitate to say much more about the film for fear of ruining it, but go into this with an open mind. Aronofsky always has something to say and this film is pulpy, its deep, open your mind when you walk in and let Darren take you on this strange trip of a film he called 'mother!'. (B+)"

","Imagine ""Rosemary's Baby"" filtered through the dark and twisted creator of ""Black Swan"" with a lot more symbolism and a lot less literal and you'd get ""Mother!"", Darren Aronofsky's nightmare about a mother's isolation.<br/><br/>From the start we are launched into the perspective of Mother (not a single name is ever said in the movie for any character). The film uses almost entirely close ups of Mother, over the shoulder shots, or point of view shots to emphasize this viewpoint. The sound design also adds another layer of immersion, accentuating the many small sounds made in Mother's home, and creating a three-dimensional landscape through the sound. This very limited perspective, as well as the fact that the film takes place entirely in one home, gives the film a claustrophobic atmosphere and often heightens the sense of paranoia.<br/><br/>The set up is simple: a couple, comprised of a writer and the woman who built their home, is interrupted by a sudden unexpected guest. I don't want to go much further than that, but the sudden escalation of events is incredibly surprising and very bizarre if taken literally, but even as I wasn't entirely sure what exactly was happening I was pulled into the movie by the amazing performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although it may seem like a traditional psychological thriller film at the start, along the same lines as Aronofsky's own ""Black Swan"", I can say by the end I had many lingering questions about what I had actually just seen and what exactly it meant. This is why I'm going to do a more in depth analysis below this, but this is where the spoiler free review ends."
"lrallennyc","9","6","21","16 September 2017"," Lawrence is incredible!
","Seems that there may be lots of Trump trolls on here who are attacking Lawrence for her political views. Unfair. This movie has a lot to offer if you go with an open mind and don't read too much about it prior to your visit. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in the role and is in every scene in the movie. Surely an Oscar nod is coming her way, just like Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan,"" another incredible movie directed by Aronofsky. Michelle Pfeiffer is also wickedly wonderful and should receive an Oscar nod as well. <br/><br/>While the story moves along creepily and eerily toward a conclusion that no one would guess, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. Both disgustingly gruesome and tantalizingly audacious, there's plenty ""to chew on"" literally. But, the fascination of the moviegoer is what the movie means as a whole. <br/><br/>It sets a tone that is familiar to us all, a home invasion. Everyone's worst nightmare. But the scenes take us on a roller coaster ride that no one suspects. <br/><br/>Forget what other's are saying about it being a ""Rosemary's Baby"" clone. That is defining the story too narrowly. If it is about God, the environment, Mother Earth and the state of our society today, then so be it! All that fits. <br/><br/>But when you leave the theater shaken, it is also becomes a thriller in the vain of the first viewing of ""The Exorcist,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" Something audacious for the eyes and senses. <br/><br/>Kudos to all the talented cast and crew for shaking up my psyche in these repressive, controlling days of America!"
"ShimmySnail","10","4","12","21 September 2017"," If you liked The Fountain, you'll like this
","Well, I can definitely see why it's a ""love it or hate it"" kind of film. It's not a horror movie at all, it doesn't even have horror elements, though IMDb classifies it as one.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say the film is not a straightforward story. If you're the kind of person who likes formulaic films with simple moral messages, who hates being surprised by Shyamalan type plot twists, who thinks that any style of photography or sound even slightly out of the ordinary is ""pretentious"" and therefore insulting, you'll hate it.<br/><br/>If you love open-ended interpretations, symbolism, beautiful tactile films, and trust that Aronofsky, Bardem, and Lawrence will take you somewhere, you'll like this film. That's how I went into it, and I loved it. Aronofsky is not quite as inaccessible as David Lynch, but think along those lines, and you'll be prepared.<br/><br/>I will say that the first half features a lot of tight closeups and hand-held camera work, so those who get motion sickness from such things might want not want to see it in the theater."
"myladyblack","9","4","12","19 September 2017"," It's a movie to think and talk about
","I do understand that many people don't like this movie. I am glad that Jennifer Lawrence did spill the beans on who she embodies in this movie. Otherwise I would have been very confused and most likely would not have understood it. <br/><br/>But as she was telling on talk shows - SPOILERS AHEAD - that she is Mother Nature, you can easily conclude who the other persons are. It is a movie who puts a mirror infront of mankind and yourself and makes you think about the cruel stuff we do to mother nature and against each other. And a lot happens in the name of god. And all he does is watch and not interfere. I'm not a religious person, so the way god is seen in this movie is fine with me.<br/><br/>About Jennifer Lawrence: I'm not a die hard fan of her, there were movies and moments were I didn't like what she was doing. But she is very good and convincing in this movie! There hasn't been one cringy moment at all. <br/><br/>There is so much more to say about it, but I keep I rather stop here."

","I'm having a hard time understanding the low reception mother! got.<br/><br/>The film is superbly directed, with masterful use of close ups and camera movement, the pacing is pretty good, scenes are not too long or short, they are able to develop without becoming boring or tedious.<br/><br/>I imagine the main issue many people got was the heavy use of symbolism and the fact that it was visually really powerful, are those negative things now ? I honestly thought the biblical references were pretty clear, around here i read people claiming it's a meaningless mess ... , no, everything pretty much make sense if you reach the ending. It may also be the fact that an actress like Jennifer Lawrence, more know for easier family friendly films, has the main role and people were expecting something different from it; i can understand this but even not being a huge fan of her i have to say that the interpretation was spot on, on her and pretty much everyone else side.<br/><br/>If we wanna talk about the negatives there is some issue between the first and second half, i feel like it got ""cut"" too heavily especially after the smoothness of the first part. There is a little overabundance of symbolism and if they went for a lower quantity and took more time to made them clear the picture would have probably improved.<br/><br/>The story flows really well, the cinematography is great and the acting is superb.

"Equalizer16","10","3","8","26 September 2017"," A Mother!'s Nightmare
","Darren Aronofsky's disturbing nightmare parable horror-thriller, is a new masterclass work in cinematic depictions and narrative <br/><br/>In the comforting urban paradise, separated from the rest of the world, a husband and wife's tranquil life is disturbed by the continues arrival of uninvited guests. 'Mother'(Jennifer Lawrence) becomes incapable of stopping the trespasses 'Him' (Javier Barden) graciously invites the people into their homes as means to create inspiration for his writing. But as tensions and distress begin to flood the house, transcendent rage rises in the heart of Mother! <br/><br/>Aronofsky is very well known for his disturbing, surreal dark fantasies as shown by works like Black Swan, but Mother! is something else entirely. Never before has film like this been more alive cinematically. There is much to repel and divide audiences in the case of Mother!, what Aronofsky effectively achieves is moments of massive shock that may enrage audiences., but beyond the visual level is a much compelling nature.<br/><br/>In the very soul of the film is Jenifer Lawrence, the active housewife to Javier Barden, determined to respect her husbands ambitions, but also break his writers block. In a very extraordinary view, we are never not by Lawrence's side as the camera creeps astonishing behind Lawrence's every move in extreme close ups and over the shoulder shots. Consistently always from her point of view, we are easily transported into the nauseating nightmare that becomes her world. Even as she seeks gentle comfort from her husband, Barden presence and behaviour only drags us further into the depth of the horror.<br/><br/>Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are the first of the guests to arrive at the house, and from first contact immediately are most definitely no the company you want in your home. Pfeiffer is frustratingly terrific as the childlike, intrusive 'woman', with her nosy tendency to invading the couple's personal life which leaves 'mother's' aggressive lashes to be only responded by ignorance from the her husband and 'woman'.<br/><br/>The haunting presence of location within the house is fascinatingly portrayed by Matthew Libatique's cinematography, although always in focus on Lawrence, creates the Gothic environment of the harrowing home. In one scene, Libaitque takes us through and almost historic but apocalyptic journey through the house, during the shocking and jaw dropping climax.<br/><br/>Mother!'s ending result leaves you rather traumatised and overwhelmed by the astounding cinematic creation you have just witnessed. In an amazing display, Aronofsky has fabricating and elusive dream like vision layered in many and different narratives to be interpreted in multiple ways depending on its viewers. From a poetic expression of the collapse of a happy marriage to a comment on torment of mother nature, to also biblical depictions.<br/><br/>Mother! is masterfully constructed piece in whatever way you look at it. From surface level this work, is a very controversial and staggeringly difficult watch but as construction of narrative and cinema is phenomenal."
"gilcostello","10","3","8","19 September 2017"," The Artistic Heart of Darkness
","MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!<br/><br/>This film goes deeper than anything Aronofsky has done to date. It is certainly his most personal film, and that is evident in its exploration of the great paradox, the great cruel irony, that he certainly knows so well, of how an artist driven creatively can destroy the essence of all that is good at the center of HIS OWN LIFE while simultaneously destroying the heart of what is good right in front of him, what could easily envelope him in absolute love, provided by Mother (however one envisions Mom in any or all her dimensions).<br/><br/>This film is a deeply personal exploration into the Heart of Darkness in a relationship between man and woman where creative Rumblings will not permit a steady Foundation. It is possibly the worst nightmare a person could get caught up in, fulfilling one's Destiny as an artist while simultaneously destroying life all around IN ITS ESSENCE! That is the greatest temptation of all in life, one that every artist has tasted in some degree, and a handful of impassioned artists have driven themselves into the darkest regions of the Abyss with no return in pursuit of the absolute truth that will affirm a vision of this Darkness that lurks beneath the surface of consciousness, often dragging those closest down with them. <br/><br/>I loved how Bergman explored this theme in Hour of the Wolf,and in Roeg's great film version of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but I'm really taken deeper, more personally, inside this Haiku cinematic version from Aronofsky."

"jon.h.ochiai","7","3","8","17 September 2017"," What the...
","""Mother!"" is totally bizarre, and mind bending disturbing. No, clearly these are not props. Writer and Director Darren Aronofsky is angry and surreal in his apparent elegy of the artist's lost muse. After watching this ""What the"" vanity project, I have to wonder whether it extends far beyond mere indulgence. This is not at all a great movie. Really. <br/><br/>At times when I viewed the movie as an observer instead of being an audience, the story is laughably ridiculous, taking itself way too seriously. Then again that in itself is somewhat entertaining.<br/><br/>Literally, none of Aronofsky's characters have names. I'll use the actor's names when possible. Jennifer Lawrence plays the much younger wife of bestselling author Javier Bardem. Jenn is the melancholy wife, who valiantly restores their country home. Apparently, this was Javier's childhood home that was destroyed in a fire. Jenn wants a baby. However, Javier suffers writer's block, and has lost his muse. The two stopped having sex. <br/><br/>""Mother!"" then spirals into the abyss. Ed Harris and his wife, in the movie, Michelle Pfieffer become uninvited house guests. Their prodigal sons return played by Brian Gleeson and Dowhnall Glesson, as Cain and Abel characters in Aronofsky's passion play. ""Mother!"" defies description, being so hard to figure out what is going on. It is strangely amusing in the over the top repulsive imagery and muddled logic. <br/><br/>In a weird way, I kind of enjoyed ""Mother!"" given the ending. Seemingly, the angst of the lost artist's muse is more than personal, at least for Aronofsky. ""Mother!"" will not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. It is neither mine, as well."

It is like nothing you have ever seen before, as it grabs you by the shoulders and rivets you in your seat for 2 hours. Darren Aronofsky stated in an interview with MTV that he wrote this movie in 6 days, after a fever dream. Sounds like a supernatural creation to me. Most movies take years, if not decades to formulate. Aronofsky is a genius and one of the most audacious writer/director that we have today. His resume is staggering and includes such films as Pi, The Wrestler, Requiem For A Dream, Black Swan, The Fountain, and Noah. Mother!, like Noah, is not a Christian film like The Case for Christ. On the contrary, this film takes the religions and cults that have been invented by humans and burns them to the ground.<br/><br/>For all the Haters out there that give this masterpiece low grades because it offends you mythologies,just get over it.

","This film just might be a masterpiece. This film is a complete original. Unlike anything you've ever seen before. It keeps you thinking long after it's over and it keeps you wanting to search for more. I went into this film knowing almost nothing about it at all, which is such a treat and also a testament to the marketing of this film which revealed very little about the plot or the characters. But by not divulging anything about the plot or the characters, it has lead to a stream of regular movie goers hating this film. Why the hate? Simply put, people don't understand the film upon first viewing. Not to say that people are stupid or unwise (I didn't truly understand what the movie was actually about until the climax began), because there is a lot to take in upon first viewing. I do believe that if people go into this film knowing what it is actually about than I think the cinema score would surely be at least an ""A"" instead of that ridiculous ""F"" it received. It would certainly be certified fresh by rotten tomatoes instead of the middling score it's currently holding. No one likes to admit it, but sometimes the critics are 100% correct in what is a great film and what isn't. In this case, please-please-please listen to the critics. This a film they used to make back in the 60's and the 70's. When they used to let auteur directors make their passion projects and show us something completely unique. There are so many films like this one where they bombed at the box office and then some years later more and more people see it and ultimately decide that it is indeed a masterpiece. Think Donnie Darko. Think Blade Runner. Think Sorcerer. Think Fight Club. Think Idiocracy. Think Dredd. Think The Iron Giant. Think The Shawshank Redemption. Think Children of Men. Think even The Wizard of Oz. Don't be late to the party. Be the one who gets to say, ""I saw that in theatres when it first came out and it blew me away!"" Don't be surprised if this film gets nominated for a slew of academy awards. And if it does, it would be absolutely justified. Thank you, Darren Aronofsky, for making something brave and different. Thank you for making me excited to delve deeper into the meaning of things and keep hope alive that film doesn't have to just be cookie cutter nonsense that we are all so used to seeing."
"dtharter","9","4","13","19 September 2017"," An Important Film About Creation, Destruction, the Earth, and Mankind's Place In It
","I love how divisive this movie is! People seem to either love it or hate it, but nobody can stop talking about it. But let's make one thing clear: This is NOT Rosemary's Baby. It's something completely different.<br/><br/>Is the symbolism heavy-handed? Sort of, but that doesn't stop people from totally missing the obvious Biblical allegory in Mother! Maybe it's because of the inclusion of mother (nature), a presence that the Bible overlooks, but the arrival of Adam and Eve, the original sin, the two sons, and everything else should make it clear that this film is about the clash between nature and man as God looks carelessly on.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is great in this film, bringing the vulnerability she's brought to other films, but the true star is Javier Bardem. Some people have been complaining that Bardem's character of Him is fickle and inconsistent, but isn't that the way God is depicted in the Bible? The mercurial blend of egomania, rage, and sympathy makes Him downright hilarious at times.<br/><br/>This film will not be for everyone, at least not at first. I feel that this will grow into a sleeper hit and may end up being a classic."
"Deathstryke","6","4","13","17 September 2017"," A metaphorical gut punch
","Based on Darren Aronofsky's previous work, I was already anticipating that Mother! would take some hair-pin bends around my suspension of disbelief, but I wasn't expecting it to leave the road entirely, flip 30 times into a ravine and explode. This is a roller-coaster track through a director's ideological stream of consciousness and you're either in for the ride, or out.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence (unnamed, as are all the characters in the film) plays a dreamy, docile housewife to an acclaimed poetic genius, Javier Bardem, suffering from writer's block. The two inhabit a palatial southern Gothic home in the middle of nowhere, half under re-construction after a previously mentioned fire destroyed it. Interrupting their placid existence arrive two strangers, a man and woman who, despite protestations from the suspicious wife, are invited to stay by the friendly host, who hopes their conversations might inspire him to write. Later, the two stranger's squabbling sons show up and violence ensues. This first act is a microcosm for what happens later on, as more devoted fans intrude on the house to profess their 'faith' for their beloved poet, all the while ignoring the beleaguered wife's protests and gradually tearing her 'paradise' apart.<br/><br/>Mother! is a pessimistic commentary on mankind's propensity for destruction and depending on your political leanings, there are many ways the events that transpire can be interpreted. There's no coherent narrative. This is a mayhem of religious, environmental and socio-political metaphors, an irreverent mardis gras parade through history from man's first transgression in the Garden of Eden to the Hiroshima bomb. The house stands in for mother earth, slave to the whims of a rapacious, capitalistic greed. And most of this happens in the last 30 minutes, where the grotesque violence increases to an over-whelming intensity and the claustrophobic camera work, shot mostly from Lawrence's point of view, makes for a dizzying and disturbing experience. There's no uplifting message to be taken, no silver- lining, just unapologetic nihilism and wanton imagery that punches you in the gut and grins sadistically.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling quite shaken, my brain contorted trying to figure out what all the metaphors meant. I felt as though I had been given access to someone else's nightmare. Others were laughing derisively and complaining that it didn't make any sense, failing to grasp the subtext that was so obviously bashing them over the head.<br/><br/>As another reviewer pointed out, it's hard to rate something like this honestly. There are many reasons to dislike it on a content level, but certainly bad film making isn't one of them. This is a tour de force of camera work and cinematography and the acting is top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if Jennifer Lawrence had a mental breakdown after filming this, with all the closeups of her gasping tortured face.<br/><br/>Mother! is kind of like heroin. It left an impression on me that's for sure. But I'm not recommending it."
"rgkarim","Null","4","13","16 September 2017"," Oh Mother, where are thou?
","Horror movies continue to be a popular trend in Hollywood. IT's successful launch last weekend, surely inspires the trend to continue, so what the heck put out another one this weekend.  Jennifer Lawrence takes center stage in what looks to be a psychosocial thriller to usher in a new age. Will the artistic styles of Darren Aronofsky be a welcome change to the milieu, or does its odd premise promised in the trailers might dive too far down crazy town to enjoy? Robbie K happy to fill in some gaps with another review. Let's get started. <br/><br/>LIKES: <br/><br/>Unique vision: Call me crazy, as many people do, but originality is something difficult to come by these days. Mother, certainly gets points for standing out, not only in the bizarre presentation and mind messing visuals, but also in the symbolism represented in the story. Amidst the mystery, drama, and other oddities in the film, one will get their fill of morals in that artistic manor Hollywood loves. One certainly won't forget this movie, or itsoriginality. <br/><br/>Acting: The chemistry between Javier Bardem and Lawrence is perhaps the biggest selling point of this movie. Much of the mystery comes in the tension between the two protagonists, Bardem's deceptive nature and double speak is on point to keep you wondering what is going on. Lawrence's curiosity and desperation kept me intrigued as to how far she could go, before breaking and challenging his words. It's a relationship dynamic brought out in spades, further leading you down the rabbit hole into the mind meddling to be had. In addition, Lawrence also knows how to sell psychotic with screams, tears, and just enough raspy voice to sell suffering. <br/><br/>Prosthetics/makeup: Grasping for straws here, but the team did a nice job with the prosthetics at hand. Injuries that arise look festering as if plagued by infection illustrated in text books. The degrading house seen in the trailers is only further detailed in the shots, black marks and degrading wood in all its glory. And Lawrence's pregnant belly is flawlessly blended into her normal skin, creating the roll that she could pop at any point. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Slow: Forgive me, but horror movies often move quickly to get to the scares at hand, even though they sacrifice story. While mother has a storyit moves dirt slow to the point of inducing sleep in the movie. The drama aspect takes more precedence than anything, and unfortunately it is dragged out relentlessly to the point of being annoying. This snail's pace doesn't do much for the quality of the movie, despite building up suspense for something never to come. <br/><br/>Not Scary: Aren't horror films supposed to be scary, or at least try to get me to jump? Mother failed on this aspect much of the time, resorting to a few loud noises and people sudden turning a corner as their fright factor. The tactic grew old and soon became nothing more than a ploy to try to salvage scares. For me, the creepiest factor was seeing humans devolve into selfish, unthinking cretins makes me fear for the future. Outside of that though, not much got me on edge for this movie. <br/><br/>Editing: I stated above the pace was slow, but that's because there was too much unneeded details for most of the movie. The drama was dragged out, the weird concepts were even longer, and there were a few scenes that I could have lived without and been just fine. Editing needed to jump in and get rid of some of this fluff, because it didn't work for me at all given the lack of scares. Yet, their hands were tied by the fact the writer was also the director. <br/><br/>The Story: All the symbolism and artistic presentation doesn't save the audience from an incoherent story. Mother has a lot of weird subplots in it, many of which held little relevance to the overall plot. Additionally, there are lots of gaps in the plot, unless you like theorizing and reflection on the plot, because that's the only way to fill in the vague data points. The writer got so centered on its uniqueness, it didn't close the story the best I think they could do. Questions are great for discussion, but I like my films with a little more explanation than what I got in this film. And when you draw most of the conclusionsyou can't help but say, ""Really? That is what this is?"" Which reminds me.<br/><br/>The Weirdness: Mother started out artistically weird, but as the movie hit the halfway point it dove deep into the tortured artist route. What didn't make sense, quickly turned into a trippy, random display of negligence and rudeness, mocking the modern human while deterring from the mystery. Soon rapid time progression and sequence changes led to even more head scratching moments, that continued to shock me further to the point of asking what I was watching. The obscene violence and darker phenomenon only grossed me out, and again seemed pointless in the grand scheme of things. <br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>Mother is artistic and unique, I'll give it that, and certainly makes bold statements about a lot of cultural quarrels plaguing our world. But outside of that, it's not so much a horror movie as a though provoking, psychological thriller. A slow pace, trippy visulas, and just overall weird atmosphere, does not make for the best horror movie. So, if you had your hopes up for this one, do yourself a favor and skip this mind bender until it hits home theaters. Go see IT again instead. <br/><br/>Scores:<br/><br/>Drama/Mystery/Horror: 6.5 Movie Overall: 4.0"

Second, it's misleading, and I think it's intended that way. You might be fooled into thinking you are watching a terror movie, a psychological thriller, or the like...It is not. Yes it's allegorical. The fact that I read more than one interpretation only goes to show that it works on different levels, as good films do. Mine is neither correct or incorrect. It's just one more. To me, it's obviously about creating art. The poet is married to his muse, the mother of his art, his inspiration, and in the beginning the relationship is strained: he's got a terrible writer's block. He's trying to work, but he's easily distracted by outside influences, and his muse does not like it. Of course when his muse gets pregnant, that's when he's inspired to write ...It's all there. The whole process of creating a work of art (book, film music, you name it). Just before birth, it's more hectic than ever...You even have the editor causing mayhem. She just wants the manuscript. Then ""mother"" delivers ""the child"" (new book of poems) and she's jealous that he wants to share it with the world (release the book), which he does, and the public consumes the writer's work (child) with gusto, an act of cannibalism. Market forces at work. I could go on and on finding the allegorical meaning, but you get the point... An original, interesting film, that both makes you think and keeps you intrigued throughout. A rarity nowadays."
"hunter-friesen","8","3","9","28 September 2017"," A bizarre horror thriller that will keep you thinking about it for days
","If you plan on watching Darren Aronofsky's newest horror film, Mother!, then be prepared to ask yourself what the hell you are watching. A freak show of a film, Mother! is a well made psychological thriller that will keep you thinking and questioning what happened and what it all means. <br/><br/>This is a dark and surreal film that subtly sends messages to the audience. Everything you see is put in for a direct reason and is made for you to think and decode. I won't spoil what the messages are since the main joy of watching it is piecing everything together and comprehending the story as a whole. It does a very nice job of steadily dripping details throughout that keep you questioning. It shares similar qualities to Aronofsky's previous thriller films like Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream. <br/><br/>The plot follows a husband (Javier Bardem) and wife (Jennifer Lawrence) who live in a secluded house. He's a successful writer who's having trouble creating a new story and she's excited to work on the house of her dreams. One night, a mysterious man (Ed Harris) shows up at their door and spends the night. The next day, the man's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) appears. They confess to being fans of the writer and start prying around the house. Lawrence is hesitant to having them continue to stay, but Bardem showers them with open arms and begs them to stay as long as they like. From this point the story starts to delve into the stranger and stranger, revealing dark secrets that culminate in a ten-minute sequence near the end of the film that throws so much symbolism and commentary at you that you won't be able to comprehend everything you see. <br/><br/>After the start of the film, you can tell that these characters are not just simple humans. They are all unnamed and exhibit specific traits that relate them to famous characters everybody most likely knows of. The real mystery of the story is trying to match which character is which. <br/><br/>The trailers don't sell this film well because it's never a true horror film. It's a creepy psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. People looking for straightforward horror will be sorely disappointed and I would expect at least a few people to leave the theater halfway through at every screening. <br/><br/>The camera is positioned in very claustrophobic spaces and limits the amount of information you get from each shot. This creates a tense film that challenges the audience's ability to comprehend what is happening and what is going to happen next. Aronofsky reunites with his regular cinematographer Matthew Libatique and creates the usual suspense and creepy from previous collaborations such as Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. <br/><br/>The actors do their absolute best with the absurd material they are given. Jennifer Lawrence makes the best of her character who continues getting pushed around and trapped in her own home. Javier Bardem plays the usual dominant male that can't control his ego. He glorifies his success and strives to be the center of everything. Ed Harris is good as a supporting character, but the performance of the film goes to Michelle Pfeiffer as the prying and manipulative visitor. Expect to hear her name in the Best Supporting Actress race. <br/><br/>People will say how much they hated the movie because of its message and how it was sold as a horror movie and didn't deliver on that promise. I feel that people should treat this film as an experience and then make a goal to convince someone else to see it. Aronofsky has crafted a thriller masterpiece with a perplexing message and unusual style that will have people talking for years. Mother! should be on everyone's radar as long as it's available."
"Random3","7","3","9","20 September 2017"," Unique, absurd, disturbing, and extremely well made.
","The reason why this film has an F grade on Cinema Score is because this film is impossible to market. There is no feasible way to convey what this film actually is in a 30 second trailer. The trailer makes out that the film is some kind of horror film, which is absolutely not the case. There are horror elements, sure, but it is not a horror film. So this leads me to believe that the reason it has received such polarising responses is because a large percentage of the people going to see it are expecting ""Jennifer Lawrence in a horror film"", and those people will have been sorely disappointed. Everyone sitting near me at the cinema was remarking how bad the film was, and how much of a waste of time it was, and to be honest I don't blame them. If you go into it as a casual movie-goer, and you see a mainstream actress like Jennifer Lawrence is in a horror movie, that alone may be enough to convince you to go and see it. Hence the F grade on Cinema Score, and the extremely divisive response to the film.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I had my theories during the film but I found afterwards that there is a single metaphor that the film conveys. There are however multiple ways of interpreting a lot of it, and there is no single ""right answer"", which is something I appreciated. Any of you considering seeing it, I do urge you NOT to research what the film was intended to be about beforehand as it serves to make the film much more interesting on reflection.<br/><br/>The performances were top-tier, as expected, the cinematography and the set design, which isn't something I usually pick up on, was incredible. The whole film takes place in this one (large) house, so you get to know the house pretty well by the end.<br/><br/>As far as criticism goes, the pacing is weird. On reflection this is necessary for what Aronofsky wanted to do, but while you are watching the film you will likely be WTFing multiple times. Although there is a general sense of unease and threat throughout the entire film, there are some scenes which are very slow and borderline boring, and entire segments of the film are very slow to build. By the time it reaches the last 30 minutes, the film has become literal insanity, with absurd and extreme things happening too fast to keep track of.<br/><br/>Another thing to mention is that some of the content in the last 30 minutes is disturbing and arguably excessive. I was fine, but my girlfriend was unable to watch the end of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it gets a solid 7/10 from me. Unique, absurd, disturbing, and extremely well made."

","Heard about this film & was surprised it was a remake of another with the same story-line. I was also surprised to find it was 18 rated! You never see a lot of those now...! But anyway to the film:<br/><br/>I found the film to be something else, I'm simply speechless, yet somehow amazed by how f**ked up this film got from the first 20 minutes! It's like after the witness of the first part, you get another part which goes off the rails, then retreats back & goes off a little further & then back & then again but even, even further, so much so, it goes too out of control to even get back on the rails alone, not to mention get back to where it was at previously!<br/><br/>The film is about a writer & his young wife, who is somewhat 10/over a decade younger than he is! He's more obsessed with himself & simply using ^ taking things, while she, is more interested in living a peaceful life away from the hustle & bustle of city life! Things quickly go from 0 - 1000 times of wtf as the husband wants more & more! The film really gets going after the 20 minute mark! We have 2 actors from 2012 best film in this one playing this couples parts: Javier Badhem from Skyfall & Jennifer Lawrence from The Hunger Games! <br/><br/>My expectations of this film were quite far from what I read on the synopsis! I thought this to be a home invasion type horror film. But the film started off bland & a bit boring, like I was itching for something to stand out, like an obvious sign. But it got going!<br/><br/>The film had some pretty f**ked things going on! It made the first Purge Film seem tame with the amount of violence & carnage that went on! I won't spoil it for you, but I actually quite enjoyed it! It had some raw elements going on & some pretty sad moments too! I felt for Jennifer Lawrence's character in this one! <br/><br/>But although the film wasn't what I was expecting & I was speechless after it ended, I somewhat enjoyed the film quite a bit! I give it a 9/10."
"pflynn-38429","7","3","9","19 September 2017"," Definitely an experience
","Having not been a huge Aronofsky fan in the past, I went into 'Mother!' with a completely open mind having not heard or read any reviews about it. I loved the creepy scenes with Bardem/Harris/Pfeiffer and I thought Jennifer Lawrence was amazing throughout. In all honesty, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch, but I imagine this is what was intended by the director and all I can say is that I went through many emotions whilst watching this film. Whether it is good or bad? I really, really loved the first half. The second half was very interesting to watch, but maybe not a pleasant viewing experience. But how many films nowadays can we honestly say is an 'experience' to watch? Not many. I'd like to see more filmmakers taking risks like this - uncomfortable as it was at times!"

","I have never liked a film so much that left me with such emotional repulsion and the need to strangle the picture with my bare hands. <br/><br/>I was wary of the marketing that sold mother! as somewhat of a modern Rosemary's Baby, but I was truly unprepared for what was to come.<br/><br/>mother! is one of the most original works of art that I have seen in years, although the velocity of Darren Aronofsky's ego can hinder the film to the point of wanky exhaustion. Nonetheless, the artistically relentless mind-f**king of his audience is astonishing, without even the courtesy of a mainstream reach around. <br/><br/>You may feel violated, but it will be worth it. Even if you won't admit it straight away.<br/><br/>8/10."
"jdesando","Null","3","9","18 September 2017"," One of the best drama-horror films of recent times.
","""I know what it's like when you're just starting out, and you think you have all the time in the world, and... you know, you're not going to be so young forever. Have kids! Then you'll be creating something together! This is all just... setting."" Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer)<br/><br/>What a phantasmagorical setting it is! Darren Aronofsky is mad about motherhood or rather the process of giving birth either physical or metaphorical. In his mother! he directs and writes a horror potboiler with unsurprising scary tropes but an allegorical heft not seen yet this year. Poe would have approved.<br/><br/>Having characters with no names, only generics like woman or poet, allows the writer/director immediately to plunge into the figurative with our approval. The poet (Javier Bardem)) and his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) occupy a mansion that could serve well any such Gothic setting from Frankenstein to Psycho except that it is being rebuilt from a ruinous fire, a phoenix rebirth helped by the construction skills of the wife and the spirit of her youth.<br/><br/>Her being pregnant helps the allegory of the artist's creating and complements their apparent devotion to each other in the creation process. The film seems also to be commenting on the dangers of the January-May marriage. He can't write or make love in this sterile time of his career and marriage.<br/><br/>Not to worry, for they receive visitors, starting with an ill doctor (Ed Harris) and his stone-cold wife, Woman, who begin to upend the couple's life with fan adoration and frank comments about their marriage. A splendid home-invasion thriller this turns out to be as their loony family and countless fans appear. Aranofsky's Grand- Guignol ending is over the top but effective translating a fearful anxiety the couple has over home invasion.<br/><br/>What happens is a mash up of Rosemary's Baby, Black Swan, and Carrie with any other invasion film that becomes more than home busting. Indeed, this tense black comedy is largely a commentary on the challenges of art and partly about troubled marriage. The narcissism of creation and the obsession of the writer to be loved are important motifs of the film as it graphically paints the fall of the house of art.<br/><br/>Some audience might grow tired of the Lawrence close ups, which draw us in but also cause us the pain of identifying with her, caring about her more than the artist can. Yet, caring is what art does, close or from afar, writing or filmmaking."
"Quinoa1984","8","5","19","15 September 2017"," tell your children to walk this way, with caution
","With mother! a story of taking care of a house, having to let in unwanted house guests and feeling the awkwardness settle in more and more, and why being a *strong* woman is so crucial in this world (by this I mean that by showing us scene by scene how women like Lawrence get ground down by not just the men but by other women too - ""Be a mother"" of course is always the words spoken especially without asking), this is wildly intense stuff. This by the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan and Noah is not a surprise. What's surprising is that, on a first viewing, I'm not completely sure it's all... cohesive in its approach to how human beings... are.<br/><br/>Yet, two-thirds of this is a masterpiece, the first two-thirds I should say, with a harrowingly compelling performance by Lawrence and a... almost too spot-on casting of Bardem as the Poet who can't help but be both a charismatic AND terrifying presence (especially in those close-ups). It's claustrophobic and deeply, darkly, nightmarishly, even black-holey surreal in its approach - akin to Polanski (a brew of Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant, but still all Aronofsky), maybe some Bunuel thrown in there (a house where they can't leave you say or where people keep coming because... why? but still all Aronofsky), and it is basically PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE: THE MOVIE, a series of scenes where Jennifer Lawrence is stuck in that painfully awkward position of the social contract and probably the most bitter satire of toxic masculinity as far as, well, everything's about the man (except for having kids)....<br/><br/>And then it gets into the last third. I don't know what to think about that except... well, that was intense, and unpleasant, and possibly really, really pretentious (the very last scene, I get what you're doing man but... man). It's not a film that you immediately know what you're getting from minute one and it's a filmmaker, a writer-director, who is going TOO far and not reigning himself in and is unloading his id (and probably ego too) onto us all... and not all of this, again, is meant to be pleasant. <br/><br/>This ends on such a depressing note, as if (without spoiling too much) a cycle will repeat itself, I'd almost say Requiem ends in a sunnier light (hey, at least they're *alive* by the end of that). To get something like this, with vision and fire and violence and (yes) pitch-black comedy, in a major release on thousands of screens is welcoming and encouraging - final cut certainly helps, but nevertheless - and that this ambition when it comes to what is technically a ""bottle"" film is... art."

","Art doesn't need to be this brutal to get a message accross. We get the allegory. The rest is the director's own sick vision. Thank you for putting these horrendous images into people's mind. After crossing a certain point the effect of disturbing art becomes just as harmful as real events. Humans might be vile and killing nature, but this kind of movies don't serve as a cautionary tale but add to the corruption. I also don't get how the director dares to preach when probably he has a bigger ecological footprint that normal folks. I will boycott his movies for the rest of my life. It should be banned."

"webarber-63716","1","2","5","21 September 2019"," It's not allegory if its obvious.
","Mother! is very heavy-handed. It constantly bludgeons the audience with biblical allegory but it's done at such an inartful and elementary level that there's no room for the metaphorical. The result is that by about halfway through you throw your hands up because it's so nonsensical. It has neither an actual plot nor moves in any real direction. Its like watching a kindergartner describe their day: this happened then this happened then this....There is no point! There is no story, just a recital of events.<br/><br/>What a pretentious bore. It's intentionally cloudy and Aranofsky seems to have thrown some elements in simply to obfuscate and make a certain portion of the audience think he's oh so smart. I need some smart person to explain to me for example what the point was of having Mother add ochre to her water and drink it whenever she didn't feel well. Just to remind us that she's Mother Earth? We get it!! I almost gave up on it about halfway through but thought to myself, maybe something interesting will happen yet. Nope. Just more pretentiousness. God is narcissistically insane apparently, as ""Him"" keeps repeating the same events over and over, presumably trying to get different results. Why else bother? At one point he says to create is what he does. I guess an eternal being has to entertain themself somehow. Seriously, at its core this movie is actually incredibly anti-religion. None of the zealots that come to visit Him have any redeeming qualities at all, not a single one, and in fact each of them seems to represent one of the worst qualities in humankind. Him craves their adulation though and thus overlooks their innate shortcomings.<br/><br/>To those that think this movie is some sort of existential masterpiece, Aranofsky is laughing at you. What exactly do you think his point was? That we had better change our ways or we'll be rebooted? It would seem that we're going to end up that way anyway so maybe his message was actually go party before you die lol. Other movies have strived for ""experience"" and succeeded but there has to be an endgame for it to work. 2001 A Space Odyssey comes to mind. Mother! has no payoff for the two hour investment. It's junk and I wish I had turned it off halfway thru so that I would always wonder if it ever got any better instead of knowing it unbelievably gets worse."
"jessirainey","6","2","5","5 September 2019"," Bardem is not god.
","When this film came out, I read several critiques and decided to wait until it hit the small screen. I can see how it would be overwhelming and emotional on the big screen, but I disagree with everyone who says Bardem is god.<br/><br/>Even if Aronofsky meant for the character to be god, I still disagree. For the fundamental reason that the character cannot create without either the contribution of Mother or through experiences that feed his ego. A true God or god doesn't need an outside force to create and certainly doesn't thrive on adoration.<br/><br/>I can go with Lawrence as a Mother, both literally and figuratively. She creates and outside forces can lead to destruction and rebirth but as something new which can just as easily be destructive or good.<br/><br/>For me, Bardem is Man (yes, I know that Aronofsky has a different character labeled man, he obviously didn't think this through). Man tries to stand on his own and accept the Love of Mother which becomes confining and insufficient because Mother doesn't need anything else but to create and love Man.<br/><br/>Enters stage right, worldly imperfect stuff which is shiny, dirty, chaotic, and constantly reaffirming in new ways the value of Man. The opposite of Mother. Both Man in his desire and need for more and the worldly imperfect stuff destroys Mother because her existence doesn't depend on them and the 2 cannot coexist. They are completing for Man. Man is like a lizard in the desert, constantly moving to the next shiny object to feed his insatiable appetite. Man realizes both that Mother can never be enough and he needs to confine her as the next shiny object to show off.<br/><br/>Thus, Mother attempts to destroy Man and the stuff but ultimately becomes another object for Man to possess and show off as an accomplishment.<br/><br/>This never ending circle will always lead to the ultimate destruction of Mother because Man is vain and requires chaos instead of the safety of the Mother who can provide love but that is never enough."

","First rule of going to see Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, Black Swan) movie is to be open minded and not to freak out when he starts to throw out stuff that in first might not make sense but you need to let the feeling take over you. Loving couple gets their paradise interrupted upon arrival of strange visitor and it just picks up from there to things that you can't imagine that Aronofsky saw. In moment that movie ends and you are leaving theater there are voices of people talking - What did I just see -, -What just happened-, -This is one of the worst movies I saw-, -I don't get it- and just then you find couple people fighting with themselves trying to figure out bigger picture of it and frankly told you need to spend some time putting peaces together because it ain't easy at first. In moment you realize how magnificent and full of lively metaphors movie is you are mind blown with how little director/writer of movie can do. Darren Aronofsky made a huge venture in trying to transform bigger picture to movie screen which seems impossible until you see and realize it. His great and masterful directing skills are all over the movie and there is only place to enjoy it at it's best without losing a sight of his vision. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem gave a pretty tight and so nice to watch performances filled with constant emotions of all kind. Appearance of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer was also quite noticeable because of their class and acting skills that will never disappoint you. Only thing that might get you angry is complexity that movie presents and puts on you to figure out but you can't be thrown off because of that. One of the biggest visionary picture that came in years and that probably will change how you look at movies deserves a praise for being bold and trying to present itself in the best and beautiful way possible. Beautiful, bold, mind bending, emotional. 3.5/4"
"paulijcalderon","6","2","5","29 September 2017"," Can you care for the metaphors? Sort of.. For the most part
","Hmm. This is a difficult one to talk about. I really understand why it's so divisive among people. I saw this in the cinema and at a point a person sitting two rows behind loudly said: ""This is the stupidest movie I've seen"". I have to agree that it's a strange movie but could it make me care for what was going on? Yeah, kind of actually.. For the most part. I enjoyed some things about it, but that's mainly whenever it goes in a more minimalist and subtle direction. The brutality/chaos is affecting to a point, but you can only go so far before the disturbing elements go on your nerves and you get lost. I'm standing in the middle with this movie. I cannot rate this in a proper way. Not yet at least. Everything about the story is a metaphor. That's clear as day and that's also what can make the movie a little difficult to get through. When you have characters who are merely supposed to be representations of a metaphor it's easy for it to turn out very hollow. But, the actors give a huge effort in making their characters seem as alive as possible which is what helps carry your interest. They do appear as real and emotional people. It's just sometimes annoying when the metaphor becomes so clear that it makes them out to be vessels and not actual people to care for.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is atmospheric with tension filled chunks sprinkled throughout. There's a somewhat grounded feel to it, so it's for sure the part of the movie that most audience members will like because it's easy to follow. The second half goes of the rails into an extreme, savage and fierce zone. I enjoyed the quietness at the beginning, but it got carried away quickly. Yet, I could still care for the lives of our metaphorical characters. I can't help but to feel bad for them when you understand the frustration that's going on. At a point you really want to chase these annoying intruders away. That element of intrusion and overstepping boundaries came across in a great way. The extreme brutality in the later half got so beat into my head that I began to check out. It was just metaphor after metaphor. I understood what it wanted to say, but it was to such an extreme that it got distracting and took me out of the immersion. If it hadn't been so overly clear as to what it was representing I would have had a more interesting experience. Because when you know that this character is just supposed to be this, then the impact isn't felt the same way. I'm sorry, but that's what held the movie back for me. It's essentially a re-telling of a certain thing which I'm not gonna give away if you haven't seen it. And if/when you understand what it's re-telling then everything becomes all the more predictable.<br/><br/>So, what made it work? Many things that happened still came across as extremely frustrating in the right way. I found it easy to side with Jennifer Lawrence' character yet it didn't judge all the wrong decisions Javier Bardem's character made. You get that all he wants is to do good, but he has trouble knowing when enough is enough. Lawrence wants to live in peace in the house without annoying people overstaying their welcome. The motivation was understandable on both sides, so that was good. It's possible to throw the metaphorical thing out the door and follow the narrative that you see on screen. It can sort of work, but then again it gets so obvious at the end. I felt both annoyed and emotionally devastated when the film ended. I liked it and not liked it at the same time. So, it's a weird reaction. Should you see it? Sure. I know it will make you feel something. Whether it's confusion, happiness, sadness or anger - It's all understandable. There's no wrong opinion."

","The trailer is totally miss leading, as it would probably lead to believe you're about to see a horror film. <br/><br/>So what kind of film is this?<br/><br/>Action: there is some action but not the kind of action you're used to. Biography: there is a birth and a death, but this is not a biography. Drama: dramatic but not usual drama. Horror: horrific (very horrific) but definitely not a horror film. Fiction: based on a best-selling book but not fiction in the normal sense. Thriller: more shocking than thrilling. Fantasy: I'll pick this, as it's hard to categorise. <br/><br/>These are the religious metaphors I picked up, there are many, many more<br/><br/>The house is their paradise = Eden. Javier Bardem = God. Crowds of people ascend on the house = worshipers from far and wide. Jennifer Lawrence = Mary, gets pregnant towards the end of the film. Javier Bardem = God who gives up his only child. Screenplay written in 6 days = the creation. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are the visitors = Adam and Eve. Ed has a chest injury = A plucked rib. Ed and Michelle have two sons, one of whom kills the other out of jealousy = Cain and Abel. The precious crystal = the Apple. Jennifer insists Ed and Michelle never enter Javier's office, of course they do. She then insists they never touch the crystal on display, of course they do, and they break it and are banished from the room and it is sealed up. Eventually Javier overcomes his writers block and completes a piece of work = the New Testament, or 10 commandments, or another religious article. The newborn baby = Jesus. The newborn is killed by the crowd and is eaten = crucifixion and the bread offering during Eucharist.<br/><br/>Every religious metaphor you could possibly imagine. I can't recommend this film to a religious person or horror fan."
"kgprophet","5","2","5","20 September 2017"," ""The Guest Who Wouldn't Leave"" meets ""Rosemary's Baby""?
","My conjecture at what this movie is about is a question mark because I wonder even if the filmmaker knows what he has concocted. Above all else, you will have a hard time predicting what will happen next in this nightmare movie. You get the impression about midway that this film is playing upon a woman's fears after just getting married and later having children. It provides nightmare images from her point of view throughout, giving you a strong feeling that Jennifer Lawrence is just on some heavy meds. <br/><br/>It is hard to recommend this movie on it's face. It runs long, has some rather repetitive story moments, and provokes flat out laughter at some of the directions the story takes. One thing for sure, don't try to make sense of it. Jennifer Lawrence is a newlywed fixing up a creaky old house for her poet husband Javier Bardem. Bardem is well cast, because it's hard to read a guy who although seemingly well-intentioned, has a foreign demeanor. Hence the Rosemary's Baby connection. The husband has an agenda that leaves the wife all to her lonesome. <br/><br/>But then, a guest arrives. Then his wife. Then his two sons. Then other friends. It is like a Monty Python sketch. By the third act, this absurdity caused laughter to ring through the auditorium. Something I wonder if Director/Writer Darren Aronofsky really intended. What makes this movie watchable is the guessing game about whether the REAL freaked out person is Lawrence or Bardem. Lawrence is seen taking some kind of medication (or is it a potion?). We get some Lynchian imagery that suggests the house is alive(?!). Bardem becomes withdrawn as he suffers from writer's block.<br/><br/>There are fun moments along this creepy kooky ride, and only starts to drag near the end. I think some of the story could have been condensed, and find our way to the inexplicable explanation a little sooner. I guess what I am really ultimately trying to conclude is whether the director has a method to his madness, or just wants to toss together a bunch of unnerving scenes that play like your nightmare's greatest hits. Such as going to a formal gathering in your pajamas. Or someone taking your newborn baby and letting him get handled by an unruly mob. Or getting assaulted yourself. <br/><br/>Much attention is paid to the creepy old house. Perhaps it is only a manifestation of Lawrence? Or Bardem? Or his admirers that find God in his poetry? The ending only seems to partially explain. Perhaps also deliberately not revealing everything. Perhaps the director was just finding a bunch of annoying things that a self-centered artist can commit in a relationship. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the long running time and the moments of absurdity means you should probably wait until the DVD comes out."

","This movie is just great. However it's not easy to get right away and if you don't get it, it might end up be very confusing or even stupid. Judging by the reviews here many people didn't really get it. Before going to the cinema drop all of your expectations, it's not a horror, it's not a sequel to Rosemaries Baby or a rip off, it's not a psychological thriller even though at times it certainly look like all of those.<br/><br/>This is a biblical or rather theological story. It's full of metaphors and symbolism. Maybe you won't see it in the beginning but as the movie progresses things become clearer. I almost walked out of the cinema in the middle of screening... but I'm glad I didn't. I'm not going to talk about form or technical stuff here, I will just talk about the essence of the story<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>So this is a story about God or Creator or however you want to call it and Mother or Nature or a goddess as he calls her few time during the movie. The creator and the caretaker, the male and female symbol. The house is Earth, the first visitor is Adam and his wife is Eve (she was created from Adam's rib which you can see in the scene where Adam is throwing up and God is hiding his injured rib) Their sons represent Abel and Cain. The child that gets ripped to pieces and eaten is obviously Jesus Christ. It's a story about the tragedy of humankind.<br/><br/>Don't bother reading reviews that obviously missed this completely, take my advice and go and see the movie, you won't regret it."

","There are small moments in this movie that deserves repeat viewing. It's aggravating but different. It follows no template of Hollywood films, but you think it should. And it gives proper credit to a heart-wrenching sound design.<br/><br/>This will go down in history as a movie overlooked in retarded 2017 (I say this because theater watchers are texting, talking morons...I've yet to go to a theater recently that a idiot didn't do any of the above mentioned). This is far more important of a film, yes, stupid idiots who didn't ""get it"" this is a film NOT a movie because Jennifer Lawrence is in it. Rex Reed, movie critic HATED it. Claiming it to be misogynistic and pretentious. It's not a MOVIE Rex, it's an experience. Yet no one can absorb movies anymore, because they can only casually watch. This film is everything. For me, it was the decline of society who idolizes celebrity and selg-righteous indignation. For you, most likely something else. ""mother!"" is it all. Much like the title character, they give and give and give everything and...it still amounts to jerks who watch this film and want something more. That's the point. There is nothing left to give. And you're ungrateful."
"justin-209-152796","10","4","15","2 October 2017"," A near perfect allegory for what it takes to make a movie. (And how all the critics illustrate the point perfectly)
","Here's my interpretation of mother! Major spoilers ahead. <br/><br/>The film is as much about Jesus/The Bible as much as it is about a house. The parallels are there, but I see it way more as a shorthand way to tell the many small allegories that get us to the actual point the movie is trying to make. This movie is autobiographical. I just didn't happen to make it. Aronofsky made it, and it's clearly OF him and the movie is more about making a movie than any movie I've ever seen. I repeat, this movie only uses religious elements to help tell the story and inform the situations. That is not what it is about. <br/><br/>The mother! (as played by Jennifer Lawrence) is actually Aronofsky trying to make a film. He is slowly toiling away, rebuilding the house since the last time a film was made. He is working hard to provide a foundation, but that is only so that it can be torn down again when that all happens.<br/><br/>Him (as played by Javier Bardem) is the screenplay itself. It is powerful, noble, and loyal, but it is not owned by anyone but itself. Especially not its creator (Aronofsky or the mother.)<br/><br/>ACT 1: Him toils to be a thing. It can't write, it can't find the words since the last time it burnt down, but it wants to. So it ""lives,"" it invites ""life into this house"" and opens itself to turmoil and passion and the outside world. Through a series of cause and effect and Cain and Abel symbolism and Michelle Pfeiffer's character being a rude house guest, all this stuff happens which results in ""The film"" and ""The filmmaker"" making love and creating a baby. mother wakes up and knows she is pregnant. i.e. she has an idea. Inspirado! Immediately thereafter the film starts writing itself (Him) starts writing feverishly and much as anyone who has created a thing knows, the piece itself will dictate and determine where it wants to go. As a creative, it's best (and sometimes the only option) to be the shepherd for the piece. You ultimately have to allow for the story to grow and become a thing on its own. Trying to make it exactly what you want will only open it up to be nothing that you want. Michelle Pfeiffer can be very mean and forward about making a new ""baby"" because she isn't talking about a human life, she's talking about Aronofsky's next film. Which, to be honest, is exactly what happens. The moment you walk out of a theater after watching the premiere showing of your latest film, people will ask you how long it will take to get the next one. The appetite is insatiable. People don't talk about babies that way, but they have no problem with talking about pieces of art that way.<br/><br/>ACT 2: Through furious bouts of creation the screenplay has been written, it is in the hands of the masses (agents, producers, potential distributors, adoring fans) and very quickly, the screenplay itself gets overwhelmed. It is its own entity. Its creator (mother) tries to keep it to itself but it can't. It no longer owns it even though ""you're the inspiration."" So the script for the film itself is ripped away and goes rogue. It LOVES the attention. And the whole process gets more and more feverish. Crazy things happen while that baby is gestating, which is the actual completed film waiting to be. If you've seen the movie, you know that IT GETS BONKERS. It becomes a literal battlefield. This is the filmmaking process. This actually doesn't even take that long. The time-lines pretty much make sense. The filmmaker is being battered and beaten up and tossed around during this process. But he/she desperately wants to hold onto the baby (which is the actual completed film). Simultaneously he/she wants to retain his connection to the screenplay and everything it embodies. <br/><br/>ACT 3: So there they sit, silent, in a room. It actually takes well over a day, which is longer than it took to get shot, because that all basically happened in one night. The mother holds onto her baby. She is nursing it and trying her absolute best to hold onto it. To keep it her own for as long as possible and protect it from the outside world. But the end of this story is inevitable. The film is ripped from her hands and given to the masses. They have waited so long for this moment. And what do they do this entity? This finished baby that they have all taken ownership over? They literally rip it to shreds. They eat it. They own it now. They have consumed it and torn it to pieces. He/she doesn't own it at all anymore.<br/><br/>Then the world collapses on itself. The house that was built for this story burns down to the ground. An explosion of fire makes it so that the only option is to start from scratch again. And it will happen... the screenplay, the film, the creation, must start anew. In the ashes there is a diamond, a crystal, a small world of hope. This contains the Inspirado for the next one.<br/><br/>Soon, the mother returns. She is different, but she is the same. And the process begins itself anew."

","I've become aware that it's rare that mainstream movies take risks in making you think about the overall plot outside of the running time. A trailer makes you want to come in and make yourself comfortable, entertains us a certain way and we all get used to that level of entertainment without further questions after the credits roll. And then, there's films like ""mother!"" that come in and can really challenge a audience for surface level interpretation or deeper meanings.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays a nameless woman married to Javier Bardem, a nameless man as well as they live in a large house within the wilderness as he is trying to find inspiration for writing a new book. Suddenly, a couple comes to their house, and is allowed to stay despite Jennifer's resistance to these strangers and then eventually, things spiral far out of control. (Anything past this plot is a spoiler I swear.)<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, if you are not into art house or metaphorical horror films, stay far away from this one. Not that it's necessarily bad, but I can tell this is the type of movie that will leave some audience members completely alienated in it's form of storytelling. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier both give compelling performances as you can tell their's a strain within their relationship that isn't said but instead seen within their eyes.<br/><br/>The third act is when the film goes completely insane on screen. Like ""Most Insane Moments of Events I've Seen in a Movie In At Least 5 Years"".<br/><br/>mother! is a film, that is worth seeing at least for sensory reasons. From a technical standpoint, this film has a lot of highlights from its sound design and atmosphere. The pacing feels fairly off, but makes a bit more sense after looking back at the film. Just be prepared for a mind trip unlike most major studio films."

"esthercross","8","3","10","7 October 2017"," Haunted most by the regimented linen draw
","I had read enough to be deterred on reasonable grounds from watching this film so I went in with my expectations around shin level but exited to get a slice of the scandal. The conditions where perfect I was on the front row of an impressive screen with sound quality reverberating in my bones I was completely thrust into the mother house where the whole story takes place. The audio in this film is very effective, even the quieter sounds get eerily under your skin. For anyone who takes to YouTube for the ASMR videos, then the noise quality of Jennifer Laurence mixing paint shades will massage your ear drums royally. J-law's character 'Her' (as credited) represents an purely natural entity with garden of Eden updoo's and clothed in crisp Cotten whites. The grading and texture quality of this film early on is almost oily, like a still life painting - the serene calm before humanities gory metaphorical decline. Very early on we see her mixing powders and spreading them lovingly on the wall and giving the same attentive warmth to her cold husband. The more we see her nurturing the house the more we feel her becoming dangerously intertwined within the very fabric of the home. There has been question over the genre of this film, whether or not it slots into the horror genre. I certainly felt a bizarre discomfort during this film. Not just because 'Her' life is snatched up by chaos but because of the lifeless, inescapable beige prison 'Her' was creating around herself. The moment she opens the militantly ordered linen draw it makes you feel the sting of unease when even just one unannounced guest arrives, let alone the horrors to come. The unresolved conflict for me in this film was how the seemingly picturesque woodland house was lacking in humanity but when the humans arrive a different kind of horror erupts and you get a sense that there is no optimum ground to be found within this story and this made me feel relentlessly uncomfortable. 'Mother!' Is very much like watching a piece of instillation theatre where it doesn't seem like there is a substantial plot but it certainly feels like you are in amongst the escalating action. I felt a certain degree of motion sickness coming out of this film as the camera seems to make a lot of quick spiralling shots. It almost almost mimics the snapping round of the head when you hear a sound over your shoulder. Very effective, but also very effective in making me feel slightly woozy. For me; 'mother!' felt like something I hadn't experienced before, it was fearless and left me exhausted and for that I have to give 'mother!' my respect."

","Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother"" is a show, both technical and scripted, full of biblical metaphors and human nature, we have tension and anguish, love and hate, repulsion and seduction, the film where the lousy and perfect go hand in hand, a cinematic experience for some, or a badly made and meaningless thriller for others, highly criticized by expert critics and the general public, ""Mother"" is one of the best movies of the year, but it's not for everyone. Some directors abuse silly and superficial stories, others make complex films, and full of too many metaphors, Darren does both, he tells a story to people, a common story, nothing unusual, but the subcontext and metaphors tell other stories, other films, such as his great ""Black Swan"" film that can be seen 3 times in a row, you will see 3 different stories, and only those who already know this background of the director, could be sure and not only suspicious, that his long, is a metaphor for human nature based on biblical passages, that is, its script, is great, I would not say perfect, because, for the public that prefers to stay on the surface of the film, will finish the film without fully understanding the film, only the viewer the more vile it will end with a smile on his face, as well as heart-pounding and eating nails, carrying, the script that tells the story of a couple tormented by strange visitors, escapes the palatá and even so, Darren manages to make the viewer extremely agonized and tense, unlike ""Requien para um Sonho"", where he makes the viewer turn the face of anguish without even needing to drop a drop of blood, here no, violence exists here, it is not completely explicit, but even so, it seems to shock more and more, because it is a cowardly violence and that causes reflection on who is glazed in the film. Javier is God seeking perfection, Jeniffer is the house itself, which is in the case is the land, that is, it is nature, nature that is at all times trying to repair human evils, church, politics, birth, all this is addressed in the film, even the globalization and mystification of the world is approached in 2 scenes of 20 seconds, passing through genesis, and the apocalypse, ""Mother"" is a great re-reading of the bible, I do not even have to say that the first couple of intruders is Adam and Eve, and then Cain and Abel, and finally, mystification and human beings, understanding the chaos of the bible, and nature itself applied to just one house, is a great and perfect metaphor, a film that reminds me of ""Antichrist"" by Lars Von Trier, for his perfectionism in retelling and provoking reflection in a different, polemical and heartwarming way, ""Mother"" is a visceral film. As ""Run"" managed to do this year, ""Mother"" also holds us in the chair, the film had absolutely everything to have a slow and tiring rhythm, but Darren amends a narrative arc in the other without space, we can not even see the hours on the clock, besides the great rhythm, which is more merit of the script than of the montage, other aspects that deserve palms, not only palms, but indication to the Oscar, are, first, the great direction of art of the film, that aligned to a photograph that oppresses at the same time that contrasts with the clear and with the good visual effects, the other aspect that looses to the eyes, or rather to the ears, is the spectacular edition and sound mixing. this is the one that overwhelms most the viewer, because often it is misaligned and very acute, it bothers, the noise of everything is very emphasized, often remembering the great film ""Repulse to the Sex"", when leaving the theater and giving in the face of the mall crowd, you will feel bad, and you will notice and notice details in people who previously went unnoticed, I think the Oscar sound categories this year already have owners (Baby Driver and Dunkirk), but it's worth a lot the indication. Javier Barden and Ed Harris are fine, but the film is by Jennifer Lawrence, I've never been a big fan of the actress, and I even think she did not deserve the Oscar nor his last nomination, but here, here she is sensational, steals the movie she is ""Mae"", nature, the world, is a grandiose character even within her naiveté and ignorance, and Jeniffer is completely committed to the role and makes a great performance. Darren Aronofsky is for me the best director of the new generation, and this film only reinforces my thinking. The film was voiced and booed at the same time during its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2017, and that says a lot about the movie, love or hate, for me, ""Mother"" is a spectacular movie."

","""Mother"" must be read alongside with ""Melancholia"" by Von Trier. In both movies, the melancholia of the first character is projected to the reality, and the whole world has become melancholic, as our real world actually is. In ""Melancholia"", the name of a hard and meaningless object is the name of movie: A planet which threatens the whole earth! but in ""mother"" the melancholic metaphor is lied beneath the everyday life of a woman, her husband, and the child. After you experience the very core feeling of being a mother (as an audience), the movie takes you far beyond: the realization of melancholic feelings. From the psychoanalytical point of view, the mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is not simply melancholic: she starts from obsession, and she dreams about making their home a paradise. But eventually, her husband, the intruder (as every child experience his/her father), allow every terrestrial intruders in her paradise. So, as they intruders kills her child, her heart becomes stoned, and finds the infinite feminine power of ""Medea"" in herself! To kill and destroy anything. If you want find yourself in the movie, you cannot be anything but an intruder, they are representing our world and us generally. So, when ""mother""'s husband (which is the god for all people in the movie), send the baby to the public, they sacrifice the baby and brutally eat his blood, such as an spiritual ceremony. It is therefore an Anti-Christ version of the myth of ascend/descend. But at the end of movie, the Father/God (Javier Bardem) saves the mother as its purest (by killing her, and extracting her heart), in the shape of a big beautiful diamond, which is extracted from the burnt heart of the mother. That is how God and Satan are colleagues, and the only salvation for humanity remains not in reaching out God, but in the feminine act."

","'MOTHER!': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new psychological horror flick from writer/director Darren Aronofsky, and starring Jennifer Lawrence (the two are now a couple as well). The story revolves around a woman who's quaint life, living with her poet husband in a quiet country home, is severely disrupted when a mysterious couple shows up wanting to stay at their house. The movie costars Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's gotten polarized reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it disappointed at the Box Office as well. I found it to be really weird, creepy and hard to watch, but at the same time it's also extremely interesting and quite memorable. <br/><br/>The story begins with a woman, called Mother (Lawrence), materializing in a bed and waking up from her sleep. She begins searching her quiet country house, for her husband, Him (Bardem). Him is a poet with writer's block, and his creative struggles have caused distress among their once happy home. Then two strangers unexpectedly show up (Harris and Pfeiffer). Him welcomes them into their house without questions, while Mother fears what damage the mysterious couple could possibly do. Things become even more complicated, and distressful for Mother, from there. <br/><br/>Like all of Aronofsky's movies, the film is completely bizarre and unpleasant to sit through. Also like his films 'NOAH' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', this movie is another biblical analogy about creation, life and God. As dark and weird as it all is, the film does have some very insightful things to say about people's belief in Jesus Christ, and the Christian Lord. I think the movie is very effective in this way. I can definitely see why so many viewers have hated the film so far (it's gotten an F rating from theatergoers), but I think the right audience should definitely still enjoy it. Lawrence gives another amazing performance in the movie, and the story will leave you thinking about things in it for days (weeks, months and perhaps years). It's another unique 'near masterpiece' from Darren Aronofsky (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234"

","I went to see this film based on the strength of the reviews here. Any film that garners this many angry ""Worst Film Ever"" and ""Total Waste of Time"" reviews clearly packs a punch, and I couldn't wait to see it. And I was duly rewarded.<br/><br/>Audacious, sprawling, cheeky, stimulating, and heaps of fun. Aronofsky keeps us guessing throughout and I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. The visual language is intricate, unexpected, assaultive, and ultimately thought provoking without being overly serious. The result is a deliciously artful send up, the experience of which stays with you for days. <br/><br/>All in all a brilliant film with only a few flaws. Jennifer Lawrence is miscast here, and clearly out of her league next to Bardem, Pfiefer, and Harris. And a very minor technical point: Some of the CGI is a bit cheesy, but I suppose that adds to the lighthearted fun."
"trevor-82944","5","3","10","15 September 2017"," Freaky Stressful Questions That May Not Be Answered
","A young woman's eyes stare at us from what appears to be hell, then the image of a man (Javier Bardem) pulls a fire veined crystal out of his burnt home, restoring it back to normal. The restoration brings his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) out of bed, in search for her husband amongst the empty rooms.<br/><br/>Mother! focuses in on a famous writer who locks himself in his writer's den while his overworked wife repairs the entire house on her own. We see here a presumably distanced, unhealthy marriage, one that by the end should hopefully trigger some good conversation about proper healthy gender roles in a marriage.<br/><br/>The wife's wardrobe acutely projects her precise emotional state throughout Darren Aronofsky's (Black Swan) film; she first wears a opaque see-through night gown, then dresses in either all frail- white or all wooly-gray, depending on her inner security. These costumes designed by Danny Glicker (Milk, Up in the Air) contrast her against these satanic visions she has from inside the supposedly inanimate house, as if it knows her true feelings better than she does. Sure enough, we travel deep into her psychological state mostly through close-ups on her unstable face. Nothing about her thoughts is left to the imagination once her husband starts letting these strangers stay in their place.<br/><br/>The octagon-shaped home itself almost seems like a character itself, as it resides far away from civilization in a grain field. The wife never once sets foot out of the boarded wood, almost as if she and he house are one in the same.<br/><br/>Somehow, more and more visitors come to the house's evil workings. First, a dying man to wants to visit the author who lives there, then his slutty lover moves in too, then their sons start a Cain- and- Abel fight, leaving the wife alone with a pool of blood to mop up. Everything from here violates her space as house fights, raves, demolishment, robberies, and even the SWAT team turn her house into a warzone. They came just to worship her author husband, attention he simply adores despite the deadly chaos. The noise levels become so loud you can barely hear her screams as her petite, silver dress gets gradually distressed. You truly feel sorrow for her while everything over a single evening grows worse to near-cultic levels; none of these terroristic visitors even once acknowledge her as anything more than property.<br/><br/>This entire sequence is both the film's greatest asset and greatest blow, as it expresses its true distance from reality. These terrorists lack believability as they demolish the home; their behavior could possibly stem from the house's evil energy, but little was established to authenticate my theory.<br/><br/>The feature's very last frame leaves the viewer with a reality twist that leaves behind more questions than answers as to everything seen. When I say questions, I mean the kind that leaves you less thinking about the ultimate theme, and more about the ""masterful"" work of the director.<br/><br/>Other classic horror films depicted evil spirits with ""open to fan theory"" moments, while also keeping grounded in reality. Ironic, as various plot points here virtually copy both Rosemary's Baby and The Shining, both of which remained subtle in their interpretive imagery, which Mother! abuses.<br/><br/>What made the message even less effective came from the acting, mainly by Miss Lawrence. She was supposed to appear compassionate compared to everyone else around her, except the Oscar winning actress did nothing with her eyes to evoke sympathy. She even unintentionally cracked me up pretty hard from her blank line deliveries and ear-screeching screams, especially when under really bad burnt makeup effects. I'm serious, any other a-list, b-list, or even c-list actress could have played her part better.<br/><br/>I guess I can understand why she put so little care into her role, as it was written with too much passivity to bring out the independent woman empowerment it clearly intended. It never clarified what exactly she fears; is it the house itself, the strangers, or her husband? While we're at it, what does she even see in her husband if he disrespects her so often? Even if she fears aloneness, such weakness in character consequently ruins her sympathetic appeal.<br/><br/>It makes you wonder: what if the gender roles swapped? What if the wife played the ungrateful workaholic while her husband did the cleaning? What if the women were played by unattractive actresses by talented unknowns possibly from a different ethnicity? Aronofsky may have addressed the wrong questions, yet with what he does expose us to, it helps to initiate some talking and listening for once."

","Mother! is a well-made movie, but it will upset a lot of people. Personally, I didn't have much of problem with this movie, but I still don't know what I really think about it. There's a lot to like about this movie from its cinematography to Jennifer Lawrence's great performance, but this movie is still hard to digest. It's a weird movie that mixes horror and tension with weird humor and shock value. This is definitely a movie I have to watch again."
"horrorgasm","Null","3","11","14 February 2018"," Don't listen to any of our stupid reviews, just watch it yourself.
","It's baffling to me that so many people seem to have completely missed the point of this movie. Stop. Before you start slapping me with your go-to label of ""pretentious"", this is NOT a complicated movie. This isn't some David Lynch movie where every frame needs to be dissected for hidden psychological meaning. It couldn't be more simple. It's a retelling of the most commonly known Bible stories. The ones that are so common that they're comparable to knowing who Santa Claus is. You don't need to be a genius or a theology major or even to have read the Bible in full to have heard the most basic elements of the Christian creation myth such as Adam and Eve. <br/><br/>If you feel that such an simple concept is trying to condescend to you or insult your intelligence somehow, that says a lot more about your level of intelligence and insecurity than it does about this movie. You know what intelligent people do when faced with something they don't understand? They ask questions. They seek answers. They even do something as simple as a Google search. <br/><br/>What they don't do is lash out and mindlessly rage against something because they felt it threatened their intelligence. Let me tell you, the only thing threatening your intelligence in that situation is your behavior. If you spent half as much time just swallowing your foolish pride and looking up theories on a movie like this as you did writing a sad excuse for a review that does nothing but parade around your own willful ignorance, maybe you could have enjoyed this movie for what it was instead of making yourself miserable out of pointless stubbornness.<br/><br/>I guess it could be worse though. You could be on the other end of the spectrum, throwing ""pretentious"" at this for the opposite reason, because you think you're so far above this kind of thing, and somehow completely blind to the irony of you calling something pretentious while you preen about you're so much more clever than it. Hey, maybe throw ""self-indulgent"" in there a few more times while you're at it, without ever stopping to think how ridiculous it is to use that as a derogatory term in reference to art. Only thing worse than a fool is a fool that's convinced themselves that they're clever...<br/><br/>Anyway, watch this movie and decide for yourself. Don't let any of these misguided sourpusses with personal hang-ups lead you astray (myself included, make up your own mind). I almost listened to them and skipped this movie myself, and I would have missed out on one of the best movies of 2017."

","Mother was one of the best movies I've seen this year with incredibly clever writing and performances. <br/><br/>This was my take on the movie. The whole movie is an analogy of the bible and humanities perspective of God. The house represents paradise/the garden of Eden, with the husband representing god. The husband invites a man and a women into their home who represent Adam and Eve. The prized jewel represents the forbidden fruit. When the couple mess up and break the jewel this reflects Adam and Eve eating the fruit followed by the husband/God ordering them to leave. The couples sons who represent Cain and Abel arrive and kill each other. The blood stain on the floor that won't clean represents sin/mark of Cain. The other guests represent humanity and mankind. When they come into their homemade house/world/perfect creation they cause chaos, anarchy and destruction. Jennifer Lawrence questions why her husband won't get rid of their guests/humanity because of how destructive they are but he won't. This represents God's love for humanity and the hope that he can restore relationship between them. The baby obviously represents Jesus which initially causes peace followed by his murder by the husbands fans/so called followers. With Jenifer Lawrence dying breath she gives her husband/God her love which mends this broken relationship with the fall of man/mental fans. The writers block represents the years of silence of God between the old and new testament. At the end of the movie we see a new actress wake in the bed representing a new heaven and earth with followers of God receiving a new body."

The way it messes with important human values is made to drain the spectator, its a never ending hell. I had never seen people leaving the cinema before, such a unconfortable master piece. I cant describe it"
"emmanuel-mg-87","9","3","11","23 September 2017"," Masterpiece from Aronofsky 10/10
","Let's start saying that this ""review"" is not for the people, it's for the respect that this cleaver living film deserves, and i want to be clear that i know that my own perception is not going to give any meaning (or take it) to this film, it is already what it is.<br/><br/>Reading parts of some reviews in here, i could notice that so many people dislikes this film, and i didn't know why; Those reviews even make me doubt a little about the film and his creator (shame on you), but the film is perfect., for moments reminds me to Tarkovsky, von Trier, but its way too different, in a good way. <br/><br/>And after seeing the film, i know the ""why"" (people dislikes the film) its to much, to big, and doesn't slow down., i Will NOT spoil anything, just going to put some basics clear., Aronofsky as other talented minds in the film industry has created a path that we can follow, but when its about to describe some characteristic style or his own personal mark in films, the thing is clear, he changes through his films, he develops and increases the complexity of the plot and characters. <br/><br/>So ""Mother!"" (and with the possibility that i am overexcited about what i just saw) i can say that Aronofsky, as always, has crated something that breakes any mold, any rules or paradigms, and goes beyond of expectations and limits of his own films Mother! Is AMAZING, it's Greate, convoluted, with so many layers, Life, death, nature, humankind, love, god, end of times? All this in a metaphoric visual and breathing whole, a glimpse of history and existence. <br/><br/>The main problem with this film (becaus it exist) is the next: people the same film establishes this as a concept in the narrative and plot, people (you) that lives without knowing nothing, and I'm not going to apologize if someone or somehow this people feels offended, (you started) because they are disrespecting something bigger than them, something that Will even live longer tan them, and something that they Will never be able to understand. Some people doesn't appreciate art (i don't like that Word either), but this film is not that (only) it's smartness, intelligence, complexity. But if you are different, and if you are just worried that your great director of always, perhaps, missed the target with this film, FEAR NOT, just go and watch it just remember Aronofsky made it bigger and deeper this time, so watch for the symbolism's, metaphors, everything hides a piece of this puzzle. And remember, a film (proper film) is not made for the audiences, it's made to search and find, to develop and visualize, to give life to an idea, to create a philosophy, and a view from a different unique perspective, and this film is not the exception, it's not made for you, and me, so, it's not made to confuse you, or trick you, not the hidden things, not the unusual way to deliver the message, not the symbolism or metaphor, those things., exist as a vessel, and in this case, the only vessel that could deliver this complexity, this bigger reasoning. everything in this film exist as a piece in a clockwork that makes function the entire concept correctly, a masterfully crafted and tridimensional vessel of thinking., ideas, visual, sound  all three together., there is no way to some one could explain to any one, what this movie is about, because all the necessary things to explain that, are already in the movie, any other interpretation, video explanatory (youtube) will be incomplete and for so, wrong (and in the case that the explanation is were correct, to hear the words of some one else's it is not to understand).<br/><br/>Its a film of 2 hours that tries and achieves on joining together so many things, that if Aronofsky would like to explain it commonly, it Will became in the longest film ever, the density of the plot it's necessary, it's like a compressed digital file, is a substance, a concentrate, an essence. And i know that not to many % Will be glad with this film/way of thinking, not even my ""reviw"", and that's OK, because the film is not made for the bunch but for the few., and becomes a bitter-sweet sensation, for one side i Will like to see this amazing movie to be recognized for what it is, but at the same time when its not recognized, as sad as it can be, i can appreciate that something this unique do not fall in the minds of ignorant ones, and that compensates just a bit. <br/><br/>For me it's a solid 9, and that's because more tan sure i missed something (even when i do hate give an empty number at something this great), but i Will give a 10 just to put some balance, i'm not trying to be objective in my rate with that 10/10, not when most of the rates are so wrong) <br/><br/>PS. A similar thing happened with NOAH, another amazing film, so please, do not hate what its above your capabilities, learn to embrace your flaws and do something about it. forgive the misspellings, English is not my native. <br/><br/>Thanks IMDb, thank you so much Darren Aronofsky."
"sanjidparvez","8","3","11","23 September 2017"," Is it only about God Vs Mother earth Vs Mankind or more?!
","'mother!' can be defined as Darren Aronofsky's major, bold move into the segment of avant-garde cinema which got a pretty close tie with Horror. While I referred BLACK SWAN as his love letter to Roman Polanski's psychological horror films, now I like to consider this as his own way of homage to some other maestros of cinemafrom Luis Buñuel to Stanley Kubrick, along with twisted flavors of Polanski to Micahel Hanekethe inspirations were evident in this one hell of a magnificently bizarre, odd movie. With a set of nameless characters & the limited set up of a house in the middle of nowhere, Darren Aronofsky made a total allegorical film that manifest itself into multiple layers of meanings or symbolism including religion, politics, troubled conjugal life dealing with fame & personal will etc. The thing that intrigued me most was whenever I tried to reach an idea of what's it actually about, the twists and turns of events just amazed me over & over againlike Aronofsky was saying ""Why so hurry, my friend? I think there's something more that you may find interesting!"" At times while the first half was somewhat like a twisted Hitchcockian thriller directed by Kubrick or Haneke, the second half gradually descends into total chaos & horror which kind of reminded me of the madness of Luis Buñuel's The Exterminating Angel! At the end, you may find an answer to get a relief for a while (like it's all about God Vs Earth Vs Mankind or God & Earth Vs the Mankind) but that may not be the only key to unlock all the doors of confusing & mysterious stuffs happened to that house of strange chaos, triggered by ""few"" suspicious guests & the baffled owners.<br/><br/>In time, I believe this film will become a cult favorite for the ardent horror fans (at least) and can be regard as Darren Aronofsky's a matchless masterpiece which may going to inspire him to work around more closely to the horror territory in future."
"ambrakay","7","3","11","20 September 2017"," Psychological thriller where the audience is the antagonist at times
","I would not recommend this movie as a general movie to watch, as I do with Black Swan. That doesn't mean that it's a bad movie: I mean that, to say that it's not for everyone is an immense understatement. There is symbolism that isn't immediately apparent, but most of it is. There is also a lot of action and dialogue with which to distract you. It does all tie together, but not before inflicting visual and audio trauma. I think that, to get the message across, the extent to which it is disturbing is appropriate. It will appeal to your visceral senses more so than it does rationality, and if your preferred genre is anything other than dark and twisted with elements of insanity, I'd say skip this one."

People who ""don't get it"", expecting conventional plot, will absolutely hate it. People who know what it's about before they see it will absolutely hate it. People who appreciate Aronofsky's previous ventures (let's not talk about Noah) and know how to be an audience, to let the movie tell its tale, who don't fight metaphor/allegory, SHOULD love it. Sure, once you figure it out it might get a bit trying, and for sure it lays it on thicker and thicker until it practically rams the ""twist"" down your throat, but its style and absolutely genius direction will pull you through to the end.

"cappiethadog","7","2","6","22 November 2019"," Fortress of solitude
","The tire jack slipped. Jonathan Kent(Glenn Ford) should have been crushed by his pickup truck, but the fatal contact between man and metal never arrives. The truck is held in suspension by an inordinately strong boy who fell from the sky. Did this alien child need help loading his spacecraft into the man's truck? It's possible. The boy is strong, but short. If he loaded his spacecraft from the side by throwing it into the bed with outstretched arms pointed towards heaven, the weight of the thing could have broken the wheel axle. More than likely, Jonathan opened the door's latch and had his future adopted son ease the thing in from the back. Hopefully, they had a tarp to throw over the UFO. It's not called Smallville for nothing. People talk. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky was once slated to direct ""Man of Steel"", which eventually got made with Zach Snyder at the helm. ""mother!"" is not just Bunuel-built, an homage to ""The Exterminating Angel"", the Spanish surrealist filmmaker's 1962 classic, but also ""Superman"", the 1978 original directed by Richard Lester. Soon after his father's heart attack, young Clark Kent(Jeff East) discovers the florescent green crystal in his spaceship, hidden in the barn. His alien intuition tells him to go north, apparently by foot. Into subzero Arctic air, he flings the green glowing object as far as he needs to. The crystal disappears in the melted snow. It's a building block that transforms earth's snowy landscape into architecture that's uniquely Krypton-esque. Clark is home-schooled, so to speak; a formal education supplied by Jor-el(Marlon Brando) via prerecorded messages leap years ahead of VHS technology. When Clark, in essence, graduates from the Fortress of Solitude, his school and home, and also, a chrysalis of sorts, he emerges as Superman(Christopher Reeve).<br/><br/>A poet, identified as Him(Javier Bardem) never wanted kids. He impregnates mother(Jennifer Lawrence), his wife, only after she emasculates the writer, asking him point blank, as to why their marriage is devoid of physical love? mother gives birth to a son; not in the hospital, but instead, the nursery she put together, because mother never leaves the house. Him, at first glance, isn't a cruel man; his wife seems free to come and go as she pleases, and yet the woman never gets past the front door, never sees what lies beyond the front lawn. Not even with a violent and bloody small-scale war in progress and formation of a cult devoted solely to the poet, mother stays with her unborn child inside the self-designated confines, telling strangers to get off her unbraced sink, and avoiding gunfire. How does ""mother!"" differ from ""The Exterminating Angel""? Is she bourgeois like the dinner guests who can't get past the elegant house's salon? Yes and no. Although a bourgeois/proletariat binary exists in ""mother!"", Aronofsky provides a secondary binary that is given first priority. When Him demands that mother hand over the child, his son; only then does she start to distrust the poet, and perhaps, see the truth of their relationship she tries so hard to obfuscate. His followers outside the room, he explains, just want to lay eyes on their baby boy. When mother refuses, Him drags a chair in front of his small family, and waits for her to fall asleep. mother wakes up just in time to see her stolen baby being used as a human sacrifice, a ceremony that turns out to have literary ramifications. The poet could have put a stop to the murder, but he allows it, because he needs to allow it, for his own survival. Him's devoted readers hide the evidence by eating small portions of human flesh. Surely now, her husband will send everybody home. The wife's suspicion grows, and so does the audience, in regard to who, or what Him is, when he asks mother to forgive the cannibals. This, of course, would be the Christian thing to do: ""Forgive thy enemy,"" but that's a cult of personality who ate their baby, not holy roller fundamentalists. The impossible request made by her husband pushes mother over the edge. And here is where Aronofsky riffs on ""The Exterminating Angel"", during that climactic scene when mother drops the lighter and sets everyone and everything on fire. Rita Ugalde(Patricia Moran), one of the dinner guests, in the Luis Bunuel film, about the proletariat, says: ""I believe the common people, the lower class people, are less sensitive to pain. Haven't you ever seen a wounded bull? Not even a trace of pain."" Why is Him the only person who survives the flames?<br/><br/>The writer can be the proletariat, but the act of writing is bourgeois.<br/><br/>The wife is not corporeal; she's a muse; a god, a literary god, who invents, not creates people. The first word out of mother's mouth is: ""Baby."" This baby grew up to be Him. The poet is merely a facilitator for mother's words. Him kills their baby because that child was his replacement. Him would not be able to write a single word without muses. Without mother, he would be, god forbid, a reader. mother is eternal, manifesting herself over and over again; a whole procession of mothers, who outlives her usefulness once Him finishes his latest work. Earlier in ""mother!"", an old married couple known as man(Ed Harris) and woman(Michelle Pfeiffer) drop a crystal object, shattering it to smithereens, in Him's study. The poet raises his voice, the only time in the whole film. The crystal, we learn in the denouement, comes not from some distant country, but somewhere closer to home, when Him, carrying mother, burnt almost beyond recognition, reaches into his wife's chest and steals her heart away. Paring down the organ's overdone meat, burnt flesh falling wayside, the poet gets what he wants; another crystal. He places the crystal in its exalted place of honor, a wire holder, as if it was a Faberge egg that contained a miniaturized scroll of Homer's last unfinished poem. The crystal has restoration powers. The house gets rebuilt. The house is alive. mother is the house; a crib for Him, her baby all grown up; a poet who tries to save humanity with words, alone in his fortress of solitude.<br/><br/>What kind of Superman would Darren Aronofsky have dreamt up? Nobody knows for sure, but consider this. Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), a mortal woman, strips Superman of his powers, in Richard Donner's ""Superman II"", whereas in ""mother!"", a muse, or rather, a superwoman, turns the poet into Him, an oracle. Maybe the mother who regenerates in the same bed where her predecessor originated from, will be smart enough to cut out the middleman and write her own story."

The acting was awful-particularly by Lawrence. I frequently found myself shaking my head at why a person would be walked on and treated like dirt by strangers in her own home.

","What I liked about Mother! was its cast, Pairing up Jennifer Lawrence with Javier Bardem as a somewhat oddly matched married couple was interesting, but it seemed to work. Michelle Pfeiffer still looks stunning, and Ed Harris was good as a mysterious stranger. The large, Victorian house, situated remotely in the countryside, looked fantastic and creaked in all the right places. And for the first hour or so it played out as an interesting slow burn, with the odd twist and turn.
Sadly the movie takes a turn for arty, pretentious nonsense. I think I understood it but I certainly will not be putting my brain through that again! This may well appeal to fans of such movies as Hereditary or Us, but fans of Lawrence, who are used to seeing her in more mainstream movies, will be in for a shock and most probably a disappointment."

There's just a lot of scenes that make you feel very uncomfortable. One scene will even make you say, ""that's messed up."" And it is. Don't worry, you're not alone. It also has many religious undertones, which I did understand some of them being religious myself but others are easy to miss. The acting is definitely good, great even.

"nickmaher-71633","Null","1","2","1 September 2019"," Not as clever as people seem to think
","A lot of the negative reviews I've seen were certainly written by people who completely missed the point of the film. I assure you I got the point, I saw the symbolism, I just didn't care. It's really not that clever. There are moments of subtle brilliance; the cut on his back before Mother later asks ""Did you know he had a wife?"" No! Because he didn't when he arrived. The flood that gets rid of everyone before a new group of followers turn up, and a few others but unfortunately the dialogue is just so poor. Not even the amazing cast could breath life into such poorly written drivel. Jennifer Lawrence, one of my all time favourite human beings, is left delivering a mediocre performance of a woman so blinded by love that she seems to have no respect for herself. Is this really the way we want to portray ""Mother Nature""? Don't even get me started on the scene where he is practically about to rape her before she just gives in.
As someone who despises religion and is baffled by peoples blind faith I feel that I should have enjoyed this film and the way it mocks certain aspects of Christianity. Unfortunately the main scene, which is no doubt supposed to leave us reflecting on the impact religion has had on our morality, is nothing more than an over the top attempt to shock and disgust. Sufficed to say they failed"
"ronakkotian","9","1","2","30 August 2019"," A symbolic piece of art.
","At the time of its release, Mother! was a very polarizing movie. Some people loved it and some people claimed it was the worst film they've seen. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that Darren Aronofsky got people to talk and contemplate about the film's hidden meanings and metaphors.<br/><br/>Mother! follows the story of a couple whose peaceful life gets destroyed by some uninvited guests.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, some audience members will dislike this movie wholly. In fact, people disliked it to the point where it got an F grade on CinemaScore. I, on the other hand, found this movie to be an uncomfortable but intriguing piece of art. It's not perfect but majority of the time everything is executed well.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are staggering. Jennifer Lawrence does particularly well. A lot of the shots throughout are fixated on her and so the film did rely on her acting skills but thankfully she managed to pull it off. Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer also do the film justice with their performances.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has done an incredible job. He made a film which will get me thinking for a long time. There are many interpretations that can be made since pretty much everything you see during the movie has a meaning or is metaphorical for something else. Even on a surface level I think this movie's enjoyable. You're constanly interested in figuring out what's actually happening whilst at the same time feeling extremely anxious and awkward at the events that take place.<br/><br/>The cinematography is terrific. The whole movie you're wandering around in this house. There are shots of the outside scenery but we never go there. This added a huge feeling of claustrophobia within me especially during the last 30 minutes where it all turns into a nightmare that's not easily forgettable.<br/><br/>If there is one problem I have with the movie is that the pacing can suffer. There are scenes where we go from seeing a regular, mundane life to something completely shocking. This may catch some people off guard.<br/><br/>All in all, Mother! is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Its visual imagery and metaphors will keep me engaged until I can decipher the many meanings the movie contains. Aronofsky has crafted a piece of art."
"MirandaJana","10","1","2","29 August 2019"," Bizarre and surrealistic happenings as ordinary, wonderful!
","Directed by the American filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, I wasn't surprised that Mother! (2017) brought so many obscure references and unsettling metaphorical discussions. Actually, when I watched the movie last night I knew absolutely nothing about it, but the first thing I went to research straight away after was who directed it and voila! He is the same director of the cinematic masterpiece Black Swan, winning the Best Actress Oscar in 2011 for the performance of Natalie Portman. Definitely no less important, the director was ahead of Requiem for a Dream, where once again the director shows a mindset that can blow your mind.<br/><br/>The movie starts in a house not-long-time-ago burned in a fire, which Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) has been working to rebuild. The place belongs to Him (Javier Bardem), a once-famous writer that faces a kind of block and hasn't produced anything for a long time. Life went on quietly in the house that is dangerously far from civilization until one day a middle-aged man knocks the door and immediately transforms His life. She clearly didn't want the couple's peace to be broken, but He was more enthusiastic than ever and invited him to spend the night at the house. Later they discover that the man is on the brink of death and is a big fan of the writer, which makes Her desire for the man to leave complicated. Next day was even worse for Her once the wife of the man comes through the front door. No listens to her concerns - she's ignored, insulted, patronised, a prisoner - He allows the couple to stay longer in the house.<br/><br/>To say that things get awkward from here would sound like a misperception on my part. The wife was always around making strange questions and having weird talks with Her. An unrealistic anguish begins to spin in circles and never stops. She get really into this and between feeling the house, literally putting Her hand on the wall and feeling the heart of the place, and taking a strange yellow medication every time She felt dizzy, She tried to keep up a dialogue with Him, who totally ignored Her.<br/><br/>To elevate the strangeness all over again two sons of the man and the wife show up and in the middle of blood and rising the house is turned into a celebration with dozens of people and this is the only time that She abandons completely the passivity that accompanies Her so far, enters the heart and desire of the spectators and screams at the top of her lungs: ""GET OUT! ALL OF YOU!"". It's soothing! I'd say that He wants and expect more than She can gives all the time, yes, but the fact is He wanted more from other people as well, apparently is not enough for Him to live in a country-side house without any recognition for His work, which is absolutely acceptable. But what is unacceptable is that he uses her love in a sadistic and selfish way turning Her life into a surrealistic nightmare and make all of us accept the bizarre happenings as ordinary.<br/><br/>To summarise, If you get into the analysis It could be an analogy of how we treat Mother Nature, about the environment and its destruction, as the director himself has stated numerous times. It could be suggest a religious metaphor: Is the house Eden? At first it is beautiful and full of life and as humans are abusing, the space becomes a huge bonfire with pain and horror. Is He God and She is Mary? Well, then could be an anti-religion message, once He is a sucker who ruins everything. While She knows She will have a baby right after conception and then She is forced to see Her son killed by terrible humans and be eaten by them - which would be the host - whilst He says they are good and deserve forgiveness. And it all starts to get heavy after the man and his wife break the crystal it is all ruined, there we have the apple. Anyway, this is a movie to be studied as well as Rosemary's baby and Antichrist, plenty of messages that, in the end (no spoilers), makes us wait for Mother! 2. Could it be as impactful as the first?"
"caixajoao1979","2","1","2","24 August 2019"," Slowly drowning in boredom...

"samharby-80482","2","1","2","12 July 2019"," Interesting premise, terrible movie
","I'll give ""mother!"" credit where it's due - it has an interesting premise. And the first 30 minutes of the film do show some promise, with the arrival of a mysterious and creepy stranger - soon followed by his b*tchy and bizarre wife - at the home of a generationally mismatched couple. Unfortunately for Aronofsky, an interesting premise and early promise doesn't make this a good film.<br/><br/>Strange from the outset, this initial set-up does pose some interesting questions: who are these people, what are they doing here, how did they find this place, why do they seem so normal yet so sinister? All these questions, however, go entirely unanswered.<br/><br/>This is a film so concerned with metaphor and enigma, that it forgets to tell a coherent and logical story.<br/><br/>Plot points are set up, and then completely forgotten. Mother, the main character (none of them have actual names - vEry eDgY), is constantly confused and annoyed at these strangers in her house, but never thinks to ask any logical questions. All she appears capable of doing is yelling ""Hey! Come out of there!"" at people.<br/><br/>Once the couple leave after a series of increasingly inexplicable events (they're never seen or heard from again, by the way, so don't expect any closure there), things continue to get weirder and weirder until the movie becomes laughably ridiculous. The final 'twist' makes no sense, and only creates more questions.<br/><br/>People either love or hate this movie, that much is clear. But I feel inclined to say that anyone who loves it because it's a ""thinking-persons"" movie, is about as pretentious as the films itself.<br/><br/>If you like logical storytelling, AVOID!!!"

","I think the issue with this film was that it was presented as a standard horror film, but it was really a surrealist film. This is a genre that is largely dead now, but this film reminds me very much of a the work of Bunuel.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away, but this is a film that can be interpreted in many different ways. I think it's a dark, somewhat satirical, personification of religious themes and the concepts of life and creation. Jennifer Lawrence gives a brilliant and effective performance that reminded me of Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby. It's a truly terrifying and brilliantly shot and directed film.<br/><br/>It's certainly divided audiences, but I think that's largely just due to this film being of a dead genre.

The story follows the chaos and devastation of others invited into Mother's surroundings by Him. The story intertwines the relationship between the main characters, whilst exploiting the delicate connection between nature and life.

Honestly I didn't have much expectation to the film, so 10 stars basically just my way to saying that this film is great and I am still amazed. Even though, major negative responses (and quite divided responses) were addressed heavily towards this film may means many people objected this.<br/><br/>Mother! quite follows the beginning of the premise of a mystery/horror film you see. Nice settings, introduction to several characters with their own ""uniqueness"". It's not that difficult to see that many symbols were purposely added by the writer/director that make us think that this film is way more than your usual mystery film. Through the film, I was enjoyed the performance of Jennifer Lawrence with her innocent-like woman that starts feeling uneasy towards the existence of other people. The upsetting ambiance from her point of view envisioned perfectly by constant hand-held camera movement that captures the feeling perfectly.<br/><br/>When the film starts to emphasizing the plot into more biblical story, I know that I can't expect any ""realistic"" plot anymore. The director clearly said that the characters based on his interpretation towards mother earth, God, Adam and Eve, and visualization of religion. Sure, I can't deny myself that the depiction are quite extreme at some points, like at the last scenes, even almost like a blasphemy. However, those symbols/interpretation were too much to handle, so that the film runs into unrealistic/fantasy/arthouse realms that probably makes other people pissed. So do I at the sudden fanmeeting at the house scene, but I ignore it because the film seems on its own.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, all the symbolism make all pieces seem connected into a single picture of a depiction of Earth and her ""POV"" with the human. It's too debatable, but the performance of Lawrence and many actors was amazing and I dragged emotionally to finish the film, and that's the only thing I want to care about. Probably it's not a movie that can be accepted by anyone and it's understandable, but I value the acting performance and the writing/directing too much that for me, it's best to focus on that side."

"david_hokey_16","9","1","2","16 September 2018"," If You Rate it Negatively You Didn't Understand It
","That sounds pretentious, but hear me out. You can dislike something and still appreciate its merits. This is especially true of art movies like this one. Lawrence gives an amazing performance, but the true wins here are in the story and direction. The plot sometimes makes no sense to viewers - how realistic is it that this couple would show up and be allowed to stay, for instance - and is contrived, but it has to be. This is a visual story told through symbolism and it isn't afraid to get gritty, controversial, and unnerving in the way it presents itself. The real story of mother is one of a relationship. One that we all know about. One where one person gives everything and the other side only takes. One that is so cleverly disguised, however, that those watching on the outside - even those on the inside - may be confused into thinking that the love is real. The house is the first symbol. It represents the relationship. It burned down once before in his past relationship, but she is trying to build it back up. To make it new. You'll notice, however, that she is the only one working to make this house whole again. To improve it. He is too obsessed with his poetry - himself. When outsiders intrude upon the happy home he doesn't care about the damage they cause because they are paying attention to him - his glory. When she finally has enough and risks ending the relationship he gives her another reason to stay - the baby. It becomes the next symbol of the relationship. Something more personal because it's not a token of his past and it's something they created together. But once again he turns to his old ways with the publishing of his poem. This time it gets worse and everything descends into chaos. As the people tear down the walls she built he exclaims it isn't important. Still, he comes to her defense enough times to convince her that he means well - that he loves her - even as everything around them is destroyed. The publisher refers to her as the inspiration - this is one of the hooks he has in her. A lie to make it seem as if it isn't about just himself. This lie comes undone when the publisher gives the order to kill her. The only hope left is the baby which is still constantly put in danger throughout the chaos. After she gives birth he again turns back to his selfish ways. He wants the praise of the crowd and ends up sacrificing the child - and ultimately the relationship as she can stand no more. She is pushed to her breaking point and a relationship that should've ended long ago now ends in an unhealthy explosion of suppressed feelings that ultimately kills her. The relationship is dead and while he gets to go on doing what he does she gave it he all and as such is left completely dead. As a final insult he takes her heart as a trophy. Note that the former heart he had kept is the one thing he gets angry at the earlier couple for when they break it. The intruding woman doesn't understand why - a symbol of his selfishness, but he does care not because of what the past relationship meant to him, but because it was a trophy - a symbol of his sadism. He is a collector of hearts. Everything in this film is so straightforward I cannot understand how anyone could be confused. It plays out in chronological order. An emotionally abusive relationship that goes on for too long, with too much forgiveness, until it is too late and she is destroyed trying to save it. If you don't understand this then you may think of it as senseless and judge it only by the shock value. You'd be misjudging it, as whether you like it's message - or more importantly how it conveys its message - or not you can't deny that it does one hell of a job bringing it to life."

Aronofsky and his cast created a work of art, and art is not necessarily pleasant, easy or comfortable, but it is fulfilling, both for the artist and the observer, who through the communication of art can become as one mind, as one soul, as one heart."

","A married couple live in an isolated country house. He is a celebrated poet, suffering from writer's block, and she is working on renovating the house. Then a guest, a stranger, suddenly drops in and nothing will ever be the same again. <br/><br/>Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky who gave us masterpieces like 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream', as well as the excellent 'Black Swan'. The fact that he wrote and directed this was the only reason I watched it, hoping that he was back to the form of those movies as his previous movie was the craptacular-beyond-belief 'Noah'.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, no, he isn't, though initially there was a glimmer of hope. The movie started interestingly enough, with some decent character development and some interesting themes. However, from the outset it was slow, plus there were signs this wasn't going to be a character-based drama but something symbolic, and pretentious.<br/><br/>Plus it was annoying. The only likeable character was Jennifer Lawrence's. Javier Bardem's was selfish and egotistical and every single other character was incredibly irritating. <br/><br/>Still, I was hoping this would all develop into something interesting and profound. Wrong again. It develops into anarchy and some sort of badly-thought-out horror movie, and the annoyance factor gets pushed to the max. Of course, it's all meant to be symbolic, but figuring out everything would require you to think about the movie, and do so you would have had to have concentrated all through the tidal wave of excrement that was the movie.<br/><br/>Pretentious and annoying, and evidence that, sadly, Darren Aronofsky has run out of ideas."

"seige-hound","7","1","2","21 May 2018"," A Film Expressing Interesting Ideas, if Nothing Else
","As I scroll through the reviews of this film, what I'm getting a sense of is that people don't like the movie because it's gross, weird, shocking and controversial. If you think those traits a bad movie make, I don't know what to tell you. There is a massive legacy in film history of people making weird gross controversial films that are loved by critics and film snobs, as it were, but not the masses. mother! is definitely one of those films, a film that is going to go down in history as a cult classic.<br/><br/>I think everyone knows at this point what the movie is about. It's allegory from start to finish. It's Biblical allegory, like Pilgrim's Progress, but unlike that story, mother! is very anti-bible and anti-god. Darren Aronofsky is a Jewish Atheist, so much of his work is centred around a very critical view of the Bible. We saw this before with his big-budget adaptation of Noah (which I also like, so you can sort of see why I would like this as well)<br/><br/>In this film, Aronofsky frames God (known in the film as 'Him' or 'The poet') as a blathering idiot who is so caught up in his own legacy that he ignores the constant pleas of his wife, known as 'mother', played by Jennifer Lawrence. Mother, or Mother Nature's sole purpose is to protect what is hers. She desires to live alone with her husband the poet, but He denies her that right, and invites unwanted guests in again and again, who bring nothing but arrogance and destruction to her house, representing humanity's arrogance and wanton destruction of the world and environment.<br/><br/>At several points in the later half of the film, the unwanted guests say that the 'home' is everyones and that they should share the home. This parallels a real life phenomenon of many people using religion as a justification for their greed and exploitation of the world's resources.<br/><br/>There is a lot to think about in this film, and I think it's worth discussing as to what the story is trying to say about our world, our relationship to God (whether real or not) and how we use religion to justify atrocities.<br/><br/>However, I wouldn't say this film is perfect. I think it does get caught up in itself sometimes, and there are some weird contrivances within the story that muddles up the allegory. The presence of a phone that can call 911, especially, doesn't make sense. What do the police represent in this allegory? It's hard to tell. What is ridiculous, though, is that this film was nominated for several Razzies (worst director, worst actress, and worst supporting actor) which is entirely perplexing because the acting and directing aren't what makes this film 'bad' in any respect. People who have issues with this film have issues with the writing, so if you want to say something in this film deserves a Razzie, make it worst writer (although I don't think that's a category in the Razzies, which would explain a lot)<br/><br/>This film isn't for everyone, and I respect that. People should understand though that just because a film isn't for them doesn't mean it's bad. You have to think of something more concrete to explain why something is bad beyond you simply not liking it or thinking it's gross and controversial."

It's backed up by great performances from both Lawrence and Bardem, and fantastic sound design. However, sometimes it gets too showy in it's symbolism that it becomes pretentious. It's a slow movie, with some parts that doesn't seem to be needed. The camera work also gets annoying, having it always up close to the actors' face. But that third act had me at the edge of my seat, it was so crazy. At times so crazy to the point of exhaustion. It has glaring flaws, but that intrigue pulled me past that.

"iquine","8","1","2","9 May 2018"," Crescendo of Insanity
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>""Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb."" To quote Pink Floyd, this is exactly what Aronofsky does with this film. <br/><br/>Wow........where do I..........even begin with this film? <br/><br/>First off, I was unaware what I was about to unleash on myself as this is an unforgettable film with an insufficiently 'light' IMBD summary. So the surface plot is basically a husband and wife are living together in an isolated, large, classic, southern-style house. The husband is trying overcome a creative writing block and the wife is remodeling the house interior. A stranger visits their house as he admires the husband's writing. As the story progresses many strangers come to visit and the husband graciously invites many more to stay at the house much to the dismay of the wife who wants intimate quiet time with her husband and to start a family. Enter the crescendo of insanity from here on out and maybe some light spoilers. What sort of people will arrive and with what degree of passion for the husband? Will the wife be able to calm the household? Much of the story harks back to biblical references and metaphors as well as scenes that are open to personal interpretation. Many reviewers try to rationalize the wife as a symbolic ""Mother Earth"" being trampled upon; I can see that perspective. Many reviewers as well as myself describe the second half as a jarring nightmare, fear of lack of control and boundaries. Combine that with increasingly madness behavior including some alarmingly disturbing and putrid moments!!! I contemplated turning it off but I had invested too much I was curious to see how it would wrap up. It had great production value, good acting and a manic story. What's the intended message? I dare you to watch and try to figure it out for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you! Ha!"
"mihalikovakaterina-73116","Null","1","2","7 May 2018"," The movie was a masterpiece of horror to me...
","The movie was a masterpiece of horror to me. I could really feel her suffering and despair at the time, and understand the true background of the story. The Mother, having the diamond of love in her heart, being nastily misused by the proud, self-loving monster, slowly realizing, and understanding the horror of her reality, trying to escape suffering. The end was perhaps even more horrible than the movie itself because it did not show any escape from that hell. 
So if i should say my opinion - very moving, shaking the spirit but not in a positive sense, and not helpful because from the mothers view point, one would expect much happier ending. Hopefully there would be a continuation of some sort which would allow to create a different, more positive final reality for her somewhere else, and with someone else. Spirit needs hope. There was enough of horror already."

"lstorchevoy","3","1","2","22 April 2018"," Spectacular Failure!
","The best part, incidental to watching this cinematographic disaster, is getting to read the reviews, including those posted on imdb. The imagination of the reviewers is immensurable. Some claim the movie is an allegory of the Bible. Writer is God, Mother is the nature, the ever-coughing intruder is Adam, his vulgar wife is Eva, their pathetic sons are Abel and Cain, and the mansion is the world. Did I miss anything? Oh, yes, the baby is supposedly Jesus Christ, and the poem is the Bible (this is cute: even theologists do not claim that the Old Testament, let alone the New one, was written by the God himself). By the way, what or whom does the black guy, who tries to paint the house, allegorize? Moses? King David? King Solomon? Nelson Mandela? I can clearly hear Darren Aronofsky's Homeric laughter when he read these ""aspiring"" reviews. It's easy to find a black cat in the dark room, after all - even if it's not in there. 
So, are you telling me that Aronofsky intended to raise public awareness of the importance of some Biblical stories and adapted them to the present day realities? But why couldn't he just follow the Bible straight, without any allegories, as he did in Noah?<br/><br/>Or was it a cinematographic attempt to call public attention to environmental concerns and lack of respect for Mother Mature?<br/><br/>It's funny that no one seems to understand that this film is just another portrayal of the Poet and Muse theme. The sufferings caused by creative impotence; the search of inspiration in other people and other people's sufferings; the spiritual hunger; the neglect for the Muse and passion for the Muse; the success; the fatal danger of becoming an idol and being devoured by the fans - these are the things that Aronofsky wanted to share his insights in. He did not do a very good job, though. While the idea has a great potential, the movie ultimately fails to deliver, and watching the main character repeatedly wandering around the house, exploring - again and again - each of its numerous corners, is just boring. In all fairness, Aronofsky should have quit the movie industry after releasing Requiem for a Dream, for there is no point in regressing to failures such as Noah and Mother!"
"doyoubelieveingod-39954","9","1","2","6 April 2018"," Easy to hate. Should you watch it?
","I think the biggest flaw of the movie was marketing it for a wide release. This is definitely a niche film. While it was plainly going to polarize audiences, I feel sad at the pure vitriol being leveled at it. So, if you haven't seen it, should you?<br/><br/>First off, how you feel about Aronofsky in general is likely to color how you feel about this. If you find him indulgent and pretentious, this movie isn't going to change your mind. If you think he's a masterful auteur, you'll probably like this based on that. Is it pretentious and indulgent? Indulgent: yes. Pretentious: probably. I thought it was slightly, but YMMV.<br/><br/>I feel like this movie needs the proper context, as it's going to have limited appeal. At its essence, it's a nightmare with a loose allegorical structure. It's essentially as close that Aronofsky has ever come to making a David Lynch film. The characters are unrealistic, there is a bit of a mixed metaphor and everything follows dream logic. What appeals to me about it is that while I like the aesthetic qualities of Lynch, it's always missing some thread of meaning outside of a few ideas. This movie fills that gap by hinging it on a classic story and an environmental lamentation. <br/><br/>That's not to say, ""omg bro, it's super deep,"" but it keeps a straightforward structure to launch its assault of a nightmare. I did find it very visceral and off-putting. I like that in movies, and I felt at the end that it meant something instead of being a series of meaningless set pieces. While it didn't make me feel fearful or disturbed (like the trailer implied), it did make me feel very anxious and at points sad. I also feel like accusations of condescension and pretension are a little overblown, because DA has been very upfront and humble about what he was going for. Since before the movie was released. I feel like a lot of that is projected onto the film, possibly due to the misleading marketing, and preconceived notions of the filmmaker.<br/><br/>So, this movie is not for most. Not because people won't get it (although, some haven't), but because it's a very specific sort of film. If you can stomach the indulgence and the detachment from reality (and can handle discomfort), I think it's worth a watch."
"aquascape","8","1","2","2 April 2018"," Spellbinding and highly creative piece of art
","Darren Aronofsky always turns heads whenever he releases a feature film. I can't believe that a completely original movie can still be made in today's Hollywood, it gives hope for the future generations of directors and producers. Aronofsky came after the contentious epic biblical film ""Noah"", which took heavy hits from critics, to regroup his efforts and give another stab at his creative nature, only to yet again be questioned by critics.<br/><br/>""Mother!"" stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a couple living in a battered, run down house in the middle of nowhere. Bardem's character is a poet who is struggling with writer's block and is hoping to recover by moving to this old crummy house secluded from society. His wife decided to support him and starts renovating the house room by room, piece by piece. One day, a couple of strangers, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, knock on the door and they are let in without any second thoughts. From here on chaos slowly starts to ensure in ways that no one would suspect will carry on. 
The film starts slow, building up the tension of the main character's relationship, but after a third of the movie, things start to pick up and it is just spellbinding. There is about half an hour of non-stop madness that will leave you speechless, incapable of taking your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>All of the characters are unnamed, given just their position in the family, such a mother, man or son, leading to the impression of an eerie Garden of Eden setting, where later Lawrence would go on saying that her character is an allegory of Mother Earth and the film depicts the destruction of nature.<br/><br/>The distinct sound editing makes ""Mother!"" an interesting piece of film. Aronofsky decided to scrap the original soundtrack after seeing a rough-cut without music and instead focused on set-sounds from the landscape.<br/><br/>The filming also offered us a different camerawork approach from the norm involving heavily of close-ups that may leave you dizzy when watching it on a big screen. <br/><br/>""Mother!"" is controversial though-provoking film with deep philosophical and biblical undertones that should not be missed. It really is one of those movies where at the end of it you will either love it or hate it."

I normally hate these kind of arty hollywood rubbish movies that a rich hollywood guy makes to try and be different, but i think it actually works here. <br/><br/>I was told about the biblical references beforehand, and i think thats good to be aware of as it makes more sense of what your seeing and why the movie changes and ends the way it does."

","I liked Wrestler by the same director but this movie is really shit. The symbolism is a good idea but ruined by not keeping it symbolic. The movie shifts between normal behaviour dialogue to the symbolic. It is just idiotic not to keep it consistent. I understand the symbolism as does any other viewer (ie God, Mother Nature, Adam, Eve, etc.) and that is a great idea but it is totally ruined firstly by not making it into a horror movie and secondly by not keeping to the symbolism. They put in the usual Hollywood bullshit of trying to be normal while it could have been a good movie if they had just kept to the symbolism about reality. As this movie stands it is absolute crap and really an insult to pessimism since it tries to market itself as attractive to pessimism."
"calicut110","8","1","2","27 March 2018"," Unique and exhilarating experience
","I can see why the film is so polarizing. For me, it was awesome. Jennifer Lawrence did the best acting that I've ever seen her do. Everyone else was good but she was definitely the star of this show. After watching the film I read the explanations for the movie - I encourage people to read up after the film, you will learn something about the incredible experience you just had."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","24 March 2018"," Difficult film which does hold the attention despite not helping the viewer that much (SPOILERS)
","Mark Kermode liked but warned over this film, that the viewer should not step away too long because the film can easily change and it will be almost impossible to explain why the shift occurred in their absence. To be fair, it is sometimes hard to explain even when you stay with it. By the end, it is very clear, tidy, and quite satisfying - but you really have to stick with it.<br/><br/>This is the problem of the film; too much of its time seems to be spent not involving the viewer in the game being played. At first it starts out as a sort of home-invasion film, where a man arrives into the otherwise peaceful lives of a couple, and soon the events around this man and his family start to get out of control. The success as a writer of the man of the couple leads to more people coming, further stressing the woman. It is not too long before bloody wounds are opening up in floors, full riots are occurring in the front room, and the end of society appears to be occurring as a result of a simple promotional event for a book. It is quite a ride as a film but, while it ends up being quite cleverly done and clear, it doesn't help you as you watch it. However, on the flip side of that, if you go in knowing it is all a biblical allegory which plays the creation story out to its complete end, then probably it would be too obvious in too many moments. It is a difficult balancing act and the film doesn't pull it off.<br/><br/>As a result it is bewildering, likely to have people give up, and certainly put off the people who would otherwise have flooded to watch the same story played out in a more 'normal' fashion. As I understood what I was watching (late in the final acts) I did appreciate it more for doing something different with something so fundamental, even if it left me on the outside for the majority. While on the outside, the quality of the delivery and the intrigue of what is going on was still enough to keep me watching, but I understand that for others it won't.<br/><br/>The performances are strong and all involved deserve credit for doing something so unusual in a 'mainstream' film. Lawrence is great throughout, and has plenty of strong support from Harris, and Pfeiffer, as well as many other familiar faces. The film is all Aronofsky though; his vision and creativity of delivery. While it is difficult it is hard not to be impressed by the scale of what he does in such a small place, and how well he makes it work - for all its faults, you can't claim that Mother! isn't trying. I doubt I'll watch it again, but as I watching it was mysterious and weird for just a bit too long before it then rode its luck on being bewilderingly bananas before then delivering an explanation which is obvious in retrospect, but still provides a satisfying way to close out the film."

","My relationship with religion has been a tenuous one, and the farther I leave it behind, the more ridiculous and blinding it seems. This film really captures those feelings thay religion can leave behind, I think. This movie shifts the focus away from God and humanity, to show the possible perspective Earth would have if it were a cognizant being. I think this film marks a clear shift away from the idolation of religion and god, and of the brutality of man and the blatant disregard for their home both humanity and god have. I for one one thoroughly enjoyed the film. However, if you do not wish to see a film that some would call blasphemous, don't watch if you cannot handle it."

","For some reason Lawrence and Bardem are a couple. He doesn't do much of anything, a poet with writer's block--as always in the movies. She in the meantime single-handedly built the mansion in which they live apparently secluded, after a fire destroyed it.<br/><br/>One day there's a knock in the door. A stranger arrives who claims to be a fan of the poet. Because there's nowhere else to go, the guy invites the stranger to spend as much time as he needs in the house. There's some mysterious crystal that is the pride and joy of the guy and the stranger quickly wants to see it and touch it. Soon the stranger's wife arrives. And she's just insufferable. Right in the homeowner's face at all times, no filter between her mind and her tongue. She gives her a hard time about not having children. The stranger is seriously sick and a smoker. <br/><br/>Then suddenly the two sons of the strange couple arrive screaming, yelling, and fighting over a will. One son kills the brother in the living room. Get where this is going...?<br/><br/>For some reason the guy accepts that the funeral reception be at their house. The girl is aghast. Hundreds of people show up and they make themselves right at home. The girl flips out. The guy is delighted at all the sudden life in his house. They fight and have sex. She ends up pregnant and he suddenly finds the inspiration to write. He becomes world-famous. Again the house ends up filled with media, fans and assorted strangers to the disbelief of the heavily pregnant girl. She eventually gives birth and the guy parades the son like some trophy. The crowds go wild. Chaos ensues. Political battles take place inside the house, religious battles. SWAT arrives and it's all against all. The baby ends up being cannibalized by some worshiping crowd. And now the girl decides to put an end to it all.<br/><br/>Mother! is a rather infuriating movie. I had to watch it in two one-hour session because I just couldn't take it anymore. The girl is lovely and the camera is on her nearly the whole time. The guy is annoying in his anything-goes aloofness. They don't talk much at all in the two hours. And of course we are limited to this house the entire time. The strangers are insufferable on all levels. <br/><br/>Sure, the idea is not bad once you interpret it. And watching a history of humanity unfold in the last 30 minutes is kinda interesting. But for those 30 minutes you have to put up with one and a half hour of nothing. This is one instance where the writer should have taken more time to polish the work and he should have let someone else direct this project. I'm convinced that under another director's vision this movie could have been outstanding. As it is, though it's obnoxious to watch and hard to recommend."
"Thanos_Alfie","5","1","2","27 February 2018"," Don't expect much...
","""Mother!"" is a mystery - drama movie in which we watch a couple who has a quiet life, living in a secluded grand mansion that was burned to the ground and they are trying to rebuilt it. Their quiet life and their safe environment comes to disturb some uninvited guests who arrive at their home. And time by time this increases and continues to grow. The more chaos the husband lets in their home the better for him and his ego.<br/><br/>At first I liked the movie but after the middle it becomes boring because it tries to much to prepare you for something extraordinary that it's going to happen and finally disappoints you. The plot is not something that even worth mentioning because in its core is very good but on the outer place of it, it's not equally good. Despite the good interpretations of Jennifer Lawrence who plays the mother and Javier Bardem who plays the husband who are the main actors, the supporting roles of Ed Harris who plays as the man and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays as his wife don't help the main characters to evolve. The direction of Darren Aronofsky is below average and of course worse than I expected, that's maybe a result of low budget.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Mother!"" is an average movie which was promoted so much for no reason. The most disappointing part of this movie is that it has four very famous actors but does not impress the audience. The only reason I rated this movie with five stars is because of these actors and the interpretations of Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. If you want to watch this movie just don't expect much from it."

","I love watching Jennifer Lawrence in any movie as I think she is a great actress. However, I have to say I think Darren Aronofsky is a little too bizarre as a writer although quite brilliant as a Director. I found the storyline quite unpleasant and I'm unclear what message, if any. the writer was conveying. Was it a parody of Christianity? 
On the DVD is a documentary of how the movie was made which was very interesting. 
Lawrence and Bardem were superb as they always are."

","I should start off by saying that I am not a diehard Aronofsky fan, as the only other movie of his I've seen is Requiem (which I love). I'm interested in seeing his other big films but haven't gotten around to it. Anyway, I can understand why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. If you don't bother to look beneath the surface then you'll certainly dislike it. It's confusing as hell, chaotic, frustrating, etc. I had basically no idea what was happening the entire time. But, when you get to the end and the realization hits you, I found it to be incredibly rewarding. I kind of sat here, contemplating, allowing it all to sink in. And wow, what an incredible way to tell a story! This one is a real mind opener, and if you're not willing to peel back layers and expand your mind, honestly don't bother. This beautiful and creative film does not need any more bad reviews. As an avid Shyamalan fan, having seen literally every one of his films, I'm used to being open to possibilities. <br/><br/>Overall I was truly blown away by this movie. I gave it 8 stars, reducing a little for the roles of Mother and Him. I personally felt that they could've portrayed Him a little bit stronger and Mother a little bit softer and more nurturing, but that is my only criticism. Otherwise a truly tremendous and thought provoking movie."

And I think that moment hass been upon us for quite a decade or two now!<br/><br/>10/10 means its the best movie you have ever seen.
The folks on here who give this ordure 10/10 are in one of two categories - In a padded cell with access to tv or the anally, retentive pretentious, luvvies (or ones who want so much to be part of the ""in crowd"") who actually think this is more than one of Aronofsky's bad trips on Lsd or an overdose of the magic mushies!<br/><br/>Pretty sad isnt it when all artists have now to bring to the world is the value of shock treatment which is all this really is and all Aronofsly was clearly doing was stirring up a pot of controversy to give this a bit of advertising pure and simple. I could crap on a piece of paper and call it a modern critique of contemporary art , have it framed and no doubt the types who give this movie 10/10 on here will hail me as the new Tracy Emmin of the art world.<br/><br/>It is of no merit artistically and anyone who thinks it is well they may one day disappear up their own backsides.

I went to watch it an art house cinema, completely blinded to all what has been said or written about mother!, including the director's statement. So my take-home message was completely, completely different! <br/><br/>But that's the beauty of cinema, no? I mean cinema at its best, is a work that leaves you some room for your own interpretations! I understand, we live in a fast-food culture, fast-fashion, fast-spirituality! people just love being told what and why and how to think, because otherwise it takes effort! I understand, and it became clearer reading the reviews here! <br/><br/>I can imagine, kids raised in Jesus camps will find this movie quite disturbing. The director is an atheist, and the picture he depicts for God is not a very nice one. <br/><br/>So back to my own interpretations: 
1. ""Him"", played by Bardem, is obviously each and every narcissistic artist/creator since the dawn of humanity! So narcissistic to the extent of lacking basic compassion, that we humans ought to have. But this is not too far from the director's intention, no? I think for those who departed the Jesus camps, with no intention to return, would agree a narcissistic God is not far from reality! The absent God, the all powerful yet having no desire to put an end to suffering, the one so obsessed with creating wonders, yet keeps busy with testing humans, tempting them and Satan to fool into a spiral of eternal misery, only to prove some point no one else but ""him"" knows; we all know about these qualities, my fellow atheists, no? This picture was masterfully and poetically depicted by Darren, you just have to watch with an open mind, probably with an open heart, to get it. <br/><br/>2. My second interpretation: ""Him"" is each and every Prophet since the dawn of humanity! Again to my fellow atheists: we know that even if they had preached good causes, their objective was to attract the masses, hypnotize them, and in return they sacrifice humanity's ultimately true goodness, represented by the mother, losing her own child in the midst of the idol-worship frenzy! Is this far from reality? just look at the F* Middle East, for Baal's sake!<br/><br/>But, watch few interviews with the creators, and you will realize the movie was actually engineered so that you can interpret it the way you want! Jennifer herself said she saw it as the creation of religions and false idols (close enough to my second interpretation), Darren himself pointed the story is open to endless number of interpretations. <br/><br/>This project is a grand social experiment! a disturbingly stimulating work of art! a masterpiece! I highly recommend it for open minded people, Jesus campers? maybe not."

As I've watched more and more of his movies, I can't say that I've 'loved' every one of them, but I certainly always appreciate the vastly different themes or elements that (I think) he wants to showcase. <br/><br/>Example: 'The Wrestler' - Uncomfortably Raw Empathy 'Black Swan' - The Reality of Paranoia vs. Madness<br/><br/>Lastly, my favorite, ""The Fountain"" - Multiple Abstract Views of a single storyline. <br/><br/>While the entire plot is never quite crystal clear, Aronofsky balances that abstract curiosity with enough deliberately placed elements to allow the viewer to come up with their own feasible conclusion(s).<br/><br/>It's a fine line between making abstract/interpretive movies with a hidden gem inside vs. spilling into convoluted story lines, the latter of which forces the viewer to find a conclusion where one doesn't rationally exist. ""The Fountain"" and ""Mother!"" fit amongst the former. <br/><br/>Basically, if you like movies with bizarre, intriguing elements presented in a beautifully abstract way, like ""The Fountain"", you will almost certainly like this movie too.<br/><br/>Despite the minimal amount of dialogue in the movie, Jennifer Lawrence still pulls off a beautiful, believable performance. We see the world through her eyes, which deliberately makes us taste her sense of discomfort and unease. Despite that though, I still wouldn't have classified this as a ""Horror"" movie."
"Tweetienator","4","1","2","7 December 2017"," Mixed Experience
","I really have mixed feelings about Mother. Strong are the performances of the main actors: Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. They all shine like Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly and Christoph Waltz did in Polanski's Carnage. But whereas Polanski provides us an ""everyday story"" with a fine psychological analysis and a well-choreographed rise of tensions between the protagonists, unmasking neuroses and deeper layers of the involved characters, leaving a lot of room for the actors and their skills, Darren Aronofsky drowns the great cast and wastes their fine performances in an unbelievable and absurd story overloaded with (imo) pseudo-intellectual symbolism with a really plain ""outcome"". <br/><br/>Mr. Aronofsky directed some of my favorite movies - The Fountain, The Wrestler, Black Swan, and whereas I didn't like Noah the first time watching it, the 2nd time I liked that one too. But Mother!? <br/><br/>I don't believe watching it a 2nd or 3rd time will change anything: the story is for my taste too artificial and of course, if you read some surrealist's poetry you can find tons of layers and of possible interpretations (projections of the reader etc.), same I guess with this movie, but for me the mixture of symbolism, drama, some elements of horror and thriller and Genesis just doesn't work out well - the whole movie I was annoyed by the unbelievable and stupid behavior of the protagonists (even if they are just ""symbolic"") and some ""stuff"" happening felt just out of place. Also if I try to interpret Mother with the help of the Old Testament (like some reviewers indicate) this just does not work well for me - if Bardem is God and Lawrence is sth like Mother Earth or ""Life"", such concept is unknown to the Genesis or to the Holy Bible (alone the idea/concept that ""Mother Earth"" can suffer or has a personality is just a projection, and here imo Mr. Aronofsky, the atheist, misunderstands or misinterprets the Christian concept of God, as nature is nothing but God himself), and if I got to rewrite the Genesis so the characters somehow fit in, I could also use, let's say Shakespeares Hamlet as a reference for interpretation and do the same. (Alone that the audience must know the Genesis to make such connections, just imagine someone watching the movie without knowing anything about the Genesis, imo a great fail, good symbolistic codes should be universally applicable). <br/><br/>Sadly I must state: this is the first fail of the greatly talented Darren Aronofsky. And I have the mild ""feel"" that the very (well hidden) message or lecture of the movie is just one of the usual esoteric texture of romanticism - man fails to achieve Eden because he is too selfish, greedy etc. pp.<br/><br/>So what is the essence of the movie!? That life is a cycle!? That people behave like they do because they are people and do the same mistakes again and again!? Wow, a lot of noise to make such a plain statement... <br/><br/>Final words: a great packaging (acting) but also pretentious with a shallow content. A rate of 4 - but only because the great actors saved Mother! from being a disaster."

","My score of 4 is only based on me liking Jennifer Lawrence and the effort she put in this film but it honestly deserves a 2. I really looked forward to seeing this movie and from the previews I really hoped I liked it. Needless to say that didn't happen this movie was a bit of a bore , aggravating, lacked continuity, and was a complete train wreck. None of the characters are likable, the unnamed Jennerifer Lawrence character is even worse than the unwanted guest by allowing her husband to not only run over her but it turns out she was sexually frustrated by this older man as well. The husband, I can't get in to him, he is to annoying to discuss except to say if you are remotely married to a man like him divorce immediately, I won't give anymore of the movie away, I don't think I could if I wanted to. I just finished watching it and already I have forgotten it, that is how memorable this film is. You have been warned!"
"confirmeddeath","4","1","2","6 December 2017"," What the Heck did I watch?
","The beginning of it, the rewinding was a big giveaway that it would be one of those sh*tty movies where you already know the ending, she burns while crying... I watched it regardless...<br/><br/>Having endured through the excruciatingly unreal half of this husbands treatment of his wife and this wife being so damn stupid as to give birth to a baby for a man who invited the family that terrorized her.<br/><br/>Anyway... it was a big waste of my time, the rating mislead me. I went into this believing it'd be good and make some sense. I thought it would be about the husband beating up his wife (based on what I heard) but I was awfully off and I paid dearly for it, it cost me 2 hours of my time!<br/><br/>The acting, the setting and everything was good, but the rest was a pile of sh*t.<br/><br/>****SPOILER Below*********<br/><br/>The movie is about a man with special powers who hungers for attention, basically an attention wh*re. He is not only immortal, but he is also invincible it would seem. He relives his shitty life over and over again, but with different women as the previous woman dies ...in a fire that she set. <br/><br/>A time loop in essence except with different wife each time."
"squanto79","4","1","2","6 December 2017"," why great actors accept these kind of roles ?
","When I started to watch the movie, I took it seriously, I mean I thought I am watching a high rated horror film.... I mean I didn't saw a great horror film since Stephen King's - ""The Shining"" made by Stanley Kubrick. Not that I'm a Stephen King fan. But Kubrick done a great job with that movie. Every horror lately doesn't receive a higher rating than 5 or lower. Anyway... getting back to the movie. As I wrote in the beginning I took the film seriously first, then when I started to see the cellar scenes I thought she will discover some early dirty secret of his from his past. I think after 50 minutes from the movie I started to realize what a huge fiasco the film is. So the film wants to be an allegory as some commented about the movie. Javier being God, Pfeiffer being Eve and Harris being Adam. And their children being Cain and Abel.<br/><br/>If I may make a stupid joke I would say : A mother stays in the kitchen, Cain and Abel have finished watching ""Mother ! "". After a while Cain says - what a waste of time. Hearing this Abel gets angry and says: why is this a waste of time? Maybe you didn't perceived the hidden meaning of the film. Cain answers what hidden meaning ? This is the worst underrated movie I've seen in centuries. Abel replies : well this movie has deep biblical meanings. Cain : I never read the Bible. Abel: then why are you talking about something when you don't even have the slightest idea of what the movie is all about. Cain: you know what? Go to hell ! So Cain and Abel are starting to fight almost killing each other. After one hour of fight Cain throws a can of popcorn towards Abel. Abel had his mouth open and a piece of popcorn flew straight in his mouth. After a few seconds Abel chokes suddenly and dies ;) ..... Another movie made with great actors playing in order to get more income. I think Jennifer Lawrence played a great mommy in the movie, but maybe someone gives her a better role. I mean she's the perfect young mother type, every man would love such a mommy wife but she should read the script twice before playing. A 4 for this movie. In my view a totally waste of time and money ;)"
"FourFeathers","Null","1","2","3 November 2017"," Many thoughts and confusion that I can only believe it is nearly perfect
","Just watched 'Mother!' by Darren Aronofsky. I hate when a film does not say anything and at the same time says a lot. It confuses me as I cannot fully choose between love or hate; it leaves me in the middle where I never thought its my place to be. <br/><br/>Honestly, I was bored in the middle of the film due to obviousness, but also was eager to see where the story will be turned into. What role God the director will leave for God the character. Being subjective critic of art created by an artist, here I feel frustration of the idea that writer of the film is the Poet and the audience is the Mother. It is a bit out of topic to put myself in the mothers shoes, but I just can neither stop questioning what director wants of me as a viewer (thats a rhetorically religious question and probably he does not want anything), nor stop loving the director and its work for bringing all the questions and the subject hopefully for the good/best... <br/><br/>Thought by thought and now I am left with the confusing neutrality which might be the reason why so many of us decide to stay blind."
"melissaoaks","5","1","2","27 October 2017"," disappointment ending
","the ending of this movie was stupid and didn't make any sense. the only reason i rated it 5 is because it was really good up until that point. It was a disappointment. I was expecting some ending that would explain the chaos and craziness going on throughout the movie but it didn't happen. the director of this film said a lot of people didn't like it because they have something against science but i didn't see anything scientific in the entire movie. and i didn't see that it had anything to do with science. it was just a stupid movie."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","2","23 October 2017"," A cause célèbre sprung out of this year's Lido island
","A cause célèbre in this year's Lido island, Aronofsky's MOTHER! has crushed and burned in its homeland's box office front and precipitated polarized reactions from both critics and audience, which is a usual given to galvanize a cinephile's interest. <br/><br/>MOTHER! has a disguised threadbare set of components but its construct is vastly ambitious, even errs on the side it. It is set in a single location (an antiquated villa), in an indefinite space (the wilderness) and time (there is a telephone but no signs of cell-phones), score-free, no name is designated to its dramatis personae, (after checking online after), a married couple, Him (Bardem) and mother (Lawrence), is living in his family residence, Him is an acclaimed poet stuck in the writer's block and mother, decades younger than him, starts to re-decorate the house all by herself. <br/><br/>Their placid domestic facade is disrupted by two interlopers, credited as simply man and woman (Harris and Pfeiffer), him, a gravely ill man with a wound in his rib (in a transient scene one can barely discern the locus of the wound), the signs are all over the place (only it is practically an incomprehensible task for an audience entering the movie with a tabula rasa): the biblical metaphor, which continues when later in the story, the man and woman are evicted by mother for breaking Him's precious crystal, following by their elder son kills his younger brother in an impulsive rage, now you can feasibly connect them with their unsaid names. <br/><br/>Up to this point, Aronofsky has fervidly contrived a hybrid between a home intruder thriller and a haunted house horror (literally a beating heart within the walls has been presented more than once), and Jennifer Lawrence's heroine is the undivided cynosure of the story, often in jittery close-ups enclosed by a claustrophobic and dreadful palette. Heralded by the film's foreboding title card, motherhood is in the offing and Him regains his inspiration but all hell will break loose in the night when their baby is born, topping off with a disorienting, anarchic maelstrom with inarticulate transgressions. It is an ire-fanning third-act jam-packed with cult craze, frenetic editing and smothering pandemonium, until mother incinerates their domicile as the last resort and resets the Garden of Eden to the ground zero, an iteration of the film's gnomic prologue, displaced with a new mother. <br/><br/>The parable is intentionally to be construed as how mother earth has been slowly encroached and finally destroyed by humanity's wantonness, but in hindsight, it is more revealing as a cautionary manifesto about a trophy wife, living under the throes of her husband's authority, habitually being neglected by him and treated like air by others, and her functionality is boiled down to either as a catalyst for his creativity or procreation, nothing more, and in the end of the day, she can be anonymously superseded by another young flesh, is this a feminist agitprop in disguise? <br/><br/>Headlining by a solid star-turn from Jennifer Lawrence going down through an excruciatingly disturbing path of self-demolition and a dastardly Javier Bardem emitting increments of creepiness and noxiousness, plus an eye-catching menacing presence from a barnstorming Ms. Pfeiffer, this masochistic allegory is shunted to a less savory orbit by Aronofsky's abandon in his well- intentional ideology and a no-holds-barred modality (is that you Kristen Wiig?), when you make God acts like Satan, the ennobled epithet ""auteur"" is incontrovertibly degraded as ""provocateur"", thus, no universal acclaim can be garnered from that stigmatized word."
"stroggos","7","1","2","28 September 2017"," Watch it to make up your own mind—deeply disturbing
","Ugh, ""Mother!"" makes you feel bad... Jennifer Lawrence's character just moved in with her husband, a poet played by Javier Bardem. Their seemingly idyllic life becomes interrupted when a mysterious man and a woman, played by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, invite themselves to the couple's new home... and from there on, things spiral downward.<br/><br/>Among the many good things that stand out about ""Mother!"" is Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. Her face fills almost every shot and the whole story is told in a deeply subjective way from her perspective: As she is trying to make sense of what is happening around her, so are we.<br/><br/>When I watched the trailers for ""Mother!"", I thought this was just going to be a rip-off of ROSEMARY'S BABY, but in fact, the movie is nothing like that. You continue to be surprised from beginning to end, and there is a lot of mystery that is deeply haunting. The suspense keeps going as you try to make sense of this movie, which is deeply metaphorical and open to many interpretations. You will leave the theatre wondering what you just saw and discussing the deeper meaning with your friends. Because ""Mother!"" is rich, contextualized and multi-layered, it's best to just see it for yourself, if you don't mind being deliberately confused and irritated, and if you don't mind a lot of religious subtext."
"bram-81557","5","1","2","20 September 2017"," mother!
","Mother! is that kind of movie that wants to say so much, your brain can't handle it anymore. The setup of the 'i want to be different movie' is a kind of bad nightmare what you have when you're having a fever. Sometimes it's also feeling that way, but it's in a bad sort of way. Mother! or mother! wants to make so much statements, about how the humanity treats each other, and the dis respect against mother nature nowadays, that the whole point of the movie fades away. Thereby you don't care about the character 'mother', because it's not realistic anymore. And i haven't spoke about the whole religious part of the movie yet. The film is like a big wave coming towards you. At first sight it looks thrilling, when it hits you it stays in a freaky kind of way nice. But when you notice you can't get yourself to the surface, and the water keeps running, you want it to be over as soon as possible. The marketing concerning this movie was also strange. it seemed like is was promoted as the next big horror movie, instead it is an experimental psychological art-house movie. Despite all of this, in potential it wasn't a bad movie. Darren Aronofsky can get the best out of his cast and crew members again. Especially in the first bit of the movie the cinematography and natural lighting were sometimes stunning."

","Mother! is like an onion. Running at just over 2 hours it is going to be a terrible experience for your average moviegoer who is going into it only looking at the surface level, leaving them in tears an hour in, while on the other hand, people who enjoy the unraveling of the multiple layers will love it. Plenty to think about and discuss with your fellow moviegoers after leaving the theater, I suggest seeing it at a reasonable hour in order to digest it. <br/><br/>The acting was terrific, Jennifer Lawerence is great leading us through her character's point of view. Javier Bardem's screen presence fits his role (""Him"") well, while Michelle Pfeiffer reminds you of that older, boorish, white privilege (living in Frankfurt, Germany this archetype is common) who lost her filter years ago.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky accomplishes what he sets out to do: create a mask for an old cosmogony. Well done!"

","You know it's art if it causes an outrage. I totally love how this film exposes all those rather vocal idiots, who are eager to declare how much they ""hate"" this film. Nicely played Arnofsky, seriously :D<br/><br/>Mother is brilliant. It is Arnofsky's best, most refined work by far. It lures the unsuspecting viewer in with the promise of solving it's first half mystery, only to brutally deliver it's extremely uncomfortable message during the second half.<br/><br/>I think Arnofsky deserves an Oscar for trolling all those outraged reviewers on this very site alone.

"jay-techie2007","9","3","12","7 October 2017"," Must watch for the sheer acting brilliance and impeccable direction
","A highly symbolic movie. Brilliant work, especially in terms of performances of the lead cast and a very offbeat direction. You would either love it like hell or hate it to the core since there are a lot of metaphors to decode - if you miss it from the beginning, you would pretty much be puzzled for the rest of the movie but if you are able to, then it's a treat to watch. But, definitely to be given a chance - but don't go if you are thinking to watch a movie to cheer yourself up - this one will definitely not do that. <br/><br/>Story (8/10): If I draw the parallels - there is God, there is mother nature earth, Adam, Eve, the forbidden fruit, Jesus and the destruction of nature by humans and even more. So, you got a sense of what to expect in the story. I loved the way the story is written, especially creating a metaphorical reference to a known history - it is a documentary turned into a gripping story. It is a little disturbing at some points but the flow just makes sense. It is quite a predictable story once you get a hang of things. <br/><br/>Acting (9/10): This was one of the strongest departments of the movie with strong performances by the entire lead cast. The movie was largely riding on Jennifer Lawrance's shoulder and she continued to amaze. This is probably one of her best and most intense performances till date. JL was well supported by Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. Michelle Pfeiffer looked quite intimidating, rightly so, and gave a tough competition to Jennifer Lawrance. Javier Bardem didn't have as much breadth as JL to show the acting prowess and a vague character sketch didn't help either. <br/><br/>Direction (10/10): The entire movie is shot within a house - but they have made it large enough to have a variety in terms of locations. I loved Darren Aronofsky's direction. Conceptualization of some of the scenes to keep it close to the metaphorical reference is absolutely brilliant and innovative - especially the ones in the latter half. He made it a little too intense to handle, especially the double climax made a movie tad bit longer than necessary. The pacing actually helped in keeping the attention alive. <br/><br/>Overall (9/10): Great movie - must be watched for the sheer acting brilliance and impeccable direction. Loved it!!"
"msbreviews","8","3","12","1 October 2017"," Rating: A-
","I'm seating here thinking ""how can I review this film without spoiling at least a small hint of what the plot really is?"". To be clear, the marketing for this movie isn't exactly honest, but I also don't think it's trying to be deceiving. It tries to be mysterious and to some viewers that might negatively affect them once they actually watch the film because mother! has NOTHING to do with whatever the trailers are selling.<br/><br/>This is a film that's going to be discussed for years without end due to one of the most controversial, offensive and shocking screenplays of all-time. It's based on an extremely delicate theme and that's the reason why critics are either glorifying or destroying this movie, there isn't a middle term for mother!.<br/><br/>As for myself, I truly think that Darren Aronofsky just produced a masterpiece. It deserves some Oscar's nominations, but I very much doubt that even Jennifer Lawrence is going to get one. The Academy is definitely going to ignore this film since it can easily bring a big group of protesters to start a whole new preconception. So, why do I side with the people that state that this is a great movie?<br/><br/>Honestly, the story is told in such an unbelievably amazing way that it elevates everything else. Midway through the runtime, it's relatively easy to figure out where the film is heading and what it really is about. The subtleness in the details, the depth in the metaphors and the thought-provoking allegories makes this one of Aronofsky's best scripts.<br/><br/>There isn't a single misplaced moment, everything has some sort of metaphorical meaning which brings a sense of mystery and uncertainty to every scene. His vision is quite dark, intense and sometimes (too) shocking, but it's fantastically realized. He directs the hell out of this movie: an excellent use of the camera (several long one- takes), a very suspenseful soundtrack and a beautifully edited third act, that show all of his perspectives on some thrilling and unbreathable  25- 30 minutes.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say that for you to love this film you have to share the same opinion as of the director, but it does help if you at least understand his way of thinking. I'm not going to lie, I pretty much share the same vision when it comes to the evolution of the theme that he explores. However, that doesn't mean that some scenes are stretched too far because they are indeed super powerful and shocking, but I think that's Aronofsky letting his rage and anger flow in the screenplay.<br/><br/>As for the rest of his work, the suspense is very well utilized, especially in the first two acts where there's still a general perception of a conventional horror/thriller genre. The characters are extremely well-developed due to his excellent writing that never breaks the first law of storytelling: ""never tell"". There isn't any expositional dialogue, in fact, there are some lines that are very profound and significant that I'll keep in mind for the next few days.<br/><br/>There are only a few people left to mention, the ones that take the director's words into something more through their exquisite acting. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem have two Oscar-worthy performances that are probably going to be snubbed by The Academy.<br/><br/>J-Law is at the top of her game and this movie proves it. The internet has been over-saturated with her appearance in every single film nowadays, but I think that's due to her quick, exponential growth in popularity. She's a wonderful actress and the multi- layered amount of emotion that she brings to her character is astonishing. It's a terrific, compelling and incredibly committed display that pushes her to the top contenders' list for the major awards.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem also gives an excellent performance, even if it's his counterpart that catches the bigger chunk of screen time. Still, he shows a very powerful, crazy and passionate dedication to his role, something that definitely elevates his character. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer have supporting jobs and their chemistry seem both honest and sassy, which some people might find strange, but I thoroughly enjoyed their performances.<br/><br/>Despite all of the incredible directing skills, there are still some issues. The second act's pacing seems unbalanced, especially in the slow parts where I honestly think the movie brings himself down a bit. In addition to this, the loud soundtrack mixed with some fast cuts convey a sense of convolution at times, even if it's meant to confuse the audience. However, I think most of this can be smoothed out with a second viewing.<br/><br/>Still, this film isn't for everyone. It truly isn't. If I ever show this movie to my mom, she'll be terrified for the rest of her life. It's really intense and outrageously offensive, which connects to my bigger issue with the film: some scenes are simply not necessary. I mean, there are moments where I think that Aronofsky should have stopped writing for a second. I think his frustration took him to places in his mind that are far beyond any imagination and I didn't need to watch some gory stuff to understand his point of view.<br/><br/>But, all in all, mother! leaves the director's mark all over the place. Aronofsky writes a screenplay that is going to be discussed for years and it's definitely one of the most divisive movies ever. His masterful directing and his subtle, metaphorical and meaningful writing, elevate an extremely thought-provoking, intense and shocking story, told in a never-seen perspective. Jennifer Lawrence has an Oscar-worthy performance, as Javier Bardem supports her brilliantly, but some scenes are just too much gory and unnecessary to defend the director's statement.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews: follow my blog if you enjoyed my review! :)</li></ul>"

"markgorman","9","3","12","21 September 2017"," Aranofsky's masterpiece but it's not for everyone.
","Darren Aronofsky has followed up his biblical epic, Noah, with another biblical horror story starring Jennifer Lawrence (his partner in real life) and Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>Whilst advance publicity had suggested this might be heavily inspired by Rosemary's Baby this is not in fact the case.  Far from it. Rosemary's Baby is about the birth of Satan. This is not.<br/><br/>I found it helpful to know in advance what the premise of this film was and there is  a brilliant deconstruction of the plot in a great article by Adam White in the Telegraph. (Google it)<br/><br/>You may not want to know before you see it, but it's a great read after the fact and confirmed most of my assumptions about the heavy allegory and metaphor used in the movie.<br/><br/>To make two consecutive biblical films is surprising because Aronofsky has declared his atheism but presumably the source material is such brilliant storytelling that he simply could't resist.<br/><br/>What results in mother! is a film of such epic proportions, such horror, such artistry that at times your jaw actually drops.  Aronofsky stops at nothing.  There are no sacred beliefs that he cannot explore or visualise.  What he does not do is ridicule them.  This is a representative telling of Genesis, the New Testament,  earth science theory and sustainability all wrapped in one great Gothic whole.<br/><br/>And it's gorgeous, sumptuous and creepy.<br/><br/>The performances by Bardem and Lawrence are electrifying, albeit their togetherness as man and wife seems unlikely, but as the plot unravels it's obvious why.<br/><br/>The appearance of a married couple in the shape of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer (both extraordinary performances) into their lives is startling in its aloofness and cruelty.  One feels Lawrence's panic bubbling over as the idyll she is trying to create in an island home is about to gradually unwind.<br/><br/>And unwind it does; in increasingly spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into spoiler territory (read the Telegraph article for that - after you've seen the movie) so I'll stop here.  <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that although this won't appeal to many; for those that it does this is a truly great movie."

","Where do I start? I see it is described as Drama/Horror/Mystery. Drama yes there was heaps of that but it was just weird. Horror, well ""Get Out"" was the first horror I've seen for a long time and I understood that, but this beggared belief. Mystery, certainly as it took viewers on a story that seemed plausible for a short while, then threw several very large monkey wrenches in for good luck. Just when you seemed to latch on to the story again it weaved and darted about on more mindless tangents.<br/><br/>But I cannot say I hated it so there may be a glimmer of hope for some. It may become a cult in years to come but it certainly won't be in my DVD collection.<br/><br/>In the end I would have to describe it as ""irritating"", It truly does your head in trying to follow the story."

","Javier Bardem is God. Jennifer Lawrence is Mother Nature. Ed Harris is Adam. We see Ed Harris with a wound in his side when he's being sick. He is spewing up a rib (in the Bible God takes a rib from Adam to make Eve). Surprise surprise, Michelle Pfeiffer turns up in the next scene symbolising Eve. Adam and Eve break the fire heart after being forbidden from the room where it rests, thus representing the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. The two sons arrive, one son murders the other, therefore playing the roles of Caine and Able, which leads to chaos and the flood. The ending: Mother Nature realises humanity is like a plague, so destroys the world. God HAS to continue creating and NEEDS to be loved and worshipped, so he takes the heart of fire from Mother Nature's chest and starts to create the world from scratch. <br/><br/>Mother! is a fantastic film if you can be bothered working out the symbolism. Definitely a film for film buffs to pick apart. It's a ten from me."
"Reznik_T","8","2","7","8 December 2017"," Riveting!
","The film is about a couple (played by Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence) living in a solitary house, the husband being a poet in creative crisis, with his wife wholeheartedly supporting him and trying to keep their home clean and tidy. One day strangers start to show up at their house, first an older man (Ed Harris), then his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer), then their two sons, which then leads to some conflict, and things start to become more and more strange and dark. The wife of the poet doesn't understand why all these people keep appearing at their home, and why her husband is so welcoming and emphatetic to them, while being cold and distant to her. <br/><br/>Mother! has elements of drama, horror, mystery, psychological thriller and social commentary. It puts you in a position where you see things from Jennifer Lawrence's perspective, not being sure what and why is happening around her, and feeling that something is definitely not right in that house and with those people. The movie has an unsettling atmosphere, and eventually (at around the 90 minute mark) you realize that nothing in it is what it appears to be, the film is an allegory - of possibly not just one but a variety of things. Which is probably one of the main reasons why many people don't like it; because when things are somewhat revealed, they feel like they were tricked into believing that the movie was something else. (That's actually the reason why I gave it an 8 instead of a 9, but I still like it a lot, I actually think this is one of the best films of the year). <br/><br/>A huge shout-out to Jennifer Lawrence whom I never thought would impress me with her acting as much as she did in this one. Her performance in Mother! is so delicate, so emotional, so real, that I couldn't but feel sympathy for her character throughout the film. She is amazing in this!<br/><br/>If you saw The Fountain (another movie from Aronofsky), and you liked it, Mother! might be another one for you. It has similar themes, but goes even further in being abstract and different from mainstream Hollywood cinema."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","2","7","29 September 2017"," Regardless of how you choose to read the piece, 'Mother!' will get you talking and, whether you liked it or not, that can only mean it was at least interesting.
","If there's one thing to be said for the controversial and polarising 'Mother!', it's that it is without a doubt an interesting allegorical experiment that has gotten people talking, whether it be to sing its praises or declare it trash or simply just to discuss it. While I don't think it is anywhere near as disturbing as some people - and indeed some of the marketing materials - are purporting it to be (though that's not to say it's particularly lax when it comes to the distressing scene department), there's no doubt it eventually becomes an incredibly frustrating and uncomfortable watch in the best way possible. A tangible anxiety starts to set in when the previously off-kilter feel transforms into downright claustrophobic chaos; in fact, the more intense sequences are almost enough to induce a real sense of enochlophobia. Towards the end, though, things start to get a little silly as all subtlety is thrown out the window so that the director's point can be hammered home. What's interesting is that after my initial viewing I have several interpretations as to what that point is exactly - the keenest of which seemed so obvious that I was surprised to learn it wasn't an intention of the people behind the film at all. While I'm certain Aronofsky had a specific subtext in mind during his self-described 'five-day fever dream' of a writing process, I think that this ambiguity - along with the general non-conformity of the piece - is ultimately a strength and a reason why it stands out amidst a sea of paint-by-numbers sequels and bargain- bin adaptations. Regardless of how you choose to read the picture, it's clear that the experience, which is one that still works even without the larger metaphorical context, is one you won't soon forget and a testament to the fact that sometimes even the creator can't predict every valid understanding of their work. 7/10"
"Hereticked","9","2","7","26 September 2017"," A Misanthropic Masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky drops an atomic bomb on the cinematic landscape, bringing passion and artistic vision to the box office where those qualities are in short supply. Mother! might be the most well crafted, intense and creative dissection of religious mythology ever made. It starts out as a slow burn mystery, feeling almost like a dream, but soon plunges forth into nightmare territory. It takes all the assumptions and contradictions of Christian dogma, contrasts them with the reality of our relationship to the Earth, and splatters them across the canvas in all their hideous cruelty.<br/><br/>This is not a film for people who like to have their hands held by simplistic plots, lots of exposition and a paint-by-numbers procession of events. That doesn't mean you need to be a genius to understand its ideas, but it does mean you're going to have to think and some knowledge of the Bible is handy in deciphering its threads. Most of the negative reviews I've read for Mother! were from people who made no attempt to understand it, claimed it's ""pretentious"" with no supporting argument, or they understood the film on some level but simply didn't like its message. By even engendering this strong of an emotional reaction, Darren Aronofsky has emerged victorious and demonstrated that his work is culturally relevant.<br/><br/>On top of its achievements in the realm of story and ideas, Mother! is also a visual and audio marvel, creating an atmosphere of utter claustrophobia that's as crushing to the audience as it is to the female lead. The tight camera angles and spiking soundtrack ramp up the tension as the movie proceeds from general unease to outright panic. This was a film that was designed to make its audience feel uncomfortable on multiple levels and it does so splendidly.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Aronofsky's other head scratchers and psychological thrillers (Pi, Requiem For A Dream, The Fountain and Black Swan) you're going to love Mother! If you didn't like those films, chances are you won't like this one either. In the opinion of this reviewer, Darren Aronofsky has taken another step forward in an already impressive career, solidifying his place as one of the best directors of our time."
"kjproulx","8","2","7","25 September 2017"," A Messed Up, Yet Powerful Experience
","Horror films have been on a roll lately, but if anyone can combine genres and flip his story on its head, it's director Darren Aronofsky. Films such as The Wrestler and Black Swan were some of my favourite films in their respective years of release, so I was naturally very excited to see Mother!. Although I will be talking very highly about this film for the most part, my initial viewing experience of it was slightly frustrating. Aronofky remains as talent as ever and I truly look forward to all of his works to come, but this was definitely on the lower tier of his resume, even though there are some incredible moments. Mother! will definitely have its audience that falls in love with its material, but a word of caution has to be presented to those who don't know what they're getting themselves into. <br/><br/>When Mother! begins, it feels very much like a creepy romance that begins to spiral out of control once a few unexpected guests arrive at their home. Jennifer Lawrence plays an unnamed character, and while her husband seems a little off, things seem somewhat normal until the guests arrive. You may be draw in by its creepiness or the sense of mystery surrounding the events, but there's something that just doesn't seem right either. Steam surely picks up by the time the film reaches its final act, and I quite honestly loved where the film ends up, but it took a little too long to peak my full interest to say that I loved this movie overall. <br/><br/>By the time the guests arrive, the core plot sets itself in motion, which definitely becomes more interesting than anything leading up to that portion of the film, but again, something still felt missing. The mysteriously written screenplay was very well-crafted, in that I found myself wondering what was going to happen next. You know a film is well made when it has you guessing throughout its entire duration, but it seemed as though it wasn't building to anything extravagant. That being said, the third act of Mother! gives you more answers than you could possibly have asked for (maybe even a little too much).<br/><br/>From insanely brutal imagery, to some pretty terrific set design, to a revelation throughout the last 20 minutes, Mother! becomes a film that's far better than anything it sets itself up to be throughout its first two acts. This is why I find this film completely frustrating in retrospect, because it takes far too long to really become incredible with its storytelling. Yes, there are things set up within its first act, giving off the impression that it's just bizarre to be bizarre, except there is more to the film than meets the eye (which I truly can't explain with words here). This is a movie that's worth watching for its final act, and the third act has to be seen to really be believed. <br/><br/>In the end, this is a very impressive film as a whole, but it takes a little too long to get where it needs to be in order to impress its audience. I found myself slightly bored or a little too excited to see what happens next, which slightly took away from the experience in my opinion, but it compensates with one of my favourite endings to a film all year. Mother! isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and I won't even be calling it one of the best films that 2017 has to offer, but if you're looking for a messed up roller coaster ride that leaves you breathless by the end, even if it's a little uneven, then I definitely recommend Mother! to you. With all of that said, here is a warning that some people need. Before going into this film, please be weary that there are some extremely horrifying imagery towards the end of this film. Some people will regret they watched it for these images, but if you're up for anything, then sit back and enjoy this crazy ride."

","Mother is a hard film to describe in great detail because the religious metaphors were incredibly shocking to see and the craziness of the finale sort of detailed the pacing of an otherwise finely paced film that had a great performance from Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. This movie: if Darren Arranofsky's intention was to shock and confuse the audience, he succeeded on that front ten-fold.<br/><br/>Mother wasn't BAD, but it wasn't GOOD either. It's an art-house horror movie that marketed itself as something along the lines of IT: or something.<br/><br/>I'm all for metaphors and allegories in cinema, but when it's taken to such an extent that it gets in the way of its whole 'GOD DID IT' story it leaves you wondering would the film work without all the pseudo-religious commentary at play?

"nordicsoul","8","2","7","19 September 2017"," Not for the faint of heart, Mother! is a visceral experience and story that needed to be told
","Not since his 2006 opus The Fountain has Darren Aronofsky unleashed a film as polarizing as Mother. A pretentious melange of religion, misogamy, paranoia, fear and death of all that is pure and innocent, Mother! is as unrelenting as Aronofsky's acclaimed break out film Requiem for a Dream (2000).<br/><br/>Largely marketed as horror film, beneath the surface Mother! is an allegorical tale where a writer/poet (Bardem) creatively struggles to find his muse, while his wife (Lawrence) works tireless to rebuild their home, which was mysteriously destroyed in a fire. As the story unfolds various Old Testament Biblical figures begin to visit the writer (God) to express their devotion and adoration (i.e. Adam, Eve, Cane, Able, etc.). Each of these visitors is riddled with flaws as they attempt to atone for their sins. In the process, they destroy God's most cherished possession and much of their home (earth) which the Mother has been desperately protecting. In a fit of rage she expels these visitors, much to the chagrin of God (end Old Testament).<br/><br/>Entering into the New Testament of Biblical allegories, Mother convinces God to conceive a child. God reverts to an even more narcissistic state as devoted followers begin storming their home once again. I won't go into the details, but lets just say the bulk of the negative reviews stem from Aronosky's portrayal of a world gone mad as these zealots attempt to control through fear, murder, rape and utter carnage. As a result, the Mother's home (earth) turns into a war zone.<br/><br/>Anyone raised either Christian or Jewish should easily pick up on the themes in Mother! What I found poignant was Aronofsky's personification of a patriarchal, theistic society ruled by a narcissistic God who would time-and-time again sacrifice his own wife, mother, child and home (earth) to be worshiped. These same patriarchal themes occur in nearly all organized religions, and are the basis of most political systems today. Knowing the writer/director is an outspoken environmentalist, I can certainly understand the not-so-subtle message here.<br/><br/>Due to the visceral response it has received -grade F on CinemaScore- I can't in good conscious recommend Mother! What I can say is that the performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are Oscar-worthy. In addition, I felt the combination of direction, cinematography, editing and sound design created a surrealist nightmare of a world that at times induced genuine nausea. As someone who doesn't shy away from disturbing films of this nature, Mother! is as impactful a movie as I've experienced all year. I sincerely hope that the abrasive nature of the film doesn't overshadow the urgency of the themes conveyed here. Considering the film was largely marketed to mainstream audiences as a horror film starring A-list actors, I suspect some of negative reaction by the general public shows a lack of comprehension and/or a genuine distaste for film's complete lack of resolution."

After awhile, the couple's 2 sons (real life brothers Brian and Domnhall Gleason) come violently charging in.  Did I mention that the house seems to be alive and there is blood and violence and things don't seem to be what they seem to be on the surface.<br/><br/>And that's only the first 1/2 of this film - the coherent part - because after that, things get bizarre and then even more bizarre and then really bizarre.<br/><br/>But...is this film worth watching?   Hmmm...I don't think I'd go that far, unless you want your mind played with and have some bizarre images thrown at you (some grotesque and disturbing) which will make you want to talk about it afterwards.<br/><br/>I see a lot of films, so was thankful for something different - albeit strange.  But, I don't think most of you will like this at all.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  C (But a strong, interesting, bizarre C)<br/><br/>4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"12_Monkeys","9","3","13","5 October 2017"," A controversial masterpiece doomed to be under-appreciated
","Aronofsky's always been dark. There's no doubt about it. I think his ""lighter"" film would be ""The Fountain"", but if you think about ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""The Wrestler"", ""Black Swan"" or even ""Pi""... the tone of this new film shouldn't really come as a surprise to anyone.<br/><br/>Yes, it is true that this film is the darkest one, specially because of the graphic violence of the third act, but that didn't spoil the film for me.<br/><br/>I think as viewers, we're supposed to engage with films, but also distance ourselves from them far enough to appreciate their value. I cannot sit here and tell you that I ENJOYED the film, because that would be a lie, or it would make me mentally unstable. I did enjoy the first two acts of the film, the deliciousness of the slow-burn psychological thriller that constitutes the first two thirds of the story. But I can't grasp a person who could say they enjoyed the third act, because it is there to be appreciated, to send a brutal message, ""like a missile into a wall"" (in the director's words), but it's not there to be enjoyed, I don't think.<br/><br/>In any case, a film that is capable of making you squirm in your chair, and feel physically ill while watching it, is something special. Simply because it is not an easy task to achieve that visceral reaction in an audience, and it is even harder to do it with meaning, with a purpose. As Harvey Weinstein said in an interview while talking about ""Nosferatu"": ""it is too scary to look at, but too fascinating to look away from."" (Actually the cinema I watched ""mother!"" at was full, and lots of people were complaining out-loud during the screening about how bad the film was, but NOT ONE OF THEM walked out of the theater before the ending... just something to think about.)<br/><br/>Aronofsky asks as much of his audience, as we ask of our filmmakers. I'm not talking about the audience that wants to be entertained without having to think or question themselves, I'm talking about a mature audience, the ones that challenge themselves to think outside the box, to be better than the average person who sits numbingly waiting to be entertained like a dictator would ask of a buffoon. This audience, who is constantly begging for better content, for bolder narratives, and directors who take risks, is the audience who should not only appreciate this film, but has the responsibility to at least analyze it long enough to give it the valued criticism it deserves from us.<br/><br/>We, as an audience, are equally responsible for the risks the filmmakers take, and for the quality of their work. If we restrain ourselves from appreciating a work of art, simply because it made us feel uncomfortable, we do not deserve the level of storytelling this helmer is offering us.<br/><br/>When you watch this film (if you haven't already, or even if you're watching it again), think not of how disgusting it is to experience the difficult and violent scenes, but rather think about what they mean in the context of the story, what they mean to the characters in the story, and maybe you'll get to appreciate it in the level it deserves to be appreciated.<br/><br/>After you do, ask yourself (as I did a day after I watched it for the first time): did I enjoy this? (Hell no!). Do I think it's a good film? (An absolute gem.)"

It's non-linear and there aren't many clear time passages. It's unsettling because you don't always know — actually, almost never knows what's going on.

For the first 2/3rds of Mother!, I sat wondering what in the world Cole saw in this slow and opaquely weird style-trip. Then the final act hit, and I experienced 30 minutes of the most head-pounding insanity I've ever seen, the result of which not only overshadowed the previous 90 minutes, but shed life-giving light into it. I knew nothing of Mother! beforehand. I knew Aronofsky's heady filmography, and saw the darkly trippy trailers, but the story details were hidden, which was part of the fun. I will say only this: Lawrence and Bardem play a sequestered couple whose lives are disrupted by some mysterious guests. From there, things getstrange. Jumping between the quiet meticulousness of Kubrick and the eye-widening peculiarity of Lynch, it's a movie-lovers utopia. Even when I was hating it, I was perplexingly intrigued, before becoming completely enrapt with adoration. With Get Out, It Comes at Night, Split, and now Mother!, this has certainly been the year of unconventional horror. However, where most of these have a fairly broad reach, Mother! won't even come close to being for everyone. If you don't want your brain power, belief systems or general comfort violently disturbed, stay away.

","Darren Aronofsky's new film, mother!, is like going through one of those Halloween haunted houses not knowing what lurks in the next room or around the corner. At the same time, messing with your mind with cult-like images and grand disastrous set pieces. To put it bluntly, mother! will psychological blow your mind. Directed by the brilliant Darren Aronosfky, mother! stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a nameless couple living in an early 19th century Victorian home somewhere away from of society. A couple strangers (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) enter the picture and are unwilling to leave. Then all hell breaks loose when more unwanted guests arrive. <br/><br/>There's no way to go into plot details without spoiling the film for those who dare, yes DARE, go see it. Let's just say, mother! takes you on an unexpected ride. You'll be wondering if Lawrence's character (again, she has no name) is going through psychotic episodes like: is she really seeing a beating, burned human heart coming up from the toilet and could that be a bloody vagina melting through the floorboards? Whatever these images mean to her (and us), will certainly be answered in the third act. Is this a horror film like Rosemary's Baby? Could be. Is this a very elaborate Twilight Zone episode? Perhaps. Whatever it is, mother! is the darkest, most twisted and definitely most original movie I've seen all year long."
"dermobreen","8","3","14","16 September 2017"," A Grand Guignol for today's audiences
","Here's a film you don't see every day.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky, who famously directed Black Swan, has brought us another mind- twisting, psychological work of horror. Or is it? Maybe it's a thriller? Maybe it's a film about mental breakdown? I do know mother! will stubbornly refuse to be categorised and will divide audiences: some will be lost and some will see it as an allegory. What starts off as an idyll turns into suspense, then an overwhelming barrage of the senses followed by despair.<br/><br/>The opening scene features a house recovering from a devastating fire until the camera settles on the form of Jennifer Lawrence who wakes up to find her partner, Javier Bardem missing from the bed. We learn later he is a poet. As he struggles with lack of inspiration, Lawrence sets about refurbishing their house, which is evidently a passion of hers. She feels a connection to the house and in a series of never- explained sequences, appears to experience the literal beating heart of the house. The exact nature of their relationship is never fully revealed until the end of the film. Their life is interrupted by the arrival of Ed Harris and subsequently Michelle Pfeiffer (in a delicious, over the top, Cruella deVille performance).<br/><br/>It is at this point one notices the lack of names in the film. From beginning to end, no one's name is mentioned. This adds to the unnerving and eventually de-humanising aspects of the story. This is a conscious decision by the writer and director and it works on a subconscious level, much as Kubrick's set for the Overlook Hotel sought to confuse viewers of The Shining.<br/><br/>Harris and Pfeiffer (who are apparent fans of the poet) are invited to stay in the house, at the behest of Bardem and to the dismay of Lawrence. The tension starts to build as the invited guests start to take Lawrence and the house for granted. Lawrence tries to get them to leave without success. Things take a turn when Harris and Pfeiffer's sons arrive to argue over their parents will. The brothers, played by real-life brothers Domhnall and Brian Gleeson proceed to fight and tragedy ensues. The film continues to descend into an assault on the senses, almost to the point of farce but it never quite crosses that line. Instead it infused me with a bewilderment and a dread of cults. Act Three is difficult to watch as it turns in to a house of horrors, a real Grand Guignol.<br/><br/>Throughout, Matthew Libatique's camera focuses on Lawrence's face, rarely leaving it, suggesting we are seeing things from her perspective. Unusually for Lawrence, normally used to empowering roles in her films, we see her helpless and despairing. Bardem remains a mystery to us, right up to the final frame of the film. Harris, Pfeiffer and the Gleesons are all spot on. Hats off to casting team.<br/><br/>This is not a timid film. There is subtext built upon subtext. You will not see anything like this in cinemas today and I guess for some time to come and for that, it is welcome.<br/><br/>4 out of 5."

","I am pretty mixed on Darren Aronofsky as a filmmaker. I absolutely love both Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, both are excellent. The rest though, are pretty eh. Noah was probably my least favorite of his, so I was excited to see if Aronofsky could reach back for another great film. The trailer's do not reveal much but I do like Jennifer Lawrence so wanted to catch this on its premiere day regardless. After watching, I have to say its pretty hard to unpack or explain what I just saw but I know I did have an enjoyable time.<br/><br/>The film shows two people who don't have names but are referred to as Mother and Him. They live in a remote house and seemingly have a lovely quiet life at first. She takes care of the house while he struggles to write. One day a mysterious man played by Ed Harris stops by and stays over. Later he is joined by his wife. It's hard to share much more without giving away major spoilers but lets just say things quickly become crazy afterwards. Aspects of the film will start not to make sense although I'm sure there is an allegorical meaning to everything Aronofsky does.<br/><br/>The footage is grainy giving a rusty feel. Lawrence is really good. Say what you want, she puts in a quality effort. The camera is very personal, always close to her face. She does well to emote the bizarre horror and confusion about the situations she's placed in. Michelle Pfeiffer also puts forth quite a performance as a shady, bitchy, sex crazed wife with seemingly dark tendencies. The film has virtually no score but the film is still able to reverberate.<br/><br/>I found this film to have the look and feel of Rosemary's Baby at first with the situation and dark nature of mystery surrounding the strangers. Its still an apt comparison and I think the film is definitely influenced by Polanski's work but Aronofsky puts his own spin on his meaning, especially in the second half. There is an allegorical connection between the film and mother earth and how we reap and rampage and destroy something so pure. There are also biblical connotations that I feel I'll need to have a rewatch for before trying to analyze what's happening. There is also a commentary on idolization and the expansive nature and danger of it.<br/><br/>My theater crowd mostly seemed to hate it but I appreciated what I saw. Its not the best from Aronofsky and doesn't rank among the aforementioned quality films of his, but its quite ambitious as you would expect it to be. I don't know if many will understand how to interpret the latter parts of this film but the joy is in trying. While the film isn't anything amazing, its one of those that will have you thinking and will polarize its viewers. Somehow, I know that's what Aronofsky wanted.<br/><br/>7/10"
"pjovanovic5","10","2","8","9 March 2018"," Timeless masterpiece
","One of the best movies I ever watched. Everything is perfect in this movie."
"nbfcblog","9","2","8","1 October 2017"," Worthy of the Exclamation Point!
","Even though Aronofsky has never done a straight-up horror, he sure has made some really scary films such as Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream (read my review here). That is one of the reasons that the trailer, released a few months back, for his latest creation peaked my interest because it looked like his most horror-like effort to date.<br/><br/>One of the things that first came to mind when watching the trailer was Rosemary's Baby, which is one of Aronofsky's favorite movies. However, while mother! does prove to be his most horror-like entry to date, it is far from the jump-scare horror thriller that the trailers have sold it as and even the plot summary provided above is only the tip of the iceberg as to what this movie has in store.<br/><br/>Instead, mother! proves to be something a lot more unconventional, daring, and absolute bonkers!!<br/><br/>If you thought the third act of Black Swan was insane.well Aronofsky somehow manages to top even THAT with unexpected apocalyptic imagery, cannibalism and a very surreal cameo by a certain SNL alumni.<br/><br/>This is art-house horror to the max in which nothing presented through the lens of our protagonist should be taken as objective fact (think Eraserhead, Lost Highway or even 2014's Babadook) and EVERYTHING is a metaphor meant to represent something else.<br/><br/>To me the story is working on two levels.<br/><br/>Level 1 is a relationship drama concerning our protagonists' (Lawrence) increasing frustration with her narcissistic husband's obsession over his art and the outside attention it brings. I can see the significant others of famous artists or celebrities relating very heavily to the drama portrayed on screen. Weirdly enough, in a case of life imitating art, both Lawrence and Aronofsky (twice her age) started dating each other during the production of this movie.<br/><br/>Level 2 is an allegorical presentation of the Bible with Lawrence being ""mother nature"", Bardem ""God"", Ed Harris ""Adam"" and Pfeiffer ""Eve"". The biblical metaphors only grow in prominence, and even a bit heavy-handed, as the movie progresses to its bombastic third- act. Aronofsky is at Lars Von Trier-level of nihilism, delivering an unflinching portrait of all the worst aspects and atrocities of humanity.<br/><br/>Obviously, there is a lot to un-pack with this film, but even without the multi-leveled allegorical narrative, there is a whole lot more artistic merit that oozes from the screen. Aronofsky keeps the camera very tight and claustrophobic (don't take a drink every time the camera is close to Lawrence face because you WILL become dead drunk), creating a suffocating atmosphere of unease. The cinematography alone does a great job in establishing the geography of the couple's house and making it seem almost like another character.<br/><br/>And even the movie's worst critics have to admit.the performances are incredible across the board. Both Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are absolutely fantastic in their roles, especially Lawrence in capturing the intense paranoia and agony that her character is going through due to the increasing amount of strange individuals that populate her husband's house. Outside of the two main leads props should also be given to Michelle Pfeiffer; who delivers some really intense and un-nerving words towards Lawrence's character throughout the story.<br/><br/>Even though I really like this movie, I will fully admit (hopefully this isn't going to sound pretentious) that it is not for everybody. Aronofsky is not exactly known for making uplifting films and mother! is no exception. None of the characters are straight-up likable and the narrative deals with very disturbing subject manner (human cruelty, abusive relationships, environmentalism, the divine problem of evil).<br/><br/>Now, this isn't to say art can't be unpleasant, in fact there is an argument to be made that the best art SHOULD make people feel uncomfortable, but this may account for why many of the audience members were turned off. I think another reason for why the movie is currently bombing at the box office is that it was going up against the financial juggernaut that is It (read my review here).<br/><br/>Whether you end up thinking this is a masterpiece or a mess, there is one thing that can be said for surethe movie is NEVER boring or NOT intriguing."

","I loved this film so much, I had to watch it twice. it's pretty hard not to spoil anything so I will say the most I can without giving things away. If you are thinking about watching this film and expect it to be a horror or thriller movie, don't watch it. You will be disappointed. The best approach to this in my opinion is to don't expect anything from it. <br/><br/>The film does have a deeper meaning though that not everyone seems to get (from my experience with fellow cinema audience). There are tons of references and analogies and you can not simply hate on a film just because you don't understand it. however, i can see how people who do understand it might not like it, still. It is not everyone's cup of tea, I see how someone could think Aronofsky is trying too hard. i get that.<br/><br/>I still loved it.

","It was a great movie until I found out that Aronofsky himself sees Lawrence's character as the mother nature. Not only it makes no sense to oppose god with another superhuman entity, but also there's nothing in the movie to support that theory.<br/><br/>mother! creates order from chaos and gives her love to the ones she holds dear - traits characteristic not of nature, but of man! Also, mother! is god's home, because that's where god lives - in the human mind. Otherwise, no matter whether we are setting the table for supper, painting the house or fighting for our life, he's not there.<br/><br/>And when the next gorgeous creature wakes up in an empty bed with no god beside it, my only wish is to cry out: don't you give him your love, cause the basement is full of corpses!!"
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","9","28 September 2017"," Guess who's coming to dinner
","""Mother!"" is an American 2-hour movie from 2017 and this one was freshly released a couple days ago. It is the newest work by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Darren Aronofsky and he got Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence to play the main character while being joined by Oscar winner Javier Bardem as something between male co-lead and biggest supporting actor. Anyway, this one here is the story of a couple living pretty much on their own without any contact to others really, but that is quickly about to change. And while Bardem's character, a struggling writer, enjoys the social networking, Lawrence's is all against it and wants to be left alone. This, however, is the exact opposite of what Ed Harris' and Michelle Pfeiffer's character (a combined 9 Oscar nominations) have in mind. And these moments when it is just the four of them were the best the film had to offer. This may be because Lawrence was basically an observer in her own movie as honestly for 90 minutes she was walking around in disbelief at what her man and the visitors were doing and this was when the film worked. It may not have been deep or relevant, but it was entertaining, also when the Gleesons enter the picture.<br/><br/>But sadly, the last act was quite a mess. One problem was that here they really needed a great actress to pull it off, but Lawrence came truly short. There was one argument about her giving her baby to him and it was so obvious there how inferior Lawrence was to the Spanish actor. Apart from that I also felt the two did not have the greatest chemistry to be honest, which was fine most of the time though as real togetherness and love between the two weren't really depicted. The final 30 minutes are also another problem though because honestly they never felt as spectacular and mesmerizing as Aronofsky probably intended them to be. In my opinion, it was a big decrease in quality there, but I am relatively generous with my rating still because everything before that was decent. Just one example: The first time the house is packed, everybody leaves with the water splashing, but then they basically do exactly the same again, people are outside, then get in and then it escalates more and more. It did feel repetitive to be honest. I also felt like this film tends to lose itself a bit in all these metaphors and symbolisms it uses, especially once again in the last quarter where it becomes biblical really, almost apocalyptic. So yeah I definitely could have done without that crass cut towards the end and would have preferred them to stay on the quietly mysterious path instead of turning this into a fantasy film really. Luckily the majority of the movie was good enough for me to recommend the watch here, even if it is obviously nowhere near Aronofsky's best sadly. Or Bardem's best. And in terms of the cast, I would have preferred a 4-person ensemble and I think the movie would have turned out better that way, maybe add the Gleesons to that, and I also would have preferred another lead actress. Then again I am not a Lawrence fan at all, but it's telling a lot that Aronofsky who wrote Portman to Oscar glory (how about her as Mother?) and almost directed Rourke to an Oscar too cannot do the same with Lawrence as honestly a nomination would even be a big surprise, even if this character has so much in the last 40 minutes: ugliness, mother instincts, heart-broken wife etc. True Oscar bait. Maybe too much in too little, so all that may potentially stay from this film is the relationship between director and lead actress. And that is certainly not enough as this movie had a lot more to offer in theory. But they had to get in embarrassing make-believe moments telling us how gorgeous Lawrence is. Just like Hollywood wants us so desperately to believe how talented she is. I disagree with both. As for the film, it's still a thumbs-up from me, but a cautious one as the last act almost ruined it all, maybe 10 minutes too long too."
"Pzachlen","5","2","9","17 September 2017"," Don't get Darren Aronofsky.
","Having not yet seen this film, what I can say is I never got what critics and the public found so praise worthy. Black Swain was a film praised by so many. However the people who loved it did not get the subtle fact that her mother was a sexual predator. Seems no one but me caught a quick Cut while she is having her Lesbian sex scene when she sees her sex partner no other than Barbara Hershey, her mother. Also the way her Mother treats her, caters to her, says more about Mr. Aronofsky than any thing else. Seems to me that he has serious issues with his own Mother. Every film of his has a central figure being a Mother. Hope he has gotten over his Mommy issues and moves along. I only wish KEN RUSSELL were alive today to see what real self indulgence looks like. He was accused of it his entire life and died practically forgotten. His contribution to the real ART of film making has NEVER been given credit for."
"cjlove2523","4","2","9","15 September 2017"," Not the worst but not Darren's best by far (Minor Spoilers)
","Contains Spoilers. <br/><br/>Was somewhat disappointed in Mother! as I've been waiting for it for awhile and I usually don't ""wait for movies"" But I am a huge Darren Aronofsky fan and also Javier, Jennifer, Michelle, and Ed's casting all intrigued me. I think we were supposed to focus on the emotions with the Mother, (Earth) Jennifer Lawrence, but my eyes were fixated completely on Michelle Pfeiffer's extraordinary performance. She has always been beautiful, but she brought out some creepy, sexy, and very unsettling vibes/characteristics in her mannerisms, that I found myself squirming when she was on, which was pretty cool. The second half of the film has some very WTF moments, especially that of a baby being eaten, but I can't get too much into that. I rated this a 4/10 because of Michelle and Ed's performances and A for effort on Darren's part. Even though you can tell Jennifer Lawrence was trying to act, that was a problem. She's almost in every shot and her acting is not very subtle. All I saw was her TRYING to act. It didn't seem natural. Even scenes where she talks simplistically with her husband, it seems very campy. And especially when she was alone, I can't see many people making the faces she did even under the circumstances. She laid it on way too thick. I'm surprised after Natalie Portman's beautiful and haunting portrayal of a mentally disturbed ballerina in Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" he didn't have Jennifer tone down the overacting. Unless maybe he wanted it to be a bit more campy? Yet Javier Bardem who I absolutely love was kind of sleepwalking throughout, so he was doing the opposite. And yes there's an age difference which wouldn't be a problem if there was any kind of chemistry between the 2 leads which there is NONE! <br/><br/>Whereas Michelle, her subtly acting came so naturally which is why I got more lost in 'Woman.' If you like a good horror film, this won't be one to watch. It's kind of all over the place with no happy ending. I'd say wait for Red Box on this one. And watch the last 45 minutes on an empty stomach because... yuck! I suspect Jennifer will be nominated since she is an award show darling, but I'm really hoping Michelle Pfeiffer gets recognized for her part in this film!"
"hberry-51959","8","3","17","16 September 2017"," Very good - but will be misunderstood by most
","I was interested when I saw the advert of the film and who wrote the story and had a feeling what it might be about, as well because the posters seem to mislead you.<br/><br/>I was wondering. OK It says Mother! but you see a young woman and obviously here husband. And then there is a couple that appears. Who is mother?<br/><br/>With scepsis I went to see the film thanks to the bad reviews here. Glad I went anyway.<br/><br/>The film is actually very easy to understand, with certain knowledge, but I think a lot of people will miss absolutely the point.<br/><br/>If you get what the film is about, you will have fun. I think the fact people will miss the point of the film is, that they are not aware of the existence and power of mentally abusive mother-son (well actually mother-child, but here it is about mother-son) relationships and the psychological results. <br/><br/>It is a butterfly effect which is described in this film. This explains the overwhelming and at some point stressful sequences at the end of the film, but when you get what the author wants to tell you, you realize it all makes some sense and that he is trying just to mirror the reality. The world. Chaos and destruction, caused by mankind.<br/><br/>The title is Mother! <br/><br/>Like in Black Swan it is about the influence of egocentric mothers on their children, their behavior and there relationships. No worries I did not spoil the plot mentioning this.. This is just the essence of the film and if you understand this and the psychology, you understand the plot.<br/><br/>Think of Hitchcocks Psycho, Oedipus, projection, narcissism, emotional development. There is minimum one absolutely obvious analogy to Oedipus in this film<br/><br/>There are more symbols, but a lot of them I did not get yet. Will watch it again when the DVD gets released. <br/><br/>It is not entertainment. It is actually like a picture he drew. I am not much into art, but even I can see and appreciate this.<br/><br/>I think the actors are doing there job well. Sometimes it was a bit theatrical and exaggerated I have to admit. But here again, only if you grasp the plot, you'll get why they are playing their roles the way they do. It makes sense somehow. Taken that nothing is what it seems to be in this film. <br/><br/>Nothing is 100% something. Mother, wife, son, father... These are just symbols. Each character is a symbol. That is why they do not have names. <br/><br/>it is not a story about a couple that meets an other couple. It is a story about Mother! I think that is why they put the exclamation mark behind it, so that people pay attention to the title! <br/><br/>At the end I have to say, that it is not all Mothers!s fault... I have to say this, because like in Adam and Eve, the film transports a similar message about mankind, women and paradise idea. It can be therefore something that is serving the ideas of sexist people which is negative about the film, but does no harm to its quality! <br/><br/>He is doing and telling a story that (man) literature is telling since ever... :)<br/><br/>therefore for Mother! 8 stars!"

Except for some who like the Terrence Malick saccharine version of cinematography. Thirdly, it crosses the line and it offends. Some people cannot tolerate infanticide or blasphemy or closeups of women getting beaten up. Finally, some people just didn't like it. We don't all have to agree in everything.<br/><br/>The story is full of allegories and can be read in a number of different ways. He is the self-absorbed narcissist who needs to be worshipped; she is the ever-giving romantic who needs to create a loving nest. He is a god who does not care how far humans go, as long as they worship him; she is Mother Earth who is ignored and violated. He is full of human weaknesses, she has divine grace and sensitivities. But in the end he always wins and she always loses. He is willing to sacrifice everything, even his own son, and to start again with another woman. It is the eternal story of creation and destruction.<br/><br/>Our history and psyche is full of this darkness."

Visually the film is spectacular, the action is intriguing, strange, very uncomfortable and often visually violent. If I had seen the film as a teenager I would have devoured it for all the allegories and critical, cynical and sarcastic view of what it represents. Nowadays ... meh ... It is an artistic representation of a theme that has been discussed and discussed frequently, and with no real impact on those who would be its ""target"" given the allegorical and complex element in the way of passing the message.

Knowing the concept of this movie doesn't help it excel, either.<br/><br/>Mother! is incredibly boring to the point where I asked myself why I was watching it. The performances aren't particularly interesting or good enough to carry the whole film. I kept thinking of The Shining, which is also a slow burn, but it keeps you interested. There's not much here to keep you looking at the screen, despite some nice low lighting shots. The cinematography is bland and you don't care for ANY of the characters. It's an exercise in sitting patiently for the action to happen, which, if you don't know is a bible allegory, will be complete nonsense.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for the big reveal, but there is none.

Cinematography: beautifully disturbing. Plot: beyond great.<br/><br/>Go in with an open mind, expect the unexpected, but be warned: it's definately not for everyone."

However, this theme was drawn out SOOOOOO painfully long that it back fired and actually made me just hate the film over all. On a positive note, I do love the correlarion of how Mother Nature is constantly being raped by humans who are not fair to what is in the best interest of Earth.

","As one who appreciates allegory and loves a good cerebral film, this film is not it. It doesn't take a genius to see the Biblical themes and characters in this movie. For one, Aronofsky obviously doesn't understand anything about the Bible, but setting that aside, the allegory itself fails completely. An allegory functions on two levels: the surface story and the hidden story. The problem with mother! is that it commits to neither, switching back and forth between the surface and hidden stories without rhyme or reason. It feels like Aronofsky felt that shoving all of his Biblical views (which again, are a complete misrepresentation of the Bible) into a two-hour movie about a couple with an unnatural-unrealistic relationship.<br/><br/>This movie is the most pretentious attempt as symbolism I've ever seen."

Even though I recognized the director's name after I was compelled to google the details, I did so expecting to find that David O Russell was the director. The close shots with a hand held camera are his domain. And considering that Lawrence is his muse as Mastroianni is to Fellini, I would have hedged my bets in that direction. So this was a Trojan-Horse rip-off of another director that failed horribly."

--God and the Earth are two entirely separate entities (OK, this one is debatable among people of faith)
--God is male, Earth is female (tired stereotypes)
--more often than not, the needs and intentions of God and those of the Earth are at odds with each other
--from the beginning, Earth was antipathetic to human life, even before the first human had committed the first offense
--every human who has ever lived has been 100% selfish and wantonly destructive; there has never been a human who respected the Earth and cared for its resources
--God is an egotist who feeds on humans' attention and adoration
--most shocking of all, God does not care about the Earth or what happens to it!

"FairlyAnonymous","7","1","3","26 August 2018"," Coming from a Christian viewpoint: An interesting and artistic film that falls apart in the narrative department
","I just want to set a little disclaimer: I am a Christian who has read the entirety of the Bible several times, so my view of ""mother!"" may be a little different than those who have not read it.<br/><br/>My guess is that this film was made for people who casually know parts of the Bible. If you know too much of the bible then this film is dull/offensive. If you don't know enough of the bible then the whole shtick of the film is meaningless and probably very confusing.<br/><br/>Moving on.<br/><br/>From an artistic standpoint, this film is pretty good. I like the way that the camera always stays super close to the ""mother"" character which creates a dizzying/disorienting effect as she walks around the house due to the high levels of parallax and what not. Very smart choice in direction, as this immediately creates a sense of tension and intensity even when not much is going on. I could complain a little bit about how certain elements of this film feel like they were taken from ""Children of Men"", which is another film that contains religious imagery/symbolism, but for the most part this film is pretty fresh and feels like its own thing. <br/><br/>One small nitpick I have is that the sound design was a bit frustrating at times. There were several scenes where mother's footsteps sounded distinctly like sandbags and seemed to be repeated on loop.<br/><br/>
Now, onto the meat of the movie. Spoilers!<br/><br/>The film is essentially an allegory for the old/new testaments in the Christian Bible, which is both interesting yet also dangerous for the viewing experience. I went into this movie pretty much blind, so as soon as I realized it was retelling the Old Testament I became both excited and concerned. I was excited because I thought it was a neat idea to set up the Bible in a sort of ""stage play"" fashion, where time jumps super quickly all within the same setting and actors kind of just come and go as they please. (or maybe this was supposed to be a reference in the Bible where it describes God's perception of time is both faster and slower than ours, but who knows). However, my concerns were that the film would become highly predictable without any real twists or turns, which would be kind of hard to do without offending a ton of people (though I don't Aronofsky really cares about that).<br/><br/>And, unfortunately, this film is insanely predictable and has trouble deciding whether it is an allegory or not. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes in this film are so on the nose that I actually burst out laughing, like where ""Him"" who is an other (that represents God) has some ink on his thumbs and accidentally presses it onto someone's forehead so then everyone else starts doing, or where we are told early on in the movie ""don't sit on that sink, it's not stable"" so then I was just waiting for it to break to symbolize the flood from Genesis. These on the nose elements are amusing at times, but they also distract from the film because they aren't helping push the story along, which is probably the film's biggest issue...<br/><br/>The movie jumps between allegory and an actual original narrative (or else Aronofsky hasn't done a ton of biblical research) and it doesn't know which one it is trying to be.<br/><br/>Essentially, this movie's version of God is a being who loves to create, loves attention, but doesn't care about morality. It ruins the allegory when it tries to follow the narrative of Old Testament (for the most part) very closely, but then the character of God has no sense of morality. If this were a satire/critique on religion then that would make sense within the context of the movie, but the movie seems to be fairly genuine in its attempt at loosely retelling the bible (even down to the sound of coins dropping in the background before a miracle baby is murdered by a crowd).<br/><br/>For instance, the mother character and the poet both seem to have attributes of God, which doesn't really work if this is an allegory. The mother character is constantly the one who is mad at people for ruining things, causing danger, acting sinfully, and doing other despicable stuff when they were told explicitly not to do so, but then the Poet character is completely fine with all of these things because he loves people, attention, and wants everyone to have a home with him. This becomes a bit confusing because, in the Bible, God embodies both of those personalities: Loving but also wanting Justice. For the Poet to be okay with the actions of all of the people (and their Pagan rituals which they start performing) kind of breaks the allegory. You can't have a movie about God and the bible if you don't understand what God's narrative was in the bible.<br/><br/>Another example would be the miraculous child. In the Bible, the purpose of Jesus was to save humanity from sin, but in this movie the Poet simply wants to show off his child and a crowd kills the child and starts eating it. It's supposed to represent communion, but the film depicts it as a horror scene (as if it is a bad thing) when the whole point of communion is an analogy for Christ's sacrifice. You can't have a scene celebrating Christ's sacrifice but then depict the people who are celebrating it as cannibals as a critique on the very action itself, which was the original sacrifice . If they were trying to be allegorical, then the Poet would be trying to save the people in their house from themselves and his child would give the crowd insight right before being murdered.<br/><br/>Most of what I'm saying is probably going over the heads of most people so I will stop rambling. If this movie were trying to be a critique I could understand its changes, but it's not. It just kind of follows the bible very closely and then will throw in some bits that fit more of a character narrative. It's constantly bouncing between whether it wants to tell a story or if it is just telling the bible, and this lack of focus makes it hard to enjoy either half.<br/><br/>Still, the film is well shot and interesting, so I can't really hate it. It has some neat ideas here and there and while I disagree with it's depiction of God, I can still appreciate the effort that went into it."

Art imitating life got into argument with partner and turned it off. Next night or perhaps 2 nights later finished watching.

I wish this was a straight up haunted house horror. Aronofsky's style creates plenty of unease. Not giving the characters names added to this sense of unease. This has great mood but the premise is never far from the mind and that's distracting. Jennifer delivers terrific confused suppression. She's basically under constant emotional abuse.

His worshipers kills his only infant son, he still tries to find a way to forgive them. But the mother of the baby can't. What does this mean? Mother loves more than anyone? she cares more than God about her children? I don't know the movie means that or not.
Casting is brilliant. Javier Bardem plays cold character very well. Jennifer Lawrence is the catch of the movie, another oscar worthy performance has been provided by this brilliant actress. Ed harris always plays sick/ meyterious people's role beautifully, I can recollect his performance in the movie 'The hours', he was really good in playing a suicidal sick man. He started the influx of people to the house of the poet. Perfect man to start messing up an organized condition."

","This was not a good movie. As others have said it is self indulgent and pretentious. The same kind of 'art' as pooping on paper and hanging it up. All while it slams you over the head with a mallet of unrelenting metaphors. 'Oh if you don't like it you clearly must not understand it' some will say - it's not hard to understand, it's just not a great movie, yet another excuse for those left of sensibilities to screech misogyny when there isn't any. Any excuse though. At least JLaw might have made a little more effort with this one, rather than staying a healthy size when she's meant to be a starving girl in the hunger games! Reeeeal professional. I have a feeling she was happy to play this disturbing role in the even more disturbing movie only to pretend she suffers for her art and more 'poor women' clap trap. Mother! is an analogy for Mother Nature of course, the only comparison in this movie that isn't nonsensicle and is meaningful. If you enjoy photos of tea cup stains sold for millions kind of art then this movie will probably be right up your ally."
"lusinkhachatryan","10","1","3","25 March 2018"," Brilliant movie with layers of themes.
","The movie touches upon a wide range of themes from identity crisis to adverse side of fame, to being vulnerable of losing fame and lacking inspiration to create, to a dried up relationship and being overcrowded in marriage. Javier's character is a selfish poet who is after his fame and disregards his wife's needs and desires. He is not really a hostage to his fame, though, he is a predator whose only desire is to drain emotionally his wife, use her and others' dramas as a source of inspiration to create poetry and be worshiped. He can't possibly choose a calm, humble life, while his wife is isolated from the world, she is sort of a control freak and doesn't want any outsider to intrude her ""world"". People eventually intrude her house and destroy and shake her ""world"", she is unable to save her child from becoming a victim at the hands of her husband's fanatic worshipers. She ends up burning all she had built with her own hands, she is burnt in the midst. She is done, but her husband starts all over again."

","I went into this film with the knowledge that it was not made for mainstream audiences; for that reason it's completely understandable why its rating on here is so much lower that I personally think it should be. It's okay for a movie to be polarizing as long as the conversation does not end at ""you're wrong."" Anyways, here's what I thought of Darren Aronofsky's ""mother!""<br/><br/>Like others have said, this movie is what it would be like to watch a nightmare unfold in the third-person. In fact, as I'm sure most people know, around 80 minutes into the film, the up-until-this-point relatively held-back narrative descends into what I can only describe as a no-holds-barred fever dream for the remaining 40 minutes. All of the performances are great, particularly from Jennifer Lawrence and Michelle Pfeiffer. The direction and cinematography are great (as one has come to expect from a collaboration between Darren Aronofsky and Matthew Libatique). So many shots in the film are very up-close in the actors' faces and it really helps establish a feeling of claustrophobia and anxiety, as well as the invasion of one's privacy (which obviously echoes Mother's predicament in the film). There's a few technical things, particularly some of the editing, that I think could've been executed better, but overall it's still phenomenal.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of Aronofsky's best films and if you enjoy films from surrealist directors such as Lynch, Jodorowsky, etc., then I highly recommend you check this movie out."
"philipposathina","7","1","3","1 February 2018"," hmmmmm.....
","For sure Aranofski's darkest movie. It's interesting to watch, but i am not sure i quite agree with this sort of metaphorical stories implying or suggesting something that the viewer cannot be sure about. All i could say is that this is probably a story about man's wish to reach a higher level of self-esteem complying with widely spread ideas of out time, like ""being superior should mean you can share your possesions with others"" while revealing that this giving actually hides a purely selfish and extreme egoistic feeling of show-off. The ""mother"" on the other hand, down to earth and protecting its world than sharing it, is the expression of the basic instinct of self preservation, her own and of her world. Her words to her seemingly ""generous"" husbund (you have not loved me, you have just loved my love for you) is the key to understanding) what his attitude and character are about. And show who the really giving is.
Not one of my best movies but certainly a very interesting one as an Aranofski film can anything but be. Acting is great, Jennifer gives her best -though i think the ending is far too fussy to let any feelings and sentiments really reach the viwer."

"dejavoodoobrand","10","1","3","14 December 2017"," A brilliant film, (that most of you will probably hate)
","I don't think I've ever seen another film like this.
It should have it's own genre, as it doesn't really fit into existing genres well.
Oronofsky has created a work of genius here - an inspired and completely unpredictable work of passion. At first it just feels a bit surreal - just two characters somehow disconnected and relating awkwardly to one another in a quiet setting. Then the ride begins. I don't wish to spoil anything for anyone, you just have to sit back and let this one unfold, let go of expectations and preconceptions of how films should be experienced. Virtually none of the characters are likeable. They act obscenely toward others and treat the space their in without any respect. It's hard to identify with most of the characters, as they're not respectable, and act unconscionably. The vibe in this house becomes more and more dysfunctional and downright bizarre. It quickly shifts from uncomfortable to horrific. The behaviour's become more shocking and disturbing as the story develops. For me, parts of it were difficult to watch, whether I understood what was going on or not. 
This film is full of metaphors.The whole story has subtext that is as disturbing as what happens on the screen.<br/><br/>It's not a film that's easy to like, simply because IT IS NOT ENTERTAIMENT.<br/><br/>Most movies take you on either an emotional journey, or an adrenalin ride.<br/><br/>This isn't meant to do either. It's not meant to sell popcorn.<br/><br/>It's meant to make you think. 
If you can get past the difficulty of wanting to reject what you're seeing as simply absurd, implausible and surreal - you'll get to the point of it all.<br/><br/>I personally was very moved by this film. There is a blatant attempt to make viewers consider the behaviours and actions, and recognize that, metaphorically, something is seriously broken and in need of our attention. <br/><br/>I highly respect what the director/writer has done here. I wish more film makers would attempt to open our eyes to an important, bitter reality. Maybe awareness would make us embarrassed enough to think about making a change in our lives.

"spencergrande6","8","1","3","27 November 2017"," Surreal freak show that Aronofsky lets rip
","This is a surreal freak show of a film. Horror by any other name. Aronofsky creates a stage-play box-film, with a few overarching themes, and lets it rip. This is about creationism and the bible, biology and evolution and art and its inherent function in a society ruled by both and neither simultaneously. <br/><br/>Every scene grips, provokes and prods. Even when it is clearly manipulating it's working on some level. The eponymous Mother would be considered a thankless role for most actresses but Jennifer Lawrence isn't just any actress. She takes it and makes it her own. Without making a show of it she brings out the truth, she takes the audience with her, regardless of whether or not they want to - we just trust her. It's a brilliant performance that should not be overlooked for what helps make this artist's trip work."
"gortx","Null","1","3","27 September 2017"," Whatever metaphor you go by, mother! doesn't work as a film
","Ever since mother! got a mixed critical reception and downright rejected by general audiences (earning a rare 'F' on Cinemascore) there has been a cottage industry of folks trying to decify what the central metaphor is. Everything from Parenthood to Fame to Creativity to global warming and 'mother earth' itself. To me, the bottom line always is, not matter the intentions and 'hidden meanings' - does it work as drama? mother! fails that test - even if prodigiously so. <br/><br/>The cast and tech credits are all top notch. Shooting on 16mm film gives the film a hazy grainy look and feel that heightens the horrific atmosphere. Shooting in tight hand-held style works in spots, but, gives it a cramped crowded flavor that works against many of the sequences. You have this gorgeous huge mansion - use it, rather than work against that strength. Casting Michelle Pfeiffer gives a nod to the successful creepy house thriller WHAT LIES BENEATH. More to the point is the ad art that tips it's cap to Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY (but, in many ways, it's more like that famed Director's REPULSION). Horror fans may also think of Cronenberg's THE BROOD. <br/><br/>While the film begins with some clear allegorical references to motherhood (there's a lot of womb and vagina imagery), it soon becomes apparent that Aronofsky's focus is more on Javier Bardem's character than Jennifer Lawrence's (a more accurate title would be father!). Is it any surprise that a male filmmaker would make a film ostensibly about motherhood, but shift the focus? Again, no issue if the film works on a dramatic level. Unfortunately, Aronofsky has never been a subtle or supple filmmaker (he also lacks any discernible wit). The metaphors get piled on so heavily, relentlessly and in such an over the top manner (Aronofsky's signature ""style"") that long before the dual climaxes the film has devolved into self-parody. If the imagery weren't so grotesque, it could almost be enjoyed as a 'laugh at the screen' entry. And, again, if Aronosky ever evinced a genuine sense of humor, he might have realized that. Oh, what Polanski or horror-period Cronenberg could have done with the material. Aronofsky seems in need of a strong collaborator, or, at the very least, a producer willing to say no to some of his cock-eyed ideas. Of his films, THE WRESTLER works the best because it follows a distinct story and was written by an independent screenwriter (Robert Siegel). Whatever metaphor you choose to go by, mother! is a failed film, lofty intentions and all."

","Pi was a great debut.But this one...? Just saw it with a very small audience of people who were totally not into it.but I definitely see why people are hating it. the bigger problem with the movie is it marketed itself as a classic horror movie. As a straightforward horror film, this already didn't work because of the final 45 minutes or so just being too out there and especially too illogical, but then in the final minute Aranofsky makes the greatest mistake of all by pulling the rug out from under the film and explain it all, thereby completely nullifying any attachment to the protagonist that was built up until that point, and making this film entirely about himself. The film is instantly turned into one big metaphor for the creative process, the breaking of the crystal (i.e. the heart of his story, i.e. the JLaw character) the moment where the writer starts to lose the plot, as his story starts to devolve further and further into a tangled mess. Crumple up the paper, and start over again.<br/><br/>It's all very meta, and it's all very unengaging, and because of that ending, rather dull. Had he not created the bookends, we could have interesting discussions about what all the madness meant, but he took that chance away by simply explaining the film. In a deft move, I'll give him that, but now I'm left with watching a (purposefully nameless, as it turns out) protagonist for two hours that in the end I shouldn't care about, because she was just a draft version. That ending was just way too ""Get it? Get it?"

He enjoys attention of his fans and doesn't matter in how bad situation is she and how hard she is trying everything to be alright.<br/><br/>Killed brother is her suffering by people thinking she is with him only because of his money.<br/><br/>Hole in the floor is her thoughts of leaving him and the tunnel is exit. Movie shows that hole when she is in situation that bad she is thinking about leaving him.<br/><br/>After arguing he payed attention back to her again and they were happy. Their love inspired him to work again.<br/><br/>When the baby kicks for the first time he finished his work. The child is his next great work. while she is pregnant and the war scene is on then their relationship suffers the most because he is enjoying how people worship him as an artist/god and he put her aside again.

"ghent1","9","2","10","2 October 2017"," Brilliant film if you like the theme and crack its code
","As more often with Aranofsky's films this is a firmly religious film barely hidden under a modern setting.<br/><br/>The movie portrays the major milestones in the history of the Judaeo- Christian history of the world in an apocalyptic version. A history of God's adventures on the earth and how mother earth is affected by them.<br/><br/>The couple's large property stands for the earth, or the garden of Eden. The house is the house of God, or maybe Israel, the promised land (Aronofsky is of Jewish descent). Bardem is the Lord, Jennifer Lawrence is mother earth.<br/><br/>The Lord is at first bored by being all the time alone with the virginal earth, though the earth dearly loves Him and tries to be perfect for Him. Because of his basic boredom with the virginal earth He likes it when Adam (Ed Harris, who turns out to love the Lord, is of clean integrity but prone to domination by his wife) and his seductive, untrustworthy and malicious wife Michelle Pfeiffer (Eve) first visit and then come live in the house of the Lord. Despite their imperfections, the Lord loves them, though mother earth is suspicious.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long before Eve seduces Adam to first enter the forbidden part of the house, then touch and accidentally destroy the Lord's forbidden fruit (the glass artwork in Bardem's study, representing the untouched divine present on earth). The Lord gets angry. The receptacle of pure Love is shattered. I think it's after this, the Fall, that Jennifer Lawrence for the first time starts having black spots in her heart.<br/><br/>Then the children of Adam en Eve come on visit. Adam's evil son (Cain) kills his good son (Abel) over an inheritance. The earth is angry, the Lord is forgiving.<br/><br/>There seems to be some kind of a Noah interlude when all the people flee the house of God after the pipes give in.<br/><br/>Then, inspired by all the miserly stories he hears about the world from Adam and others, the Lord writes a poem (the 10 commandments) of ineffable beauty, which make Him suddenly famous and loved with the people so tha they start to flock to His house. The Lord is popular. Suddenly the Lord's house is full of His new people. They are crazy about Him but very much imperfect. The earth feels jealous and left out. Moses is probably the guy who carries the poem around on a stick in the house, and who baptizes all the people with paint. Or else he's the female publisher who then ends up killing folks (during his reign, Moses also killed people according to the bible). The Lord is loved and He loves it.<br/><br/>The virginal earth gets jealous and angry. She wants to make love to the Lord and beget His son. The Lord finally takes the virgin, and she becomes pregnant with His son (who doesn't, therefore, have an earthly father, but only a heavenly father). All through the pregnancy the house of God is on fire: the foreign occupiers (Romans/police) and the inhabitants of the house (the Jews) are battling one another. When the Messiah is born amidst all this infernal turmoil, the earth loves the child but the people, cannibalistic as they turn out to be, distribute and devour His flesh to atone for their sinful natures. The Lord forgives the impure people yet again, but the heart of the earth sours further.<br/><br/>Finally the earth can take it no more to be the neglected playground of all these human sins, pain and madness, and the apocalypse is set in motion: the earth scorches herself and in a huge inferno all the people in it are killed. Not by coincidence but the earth uses Adam's lighter for it, since it's his Fall that put the whole endarkenment of the earth into motion.
The Lord, eisting Beyond the manifest world though present in it, survives untouched, the earth herself is severely scorched but also still exists. But this cosmic round is over so we enter some sort of a primeval chamber, the umbilical origin of the cosmos, and the Lord makes creation anew. He takes the untouched heart of love out of the current earth, who still loves the Lord, and with it, recreates the earth virginal for Himself and the Mother.<br/><br/>The cosmic drama of the struggle between the purity and sin can start anew for what is at heart an essentially spiritual film.<br/><br/>To be noted here is also that Aronofsky's pervasive cultural pessimism dominates also this movie, as is the case for, for instance, also his last religious movie 'Noah'. The same goes for his fascination with how the dimension beyond time and space -call it God or Brahman or whatever- manifest in and interacts with our very much imperfect (human) realm."

You could feel her being locked in , closed in, trashed on, and disrespected. Even being burned to death, she had to give more. more.

"brianaburton","8","2","10","28 September 2017"," Shocking Amazing and Shocking Not Understood.
","To begin with this movie is difficult to rate, but if you go into this film knowing that it is heavily reliant on symbolism and metaphors than you will enjoy this movie. If you are a fan of Darren Aronofsky or psychological films in general than this movie is definitely for you.<br/><br/>Everything in this film happens for a reason and everyone acts a certain way for a reason and I really feel the need to stress this point because it seems like a lot of people didn't understand that (majority of bad IMDb reviews on this film showcase this) and I almost feel the need to really defend this movie because of that.<br/><br/>The film itself I found quite enjoyable. The film lacks any sort of actual soundtrack but it's definitely not a shortcoming. The sound design itself was fantastic and the movie constantly puts you on the edge of your seat and you really feel as if you are with Mother or even are her. The use of binaural sound in this movie is amazing as well, you really feel as if someone is actually walking behind you or speaking in another room. The constant sense of dread that you get from the sound effects makes the film offer something that i haven't felt since Halloween (1978) and it truly is a unique experience.<br/><br/>The ending to this film is completely unexpected and unpredictable. I personally did not expect a western film to show what it did and I was pleasantly surprised. The trailer for the movie itself did a great job of giving the viewer just a little taste of what was yet to come without spoiling important aspects to the film and still giving it a mysterious appeal and i'm glad it did. Every major turning point in this film is something shocking that I would have never expected and constantly made me question what I just watched (I say this in a good and non-confused way of course). The ending made me want to know more and it stuck with me for a good week. The feeling I got when I witnessed the ending reminded me of how I felt when I first saw the ending of Martyrs (2008) shocked and depressed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you enjoy and/or understand symbolic and metaphoric films with heavy psychological tones than Mother! is definitely for you, but if not than you will most likely be confused and not understand the movie. That being said, if you know the movie is metaphorically about the bible and mother nature than it will be much easier to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>General Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rating as a psychological thriller: 10/10<br/><br/>Would I recommend to a friend?: Honestly depends which friend."
"leaotovic","10","2","10","28 September 2017"," One of the best films of the year
","*SPOILERS ALERT*<br/><br/>Anyone who wrote a bad review of this title clearly did not manage to grasp the underlying theme of the film. The film clearly represents the human destruction of Mother Earth, and has biblical themes of God (the husband), Jesus (the baby) and religion (the cult).<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's character was adored by everyone, worshipped insanely, to a point where nothing else was important. Mother's house was destroyed, symptomatic of the human race destroying the Earth. It is a criticism of religion and obsession over one deity, and of the destruction of the planet that keeps us alive.<br/><br/>The married couple that stays in the house represents Adam and Eve, another biblical theme. They, along with their sons, Cain and Able, bring destruction to the peaceful environment. Humans begin the destruction of Mother Earth. The crystal represents the forbidden fruit, and once destroyed, a domino effect is created.<br/><br/>The themes are so obvious once pointed out, everything makes sense. The baby's death, and then its consumption, just like bread and wine at church, the body and blood of Christ. The husband's poetry represents the Bible, somehow it speaks to everyone. I could go on and on about all the different representations in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, the film was, in my opinion, incorrectly marketed as a horror, which may have affected people's expectations of it, leading to them being disappointed. But the graphic imagery of this film is there to shock, not frighten. It is there to force the audience to think about and take in everything that is happening.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films I have ever seen, the cinematography and set design was incredible, everything making up this production was of an extremely high standard. The public is disappointed that they did not receive a run-of-the-mill horror, as was suggested by the trailer. In my opinion, if the film had been marketed differently, the response would not be as negative."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>If you think ""Mother!"" isn't a film for you, think again, because I personally believe this film needs to be seen by everyone. If you left ""Mother!"" feeling confused, then you need to re-evaluate life and open your eyes. Director Darren Aronofsky's (director of Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream, and more) newest film, ""Mother!"", is an amazing wake up call that humanity needs, but probably will take for granted and brush off their shoulders. I want to believe and hope others can grasp the themes and symbolism in this film as much as we all should and actually make a difference in the world for once, but I don't believe that the human race will care to think twice about what we're doing to ourselves and the earth, as we crawl back to our self-revolving worlds after seeing such a film and forget about how much we don't take responsibility for our actions and how much we take and take and don't give back to our Earth.<br/><br/>Don't think so superficially if you plan on watching this film. The symbolism is clear if you pay attention, but the meaning behind the film will not be handed to you as easily as the meaning behind a Marvel movie. If you don't get this film or what it is trying to cry out and say to us, you haven't been paying attention to humanity, our sins, our repents, our history, and what's going on in the world and to the world.<br/><br/>If you're a mother, watch ""Mother!"" If you're a feminist, watch ""Mother!"" If you're a human being, watch ""Mother!"" If you care about climate change and the world, watch ""Mother!"" If you claim to be a Christian and can't understand ""Mother!,"" then try rereading the Bible to get the symbolism. If you've read ""The Giving Tree"" as a child, watch this film. If you care about humanity and our Earth, watch this film.<br/><br/>Others may think and feel differently about this film than I do, but with all the bad reviews, I needed to share my point of view and defend this film as one of the most beautiful and important films of our time."

It seems no-one else has taken up the subject, or else, copped to that aspect of the experience, so shrouded in social mores are people (one *may* think of the womanly desire expressed as ""I want to have his baby"" more purely rendered, simply, as ""I want him to come inside me""). <br/><br/>What's curious about the reactions people are having is that it *doesn't even occur to them* this is the movie's agenda ... stand or fall on its own, still, it seems to strike a nerve not-but-buried in folks. <br/><br/>Hence the confusion."

","I had high expectation of this movie. Unfortunately it turned out to be quite disappointing. The movie produced is ALL about Jennifer Lawrence. The story is not bad. But the production of the movie made me feel like it was filmed by over obsessed boyfriend. Darren Aronofsky seemed to be super crazy in Jennifer Lawrence's look.<br/><br/>The camera angle was super closed up to capture every detail of Lawrence's face, her eyes, her nose, her side profile, her neck, her breasts, her butt - i feel like watching almost every detail of Lawrence's physical appearance.<br/><br/>More than 50% of the scenes in the movie i could not watch because they caused my head to spin with giddiness. It's unpleasant to watch the movie with unstable camera footage. It's kind of pretty cheap production. In the movie, u can pretty much figure out that Aronofsky is the only camera man behind Lawrence in most of the scenes. Lucky the movie cost me only $10.<br/><br/>the story is not bad. it's an interesting story line. the story is all about life. Just the whole movie was filmed ONLY to admire Jennifer Lawrence's physical appearance. After this scene, i kind of know how her body and face look like by heart. so if u admire Lawrence's look, watch this movie. otherwise, don't bother to waste your money.<br/><br/>in conclusion, Aronofsky is madly obsessed with Lawrence's appearance. and Lawrence is very much into old men type of boyfriends. typical young girl's preference of boyfriend i would say."

","Demiurge requires time and experience in order to enact its work. You don't get perfection first try; you need to restart quite a few times.

Demiurge imagines the universe as if it were a countryside cottage; and creation as if it were a poetic work. There are times in which the cottage might get chippings and leaks, when the work is stuck, when one is found at a loss for words, when the word that was in the beginning (for in the beginning was the Word) fails and doesn't come to one. Demiurge needs Inspiration, for Inspiration is the mother (Mother!) of everything, at least from Demiurge's point of view.<br/><br/>And when Inspiration fails, all the universe crumbles, all creation falls down. Creation, its child, its child and that of Inspiration, their child bestowed upon the world in generous sacrifice, their greatest gift and success, their legacy and heritage, dies, withers off and rots because of us, for Demiurge has not created the perfect creation but a corrupted and derelict one.<br/><br/>The only thing left to do is press ""reset"" and start anew, learning from errors, crystallizing past experiences and commencing from them...<br/><br/>Hopefully, this time it'll all be fine."

"bastille-852-731547","6","2","11","16 September 2017"," A Strange, Unsettling Horror That Doesn't Quite Work
","As someone who admires Darren Aronofsky as a director, I was looking forward to this highly unconventional but deeply disturbing psychological horror. While the film is surreal and shocking, it unfortunately does not quite all hold together. It ends up being something that seems to lack a clear meaning as well, which is disappointing given that it is directed by a highly respectable auteur.<br/><br/>The film is essentially the twisted story of a husband (Javier Bardem) who is a writer, and her pregnant wife (Jennifer Lawrence.) To say anything else more could possibly reveal spoilers, and you don't want to walk into this movie knowing what's going to happen. All I will say is that the story gets increasingly more outlandish, surprising, and violent. The film's acting is uniformly strong across the board, with great lead performances by Lawrence and Bardem as well as considerable strength in the acting quality of major supporting characters. Michelle Pfeiffer is particularly strong here. The film is filmed nicely, with a thoughtful and commendable mix of wider and narrower shots. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the story gets more over-the-top and outlandish, the viewer's interest in the film begins to wane. The increasing ridiculousness of the plot completely lacks any sort of point, and just when you think it can't get any stranger, it does--but once again, without any point! As a result, you leave the film thinking ""what was that?"" This feeling is particularly heightened by the lack of attachment or emotional response towards any of the characters--let alone empathy. As a result, the film's sheer outrageousness will linger in your mind--but nothing else about it will. This isn't a terrible film by any means, but it's unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. I don't regret seeing it per se, but wish I had gone to ""Brad's Status"" or ""It"" instead. 6/10"
"swilliky","7","2","11","16 September 2017"," A mad metaphorical thriller
","Darren Aronofsky makes intense thrillers and his latest is no  different. I had no idea what to expect from this film only seeing the  cryptic trailer and seeing the film before the reviews. Since its  release, mother! has been the source of opinions ranging from hatred to  adoration. My opinion rests somewhere in the middle as I was  entertained through the whole film and shocked at various moments while  also disturbed and little letdown by the outrageous finale. Thinking  about the film later, my opinion grows more favorable and it is the  kind of film that one would continue to think about days or even weeks  after seeing it. The film borders on horror even having a few jump  scares that I usually enjoy in a film while also just being creepy and  horrific through various scenes.  The film begins with a woman burning and then a man (Javier Bardem)  placing a crystal on a stand. A house magically repairs from fire  damage all through the room until it focuses on a woman (Jennifer  Lawrence) in bed. She wakes up and searches the house. The camera  constantly whirls around staying primarily focused on Lawrence and  hardly ever going outside of the house. Bardem's character is a poet  that can't seem to produce any work or have any affection towards his  doting wife. She works to repair the house as he locks himself in his  room struggling to prevent art. A mysterious orthopedic surgeon (Ed  Harris) arrives at the house, claiming to think this house was a bed  and breakfast, and the poet invites him to stay the night, much to the  woman's chagrin."

","I see some poor reviews of this film but I'm going to assume they were written by people who just don't ""get"" what Aronofsky was trying to accomplish. I watched the movie twice and it is packed with symbolism that some people might miss. For example, for those who see the film as a modern day Genesis retelling miss so much. Mother! Is Mother Nature and the planet embodied in Jennifer Lawrence while God is embodied by Javier Bardem's Him. The movie is about their relationship God and Mother Nature. People are played by every other character in the movie. The first half is the Genesis story while the rest of he film shows how the planet has tried numerous times to repair itself from the damage people do to it. Seen as a allegory the film is brilliant. The cast was well chosen and the house is a very interesting design. The last 10 minutes of the film are the best and before that there is a lot of chaos and violence but none of it is gratuitous. Definitely watch this movie if you care about the planet and miss seeing smart movies."

","This film is not what has been advertised to you. With that being said, it is a ride that starts off slow and picks up speed and then doesn't slow down for anyone or anything. The allegory is very clear and even if it takes the entire film to understand it, it doesn't take away from the emotions this film invokes. It is relentless and contains a few shocking scenes, but this film needs to be viewed by anyone wanting to be taken on a ride."

","I honestly don't know how to begin this review, because I'm having a hard time putting everything into place. Yet, I do feel the strong need to put something on here. So here it is:<br/><br/>This film is - in the strongest use of the word ever - disturbing. Everything. It messes with your head! It messes with your stomach! It messes with your feelings! Seriously, do NOT watch this if regular tension packed movies are already too strong for you. Like a drink. But if this movie were a drink, it would be a bottle of pure ethanol. Furthermore, the film shows some gore, but it doesn't always do so in horrific detail, but it's that suggestion that makes it even worse. It's probably the most terrifying movie I have seen in my life!<br/><br/>But enough of that, more about the nice aspects of ""Mother!""
We get to see terrific acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. Those two... it just works perfectly here! Furthermore, there is a brilliant Michelle Pfeiffer next to an even brilliant Ed Harris. The acting is great. Everyone really. The camera fantastically shows enough to not lose overview, but always too few as to always leave us as viewers in the dark (and to freak us out!).
And the music! It's amazing! Why? Because there is almost none! This clever engineering of silence and the scarce moments of musical score is just wonderful!<br/><br/>I... I'm sorry. This is probably my most chaotic and unreadable review ever. But I just saw the film and... I just can't... I just don't know...<br/><br/>Just watch it (if you dare) and share my confused feeling of terror and amazement!"

","If you've come to see a horror movie then you will be somewhat disappointed. If you've come to see thriller, you may walk out of the movie. If you watch it with an open mind you will be impressed. A great movie with a weird reference and origin. Mother! takes you to the edge of madness until you figure out what is going on. I loved the many actors who showed up in this cinematic college course of a movie. Symbolism takes over and you're okay with some of the macabre events in this film.

"sarcasm83","8","1","4","29 January 2018"," My interpretation - 2nd review, this one with spoilers..
","I was surprised after reading through the reviews how apparently alot of people hated it but in their reviews, they described scene by scene what they had seen and no deeper interpretation at all.. So alot of people who hate it have just taken it ""literally""? Others talked about religious interpretations.. mother nature and the history of man etc..<br/><br/>I mean, sure - that's what they saw and it's interesting to see, but ... 
I saw it very differently.<br/><br/>To me the very ending revealed the interpretation that the movie is about love, relationships, life etc.<br/><br/>It starts with ""her"" delicate heart on a pedestal and ""he"" wants nothing but to protect it by all costs. It's the most precious thing to him.
They are happy - just the two of them, completely separate from the world. That's how relationships start.<br/><br/>She seeks him, calls him baby etc.. he had been away for a while.. needed the time to himself. All is not perfect. <br/><br/>Real world still invades that happiness: 
His work makes him stressed, uneasy and restless. 
Her desire is to build a home. A perfect one. 
She meticulously builds every inch of it. She wants to make it perfect, while respecting his terms, as it's ""his home"". Likely the house ""he"" chose?
Or maybe since his ""house burned down"", he has had a difficult breakup and there's some building to be done, to get a solid foundation for a new love. She tries her best to give him everything.<br/><br/>His writing is struggling though, he needs inspiration. 
She fears for the ""house"" (which likely represents the relationship or love.. she is seeing it still burnt, from maybe his past experiences). She has anxiety about it (chestpains etc.) and takes drugs/drinks/medicates herself to ease the stress. (the yellow liquid she mixes and drinks in distress)
 
He on the other hand escapes his stress with distractions.. He can't get motivated so he escapes it, with excuses. While she loves his books, she can't work as the muse at the time, because whenever she mentions his writing, he feels anxiety about that.. about what he hasn't managed to accomplish. She is the reminder of what feels like a burden - a pressure. 
But he finds solace in a fan that reaches to him - (or maybe that one fan depicts a small bit of fans of his work that make him feel valued)
 
He finds alot of excuses to get his work out of his head.. 
He says he spends time with the fans out of respect. 
Then a little later out of necessity as the fan is ""dying"", coughing, bleeding, not doing well (maybe depicts his fear of losing that admiration, so he hangs onto it, with excuses)<br/><br/>She feels it intruding on their life. The outside world constantly tries to get into their business.. their sexlife, their private life, their intimiate life details. (the questions and intruding behavior)<br/><br/>She'd just want him. Only him. 
So again, she medicates herself, keeps building the house - and flushes her heart down the toilet while cleaning the mess of the ""fans"" (she pushes her emotions to the side, hides her disapproval, as she's in so much love for him). 
She obliges his desires...<br/><br/>But he puts his fans and need for validation from other people ahead of her. Constantly. This eventually breaks her heart. (it shatters on the ground thanks to these fans who intrude too much)... That's when he sees his errors. It troubles him severely. It leads to a ton of conflict.. He shuts his heart off entirely - the most precious ""room"" of their love.<br/><br/>For a while he is upset.. doesn't want to see the fans, who are still in their life. 
But he's not with her either.. he has withdrawn from everything for a while... <br/><br/>Things get increasingly restless with people intruding on their lives and he has to address the outside world again... Things get so disastrous it leaves a permanent mark on their life. A disaster that can't be washed clean, can't be hidden under a rug.. they try to bury this horrible event out of sight, into the basement, into a safe, into the wall, but it just keeps busting out and keeps on reminding of itself with small signs constantly.<br/><br/>When he still spends time with the man and his family after their tragedy, it's likely a metafore of how something happened and he ""needs to be there"" for them and he accepts it as another excuse... <br/><br/>""I have to support him he lost a son, and he's dying""... but that side quickly turns into parties. It's not funeral service, it's celebration... it spreads and spreads, with her husband spending more and more time drinking with the fans or partying with the outside world while she feels more or less powerless and can't even make him hear her voice. 
Totally losing control over the situation... but she obliges, tries to be polite, tries to be accomodating - and medicates/drinks out of necessity... 
Her anxiety about the house she is building (they are building for themselves) is constantly in her mind, as she keeps worrying that the outside world destroys it. And it damages it in many ways.<br/><br/>She finally stands up for herself, reaches her breaking point... it wakes him up. 
The passion sparks through all their troubles.. she gets pregnant.
She no longer feels like a burden that he escapes: Their love is there again.. she pours her medication down the toilet and stops it (drinking or drugs?).. he makes an effort to change... he finds motivation out of all of their tragedy and their love. He finally writes, with her as his muse.<br/><br/>For a while, it all seems perfect again. It's the two of them again.. he is successful in his work... but ... upon reading his work, will that success make her lose him? There will be even more fans? What if it consumes him?<br/><br/>He promises she will never lose him.... But before she knows it, the publications already know of the book.. she was never asked.. then come the fans - the publicists - the outside world. She can barely get a moment of his time anymore. She doesn't know the people in their lives, she can't focus on building the house.. she feels the love dying. (The houses ""heart"" she listens to represents their life, their love. The house is the foundation of the relationship.)<br/><br/>All spirals into total chaos. He parties, he invites people over, she feels like a famous man's trophy on the sidelines.. she doesn't want in the spotlight at all... But she feels tremendous amounts of pressure and that there is zero privacy in their life anymore, with every nook of their house filled with people - most of who don't even know who she is.... 
People around him seem to only care about exploiting his fame or wanting to scavenge things out of them. But he is addicted to the validation. Eventually, the excuses stop and he admits it:
I don't want them to go! He doesn't want to stop. 
Maybe he still drinks? 
Maybe he still does drugs with them while she quit because of the pregnancy?
(After all, as soon as the first stranger arrived, they had ""upgraded"" from tea to alcohol.)<br/><br/>She wants out of all of it.. to focus on the child. 
It's too much, but she can't get away.. she is trapped in the life with her loved one, who won't let the publicity go.<br/><br/>The stress of that life keeps on bombarding her with stress as she keeps on trying to escape.. but it just keeps getting worse and worse, with even people who say they'll help or familiar faces that first seemed friendly, turning out to be horrible sources of stress... It all escalates to total chaos, so she withdraws from it... he follows her eventually, gives her a hand and promises to stick by her.<br/><br/>But when she wants to head to the door (leave it ALL behind) he pulls her to stay in the situation.. Again, she wants to go one way, he insists on another, until they seclude into hiding. <br/><br/>The outside noise settles down for a while. She gives birth... maybe it's meant to portray that it was too early, as it came in the middle of such stress? 
They stay in seclusion watching over the weak baby... She doesn't trust him. He refuses to let the spotlight completely go while she asks for it several times...<br/><br/>He then betrays her trust when she lets her guard down. 
He goes to the spotlight... the child dies.<br/><br/>She blames it all on the outside world.. she can't hold her anger in. She snaps at the world, at him, she has lost her child and she shows her aggression to the outside world in full force. She gets absolutely attacked for it... 
The wife of the icon the masses love is seen in public like that and they attack her, berate her, hate her... she gets abused by it all. 
She never asked for it. 
So she has had enough.<br/><br/>The ""heard"" of the house dead, the foundations completely break under her and she decides to end it all. 
He begs for her not to. But it's too late. She burns it all down.<br/><br/>Deep down, her love still remains.. or ""a"" love still remains. <br/><br/>He starts again.. from the ashes.<br/><br/>Another relationship starts."

","This film is a MASTERPIECE. Aronofsky has outdone himself once again. If you're expecting the same old conventional horror film, you'll be disappointed. Every detail was carefully and strategically placed to fit with the overarching allegory. I can't say enough, I just loved it. My advice would be to get off of review pages. Don't read any synopses, reviews, or anything that will give away information. Just go into it blind, and when you're finished, go online and look up what Aronofsky meant.

"deharris-13034","10","1","4","10 January 2018"," Do your homework or don't take the class
","Mother! is a movie that was made to enthrall the well educated as it is to give the the others nightmares. It is an IMMENSELY dense, allegorical poem meant to inform the watcher of Aronofski's passion hatred of God. As you may have noticed, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer play the role of Adam and Eve breaking the one rule of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, their sons were Cain and Abel, and the sink flooding and everyone getting kicked out was the flood of Noah, and so on. The story is sort of a synopsis of the plots of the Bible with God (Javier Bardem) writing the Bible and basking in the glory of his followers. Eventually, the apocalypse happens and everyone is in dire need of God; which is how God likes things. After giving them all the things he has, he starts to give them things he does not have; namely, his child. As in the Jewish religion, Jesus does not come to save humanity until after the the tribulation. J Law plays the role of Mother: that being mother earth/nature, women in general, and mother as in queen of the castle - the modern and eternally present patriarchy. She plays the role of ""everyman"", the only sympathetic character in the entire film. She is the basis of the poetic style as poetry is often abstract and fantastical like the entirety of the movie, Mother is the only thing that makes any sense. She is a means of portraying the cruelness of God. She gives him anything and loves him while he only loves her affection. She is earth. She is love. She is the source of his power and he repays her with naught. She does everything. She builds the house and cooks while he sits around bereft of meaning. He doesn't find it until Adam comes swaggin' in. She acquiesces to his every whim whether or not it's reasonable and is bled dry, giving up everything for him until he TAKES HER CHILD BY FORCE. He screws her over along with the rest of the world. She is forced to set fire to the whole enchilada, forcing God to start over from scratch. A new world--a new mother. She is nothing but a charred heap in his arms. She says ""All I have left to give is my heart so just take it already."" Without hesitation, he takes her heart and excitedly begins anew. All he does is take and take and take and would only give if it meant he would receive. All of this to say that God is greedy and doesn't care if not in a selfish way. I myself have a huge passion for film criticism and given the extensive and expensive religious education that I have, this movie is a huge deal to me. It is not blasphemous, or blatantly offensive, it is the brilliancy of poetry and of the free-willed mind in visual, feature film format. A cinema masterpiece of the ages and one of my favorite movies. I would say that there is a certain qualification that is required to fully appreciate the piece as it is a very complicated and, at times, disorienting allegory for in-depth understanding and contemplation of the human condition. An under appreciated gem. Utter brilliance. Mother!"

"Bunuel1976","6","1","4","10 December 2017"," MOTHER! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017) **1/2
","Director Aronofsky has said that he came up with the idea for this film after a screening of Luis Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) & his own thinking on the current human condition! As I lay watching the film - undoubtedly the most controversial release of the year - I was also reminded of many other films: Bunuel's own VIRIDIANA (1961; in the way in which invited guests unceremoniously take over a household) & SIMON OF THE DESERT (1965; throngs of people invading the personal space of & expecting answers from their idol); Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; a repressed woman who never ventures outside her home & loses her mind), ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968; a struggling artist invites a sinister couple into his marital home & they take over to the chagrin of the introverted & pregnant wife) & THE TENANT (1976; which had been the director's own male version of REPULSION anyway); Mike Nichols' WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRIGINA WOOLF? (1966; a younger married couple are the disbelieving witness to the constant squabbles of an older couple); & any number of Euro-horrors climaxing in conflagration & reincarnation (including Francesco Barilli's THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK [1974])!! The narrative is clearly an allegory but I found the implied biblical connotations heavy-handed & the overt criticism of modern-day fame perfunctory. Most audiences were shocked by the gory climax & some critics deemed this a black comedy; frankly, I was neither horrified nor entertained! All the characters involved (except for the perennially barefooted Lawrence) range from the slightly unsympathetic (Bardem) to the downright annoying (Harris & Pfeiffer)...one can't really fault Aronofsky's technical prowess here but, as Biblical tracts go, I preferred his more irreverent NOAH (2014), while BLACK SWAN (2012; still his best work) was a far more interesting & satisfying 'descent into the maelstrom'."

"tortillasdepanchovilla","9","1","4","5 December 2017"," Read if you really want to know what the movie is about
","Great movie, however it is a 9 for me because I don't like too much when the movie makes fully sense in the last 5 minutes, then you have to rewind it in your mind to fit all the pieces together.<br/><br/>Movie concept spoiler below:<br/><br/>The girl is not his wife: she is his muse, which is the inspirational goddesses of literature, science, and the arts in Greek mythology.<br/><br/>There is really not too much to be said, the rest you have to watch it under this concept. If you don't agree, keep reading.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to understand that the girl is not a real person but a personification. She is not the house or the world or mother nature for the sake. The fact that in the movie she interacts with other people could be seen as the personification in itself, otherwise she would just be kind of an imaginary friend, but the movie would be totally different. <br/><br/>Lets follow the movie sequence:<br/><br/>1 - It starts with her being on fire. While watching the movie, I thought that it was also the last scene, since many movies do that, but it isn't, meaning that she burnt ""the house"" (by the way, the house never burnt, the muse died time after time like a phoenix). Later on he tells that the house burnt down, then he found the crystal, and then she came. Confused? Don't be, he wrote a book or a poem before which of course he couldn't have done without his muse, then the muse died, again, because the poem or book was done, and then the muse came back for another book, and so on. <br/><br/>2 - He invited people to live in the house for the purpose that he explained, to grasp new ideas. In the meantime we wrote something but not too good, because these people broke it, meaning that they read it and disliked it. These intruders are necessarily fictional and real: for him are real people telling him ""why don't you use that word instead of this one"", or for i.e. ""why don't you change this for that?"". But in fact they are just meddling between the writer and his muse. <br/><br/>3 - While the intruder's son is killed by his brother, he tells some words regarding life and dead, and you will hear the exact phrase again later on. Here the killer tells her that she knows what being lonely is. By the way, nobody died, but a book in progress went straight to the recycle bin. <br/><br/>4 - In the mayhem that follows they have sex and the next morning right after waking up, she tells him that she is pregnant, she knows it just like that, and what happened next? Since she is just a personification, it means that an idea just developed and he starts writing it right away. Now you see that the baby is nonexistent but a new book is in progress. <br/><br/>5 - From one scene to the next one she is about a week to give birth, meaning that the book is almost finished. <br/><br/>6 - He tells his muse that the paper is finished, she reads it and then asks him if she is going to lose him. Next second the phone rings and she learns that his publisher is congratulating him. She is set back by this but of course his editor read it already, giving meaning to the editor's work = corrections = suggestions = intruders. Of course, if instead of being presented as a person she would have been presented as a muse, her feeling wouldn't matter at all, and in fact they don't, that's why she feel secluded and ignored from everyone. Why is she still pregnant? Because the book isn't published yet. <br/><br/>7 - Then there is a first print, just a few copies for the critics and people alike, and people from everywhere starts to congratulate him. <br/><br/>8 - Her existence is compromised, she isn't needed anymore for this book, hence the apocalypse. <br/><br/>9 - Then the book is reprinted for the general public, that is when the baby is born. <br/><br/>10 - The book is so good that it is devoured by the readers, it is not cannibalism for Christ's sake! <br/><br/>11 - So the muse is done, the book is done, and like the phoenix bird she burns, unlike him, but inside her there is the seed for the his next work, a new idea, and he takes it from inside her. Notice that when he places the new crystal in the pedestal, the house becomes again restored, as in the beginning. Also while he carries her outside, he tells her that he is bringing her to the beginning again.<br/><br/>Notice also that the house is the book's current state. The sink brakes, the floor does too, those are publisher's and friend's intrusions or corrections if you like. <br/><br/>So if you didn't look at it under this scope, watch it again if you want so watch a different movie."
"twelvehousebooks","7","1","4","5 December 2017"," Horror Is The Best Part of Man
","Jennifer Lawrence is a good actor, and Javier Bardem is almost as weird as he was in No Country For Old Men. Movies that spring to mind? All My Friends Are Funeral Singers, The Sentinel, and Silent House. This film is a metaphor for a certain perception of the world we live in, with riot police, loads of bloodshed for various reasons, religious crazies, insane fans, childish anarchists, and even liberated Blacks who have made it through college because of the relaxation of the Jim Crow laws. There is only one point to this film, and that is to watch a metaphor unfold about how God works in the world. There are different levels of his lovers, and those who obviously hate him, and those who long for him before they die--whose lives have been changed by his words. His wife, played by Lawrence, is his most ardent lover. She loves him so much that she has gone as far as recreating his house for him--being where she and God share their private lives together. There are some very unbiblical things going on here (we are, after all, talking about a director who put rock monsters in the story of Noah), but overall any film that can drag the viewers attention toward love for God gets at least 7 stars for originality and effort. ""Horror is the best part of man, but he thinks it too expensive, for there he finds God.""--Goethe"

","This is astounding! I can't wait to watch it again, still getting my head around it. I went to see it with one of my best mates who is also an urban shaman and quite drunk at the Century City mall cinema (for LA residents, there's a Gelsons in the basement with a great booze section and they don't do bag checks, it's fantastic). I definitely recommend getting a bit drunk and/or high to see this film. <br/><br/>To avoid any spoilers I'm going to go into detail about the film or hypotheses about the deeper meaning of the plot - the joy of this film for me was speculating about the various meanings of the movie, and then getting into a drunk argument with a shaman about it as we tried to find our car for 48 minutes because the signage at that mall is terrible. For me personally, I found it very true to a recurring dream, a common and archetypal dream that I think everyone alive has had at some point. It was as if the film peered straight into the collective unconscious, dredged up some very primal fears and bitch-slapped us with them. <br/><br/>I totally understand why many viewers hated this movie but for me personally it was a revelation, I wish I could go back in time and experience it anew all over again."
"DVR_Brale","8","1","4","22 October 2017"," Inimitable and highly symbolic movie made for a particular thinking audience
","Firstly, Mother! is not a horror movie. That tag should be removed. A lot of people went to see a horror movie and left the cinema halfway through disappointed. This mistake has as a consequence many people rating it irrationally low. It's difficult to specify Mother! genre exactly but it can be described as a highly symbolic and disturbing mystery drama. That symbolism is not of David Lynch's style as it appears much more ominous. <br/><br/>It's sufficient to read some reviews here on IMDb to see how polarizing this movie is. We can argue about it as much as we want and still fail to understand it properly. But here I propose there may not even be one proper way of putting it together. Therefore I believe this film can be approached from many different angles, interpreted quite differently and that you can still benefit from watching it no matter how you did that. Most of us can at least agree that there are multiple layers surrounding Mother! despite having opposite impressions about it.<br/><br/>Still, this is not a movie I would generally recommend to watch. It's not mainstream but has been made for a particular audience, I myself am a member of, who don't mind waiting, sometimes a lot, for a movie to develop. People who liked it probably sincerely enjoy giving a meaning to symbols afterwards and reconciling apparent contradictions. Besides that, most importantly, they can come to grips with shocking scenes and story. The point is not to get overwhelmed by shocking material but read through it. If you don't share these characteristics, it's highly likely that you'll walk away from it disappointed, shocked and maybe even disgusted. <br/><br/>If you do fall in to this category, be ready for a roller-coaster, especially towards the end! Mother! has been made of two parts: first part is mysterious and murky, second very thrilling and shocking. At first those two don't even seem to be connected and it's even pretty easy to neglect and forget the first part because it is much more tranquil than the second. Still, both are important to process if you want to get the full picture. I recommend that you pay utter attention in the first hour or so, so you don't get caught completely of guard later.<br/><br/>I'll immediately cut to the conclusion because this movie begs for a classical review not to be written: Mother! is one of a kind experience that certain people, tired of nonsensical action and drama, with good ""movie digesting system"" are going to be thankful for."

","Full of spoilers.<br/><br/>You see a death and then a rebirth. He puts everything back to the way that it was before each time the relationship fails. It might be a time loop but I'm thinking that it's a series of marriages. It's showing how someone can ruin one marriage after another. Jennifer is just one of the marriages in a series. <br/><br/>Their marriage shows one very important thing - how relationships fail based off of different needs in the relationship. In this case, she's completely introverted and he's the opposite. The movie decides to put her in the focal point, showing us how disrupted her tranquil state is once outsiders invade. The celebrity of just one person in a relationship can be damning, therefore, we're shown how protective she is of him, then her baby and then when her baby is lost, all is lost and the relationship implodes. At the end, we see her charred body, he takes her love and recreates something else with it, it all starts over and the whole cycle begins again. <br/><br/>It's all very abstract, very indirect and I could be completely off but the concepts are there, just displayed in the most mind-blowing way. I really want to understand this film, I refuse to hate it because there's nothing to hate. Darren is daring, he doesn't tell ordinary stories in ordinary ways and I love him for it."
"noahlenzi","6","1","4","24 September 2017"," Ignore the marketing and listen to the critics but its still not for everyone.
","The film Mother! currently holds a F rating on cinema score from audiences, however critics see it in a higher regard and after viewing it myself I can see why. Mother! is essentially a heavy handed allegory that works for the most part although I think the final third of the film gets a little too obvious and drastically departs from the slow pacing it had before. It's a very interesting movie about religion and how destructive it can be. It also shows how people of importance are sometimes used to carry one's inspiration yet are given back nothing in the end. I didn't love the film but I did like it. Its a story about inspiration, creation and destruction all under the oppression of patriarchy. We see through the eyes of one who is both cherished and oppressed and never given anything back. It's an uncomfortable watch but an interesting thought provoking film. It's not for everyone. This film was marketed all wrong. It is NOT A HORROR FILM like the trailers suggest, its more of a slow burn drama/thriller. Best to know before watching. I'd give it the decent grade of a 7.5/10"

","Mother! didn't make much sense. It made me pretty anxious. It felt like I was watching someone's nightmare or having a bad acid trip. It's definitely unique and it made me feel things I've never felt while watching a movie. I've not heard many good things about it, but I don't think it's terrible. Though I appreciate Aronofsky's noble effort to introduce the avant-garde to mainstream audiences, I just don't think they're quite ready for it. I think the poor reception was mostly the result of poor marketing. If I saw it at an art-house theater, like the Laemmle or Cinefamily, I'd probably feel different about it and would have had a better idea of what to expect. I think that seeing it at a big ol' commercial AMC downtown really threw me off. It was like the movie Brazil, add a little bit of City of Lost Children, mixed with equal parts Jacob's Ladder and Eraserhead. I'm definitely feeling weirded out by it still. I don't think I'd watch it again, but I'd say it's worth seeing."

","An out of the ordinary movie. A surrealist allegory. At a certain time in the movie, it seems we are in a nightmare, as disturbing it is.

"Aly200","6","1","4","21 September 2017"," One Insane Mind Trip
","From the creative mind of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"", Darren Arronofsky returns after a three year hiatus to bring audiences this psychological mind-bending film that has proved immensely divisive. However don't let the controversy surrounding the film give a false impression, this Arronofsky piece is probably his most unique offering yet.<br/><br/>To briefly explain the plot without giving too many spoilers, a married couple (Oscar winners Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem) are renovating a large country estate when two mysterious strangers (Oscar nominees Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) arrive at their home and bizarre occurrences begin to unfold. The film eventually descends into a torrid fever dream until its heart-stopping climax.<br/><br/>Director Darren Arronofsky knows how to assemble a prestigious cast and this film is no exception: 1. Jennifer Lawrence really delivers a mature performance that may not quite rival her work in 2010's ""Winter's Bone"", but her descent into paranoia is actually believable as she slowly starts to unravel as the amount of strangers in her home chips away at her normally solid façade. However the actress's chemistry with costar Javier Bardem seems a little less solid as the two characters seem too detached at certain times. There are tender moments where the actors' chemistry does appear more genuine, but the age difference to me was unsettling (given Bardem is near 50 while Lawrence is in her mid 20s); there is even an in-joke from co-star Michelle Pfeiffer's character about Lawrence's character being Bardem's daughter not his wife. Lawrence's climatic breakdown at the film's finale is probably the most adrenaline-rushing and heartbreaking farewell the actress has ever given as she has finally decided to end her torment despite her want for happiness throughout the narrative. 2. Javier Bardem as Lawrence's husband makes for an enigmatic figure as we never really get to know much about him. The actor imbues some tenderness into his relationship with Lawrence (already mentioned the overall flatness of their chemistry), but also masks a sinister demeanor behind the friendly-looking face; a trademark for the actor in other roles like ""No Country for Old Men"". We don't learn much about Bardem's character due to his secretive nature, but the film's first half hints that there is a dark purpose behind him and his actions especially when it comes to Jennifer Lawrence's Mother accusing her husband of being selfish and only caring about his own needs and desires as opposed to her; though he tries to tell her he does care about her. Does he really is up to the viewer's interpretation. 3. In what are basically cameo roles, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer as a mysterious couple are the catalysts for the ensuing chaos of the film's second and third acts. All we learn is that Harris plays a doctor and Pfeiffer is his pretty yet strangely aloof spouse and meet their sparring sons (an event that has a profound impact during the film's intense second act and a main drive for the start of Lawrence's Mother's deteriorating mental state). The genders each form a bizarre chemistry as we see Bardem and Harris bonding while Pfeiffer and Lawrence are wary of each other and a mild antagonism bubbles, but doesn't quite explode. There is might be a strange symbolism in Harris and Pfeiffer's characters that connects them to our two leads, but there is never a clear answer as the couple disappears halfway through the film and are never seen or mentioned again.<br/><br/>Retaining the director's traditional dark atmosphere, Arronofsky does include numerous daytime scenes to evoke an unsettling serenity that eventually dissolves into nighttime chaos. The first half of the film is like many Arronofsky films where the basic action and characters are introduced, but unlike some of the director's prior dark films this is one that turns almost into an MTV fever dream in its third act. Is there an occult message when masses of fanatics turn up at the home of Lawrence and Bardem or is there a message of the difference between isolation and socialization? There is never a clear answer as the film veers from unsteady tranquility into a maddening nightmare that can only lead to tragedy (a common theme in Arronofsky's other works). While the camera-work is impressive as expected from Arronofsky, the biggest flaw is his use of shaky cam during one intense scene early in the film between three characters; the shaky cam only stops when the fight finally ends, your head will definitely spend several minutes spinning before you can settle back. Even in the film's third act, the visuals become overwhelming and intense as the action transitions deeper and deeper into a waking nightmare before there is a moment of respite.<br/><br/>A film not for the faint of heart or a novice of the Darren Arronofsky filmography, take caution when viewing 'mother!"". You won't comprehend the story at first, there will be numerous questions to ponder."
"RforFilm","5","1","4","18 September 2017"," With how underwhelming mother! is, we at least know what Darren Aronosky's Project X remake is like
","When people saw the trailers for the latest Darren Aronofsky film mother!, many people expected that the filmmaker was going to make a return to the horror genre, similar to The Black Swan. It certainly sold me on it's claustrophobic and unnerving imagery that made me curious. I, along with a lot of people, walked out of the theater wondering what exactly we just witnessed. I'll say upfront that the movie taps into the surreal, experimental kind of style, that I haven't seen since Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life or Charlie Kaufmans Synecdoche, New York. All these films are artist's dreams, but can be polarizing the mainstream audiences. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has been known to explore into experimental areas before with Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and even Black Swan. This ranges from out of order storytelling, camera focus on odd objects, and especially cinematography He uses a lot of these tactics to separate the films world from our own, accomplishing his goal of making his work feel more unnerving then the typical blockbuster. Audience members may argue that they wanted something more logical, but often don't consider enough just what logic was even established, if any. Let's see if mother! pushes once too much for it's audience to think. <br/><br/>In a paradise-like country home that's separated from society, a young women, only known as Mother (played by Jennifer Lawrence) is focused on renovating the house, making it clean and well built desiring to making it heaven for her and her husband. Only known as Him (played by Javier Bardem), he's a famous poet with writer's block whose hoping that the home their building will inspire him once more. As she's painting or spackling, she starts to see visions of a heartbeat that seems to slow down as the film progresses. <br/><br/>One day, a Man (played by Ed Harris) visits, looking for a place to stay. Though Mother is suspicious of the stranger, Him insists that he stay for the night. The next morning, Man's wife, Woman (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) comes to find her husband and stays too. The two enjoy conversing with Him, but Mother is wondering when their going to leave. Things become more complicated when Man's two sons arrive, cause some trouble, and results in even more people arriving at the house.<br/><br/>I have to stop there, as the third act of mother! gets insane from there. This is the point that is going to polarize the audience. I will understand if people like or hate the movie, though I think I'm somewhere in the middle. I had to ponder on where I stood, as I was impressed with the ambition that Aronofsky wanted to portray. It was written well and allowed the story (or lack of) to keep my attention all they way to the end. But at the same time. I could get exactly what this movie was going for: humanized representations of the early days of the bible. What do I mean with this?<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is supposed to be God, Jennifer Lawrence is mother earth, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are Adam and Eve, and I could go on with what was supposed to be represented. The problem is that I think it comes around as too obvious and could have benefited from being more vague, something more in tune to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Ironically, much of the noise in the background tries to say so much about everything and that came off as overly pretentious. Maybe I'm supposed to be reading it as something else, but Aronofsky tried to bite more then he could chew.<br/><br/>I'll give this five crystal rocks out of ten. I give the movie points for ambition, but it may be the most unfocused Aronofsky story of all. I can't say it was bad from beginning to end, but the second half could have used both less, but more vagueness. It's to put down on paper, but I'd still suggest Pi and Rosemary's Baby as an example of what mother! needs to be. I'd still encourage film buffs to check it out to make their own conclusions, but their probably going to expect more."

","it looks like a lot of people will disagree with me but in 'my' opinion this is a masterpiece. Absolutely incredible film making. For me very much so because this is the closest to a nightmare I've ever seen on screen, simply edge of your seat stuff. I need a few days to think the film through and to appreciate the deeper meaning behind the imagery but i just wanted to give this film some much deserved praise as i was surprised to see just how much hate there is on IMDb for this film right now (as of a couple of days after its release) I would highly recommend you to go see this on the big screen as Aronofsky has once again used the medium to create an intensity that not many directors have managed capture. First class horror. <br/><br/>On a side note - As for those who are upset by possible parallels to Rosemary's Baby there is simply nothing wrong with being inspired by other films and id further mention that one should go and read the novel Rosemary's Baby before they give all the praise to Polanski as it pretty much as close to word for word a movie could be against a novel. I think a lot more praise for Rosemary's Baby should be given to Ira Levin who wrote it (i do love Polanski's Rosemary's baby too though thats for sure)"

"TheVictoriousV","8","1","5","5 March 2020"," (ARCHIVE REVIEW) Funny that the two main complaints are ""it's too obvious"" and ""huh i no get it""
","For a moment, I believed that Darren Aronofsky had lost me with Mother (or mother! as it is stylized). This is one my favorite directors of all time, who has made a handful of movies, each of them (even his Noah, on which I went easy because I enjoyed the reactions of the Christians who seemed bothered seeing the story they're used to be shown for the horror it is) distinct and strange in its own way.<br/><br/>With Mother, the trailers implied he was going for a more conventional horror flick with little to remark. Even if I admit how wrong I was, I may be spoiling the experience - this is one of the most upredictably nightmarish journeys of 2017 and I dare not say too much. Despite my attempts at this, I implore you: proceed at your own caution.<br/><br/>Like many of Aronofsky's works (The Fountain being the most obvious), Mother is short on providing clear answers to its mystifying images and events, but this doesn't hurt the film so much as it makes for an uncomfortable yet transfixingly surreal experience. For some, this will be a turn-off; as ""Adum"" of YourMovieSucksDotOrg has sagely pointed out, this is hardly intended for the sort of movie-goer that would want to see it solely because it starts Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Specifically, Lawrence plays a character whose name I will not reveal here, but she resides in a beautiful home with her husband (Javier Bardem), a struggling poet the baby of whom she also carries. As serene as things may seem, ominous visions appear to her and one night the couple is visited by a man (Ed Harris) in need of help, and eventually the man's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) as well. What follows, I will not give away either.<br/><br/>I can mention that the supporting cast is rich, even if they can be hard to glimpse through the eyes of our often disoriented heroine. Brothers Brian and Domhnall Gleeson portray two in-universe brothers and Stephen McHattie and Kristen Wiig can be spotted when chaos ensues.<br/><br/>There is a constant sense of unease and confusion throughout the film, conveyed brilliantly via the befuddled perspective of Lawrence, who turns in one of the best performances of her career. Even at the film's most pleasant moments, there remains an underlying feeling that hostile beings roam within this world we've entered.<br/><br/>The film is minimal when it comes to studio lighting, which isn't bad for the image quality so much as it's immersive by way of being natural. With a certain level of realism to the film, which is further aided by the shaky camera work and the complete lack of music, the strange and inexplicable events seem all the more threatening.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there comes a point where the hostility of this world arguably goes too far (it may even appear silly), although it is forgivable once you understand the allegory. The confusion we share with the protagonist about the humans she meets is one thing; the true question is of what it all symbolizes.<br/><br/>There are images and motifs that evoke Eraserhead and Aronofsky's first movie Pi, but the central theme is more similar to that of, say, E. Elias Mirhage's Begotten. Yes, the initial experience is generally unpleasant; it is the realizations we come to that make it worth it, even if those aren't exactly cheerful either. Some argue that the allegory is obvious, but not all audience members are so fortunate:<br/><br/>Since its release, many viewers have expressed their frustration with the film, even critics declaring that the art has somehow failed because it doesn't spoon-feed explanations to its beholders. Sure thing. We can go with that conclusion if it makes you feel better about your unwillingness to engage with cinema on anything other than a literal or optical level (or the ""I just wanted to see my bae JLaw, but now the movie's, like, asking me to think"" level)."

","Going further in the unconventional department, ""mother!"" is many viewers' cup of hemlock, and without question 2017's most revolutionary, and perhaps offensive, film. Unfortunately I cannot say much without spoiling the whole thing so I need to skirt around its plot and, even more carefully, its meaning. Perhaps one might label it a psychological horror film but that is so inadequate since, as its 'meaning' becomes clear (if the viewer ever does figure it out), it truly becomes something else. <br/><br/>Directed at high intensity by the formidable Darren Aronofsky (whose previous best was probably 2008's ""The Wrestler"", though ""mother!"" more resembles his earlier nightmare, ""Requiem of a Dream""), its basic plot follows a young nameless woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who seems to have a tranquil life with her husband (also unnamed, played by Javier Bardem) until their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer). They are also unnamed. The film proceeds slowly at first - almost exclusively from the woman's point of view - gathering pitch until all hell breaks out, and we are truly in the world of Hieronymus Bosch, although 'earthly delights' will not be forthcoming. I loved every minute of this nightmare, god help me, but most of all when the pieces began to come together after my second viewing, something which some viewers might feel t'would constitute a medieval torture far worse than being drawn and quartered. Without being able to detail it any further, I want to emphasize how important this film is as a work of art and how, if strong stomach permits, you really need to give it multiple viewings. <br/><br/>Praised around the world by many critics, it was also booed at its premiere at the 74th Venice Film Festival (along with a strong standing ovation). Although misanthrope critic Rex Reed gave the film 'zero stars', many acclaimed it, most notably filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who ecstatically raved, ""Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it."" Brilliant in every way, and a masterpiece of surrealism, Dadaism, radicalism and Lewis Carroll-ism. And if you see it and manage to unlock its levels of meaning and the impact of it starts to seep into your consciousness, you might need to lie down on your local psychiatrist's couch."

","To make things clear! this is definitely not a movie for everyone, but for the ones who enjoy a dark, psychological, and other-worldly experience - this is a complete masterpiece on that matter. 
From the slow building beginning - to the bombing finale, there is a really good pacing that makes the narrative interesting. From the perspective of someone who doesn't care about religion, the characters are so well written that every dialogue and confrontation, is made so intense and gripping that you can't stop watching. When I first heard that people walked out of the theater from watching this movie, I couldn't believe it since the psychological parts are really exciting. Later on i realized that the R-rating and the bloody parts, may be too much for some people who expected a Haunted house kind of horror. 
In time where Hollywood has become so vanilla when it comes to horror movies and psychological thrillers, it's so refreshing to see that there are some great directors left, who are not afraid to dial the tone of the violence up to the extreme, and makes it so convincing (even thought it's almost a fairy tale) that you can't be anything but shocked (in a good way). This is NOT a horror movie though... so just disregard the weird advertisements, and watch the movies if you like intense psychological thrillers, that are way deeper structured than most movies today."

"framptonhollis","8","1","5","3 February 2018"," flawed masterpiece
","My enthusiastic perfect score is NOT an indicator that this film IS actually a near perfect film, as it totally isn't. It's extremely flawed, particularly in terms of its over-the-top abundance of arguably pretentious symbolism. However, that cast aside, ""mother!"" is pretty damn incredible!
 Sad, horrific, and darkly funny, ""mother!"" is a hopeful indication that, when Aronofsky has matured a bit as an artist (I love all of the films of his I have seen, but I still admit to them having various elements of a possibly-pretentious-sort-of-self-indulgent nature), he can make a movie that is even better! The pieces of the puzzle are all here, and are used to a strong, powerful effect. While the film is obviously a biblical allegory, it can still be viewed as a horrific surrealist nightmare of a film and nothing more. It is reminiscent of Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" or Svankmajer's ""Alice"", and, speaking of ""Eraserhead"", the sound design in this film may be its greatest achievement believe it or not! Strip this film of its visuals, and you've got what may be the greatest radio play of all time (at least since Samuel Beckett's death)! 
 The visuals are also quite spectacular. Even if some of the special effects could easily be labeled ""cheesy"" or ""tacky"" or ""whatever"" in some way, I still found myself loving them! And Aronofsky's lens is fittingly unsure about almost everything. The camera shakes nervously, following Jennifer Lawrence as she runs and screams through a decaying world. The acting is also quite magnificent (Razzie Awards, go f*ck yourselves), with Lawrence turning out my favorite performance of hers by far, as well as a surprisingly likable (if in the end mildly sinister) portrayal of God by Javier Bardem. Even better are performances by Ed Harris (who is fantastically tragicomic in his interpretation of the dark, absurdist humor flowing through the very strange scenario) and Michelle Pfeiffer (who is still beautiful, but manages to demolish said beauty with a performance peppered by the spiciest of cruelties towards our leading lady).
 While apparently extraordinarily divisive among viewers, I highly recommend ""mother!"" to almost anyone who loves film, as long as they think they can handle it, as it is extremely intense on all sorts of levels (which will, obviously, happen naturally when telling a deeply disturbing tale with a claustrophobic and surreal atmosphere).admittedly flawed and immature in some aspects, but ultimately a thrilling exercise in nightmarish surrealism"

That is probably the most perfect and original way to keep your attention. - First movie - <br/><br/>But then, on the edge of saying ""This is bad"" you hit your self in the head with your palm, yelling ""I am stupid!"" and start to put all this little parts and begin to understand. Then you are watching a different movie. <br/><br/>Spoiler <br/><br/>When you realize that overture is a book of Genesis, when you understand that first visitors is exiled from the Garden of Eden, and then Cain and Abel, and Sodom and Gomorrah, and the great rain and awaking of the monotheist religion, and that he is a idea/god and she is a life/holly spirit and that house is Earth and their child has been given to the people and they killed child and then eat him, you will adore that palm in your head. - Second movie - <br/><br/>The movie in artist look, has provocative visualization, which give you a constant feeling of discomfort and it is putting you on the edge. You are following the emotional discomfort of Jennifer Lawrence, and she is brilliant to say at least, and that makes you to like her, to hate her, to - don't know what i think of her - at the moments. That constant feeling of discomfort is what may pull you away from this movie, but if you get used of it, or just try to ignore it, which is hard, you may enjoy in surreal visualization which is brutal on most occasions. <br/><br/>For the end of this review, I give this movie 8 of 10, because it is a brilliant and a future classic piece of cinema art, but it does have a several problems in narrative, and the main problem is confusion, which I personally adore and think that this is a probably most original narrative in past decades, but in cinema retrospective it is just confusing. The second problem is that this movie to be fully understand require mythological knowledge, and non-stop attention, which is a problem for some, especially younger public, or non Christian public, and that is a problem. The whole idea of cinema is to be universal and to show and be maid for everyone, but everyone can not enjoy this movie to the full, and some will see this movie as what they see, a story of two people in the house, or something like that."

","As I watched Mother! I felt utterly uncomfortable and I loved every second of it! The way it reflects upon so many subjects of our society through its metaphors is so unsettling. It hits you right on the spot. Jennifer Lawrence has never been looked as beautiful as she does in this movie, and her performance is at the top of her game. As much as it is disturbing and brutal this movie is beautiful. A True Masterpiece by Aronofsky!"
"barbagvido","10","1","5","27 October 2017"," It came from 1 to 10 for me in the matter of hours. That's how strange it is.
","mother! is a new movie by a visionary director Darren Aranofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Noah, Black Swan) who has never shied away from shocking the audiences and causing controversy. That's why I think he's one of the most interesting directors working today and his films are always talked about when they come out, doesn't matter if they bomb or not. It starts Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as this couple living alone isolated from the world in this house and then some people come up and ruin their peace.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say anything else about the plot because it's just so much and it's hard to describe, so the less said the better. I gotta say this is quite possibly the most unique movie experience I have ever had. Before I start talking about the movie itself let me tell you a story about how I watched it in order to make some points about it. I knew this was going to be something else, but I didn't expect it to disturb me this much. I'm not one of those who get scared by movies. Some rare ones did scare me, but not much. And this is not your usual kind of fear. This is just pure uneasiness and disturbance. First half is interesting. Now that I reflect upon it, I remember how easily I got sucked into this nightmarish world. I just got lost in the movie. Then the third act came up and all hell broke loose. And when I say hell, I do mean hell. Pure, nightmarish chaos. And being an ambivert, it really was a nightmare for me. And I could only imagine what it must be like for introverts. I've also seen it in the middle of the week and at the end of a busy day, so that might have affected the way I saw it. But you can have the most wonderful day and this movie will still disturb you deeply. And close to the end there was one particular scene that was just too much and me and my friend walked out feeling sick and I was in a state of a small shock through the rest of the night. That night, and in the morning, I hated this movie with all my heart and soul and wanted to give it a 1/10. But what extremely bothered me is that I couldn't stop thinking about how well everything works in it. I spoiled the rest for myself on Wikipedia and then managed to somehow watch the last 10 minutes online. And now I think it's one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece. This is Darren Aronofsky's Mona Lisa. I still can't stop thinking about this movie. It's symbols, allegories, plot and directing. It's masterfully directed. A constant use of close-up will make you feel slightly harassed after a while and it certainly adds fuel to the feeling of unease. And the third act is the best depiction of chaos, nightmare and hell I've ever seen on film. At first I thought I never wanna watch it again. Now I think I'm gonna watch it quite often when it comes out on blu-ray. It's a horrifying masterpiece that is also backed up by extremely strong performances by absolutely everyone starring in this movie. Horror is term used so easily today with horror movies, but this was true horror for me. I loved it. Like a poem, it's full of metaphors and there are so much ways to interpret this and there is almost no way to literally interpret this. But it's beautiful and chaotic at the same time.<br/><br/>Wow, I don't remember the last time I've FELT a movie this intensely and I don't remember the last time a movie stuck with me so much. It made such an impact on me and I certainly don't remember hating this movie and loving it not even a day later. It jumped from being my least favorite movie of the year to maybe even being my favorite movie of the year. If not that, definitely one of my favorites. Just don't watch if you're weak at disturbing movies, you might get traumatized."

","this movie completely blew me away! i have been an Aronofsky fan since his early days and have always regarded him highly as one of the top directors working out there as of now. his directorial style gets under my skin in ways i find myself craving other directors would too so despite the really nasty reviews, i decided to give him my coins. and boy i was not sorry. first things first, this is clearly an art house film that was marketed in a way it could be widely distributed and by that i mean most people who went into it due to what they saw advertised/in the trailers was most definitely upset and disappointed since the movie literally had nothing to do with what it appeared to have. now that that is clarified, it is also not a movie for mainstream audiences! this is in the likes of something Lars Von Trier would do so if you're not into that then don't bother. however if you are or at least are a bit curious to see what all the fuss is about, then yeah check it out, but be ware, you will most definitely come out of it either deeply loving it or deeply hating it!!! the usual ambition and pretension Aronofsky brings to his projects is there for sure, which i really like but can totally see why others don't, and so is his lack of subtlety that one who's seen most of his films would expect. if you hate that, i repeat don't watch it, it's not worth it and you'll feel like you're wasting your time but for those of you willing to give it a try you're in for a big treat and in my opinion one of the most relevant and necessary, in spite of its flaws, movies to come out in ages and i will forever admire Aronofsky for having the balls to do what he did and will continue to support his work."

I loved every second of it and will see it again this week (it's definitely best viewed in a theatre - you really need to devote your senses). Not for children.. definitely rated R.

","I felt as lost, baffled, confused and astonished as Lawrence's nominal character throughout the film. I tried to hold on to any kind of narrative sense or to any parallelism to previous films in an attempt to get a hint of where this was going. It is by the time the film enters its overblown third and final act where all logic, common sense and rationality seem to go out the window, that I realized that this is a) no ordinary film b) no ordinary narrative and c) its divisive reception is being supported by all the wrong reasons. <br/><br/>I've heard and read the words pompous, pretentious and conceited thrown around senselessly. I don't think mother! is any. The fact that this film is headlined by Lawrence pulls perhaps the wrong audience for this particular piece; but if an audience is pulled to a film expecting a product more akin to the star(s)'s previous work is an error that is all but uncontrollable, the finger of blame though should be pointed at the studio itself for selling a film for something it is not. Make no mistake, mother! is not the traditional horror film nor a suspenseful film. It is yes a scary allegorical and metaphorical film, in a genre of its own that entices - as it well should - split reactions and discussions. It is perhaps more of a discussion piece rather than a wide release audience appealing film. As thought provoking, visual and emotionally violent as it is, the film is a brutal exercise that is getting the attention for that misguidance. I truly hope that Aronofsky's latest gets all the attention, discussion and care it deserves, perhaps in time with a cult following an audience that wants to watch it, debate it and either praise or diminish it with substantiated arguments."

The movie has some really interesting ideas about being an artist and needing to create. And it's incredibly well made, with beautiful cinematography and gripping performances, especially from Jennifer Lawrence. Still, mother! was pretty out there for me. The story of mother! is like being in a nightmare, but not in a bad or frightening way. It's just that everything is wrong and you can't do anything to fix it. And you can't wake up.<br/><br/>Even though it was a tough watch, it's worth watching and thinking about."
"jkelt","7","1","5","20 September 2017"," Art House of Horror
","******Here Be Spoilers!*******<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Mother!"", my biggest gripe being that I thought it was shot with irritatingly low lighting, like I was watching the whole thing through glasses coated with sepia-toned cheesecloth. I found myself squinting at the screen, which, of course, didn't help. I went in having seen the preview trailer a few times (before showings of ""Annabelle: The Creation"" and ""It""), the one that was edited with quick cuts and Bernard Herrmann-like strings. To me that said it was being marketed to the horror crowd; but it was still Aronofsky with Lawrence, Bardem, Harris and Pfieffer. I figured it was going to be more than a horror movie, but seemingly rooted in the horror genre somehow. Maybe that's why I didn't hate it like so many other people seem to.<br/><br/>A jewel is placed in a stand and a burned and rotted house is rejuvenated. A withered corpse under a blanket is breathed back to life, and a day begins. Bardem's male energy is focused on creating a poetic work of art for consumption by the irrational masses of the world, to as he says, ""bring life into the house""; Lawrence's female energy is focused on creating a home for him and literally bringing a life into their home in her womb. There are Biblical metaphors (Cain and Abel, who knows how many others?)and problems that 21st Century couples have are introduced. Some are small and comic, some are large, horrid, and hurtful. Then it goes full gonzo-universal, with Lawrence trying to give birth in a war zone inside her own house. The mob perpetrates atrocities. I laughed at times, I was horrified at times. I was confused as to what was happening often. Maybe the jewel is all that's left after the life cycle of the universe goes from Big Bang to inevitable collapse and re-ignition. Maybe Bardem as ""Him"" is a sadistic demon or a masochistic wizard, with ""mother"" Lawrence as his suffering muse.In the end, what does it mean? Who knows? Why are people so angry at this movie? Who knows? With Edgar Allen Poe and Alfred Hitchcock, audiences are content with a few scares and a few twists, so why not Aronofsky? At the end of ""The Cask of Amontillado"" the reader gets a chill of realization that a character is being bricked up behind a wall to be left to die for revenge. (That was included in ""Tales of Terror"" a 1962 horror film with Vincent Price.) At the end of ""The Birds"" we never know why the birds came, and Suzanne Pleshette and others have died grisly deaths for no reason except some possible metaphor. At the end of ""Psycho"" the big reveal that Anthony Perkins is insane and mother was long dead is a crowd-satisfying twist. But Janet Leigh's body is still in the trunk, having died for nothing. Was it all just torture porn? No, a mystery has been solved. So Bardem places a new jewel in the stand, and the cycle starts again, with him as the demon/wizard/poet, and a new woman appears as his muse. We know what she's in for; the horror. The reveal of a twist; the end. ""Mother!"" took me for a ride worth taking. It made me laugh, gave me a start or two and made me think. It was well-acted, and contained moments of insight into the human condition. Good enough for me."

","I don't get this film and I don't think there is a normal message in this movie. Its pointless and scary.

Hundreds of people rush to get in the house to praise Jennifer Lawrence's husband who just published a piece of writing.<br/><br/>The people call it revolutionary and basically start praying to him... It gets worse as they start breaking the house apart, trying to keep something from the extraordinary poet. Everyone gets violent. Riot police comes in along with seal team six that try to protect Jennifer Lawrence but end up dying. When the husband and Jennifer Lawrence find a quiet place in the house that is a war zone, she gives birth. <br/><br/>THIS IS WHERE IT GETS CREEPY<br/><br/>The husband wants to give the baby to the crazy people outside but Jennifer refuses but after some time she falls a sleep and the baby is gone.She sees her husband give the baby to the crowd and they start passing the baby around VIOLENTLY. As the baby is passed around, ITS NECK BREAKS and it starts crying.When Jennifer rushed to the baby's aid, she sees that the baby has been EATEN by the crowd. She looks and sees the people eating parts of the baby.She freaks out and goes to the basement to burn the whole house down. She does this and everyone dies but her husband who remains untouched. The husband then recovers the burnt body of Jennifer Lawrence and teaks basically rips her chest to take her heart. He squeezes the heart and it turns in to a diamond. And the whole story starts again...<br/><br/>I didn't see a point to this movie and it was creepy as hell. There is just no explanation to this movie. Its just a bunch of weird things happening that doesn't have a resolution. There is no end. It basically just stops in the middle of the story.

","This movie is beautiful. I have never seen a film so simplistic, and yet so complex at the same time. I went into this movie thinking it was your typical home invasion story. Especially after seeing the trailer that only showed scenes from the first half of the movie. But fortunately, I was proved wrong. mother! is not a film. It is a peace of art. First let's start with the story. I honestly don't know what to compare to this film. This film is one big allegory on Religion. From the scene where the older brother kills his younger brother, to the infamous baby scene, this is all about religion. The story has a lot of complexity towards it, the dramatic scenes are worth every second, and when you think you're ready to leave, you are gonna sit back down and say, ""What unique ideas."" The riots, while they go on for a long time, symbolize what happens when the garden of Eden is destroyed. Mother Nature is our guardian, and we must keep her safe. And the way they portray God as the villain of the story makes me beg for it to be longer.<br/><br/>The acting? Need we speak of the acting? BUT OF COURSE!!! This has to be Bardem's best role since Anton Chigurh. He delivered so much to the film. He understood what he was doing, and he believed that he was helping Mother Nature. And Jennifer Lawrence, please tell me you'll bring this kind of emotion to all your films. Because in here, honey, I felt your pain. I cried with you. I was mad with you. The people destroyed the house you build. So when all else failed, you burnt it down. And like God himself, Bardem took your heart and rebuild his fort so that everything could start over. I never seen a movie that wasn't trying to be mature and amazing be exactly that. Maybe if you are atheist or don't read much of the Bible, you definitely won't get this movie. However, I give props to Darren for using the story of the Bible to convey the horrors of religion and reality. Before you diss it, before you hate it, pick up a bible and relate to it. That way, we all can enjoy the film."

","Darren Aronofsky has made quite a name for himself as a director, producer and writer. While he's struck oil a few times in his career ('Requiem for a Dream,' 'Black Swan'), he's also had his share of disappointments ('Noah,' 'The Fountain').<br/><br/>But nothing has prepared us for his 2017 effort 'mother!' - an allegorical tale with more imagery, symbolism and smugness than anything in recent memory. The film is supposed to be commentary on the state of the world and how we humans have destroyed the Earth, and has fairly clear ties to stories from the Bible, which is supposed to make us feel repentant for our actions. Sure, okay, whatever. In reality, 'mother!' is an unintentionally hilarious embarrassment to cinema.<br/><br/>This film is celebrated by some as art, but it's actually trash. Nearly the entire two-hour runtime is dedicated to following Jennifer Lawrence around an old destroyed house that is in a state of disrepair. We either get to see the back of her head or uncomfortably tight close-ups of her face, most of the time with a shocked, disturbed look. The only thing worse is when she says ""Stop! Don't do that! Get down from there!"" two dozen or so times. Javier Bardem does not do much better in the acting department. The only one who brings their A-game is Michelle Pfeiffer, who embraces the destructive nature of the middle-aged woman she portrays as she makes a mockery of the isolated farmhouse.<br/><br/>A key issue with 'mother!' is how it was mis-marketed. The film was supposed to be a psychological thriller, but there are next to no scenes that really fit this description. In fact, a good two-thirds of the movie are unintentionally funny, with Lawrence's wasted talents opening her up to being the butt of the joke. And amid all of the mass hysteria that the film devolves into, we're subjected to one of the most grotesque scenes ever depicted on screen. Again, some will say this is ""cinematic art,"" but it's not. It's a messy, conflated virus.<br/><br/>'mother!' was rightfully rejected by audiences. Hopefully its spectacular combustion is enough to put Aronofsky in his place so that he can go back to making high-quality films."

","Nowadays, how many movies are made that really stimulate the viewer? That they make you think and interpret what you have seen? How many movies these days are true cinematographic experiences? Unfortunately the vast majority of current films are only concerned with ticket receipts, with money, with a return of the budget spent. Because of this mentality, especially in the United States, the space once granted for the creativity and freedom of filmmakers and screenwriters is nowadays increasingly small.<br/><br/>The movie ""mother"" is a great movie experience in virtually every aspect. What is needed is to enjoy and pay attention to the film and not to the popcorn. For most of the time, the photograph is colorless, the shades of the house are what you can expect and as the film becomes more frightening, your look becomes livelier and consequently aggressive. All the discomfort that arises during the process is complemented by the excellent sound effects. That house really has life, it really scares.<br/><br/>The actress Jennifer Lawrence again surprised by the positive, showing once again its versatility. The film prefers to always follow her point of view, rather than the other characters. It is an interpretation that works perfectly within its dynamic with the public. Empathy comes instantly, and after a long time observing its innocence being destroyed, it is very satisfying when the character finally revolts with everything that happens around it, if we take into account its initial calmness and sweetness.<br/><br/>See, review, analyze, interpret, exchange opinions with your friends about the film, because it is a creative and original cinematographic experience. We may not like everything, but it's great to see a movie like this. Because unfortunately today there are so few films to stimulate our imagination."

","Mother! really is one giant metaphor. This film is so shocking and at times unbelievable. The trailers really make it seam like it's a scary movie, but really it's not. You could argue that it contains some scary scenes, but ultimately this is a psychological movie. The movie messes with your mind and it makes you think and analyze exactly what it's trying to say. Everything begins with Jennifer Lawrence's character waking up to her husband, Javier Bardem. They are married and living in their house that she is fixing up while he is working on a new book. Pretty soon after that, Ed Harris shows up, he is a man that claims he thought their house was a bed and breakfast and because it's late, they allow him to stay. Then, Michelle Pfeiffer, Harris's wife, shows up and she is now staying also. Lawrence's character really is pretty uncomfortable with this, especially when even more people start to show up. Things start unfolding rapidly as more and more people flood into their house. Part of me doesn't want to reveal too much because I do very much encourage people to go see this movie, it's just so exquisitely done and the metaphorical way that filmmaker Darren Aronofsky does everything is amazing. I will say that there is a definite theme to the movie, I think it's a Biblical theme personally. There seems to be a god and Mother Nature theme to it. You'll see what I'm talking about when you watch it. It could also just be symbolic of a relationship being torn apart by certain people and things that go on throughout the movie. It's ultimately up to each individual to interpret for themselves. This movie is fantastically acted, written and directed. 100% recommended. 10/10 for Mother!"

At first, I was feeling really scared, and in some scenes in first half of the movie, I almost regretted being there. But as soon as I understood that the house is not going to do try to kill everyone, I really started to think about the movie differently. I wanted to understand. And as the plot continued, I started to glimpse a feeling about what the author was meaning to say. And it was the best experience. As I was able to unravel some great mystery, which judging by the other reviews, wasn't meant to be understand by everybody. When the movie ended, I was sitting in my chair absorbing all the feelings. To be honest, it wasn't the easiest movie to watch, but the story ended up locked in my head and I have to think about it, even now, two weeks after I saw it. And let me be honest, the reason why I like it so much is maybe because of the mirror which artist turns to humanity. We need to think more about what we are doing and why. Please go to see it!

I can see why it's not had the best response as it's not a film for the placid or close-minded, quite the contrary actually.<br/><br/>My take is that Aronofsky has tried and succeeded to depict: <br/><br/><ul><li>Human development in a world not intended for them - How religion affects people - The dangers of religion and cults - A huge allegory for life itself and the way the Earth responds to our actions as a race. </li></ul><br/><br/>It is not as simple as many people would like, these are the people who enjoy speedy car chases and shallow love stories- but hey, we're all different!<br/><br/>Overall Mother! is my favourite film of the year, without a doubt (what an awful year it's been anyway). Performances from Lawrence and Bardem were really brilliant and believable with others from Pfeiffer stealing the show. A great film, which still messes with my head and will continue to do so."

","I decided to check this movie out because we got it at my job but I went in thinking this was some horror film and found I was very much mistaken. I would probably call this a thriller or even a psychological one because this got under my skin like no other movie has ever done so! It's creepy and strange but also mysteriously good?<br/><br/>Still, at the moment I can't really say much more about the film because I don't get it. On the surface there's people who destroy Mother's (apparently that's her name) home and after some time she just can't take it anymore, even when her husband preaches about forgiving people. But on another level, there's some symbolism relating to the bible and the Earth/world going on that I think ended up being too vague for general audiences, which is the majority of people who watch movies<br/><br/>I think this would be perfect for a school essay where one gets some clues about what the movie is about, and I would only recommend this movie to someone who has done a bit of research on the symbolism of the movie or someone who is open minded about reading between the lines"
"rileyspritchett","9","1","6","24 September 2017"," A movie that is more than a movie, and less of itself if you define it.
","mother! is the movie that our generation needed. Unlike most movies that have come out recently in an era of havoc and lost communication, this Aronofsky film collects all the barriers and bridges and walls that has been built by humanity (and even film) and burns it down with such an explosive film. Explosive even though it's only in the confines of a home. The brilliancy and sheer madness that is mother! is everything that our generation, and honestly ever generation needs. From the start, the audience is thrown into a fast paced environment that leaves you at almost every second asking the person next to you what happened as the next surprise is thrown at you. All you need to know about this movie is that it's about a husband (Bardem) and his partner (Lawrence) being put through tests and mind games as their home opens up for two unexpected guests (Harris and Phfeiffer). One small incident leads to utter chaos as a ripple effect happens in the span of seconds. And that is all you need to know. The issue before watching this film is the information you have beforehand. If you go in with the expectations that people give you after the movie, there's a possibility the movie will be ruined for you. If you go in the movie expecting a normal invasion kind of a movie it can benefit or ruin your experience. This is a film that deserves to be appreciated but can't be when the reactions are labeling the film as ""pretentious"" and ""meaningless"". Close minded people will not understand this movie unlike the directors past works such as Black Swan or Requiem For A Dream (two amazing films). This movie is filled with symbolism and truly brain throbbing moments that take not the wisest minds, but an attempt to understand. When I finished the movie, the people behind me said ""I don't get it?"" Many reviews miss the point of the movie or they understand it and try to warp what it is. With a film that has almost no score, very limited camera angles and a very A-List main cast, we already have the ingredients to make a winner. In this film, every angle, prop, and line means something. The first Act almost is comedic with an outlandish and almost joking sort of matter that makes you want to scream along with the mother character. In the second Act, we are thrown into the deep water that the movie is without a float. We are drowning with no air and no bottom to sink to. Its a struggle that also feels endless. The first thirty minutes of the film feel like the last act and its not a curse either. You are never knowing when the film is ending and never knowing what is truly going on and you know there is something about to happen. And when the thing happens and you come to the realization of what this movie actually is... it's too late. The world is twisting in misery and utter wildness that you wish you could control but there is no way to. mother! has many questions. What does the title mean? Who are the characters? What are the intentions? Every question you have has an answer, but you have to piece them together. Some questions haven't been answered but they are there. The more you glue the pieces instead of fitting them in, the more you won't understand. To describe this movie in ten words would almost be impossible. The movie is its own living organism that you can't describe in its span. Its a film that is too graphic and extreme to win a mainstream award and too controversial to be loved by the masses. Gutwretching and awful torture and awkward situations to dream like feelings and indescribable nostalgia along with several scenes that make you question the reality of the movie, is how we come to our senses with this film. It wont be an enjoyable ride that you will feel clean and happy afterwards, but it's a film we all need to watch regardless. A tedious and repetitively vile yet beautiful movie we all should suffer. Suffer, one word out of ten to describe this movie."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","6","23 September 2017"," Not what I expected going in, but what a ride
","Quite a lot has been said about Mother!, but what's most clear after seeing the film is that it knows exactly the type of film it is and what it's trying to say. People can say they're confused but dig a little deeper and the answer is there. So the question shouldn't be whether the film has specific themes in mind. It does, no doubt. The question should instead be whether the execution of those themes was successful. In my opinion, it is. Do I think it was a flawless film? I mean, obviously not. But at the same time I struggle to think of anything it did significantly wrong. The progression of slower- paced atmospheric thriller to full-blown horror insanity is very well done. The camera-work in the way its captures the singular perspective of the lead character is incredibly impressive, and the film continues to build its mystery throughout. It can get a bit repetitive, and I do think it could have been trimmed by about 15 minutes, but the film works spectacularly as a guessing game and then, once you've guessed it, works even better on a thematic and metaphorical level. The performances are splendid and fearless, with Lawrence showing all of us again why she became such a star in the first place, and the directing powerful. The screenplay very much works on a surface level, even if it isn't anything that is incredible, because everything it's representing is supposed to be under the surface (well, up until it's very much in your face about it). If there's one glaring flaw it is that the film's final minutes make everything incredibly clear and hammer the point home, but perhaps that's best for certain audiences. Overall, destined to be one of the most memorable films of the year and certainly another great horror film in a year already filled with them."

As if. <br/><br/>I went along with this one for the first two acts. Getting more extreme, but still in the frame. interesting and pointed. For me, the violent third act is a polariser, you either love it or hate it. I hated it. In the moment of watching, I couldn't grasp the full sense of it, and it seemed to undo a lot of the good work that had come before. <br/><br/>Good to see Lawrence going for new levels. Bardem as the blocked writer just seems to cruise, a less sinister version of his No Country dude. The previous reviewer here makes a useful comparison to Bunuel's teasing sleights of hand.

"DanielD_95","7","1","6","20 September 2017"," Overwhelming and Poignant
","Firstly, this film is not for the feint of heart. With its religious under tones and stern/bold imagery, this is the type of film that follows you for a while after. <br/><br/>I've noticed a lot of heat and people bashing this film, so if you are interested in a more open minded spoiler free review, look no further. I can agree the film was marketed quite poorly. It was presented to be that of a thriller/horror mystery about some backwoods cult like family, with action at every turn. Do not go in expecting this.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the acting was superb, especially Jennifer Lawrence, whom I am usually not a fan of. It is the first time, I truly felt her emotion bleed through in a performance. Of Javier Bardem shines through as usual. I loved the direction of this film along with the set and atmosphere. It really gave the impression, that the viewer was a part of the story.<br/><br/>I can see why the division between viewers regarding the actual story itself. This will not be a movie for everyone. It is not your typical thriller/horror/drama movie. I've see a lot of people calling it contrived and self-indulgent for Aronofsky, but that in a sense was the message of the movie. You are supposed to be comparing the hierarchies and rough personalities between the characters, which some may come off that way. My biggest advice to any potential movie goer is, not to look too deep for the message, it is quite blatant, and once you understand the meaning behind everything, you can properly enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed it. It had a very stern but important message. Avoid the criticism, and go. The last 20 minutes is very strenuous but the pay off it worth it."
"Skaigear","7","1","6","17 September 2017"," A very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that
","Mother! is a psychological horror film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie is about a married couple living in a secluded country home being visited by strangers with the husband welcoming them in with open arms, much to the chagrins of his wife. The film has similarities with another movie of Aronofsky's, Black Swan, in that both are told through psychologically worn out female protagonists' eyes, forcing the audience to walk in her shoes and question their own sanity as the madness unfolds. Mother! has been extremely divisive since its release due to its controversial allegory and graphic content. To be honest, the popular interpretation of the metaphor did not even cross my mind once when I was watching, instead I took the movie for face value and it still had me enthralled, uneased and disturbed throughout. I believe if you go in to the movie having read about the supposed metaphor, it would greatly bias your opinion and affect your viewing experience, for that reason, I am going to review Mother! as a pure horror film to 1) avoid spoilers and 2) be objective.<br/><br/>Mother! is very gorgeous-looking and wonderfully-acted. The film might be slow to some, but it is never boring as the situation is always building towards something keeping you captivated. It is a very strange and surreal film told through Jennifer Lawrence's eyes. We do not know much about her except she is married to Javier Bardem's older character, but as the film establishes early on, Lawrence is possibly the sanest thing in the film. The camera literally follows her everywhere in the house, which we never get to leave, creating a sense of dread and claustrophobia. The first half of the film has mostly psychological horror, with Lawrence having to deal with unruly guests with unpredictable behaviors and her slowly deranged husband. I was intrigued at frame one and found myself gripping on my seat whenever Lawrence is in confrontation with anybody, even if it is somebody that logically should pose no real danger, but the film causes you great doubt regardless. The second half contains most of the controversial visceral horror, and detailing anything therein would constitute as a spoiler so I am just going to say: viewers discretion is advised. It gets really insane and crazy to a point where you will just be dying to know how it ends.<br/><br/>Technically the film is excellent. The cinematography brings the creepy house to life and the sound design is harrowing. The film captures the fear of being alone in your own house but not knowing if you are truly alone very well. Jennifer Lawrence gives the best performance I have ever seen of her yet; she touched the notes of vulnerability and weakness, loving, reluctance and then finally anger and contempt. Since she gets close to 100 percent screen time, any sort of hiccups or off- night would have put the film in jeopardy, but she brought it every second. Javier Bardem as the husband was wonderful as always, performing like the world-class actor he is.<br/><br/>There are some negative though, namely some pacing issues, particularly it being a little too long and dragging towards the middle, repeating certain situations over and over again. I just want to wrap my arm around the director's shoulders and tell him, ""I get it buddy, the guests are rude, and she's vexed, now can we just move on?"" The whole thing should have been shaven down to a leaner 90 minutes, which would have been sufficient to tell this story. Also a lot of weird things happen unexplained and never expound upon. I guess this feeds into the film's interpretational and allegorical approach, but also kind of lazy as it theoretically gives Darren Aronofsky the right to just throw in any bizarre content in the cauldron he can conjure and not have to worry about explaining it.<br/><br/>Mother! is a very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that. When you start to unravel the film and break it down, that is when objectivity usually gets thrown out the window in favor of own personal beliefs. Even if the metaphors are what Aronofsky intended, within the film itself it was never stated as canon, so everything is still just an interpretation and what is most important is what you choose to see the movie as. As a superficial psychological horror flick, it worked because it was scary, disturbing and jaw-dropping like a genre film should be."

","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>This is the sort of film that will not resonate well with general audiences. It's a major allegory. There is a great deal of symbolism and some shocking scenes.<br/><br/>It's disheveled, bizarre, heavily message-laden, and at times unbearably cruel. Simply put, it's crazier than a bag full of wet feral cats.<br/><br/>If you're easily offended or dislike the type of material I described , I suggest you remove the lug wrench from your posterior orifice and go watch ""My Little Pony"" instead. <br/><br/>There's a husband, he's an aloof, day-dreaming, revered poet struggling with writer's block. He has a certain disconnection from his wife. His wife is younger, beautiful, creative and capable. She's nurturing and attentive. The couple live alone in a large, lovely country estate. The house had previously been destroyed by fire and mother is working very hard to restore the home. Curiosities abound as she does home repairs. She wants to reconnect with her husband, see his writing succeed, and have a child.<br/><br/>A traveling man mistakes the home for a B&B, but mother's husband openly welcomes the guest. It turns out that he didn't make a mistake. The man (Adam) was dying and he desperately wanted to meet his idol, the poet. The man complains of abdominal pain (rib) and the next day his wife arrives (Eve). <br/><br/>The man's wife (Eve) is obnoxious and meddling. She accidentally breaks the one item in the home that she was told not to touch: a crystal-like stone that the husband recovered from the ashes of his home (the Apple of knowledge/free will). The husband is devastated by this and furious for a while, yet he continues to host his guests. <br/><br/>The couple is later visited by their quarreling sons. They are fighting over their father's inheritance (old testament, Cain and Abel). One son kills the other in the home, but mother is unable to remove the bloodstain. It will not vanish (evil/violence), it has permeated the wooden floor.<br/><br/>Mother and husband argue yet end up having intercourse. The moment she awakes she ridiculously announces that she's pregnant. They are both overjoyed and the husband is suddenly inspired to write the most remarkable poem ever written. It's soon published for the world to read.<br/><br/>The last two-thirds of mother! is insensible and difficult to watch at times. Mother is heavily pregnant and heart-breakingly helpless to stop the flood of intruders who have come to praise or show their repulsion with the husband/poet. Hell breaks loose. Mother is unable to restore order and protect her beloved home. Her husband seems oblivious. There's total chaos as the house is overrun by reckless people from all walks of life. <br/><br/>The peaceful, beautiful house that was lovingly restored by mother is in shambles. The house had once lived and breathed, as though the house and mother were one entity. <br/><br/>Her husband nonchalantly forgives the destructive trespassers and revels in their worship of him instead. He was mesmerized by his ""fans"" admiration and praise and ignored their terribly rotten behavior. He could have stopped the madness but chose to ignore it instead. <br/><br/>mother! is certainly not for everyone. Director Aronofsky plainly said in an interview that he doesn't care whether viewers love it or hate it, he's just pleased that viewers have strong reactions. <br/><br/>Reviewers who claim that the film was written in just 5 days are mistaken. Only the first draft was completed in 5 days. It took much longer for the final script to be completed. <br/><br/>It's strongly religious, emulating various biblical figures and events while conveying a critical message about our abuse of our planet/environment. If you do not have a good understanding of the bible/Christianity then you will be hopelessly confused. On the other hand, those with a strong Christian understanding and faith may feel insulted. <br/><br/>I appreciate Aronofsky's bold and brazen vision. I watched the movie a second time and it will be a fine addition to my massive collection. A good film will always leave the viewer with something; it could be a song, a joke, paranoia, arousal, curiosity, anger or introspection. The latter two can be attributed to mother! It will make you think. <br/><br/>*** For those of you wondering what the yellow powder mother consumes is...it is POLLEN. Mother obviously represents Mother Nature. She stays indoors at all times though, never outdoors. Pollen is flora seeds, they're critical to the reproduction of living things. When mother woke one morning and proclaimed her pregnancy, she threw away the pollen."

","This is a truly unique film, or I might say experience. First of all let me star by saying that it is a movie that requires you to be ready, both intellectually and physically speaking. I would recommend people to be informed in the subject and the allegories and symbolisms to be able to really understand and appreciate what this is about. It is like going to a gallery or a museum, the more information you have on the artist and the piece, the more you'll be able to enjoy the art work. Is difficult to talk about this movie without giving too much away, but let me just say, it is a story about us all, about the imprint of humankind on our planet and about our relationship with it. It's hard to watch, not only because of some of the graphic and more violent scenes but because we can see the parallels with our History and that makes us uncomfortable. there is nothing comfortable or pleasant about watching this film, but I think that's what art should be about. It should make us question things, it should initiate conversations, dialogue... This one will stay with you for a while..."

It's nothing like anything Hollywood has put out in the last... well, have they ever done this? I won't say anything about the plot; all I will say is that if you're expecting a home invasion horror film... denied! This is a singular artistic vision from Darren Aronofsky, boasting dazzling close-up based cinematography, incredible acting (Though Javier Bardem's character felt a bit underwritten and wasn't the best use of his talents), thought- provoking themes and utterly bonkers storytelling throughout. I won't lie; it's often tedious, highly self-indulgent, completely ridiculous and not always massively enjoyable. But do you know what? That's fine. I quite like Mother. It's an intelligent, sometimes powerful and clever (To some extent) allegory, although the limited nature of its narrative would make a second viewing somewhat unappealing. It might not be enjoyable, but it is certainly very well-made and I think that if you go in knowing what to expect, you'll be able to appreciate this more. It's got enough visual dazzle and Jennifer Lawrence's usual awesomeness to keep the film afloat. It's also got one of the most messed-up scenes in any recent mainstream American movie... so there's that. <br/><br/>6/10"

","""Mother!"" is the allegorical film that is very intriguing and fascinating, it is clear that views on it is very controversial and some claim it is a pretentious work while others view at as a very powerful art-house film. No matter which side you are on it cannot be denied that ""Mother!"" is a film that makes you think, the fact that there are so many interpretations of the film alone is a brilliant example of this. Because of this I think that ""Mother!"" is indeed a masterpiece. The whole film complete with brilliant acting and an intriguing tone just really drew me in. The use of sound adds so much suspense and intrigue to the mysterious tone of the film that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>There are many interpretations of ""Mother!"", the allusions to modern day pop culture and celebrity fandom, biblical allusions to the Genesis, to the Exodus. All of which are very valid interpretations of the film perhaps because they are all correct and all play a part in the story. To me I strongly felt that this must be an allusion to Genesis, with the characters that liken Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel being very clear in the movie. But I am sure that you have read these discussions elsewhere so I will not go into it.<br/><br/>What I really like about this film is contrary to usual biblical interpretations we take the point of view of a very interesting character, one who represents mother Earth, played by Jennifer Lawrence. The film's decision to put 'god' in marriage to 'Earth' is such a brilliant and interesting idea. And brings a whole new perspective, ""Mother!"" presents the Earth's point of view. It shows us our selfishness as human beings trespassing Earth and destroying all the this figure has built. In some ways it's a cautionary tale and that one particular scene towards the end of the film when a group of people punch and trample mother is such a powerful imagery that represents our own disregard and trampling of Earth as human beings. <br/><br/>So what is so great in my opinion is that the film takes a biblical story but adds a sense of nuance to the film by having this new perspective that is so much more important and relevant in today's modern society. It's a modern retelling of a classic biblical tale. At the end of the film we also realize that there is a loop and that following the events leading to an explosion the film reverts to the beginning with a different woman than the 'mother ' character. Along with the peculiar exclamation mark at the end of the title this film is screaming at its audience to learn from these stories, to learn from past mistakes and to understand the importance of maintaining a balance in this world that we live in. A great message that I picked up when watching Mother! And to me, I don't think Mother! Is trying to be pretentious at all."
"jdrubnitz","8","1","7","3 October 2017"," No, it's not like Rosemary's Baby At All. That's the point.
","*Spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>I'm seeing a lot of people say that this film is a rip-off of Rosemary's Baby.<br/><br/>They couldn't be more wrong. However, any similarities or allusions are clearly there to point out stark polar opposites.<br/><br/>In Rosemary's Baby, she is raped by an other world demon and MAYBE her husband. A depiction of physical rape. <br/><br/>In Mother! she is ""raped"" by her own husband taking her love for granted. She is also ""raped"" by the consequences of her own passive aggression. A depiction of emotional rape. <br/><br/>In Rosemary's Baby, she is impregnated with the spawn of Satan.<br/><br/>In Mother! she is essentially impregnated with a child of ""God"", given the clear contextual metaphor of Cain and Abel. <br/><br/>In Rosemary's Baby, the baby is destined to be a sacrifice.<br/><br/>In Mother! The baby is laid on the altar as a response to its demise and accidental death. This is CLEAR because the entire crowd in the house gasps in shock when the infant is killed. Intentions evolve as the father surrenders his will to the people by handing over his son. <br/><br/>In Rosemary's Baby, the husband doesn't have mommy issues. In Mother! the husband definitely has mommy issues, which is the reason he does everything he does.<br/><br/>He craves love and gives none in return. He is willing to compromise his own lifeblood if he knows it will make people happy. While he doesn't intend to sacrifice the infant, he doesn't take danger into account because of his unhealthy lust for approval. <br/><br/>Multiple times, the cinematographic work emphasizes the sincere momentary grief the husband has when his own child and wife are harmed. This is much different than the idea that he intentionally harmed either one of them from the beginning (which would be more along the lines of Rosemary's Baby)<br/><br/>See? It's polar opposites. <br/><br/>The metaphors are not convoluted. They all aid in expressing an inverse universe of Rosemary's Baby, and the writer did a great job of drawing out motivations as to how it all happens."

","""You're probably not going to like it."" ""I really don't know what to think of it, just warning you."" ""It's a lot, it's probably not for you."" I've been hearing a lot of these kinds of comments from friends who were lucky enough (or unlucky enough) to see Mother! the latest waking nightmare bursting forth from the mind of Darren Aronofsky. Meanwhile professional critics have been comparing Mother! to The Fountain (2006), arguably the director's most ambitious movie until now and a film that I found to be one of the most ill-conceived, malignant stains in the history of film. I was not looking forward to this one. I really wasn't.<br/><br/>So the fact that I enjoyed and may have even loved Mother! is a bit of a surprise for all of us. There's no denying this movie is bold, this movie is audacious, this movie is thick with literary allusions, biblical symbolism, belabored metaphors, messy excesses and disturbing imagery. There's also no denying that at a rumored $33 million budget and distribution being handled by Paramount, Mother! may just be the most radical ""mainstream"" movie to come out since 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).<br/><br/>Mother! sells itself as a horror movie about a couple (Lawrence and Bardem) whose tranquil existence begins to fall apart with the arrival of uninvited guests. Basically Rosemary's Baby (1968) meets Funny Games (1997) for the millennial generation. What it actually is is a loosely braced story where the initial setup is exploited via dream logic to create a sustained sense of bleakness. When I say this movie is a waking nightmare, I mean it! Starting with a slight feeling of unease, isolation and exclusion and blossoming into full blown despair by the time the third act explodes on the scene. And because the film is told entirely and oppressively from Jennifer Lawrence's near helpless perspective you just can't escape the doom and gloom that follows.<br/><br/>Aronofsky revisists many of the same themes he has always dabbled in since Pi (1998) but started to investigate in earnest during the production of The Fountain. Yet unlike that film, which tried to marry the emotional with the metaphysical, Mother! is opting for full-scale emotional filmmaking mounted like an old-school creation/destruction myth. It's unruly and grandiose, sure but Matthew Libatique's moody cinematography which lives and dies off of POV's, extreme close-ups and 360 shots means we're always in the moment. This isn't shadow play where the film's modus operandi hangs over the frame like a thesis over a dry dissertation. This is an emotional screed, a provocation, a full-frontal attack. <br/><br/>And what exactly is this film attacking? The fragility of the male ego perhaps – our husband after all is an infinitely adulated writer who at times seems more scared of being left alone than the hell that is other people. The film can also be seen as an effrontery of modern religion as it starts with allusions to Genesis then rushes into Revelations taking just enough time to turn the other cheek with shards of glass - populist politics, false prophets, humanities penchant for burning the candle at both ends Whatever you think this film is ultimately about, most will walk out with the same feeling that they need to take a long hard look in the mirror and maybe take a shower.<br/><br/>The film is not without its faults. The screenplay was written in a flash of inspiration over a five day period. And boy does it show with a lot of confusing narrative threads and shallow, dry characters that are function only. Thankfully Bardem, Pfeiffer and Harris are all up for the challenge of making their characters more than the stuff of fables. Lawrence while certainly trying harder than the rest can't help but feel more like an exposed nerve. Of course that may be the point but I couldn't help but wonder if the movie's big idea might be better serviced by an actual, you know, character. I don't know about Aronofsky's mother but mine wouldn't stand for this film's going-ons even in a fugue state.<br/><br/>Those not inclined to watch the blended state of mind of a good David Lynch film, a bad Lars von Trier film and the Facebook newsfeed of a paranoid nihilist must take heed. Do not watch this movie unless you want to spend the next two days peering out the blinds in contempt and suspicion. Yet for those on its wavelength, Mother! puts on the screen a brave, timely, primal and baffling composite of passion and despair. I wouldn't go so far as to claim that it represents humanity in microcosm but sometimes I wonder if we're not far off from it."

It's like if Darren took all the drugs he showcased in his classic ""Requiem for a Dream"" while writing and directing ""Mother!""' OK, maybe it's not that crazy; wait, it is that crazy. Love it or hate it, the main tagline for this movie's ads are correct; there is no other movie like it, which it does not necessarily mean it's a good thing. This is the no-name defense I mean movie. There are no character names in the movie. ""Mother!"" stars Jennifer Lawrence as Mother. She is married to Him, as in Javier Bardem's character. Him and Mother live in a countryside solitary two story house. Him is a poet; Mother is a housewife; still with me? Him is like twenty years older than Mother; that sounds strange. Him and Mother start getting visits from zany strangers; primarily in particular a dying man named Man; but of course; and his rude wife named (you guessed it) Woman. Man and Woman are played by Ed Harris and Michele Pfeiffer. Then all of a sudden, ""Mother!"" goes into rapid fire ""cray cray"" mode with more strangers visiting Mother and Him. Listen, I do credit Aronofsky in his daring direction, but this was waaaay too much. It just gets bombarded and overflown with ludicrous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence, whose character gets quite a beating, was strong as Mother. And Michele Pfeiffer is always quite the Woman, and she acted the part also quite right as Woman. Bardem and Harris were modest, but I think they were outshined by their female counterparts. I do recommend quite a motherload of alcoholic beverages before experiencing ""Mother!""; to say the least. *** Average"
"robin-duns","5","1","7","15 September 2017"," Interesting, but heavy handed
","Mother! is a thematically and symbolically heavy movie. A certain kind of film student might love it for the way it explores a number of key themes, and its use of symbolism. The range of themes and anxieties here include:<br/><br/><ul><li>Oppressive husbands/families. - Artists who use consume their partners or muses. - Societal expectations re motherhood, childbearing, and domesticity. - The pressure to build a home, stay in it, and produce babies -all for others. - Fear of domestic failure – fear of building a broken home, and fear of miscarriage.</li></ul><br/><br/>Mother! is also about the cyclic trauma of motherhood – or at least of a kind of motherhood, where the self is given up for others. It is unclear who is really at fault here – is it husbands, society, families, or all of these who are to blame for sapping the life force from the young mother. All are seemingly targeted, as they close in on JL with increasing acts of oppression and degradation.<br/><br/>These are interesting themes, and some of the symbolism here is also interesting. The problem with Mother! is that it pushes these themes and symbols with a heavy, repetitive hand.<br/><br/>For me the central theme, or at least the most interesting, was the idea of the horror of the domestic space, and the idea of house as monster.<br/><br/>'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence) is trying to build a nice home. Throughout the film, though, the house represents different negative forces – constraint, isolation, a traumatic past, and the inward- pushing pressures of society. There is a sense that if only Mother could escape the house, or destroy the house, she would be free from her turmoil. The walls are large, dark and oppressive. They are coated in paints of dissonant greys. When Mother leans too close to them, the manifestation of her anxiety and fear – her straining, burning heart – appears. Whether the walls are functioning here as a reminder of a past trauma, or whether it is the walls themselves that are the present trauma (i.e. domestic encasement), the house is definitely a source of horror. She drinks a colourful concoction to try to manage her heartburn, but it is futile, as her problems run deeper. Throughout Mother!, there are many monstrous figures (including her husband, played by Harvier Bardem) but the house is the central monster.<br/><br/>These are interesting and scary ideas. At times they worked well, but ultimately they were just pushed a little too hard, and for too long.<br/><br/>There are times when Mother! is more subtle and successful. Unfortunately these are pretty rare, and only really in the opening thirty minutes. Still, they're worth praising. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is effective in its ineffectualness. Her voice is not just soft – it is weak, and embedded with an emotional vulnerability that reminds of the feeling of helplessness experienced in a nightmare. The way her verbal attempts to assert herself in the home (""I'll take these glasses"", ""I'll paint this wall"", and ultimately, ""I'll have this baby"") are denied are subtle and effective. Bardem's character ""politely"" rejects and supersedes her will – in a stronger, deeper voice: ""No I'll take those glasses"", ""We aren't having children,"" etc. It is appropriate that the dismissal of Mother's will is casual, and under the veil of social politeness. Bardem's offences here are slight, and they are surface-social, but for Mother they are consistent acts of dismissal and oppression. The fact that they come in the form of social or domestic duties reinforces that she is being suffocated not be real monsters or violence, but by her small, domestic life. The larger story of the first act, that Mother has decided to rebuild someone else's home as (or instead of) her own, is also an interesting story of subservience and forfeit in an unbalanced relationship. These elements work because they are grounded in a real story, and the symbolic elements work subtly to support that story.<br/><br/>Where things go wrong is in act two and three, when these ideas are hammered home too hard. What was subtle and interesting becomes prominent and heavy-handed. Symbolism is no longer a supporting player, but appears front and center to these themes home. Not new themes – the same themes we'd already been given in a more effective form. We already feel that the home she is building is somehow off, and a representation of her encasement. We are then given scenes of the walls crumbing down on her, her heart shriveling up under this pressure, images of a house burning to ash, and old wounds re- opening and bleeding into the home. These images feel like they're crafted by a first-year Cinema Studies student, who has just read ""Psychoanalysis and Cinema!"" and written their first script. Where Lawrence's meek voice and casual dismissal was so effective in act one, in act two she is outright ignored. The function of this seems to be only to make the point already made (she is being oppressed by the social forces pressing in on her), but in a more obvious way, and with a less relevant perpetrator. In act one it was her husband ignoring her requests in an eerily familiar, realistic way. In acts two and three it is strangers intruding uninvited into rooms, or jumping on unbraced sinks despite Mother's instructions. These moments rings less true, and feel just like a redundant, less competent depiction of the same idea.<br/><br/>Mother! explores important real-world issues, but comparisons with Aronofsky's earlier films, and with other recent explorations of similar topics, reveals the problems with his method here. The issues are real, but the movie devolves into frustrating, repetitive symbolism."

","Darren Aronofsky's Mother! is a true cinematic masterpiece. Let's start from the basics: The movie's character is mainly symbolic which means that by itself it might not make a lot of sense but once you understand what the movie is trying to tell you will start loving it. I am not going to tell, you how I interpreted because I don't want to spoil anything but its secret meaning is very obvious if you ask me. The actors give great performances and you literally feel the emotions of 'her' as the movie goes on. For me Mother! was an amazing experience not only because I was mostly living and not just watching the movie but also because the movie stayed with me long after its end and its horrific but beautiful messages still torture my mind. I understand people who say that the movie was bad I can admit that it is not easy to watch due to some gruesome imagery and its chaotic atmosphere but if your heart is strong enough you will absolutely love it like I did!"

","Arnofsky has outdone himself again in mother!. The bible allegories and mother earth concept etc gives the film a lot of depth, however, it was the film's atmosphere from the beginning to end that made it so engaging. From the first shot itself, a sense of dread was created which kept on for the whole runtime. Along with the minimal background score and the impeccable sound effects, Arnofsky's catharsis of a film is one of the greatest experience I got this year."

","I must start saying that never seen the trailer or was interested in this movie. I really don't like JL as actress but I feel grateful to have seen this movie. Mother! is a movie who can overwhelm you, start with this couple you don't know who they are or where they are, but step by step you could relate with any of them. She is home and he is he. He is a writer who can't write because of lack of inspiration. She supports him in every way she could, she covers her own needs with work. One day a bunch of strangers arrive to their home and things go wrong. After that everything goes in a madly spiral of metaphors and symbolisms and every person would read it in their own ways. This movie applies for everything in life, for the people who still dream and have the sparkle of life in them, for the creators, the artist, the egocentrics, for the mothers, people who loves too much (and give everything of them) and people who only love their self, and the list goes and goes. Nothing is enough and never will be. I cried, I almost scream, I feel so attached to her, it a was a hurricane of emotions. At the end I laugh so hard that some persons in the cinema look at me like a mad. Some people just get out of the theater, it is not for everybody. You can interpret this movie in thousands of ways and that's really beautiful overall in this times."
"earlandbonnie","9","1","8","3 October 2017"," God screws up.
","spoilers likely<br/><br/>Every once in a while, you need a movie like mother! The troubling beauty of mother! is its challenge to all the religions of the West. It turns the imagery of ancient scripture into a weapon against God. In the film, this desire of God to be worshiped is a clear sign that (He) is not perfectly self-satisfied. (He) loves us, yes, and needs us. In the movie, God's need for adulation leads to the destruction of (His) creation—that is, Mother Nature. mother! is like the book of Job—it questions the righteousness of God. And it is like the book of Revelation— it offers to reveal the future— in this case a horrible vision. mother! shows the hell that is waiting for us right here on earth—all of us, not just the bad guys— if we continue to the end of the path we are following. The movie casts much blame for this approaching catastrophe on the neediness of an excessively understanding and charismatic God. The film presents a vision of the end of humankind, but it fails, I hope, to convincingly lay blame on the goodness of God. More likely the end will come from a much more familiar demon. Imagine another movie in which God has retreated to the place where (He) glowers in silence, while the rowdy spirit generated by great piles of money devastates humanity—that humanity which is, in some ways, the pinnacle of (His) creation. But God is eternal, and as the movie suggests— there's always next time."

"maurice_yacowar","9","1","8","26 September 2017"," Allegoric clash between male and female creative principles, played as horror
","The exclamation mark reads several ways. Of course it's a celebration — of the maternal, the feminine, an exultation.<br/><br/>It also makes the title a call for help, a summons/prayer to the Eternal Feminine to restore our lost humanity. <br/><br/>It's our rededication to Mother Earth, which The Woman here rebuilds as her husband's house, a cold dark stuffy — masculine — mansion feminized by the bleeding vaginal wound on the floor and the uterine tunnel discovered under the basement. The man moves through the rooms unawares — it's his empire so he ignores it. The woman feels its pulse, shares an organic connection to it, sees life-forms flushed down aborted or throbbing in the material walls. <br/><br/>When both women from their bed initially call their absent lover with ""Baby?"" the romantic and submissive briefly supplant the woman's fertility and power, her creative as well as mythic force. <br/><br/>It's also a reassertion of the dominance of the feminine character, as in the two leads' exchange over the newborn baby. His ""I am his father"" is trumped by her ""I am his mother."" But she loses when he exploits her momentary loss of consciousness. His vanity and hunger for power proves catastrophic.<br/><br/>However else it's read, this film is about the clash of the male and female creative principles. It claims the impropriety and destructiveness of the male's advantage. The man exults in the woman's pregnancy until he swells with arrogance and vanity from the eruption of his new poem and its extraordinary public reception. His vanity destroys their world, as his egotism destroys each successive muse, each lover, when he plucks from her gut her crystalline love. <br/><br/>The madness of the mob is a contemporary image of the destructiveness that results from serving the male authority, whether in politics, art or mythology, from serving the macho strut over the nurturing maternal. Xavier Bardem is perfectly cast as a macho poet of both literary and sexual impotence. His resurgence into power makes his strength an even greater weakness that costs him his world. <br/><br/>Of course there are other themes, like the biblical history. Ot opens with the first visitors, an echo of he Jewish Edenic beginning. The central couple proceeds to a Catholic pseudo- Jesus birth and communion. These echoes of dominant faiths conclude in the nihilistic anarchic end. Horror movies are always a kind of religious experience, summoning the fear of the supernatural if not our supportive faith in it.<br/><br/>It's also about the nature, power and dangerous temptations of art. The artist here is a poet because that's the oldest of the arts, its timelessness validating this poet's unlikely rock star — and even saviour's — reception. Patti Smith provides the perfect poetic coda with The End of the World, combining the personal with the global.<br/><br/>This film is arguably unique because it makes no effort to be about people so much as about the universalized human condition. That makes it an allegory more than a story of psychological realism. <br/><br/>Nobody has a name here. The end credits identify the mother, the man, the woman, the first two sons, and so on down through the supporting cast: the whisperer, the defiler, the zealot, etc. Bardem is set apart as Him, capitalized as if The god or the creative force in more secular terms, e.g., art. <br/><br/>He is also the film's primary subject of anatomy. It opens and closes on the woman (du jour), his new muse, beloved, who will rebuild his world, offer him the chance to have a son, and finally be sacrificed and replaced because he can't suffer or allow her superior power. That's the male world Aronofsky here challenges more cosmically than in Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan and Noah. Suddenly this is a very impressive canon. <br/><br/>Now Darren Aronosky is a major auteur!"
"jboothmillard","6","1","8","23 September 2017"," Mother!
","I saw the trailer for this scary movie, I didn't really know what to make of it, but being directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan, Jackie), and critics saying ""you'll never forget where you were first time you saw it"", I hoped for something interesting. Basically the film begins with a woman burning to death, a man placing a large crystal in a pedestal, the burned house slowly changes into a newly renovated house, and a woman lying in a bed forms. The unnamed woman, known only as Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the house with her husband, Him (Javier Bardem), he is acclaimed poet suffering with severe writer's block, his creative issues are causing some friction for their tranquil existence, and Mother is beginning to see strange, unsettling things around the house. One day, a Man (Ed Harris) turns up at the house, asking for a room, Him agrees, Mother reluctantly allows it, during his stay the Man has a severe cough, Him assists him, and covers up a fresh wound that Mother gets a glimpse of. The next day, the Man's wife, Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer), also arrives to stay, Mother is becoming increasingly frustrated by the guests. Him begs her to let them to stay, saying it makes the house feel alive, he explains they are fans of his work, and that the Man is dying, he wanted to meet Him before his death. However the Man and Woman accidentally break and shatter the large crystal, Mother and Him decide to kick them out, but as they prepare to leave, the couple's sons, the Oldest Son (Domhnall Gleeson) and his Younger Brother (Brian Gleeson), arrive and start a fight over the will of their father. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, accidentally kills his brother, seemingly fleeing; Him, the Man, and the Woman take the injured son to get help, Mother is left alone in the house, she becomes more and more paranoid and cleans up the mess, the Oldest Son returns briefly, only to steal the Man's wallet. Him returns, telling Mother that the son died and has been buried, soon dozens of people show up for the wake of the son, more and more people arrive and Mother becomes increasingly uncomfortable with their behaviour. Mother is angry and finally snaps when the plumbing breaks and floods the house, she kicks everyone out, she is angry at Him for letting so many people into the house for his own pleasure and ignoring her, soon the argument decreased and the two have sex. The next morning, Mother announces that she is pregnant, Him is elated, and suddenly inspired to complete the poem he has been working on. Months later, Mother is preparing for the arrival of their child, and Him lets her read his newest piece, she is moved to tears because it is so beautiful. The work is publicised and sells out, Mother plans to celebrate preparing dinner, but a group of fans arrive at the house, she barricades herself in the house, but more and more people arrive, and their behaviour becomes increasingly intolerable. The behaviour of the people devolves into them stealing the couple's belongings as keepsakes, Mother becomes increasingly disoriented going around the house, each room devolving into chaos. Him's publisher, Herald (Kristen Wiig), takes part in the madness, executing many of the fans with point-blank gunshots to the head, military men storm the house and arrive to help Mother, but a cult of devoted fans swarm Him, engaging in rituals. In the insanity, Mother starts going into labour, Him takes her to his study, there she gives birth, the havoc outside subsides, but then he tells Mother that the crowd outside want to see the baby, she refuses and holds her baby tight. Mother falls asleep, and he takes the baby outside to the crowd, she chases after Him, the crowd grab the baby, breaking his neck and mutilate the body, Mother is horrified seeing the mutilated corpse and the crowd eating the flesh. Mother is furious and starts stabbing various crowd members with a shard of broken glass, they then turn on her, stripping and beating her until Him intervenes and stops it. Mother escapes the grasp of the crowd, she makes her way to the cellar, where the furnace oil tank is, despite her husband's pleas, Mother sets the oil on fire, destroying the crowd, the house, and some surrounding garden and trees. Both Him and Mother survive the blaze, Mother is horrifically burned, but Him is unharmed, he asks her for the love she has left for him, she agrees to give it to him, he tears her chest open and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart, it reveals a large crystal, he places this on the pedestal, once again the house changes from a burnt-out husk to a newly renovated house, a new Mother forms in a bed and wakes up. Also starring Jovan Adepo as Cupbearer, Stephen McHattie as Zealot and Laurence Leboeuf as Maiden. Lawrence gives a good performance as the domestic goddess who is thrown into hellish situations, Bardem is alright as the poet husband, and there is good support, especially from Pfeiffer being bitchy. I have to say, this was a proper mindf**k movie, I can't remember the last time I saw something so terrifying, disturbing, claustrophobic and shocking, it messes with your mind so much, it is not easy to explain, it has had mixed reactions, but I personally found it entertaining, being so insane, a most scary and watchable psychological horror. Good!"
"levi-lerner","10","1","8","23 September 2017"," Awesome movie! In line with Pi and The Fountain
","This is not a thriller or a horror movie. If you are going in with these expectations you will hate the movie.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic representation of the relationship between nature, earth, god and humans. Aronofsky gravitates toward two subject in my opinion. Self centered obsessed personalities who miss the big picture and the human condition of misunderstanding the meaning of life while obsessing to define it with religion and God. This movie is the later. Some of the parts could have been delivered in a more subtle way but I think the smack in your face over the line approach was meant to wake us up. Great artistic expression of the frustration. Will definitely see it again to catch all the subtleties. Great to see this side of Aronofsky again."

"tangojazz","4","1","8","17 September 2017"," A somewhat interesting movie about the dangers of ""Drug Addiction.""
","I have seen the Youtube reviews of ""mother!"" which have said that this movie is a metaphorical message about creation, god, Jesus Christ, etc. Really? I DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT ALL! The movie is really about the drug addiction of the lead character(a woman) as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. That's right, drug addiction. Every time Jennifer gets stressed out, she goes into the bathroom, takes some drugs, and then she feels fine. And then she hallucinates. As a matter of fact, the whole movie is just about her hallucinations from her drug abuse.That's all. Javier Bardem, who portrays Jennifer's husband in the movie, although not specifically stated, is probably a drug dealer supplying for their whole area. As a matter of fact, his clients are probably the huge group of people who visit them later in the film. Also, I want to say while the movie was mildly interesting, it was also incredibly boring. The teaser trailer for mother! was a complete lie. Mother! was portrayed as a ""horror"" movie, when as a matter of fact, it was a ""boring"" movie. Finally, about the drugs again. I would really like to know what drugs Jennifer's character was taking. Was it LSD? Was it Peyote? What?"
"lloydbarnes5","2","1","9","23 September 2017"," The film is a metaphor and Hollywood very obviously shows you it's style of metaphor!
","I have long witnessed how Hollywood portrays alternate messages in it's films and these messages usually go over the head of 99% of people because they simply are not looking for metaphors in the latest action or horror or Rom-com. But this movie was all about metaphors - It simply would not make sense if it wasn't a metaphor and this is why it becomes so obvious to the watcher that it must be a metaphor.<br/><br/>One user picked up on all of the religious metaphors. Most people would not pick up on these early on in the film because it had a vague outline of a normal story line. <br/><br/>Not to brag but I picked up on the religious metaphor from the very first scene - the person looking onto the camera, burning in flames - it was none other than Hollywood's golden boy - Mr. S... yes that's right Satan. It was so obvious to me because I have been looking for Hollywood metaphors for so long, it's very typical for Satan to appear in many Hollywood blockbusters - unknown to the average watcher.<br/><br/>The first scene with the husband smiling ""let there be light'' and the home grows from nothing. The husband plays God, then Adam appears at the door, then his other half eve, then Cain and Abel.<br/><br/>Here's something you might not get, the bloodshed left a stain. Now human sacrifice is common in Satan worship, it's the most beloved act to Satan. So that act in a sense summons Satan but he keeps a low profile. At times he is played by Jennifer Lawrence. She is jealous of Adam. ""Is he better?"" (a play on words) God says I'm sorry what? She says ""is he feeling better. Satan was jealous of Adam because he thought he was better and more deserving of God's love and attention.<br/><br/>Humanity then then wreaks havoc upon the world but actually all in the name of the 'poet'. Following God's word. Taking it out of context and following it fanatically. The sacrifice of the baby was Jesus, and this represents all fanatical religion, and also having a dig a Catholicism who 'eat the flesh and drink the blood' of Christ - this confirmed by God who immediately after this says that 'we have to forgive the'.<br/><br/>The only thing you might miss, which is supposed to be subtle- because the metaphors in this film are really NOT subtle, is the role of Satan.<br/><br/>He lives somewhat in the basement and it didn't surprise me when she finally attacks God and goes straight for the basement. Then destroys the world. Of course the obvious metaphor is that JL is ""mother earth"" or mother nature, at some points she looks like a Greek goddess and is called a Goddess by God. But the fact that she went to the place, that opened up after the human blood was spilled- this is turning your back on God.""You're insane!"" - Satan saying to us ""Am I really that bad? Look what these crazy religious people have done in the name of God. I did nothing. It was all God that caused all the trouble in the world.""<br/><br/>There are more stuff - threat of nuclear war, but I can't go on all day. Well I hope this has been informative, please look for other metaphors in Hollywood, especially to do with Mr. S."

Best of all though is Javier Bardem a great actor anyway he delivers something of a tour de force of conflicting energies passing from loving husband and father to evil monster his range is nothing short of starling.

"DJKwa","5","1","9","15 September 2017"," A film defined by binary oppositions, for better yet for worse
","As the end credits rolled for mother!, Darren Aronofsky's latest esoteric cinematic offering, I was torn. On the one hand it takes at least an hour for the film to start getting interesting, and my patience was tested more than once over its protracted two hour running time. Yet on the other hand the film's switch into full blown, boundary pushing craziness in the last half an hour is something that has to be seen to be believed. Whether it's worth trudging through to reach depends on your tolerance for artsy, self-indulgent filmmaking that's intended to frustrate and provoke. What's even more shocking is the knowledge that mother! comes from a major studio, with Paramount staking its brand for a film that's surely going to divide audiences.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence stars as the titular mother, a dutiful housewife to her writer husband (played by Javier Bardem). Living together in their countryside mansion, their peaceful bucolic life is disrupted when a stranger enters their home, setting off a chain of events that quickly spirals out of control. <br/><br/>To describe anymore of the plot would be difficult as the film is steeped in symbolism and metaphors that are not easily unpacked. The film becomes increasingly unhinged and abstract, and it invites a plethora of interpretations but offers no definitive answers. Is it a self-reflective indictment of the vanity of artists? A metaphor for the callousness of humans? Or just a reflection of Aronofsky's anger at the present state of the world? <br/><br/>The oblique narrative will prove frustrating for many, with reactions likely to range from calling it pretentious trash to an artsy masterpiece, and neither would be a wrong assessment. It's a film defined by binary oppositions; it's ugly yet beautiful, frustrating yet exciting, and all undeniable singular in its vision, for better yet for worse.<br/><br/>Some will say that the film will not appeal to mainstream tastes. I don't think that's fair because that implies there's something wrong with the audience and not the film itself. But if the intent of art is to provoke and elicit a response from it's audience then mother! succeeds unequivocally. <br/><br/>It's an angry film, which it harnesses to stir up and provoke viewers. So take the star rating with a grain of salt, as it's reductive of the film's intent. Perhaps the most blunt thing I can say is that while I didn't particularly enjoy my time with mother!, I can't say I regret watching it either."

","You might like it, you might not, but once the credits start rolling, you don't get up of your seat, you stay still, thinking about what you just saw and what it means. Then you get out of the cinema and you still thinking about it. You get home and you keep thinking. Aronofsky offers one of the most controversial movies of the decade. With a weirdly amazing storyline (probably one of the most complex plots ever), mother! can have a lot of meanings and a lot of point of views, but nobody can't deny that this is a masterpiece. Aronofsky took a lot of risks and the best thing about it is that it just made the film better. It's not necessary to clarify that the cast made an amazing job, but I'm in the need of saying that Jennifer Lawrence gave her best performance to date with this film, you have never seen her like this before and probably you won't see her in this facet again.<br/><br/>Summarizing: with mother!, Aronofsky gives us what we were asking for: a different kind of movie with the strength to keep us thinking about it for a long time, and probably to start a discussion. If you don't like this film, then you have to watch it again and try to understand it. Once you get the real meaning of this movie, you love it"
"mmaggiano","8","1","10","26 September 2017"," A satiric allegory
","For those of you wondering about the sacrilegious content of this film, in my estimation, this film is ultimately critical of humanity as a whole (and therefore all religion), and not specifically critical of the Abrahamic religions, although it uses an often profane and shocking allegory about humanity's corrupt misinterpretation of the Old and New Testaments to get at its critiques of humanity.<br/><br/>That said, not only am I going to write a 8/10 review of a movie that everyone seems to 10/10 LOVE or 1/10 HATE, but I'm also going to talk about this contriversial ironic allegory without using spoiler-examples to explain my points. I must love down-votes.<br/><br/>mother! is, without doubt, the most aggressive movie that Aronofsky has written and directed. Though many of his movies have either profane content or intellectual challenges, this one is shocking for people of the Abrahamic religions en masse, and it has a layered intellectual challenge to it.<br/><br/>The first challenge, for anyone seeing the movie without prior knowledge, is ""what the hell am I watching?"". Neither absurd/surreal movies, nor allegorical ones usually come with A-list stars and a name director, let alone anything this cruel and grotesque. And here I will spread the blame for people's mid-movie anger on two causes: 1) The film was sold as a horror movie in some quarters, which is the latest example of a battle that's been raging between filmmakers and suits for decades: don't misrepresent a movie in marketing for short-term opening weekend gain and long-term bad word of mouth. Nearly anyone who went to this movie in order to get a horror-genre fix left infuriated. 2) The fact that American audiences react with indignant cries of ""pretentious crap!"" when they don't immediately understand a movie can be blamed on both individual closed-mindedness and insecurity, AND on Hollywood conditioning audiences to expect easily-understood wish-fulfillment. You don't have to search real far to find the user reviews reacting to all of this. (Tangentially, we need more articles saying ""Hey, *none* of us immediately understand challenging movies, and we're not supposed to understand them immediately, so would you please stop being mad and insecure about it?"")<br/><br/>That said, allegory itself has been derided for being a narrative form with a low ceiling: either the allegorical correspondences and analogies are off, or the didactic intent is for the unsubtle browbeating of the unsophisticated. I'm not sure that I can blame viewers for reacting to the allegory as a form, or this one as heavy-handed, though I think the movie rises above these problems. Here is where the second layer of intellectual challenge happens in mother!, and where it is most diabolical: 1) allegory dates as far back in the Abrahamic religions as you care to go, and allegorical interpretation (sometimes forced) has been practiced by scholars in those religions for centuries. Therefore allegory is a fitting form to use to criticize humanity's willful misinterpretations. 2) The movie's allegory is chock-full of challenging (or if you please, blasphemous) ironies that amount to something akin to a 21st century Gnosticism. 3) The allegory here is NOT in a point-for-point correspondence, but asks the audience to abstract a bit since there are several analogies running in parallel here, and they interact in a fairly unstable Moby Dick kind of way (sometimes the whale is just a whale). Combine these three things with the profane content of the film and you have a work that is profane in the way that all great satire must be, and in the way that may prevent it from being received more comprehendingly. However, I think it should be received in this way: the target of attack here is human interpretation; the attack is on what kinds of behavior humanity will excuse by willfully interpreting their own religion until they get what they want the answer to be. This mother ultimately objects and the audience like the humans in the movie say ""But mom.... dad said I could!"".<br/><br/>As for the other filmmaking elements beside the narrative, they are flawless.<br/><br/>I'm grading mother! at 8/10, with the main flaws being that the didactic side is (necessarily) heavy-handed, and that the movie probably wouldn't wouldn't sustain more than two viewings worth of interest."

","Wow. I needed Kleenex and chocolate after watching this.<br/><br/>I'm staying away from wordy summaries, because if you have a Bible, you know what happens pretty much anyway. Adam & Eve, Cain & Abel, the flood, the wars, the birth of Jesus, the death of Jesus, and Armageddon are all in this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't cry at The Passion, but I bawled like a baby when HIM's son was killed. If you're a mother, that scene will hit you. HARD.<br/><br/>If you're religious, you'll probably hate it. (I'm not, so it didn't bother me.) It portrays ""HIM"" as a self-absorbed, fairly inactive praise junkie who neglects his loving wife (who is doing pretty much all the work in the house, and suffers mightily at the hands of HIM's fans). Some of ""HIM""s followers are good (like the soldier and the midwife/""Good Samaritan""), but many are idolatrous, fanatical, even violent. And then after all is said and done and everything is destroyed, HIM laughs and starts all over again. (Was all this a joke or a game to HIM? You have to wonder.)<br/><br/>Great visuals, great makeup, great acting. 9/10"
"milosprole9","10","1","11","4 October 2017"," A new psychological horror masterpiece!
","Since Black Swan (2010) is my all-time favorite film, I can't describe how 'mother!' much is strange and unusual movie. It is one hell of a film, but absolutely brilliant. I absolutely loved it! Excellent atmosphere! Stunning cinematography like from Black Swan. You will feel very awkward during watching because of weird situations. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely good in it and gave a powerful performance. In my opinion, she did her best performance so far and I am truly hoping she will be nominated an Oscar. Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer were also good actors. I wish I could see this movie again for the first time because it was hard to watch how much disturbing it is. I'd give it easily a 10/10 and this movie is in my top 40 of all time now. A new psychological horror masterpiece! Darren Aronofsky is one filmmaker that deeply disturbs me, he is just a genius director."
"dave-mcclain","5","1","11","15 September 2017"," Creative, artistic, insightful, awkward and messy.
","Okay, this is a tough one. When I review a film, I'm always careful to avoid spoilers. I describe a movie's characters and plot in some detail, so the reader knows what he or she is getting into if deciding to see it, but I always stop short of revealing twists or secrets which come late in the movie and I never (ever) spoil the ending. I'll stick to those rules in this review, but there is no way to write more than a sentence or two about the drama horror mystery ""Mother!"" (R, 2:01) without explaining what many Movie Fans will realize at some point during the film. This thing I'm about to tell you is not clear in the trailers, but the film's star, Jennifer Lawrence, was open about the movie's theme in numerous interviews leading up to its theatrical release. Knowing what ""Mother!"" is really about is pretty important in order to follow and appreciate the story. (Skip the next paragraph if you're still worried that, instead of just shedding some light on the movie, that I'm about to spoil the entire thing.)<br/><br/>Okay, here it is: The entire film is a metaphor. If it weren't already taken, a good alternate title would be ""The History of the World, Part I"". Everything you see on the screen is a representation either of the earth (note the title) through the eons, including how humanity has interacted with the planet and each other, including how the development of religion plays into human history. I'll avoid revealing more than that regarding the film's symbolism so those who haven't seen the movie yet can discover the details for themselves, but now you know enough to understand what would otherwise be a tough film to follow. <br/><br/>Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence plays the title character, a young woman who lives in an old, unusually-shaped house in the country with her significantly older husband, called Him (Oscar winner Javier Bardem). Mother's relationship to her house is a mystical one. It bleeds when she is upset and she detects what seems like a heartbeat in the walls. Her relationship to her husband is one of love and devotion. Him is a poet afflicted with a bad case of writer's block. Him shows emotional love to Mother, but shows little to no regard to her feelings and opinions. As Him continually tries to write, Mother works on the house, doing things like painting the walls after deciding between slightly different earth tones. The couple enjoy their quiet life of isolation until uninvited strangers begin coming to call.<br/><br/>The stream of unexpected visitors starts with a man referred to simply as Man (multiple Oscar nominee Ed Harris). Man shows up on the doorstep and deceives his way into the home, at first saying that he thought it was an inn and then admitting that he was a fan of the writer and wanted to meet Him. The man appears respectful, but disrespects Mother's rules in a passive-aggressive manner, smoking in the house even after Mother asks him not to. Him doesn't seem bothered by any of this and quickly bonds with Man. Then, the man's wife shows up. She is simply referred to as Woman (multiple Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer). Him welcomes Woman, who quickly makes herself at home. When Woman talks to Mother, she alternates between apparent kindness and rudeness and acts like she owns the place. Him continues to take it all in stride, until Man and Woman enter Him's study and break something valuable. Mother asks them to leave, but Him begins preaching forgiveness. Before Him and Mother can reconcile their difference of opinion, two feuding sons of Man and Woman show up and a violent melee ensues.<br/><br/>Man, Woman and their two sons finally leave the house and everything is peaceful for awhile. Him and Mother renew their marital passion and Mother becomes pregnant. Him and Mother are very happy. Then, Him's inspiration returns. He writes an apparently epic poem that brings tears to Mother's eyes when she reads it, calling it ""perfect"". The poem is published and Him gains many new fans. Starting as only a trickle, it's not long before a steady stream of Him's devotees and members of the media come to the house. They basically take over the place, growing increasingly disrespectful, destructive and hateful. Mother seems to be descending into madness, even as she is about to give birth to her baby. <br/><br/>""Mother!"" is a dramatic example of filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's messy brilliance. The film's writer-director is known for his dream-like cinematic spectacles, ranging from the bizarrely artistic (""Pi"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""The Fountain"") to the strange but accessible (""The Wrestler"", ""Black Swan""). ""Mother!"" falls somewhere in the middle. Aronofsky here returns to his frequent theme of religious symbolism, within a dominant environmental message and even symbolic allusions to the nature and price of fame. And his A-list actors do some of the best work of their careers, especially Lawrence (who was apparently pretty impressed with Aronofsky because she started dating him during production). It's worth noting that this movie has no score, but even more Interestingly, you might not even miss it. This film picks up speed and intensity like a roller coaster coming down from increasingly long climbs and the last 20 minutes is a whirlwind. It's almost too much to take in. And it is too much for this movie. The film's esoteric nature will render it inaccessible to many Movie Fans, while the awkward situations in the story, which eventually become chaotic and violent, will turn off others. However, there is no denying Aronofsky's creativity and skill as a filmmaker – and the impact of this thought-provoking film. ""B-"""

","Timber laid at precise angles. Iron bent to uniform curves. A house in an island pasture of a nondescript forest. The entire structure is a single ember away from a reset. Some visit and laugh at the notion of restoring the property, but the headmistress begs to defer. She is the handyman here, and her husband is the social debutante. <br/><br/>Stuck in a barren writer's block, the husband teeters on agitation and belittlement. His wife's encouragement only perpetuates the lie incubating in his head. He has convinced himself that inspiration must come from the outside, slapping away all interior prompts of beauty she graciously crafts for him. <br/><br/>The wife bears the strength between the two, but the husband is the accomplished one. He has fabricated a throne out of his notoriety, and she has scuffed her knees in his presence. She can argue that her contributions dwarf his works, but her audience is only two. Caulking and plumbing are not nearly as transcendent as wordsmithing. <br/><br/>He invites a visitor in when she is begging for time outside of his study. She treads delicately around his creative process, only to see a stranger shamble over their groomed habitation. Immediately at odds with the guest, the wife begins to fight for her husband's elusive attention. <br/><br/>Creation is a messy business. Destruction is a necessity of creation. Revisions only follow painful deletions. We have pinned the kind term ""editing"" to replace ""slaughtering"". All great works involve death. Death of precious ideas, or characters, or even real people.<br/><br/>Masterpieces have zero capacity for impartiality. Truth is only good when it is blinding. The couple web together a tale that elicits vomit not applause. He holds the feather, but she breathes the words. Only one name can vacation onto the cover, and the herald chooses incorrectly. The heartbeat coursing through the walls finds a defibrillator in the hands of its betrayer. A mother of revolutionary thought frozen in a Southern Gothic ouroboros."

The movie is brilliant in the way that last half hour is constructed but other than that, nothing. Constant exposition for more than an hour is an intresting concept but it doesnt work here. It just stands out really weirdly, the constant gazing and going around the house and all. The Fountain worked because Darren mastered both storytelling and metaphorical exposition in that movie. Here, there is no story. The idea is that metaphors shouldnt be a device, that the story should be a device and metaphors should tell what the movie needs to tell. I really like the reverse-thinking here but again, this way of thinking is never guaranteed to work all the time, and in this case, it does not. Overall, meh. Does it shine a little bit? Yes. Do you enjoy the ride? Yes. Can you re-experience your emotions? Hell no!

I apologize for my english but i have to say my opinion.
This is not a movie for all people cos it needs the right mind. Jennifer Lawrence was AMAZING : i loved her eyes, her anxiety, her love for the House and her hate for all the strangers were in the House. I loved every part of the film : from the beggining to the end. I loved the actors, i loved the photography and the music: oh my god. I loved every simbolism and analogism with religion, god, nature and earth.
In italian we definite you, the people that gave 1, like the people usual seeing ""cinepanettone"": that is like horrible and pathetic Christmas movie for families. So you deserve cinepanettone."

"ricman-69417","7","0","3","25 January 2020"," Suprised at how unique and entertaining this movie was. The trailers dont do it justice.
","This movie was really good! It has to be in my all time favorite movies because it reminds me of a dream or when ur under the influence of something. The actors are all incredible Javier barden and Jennifer Lawrence are so good evening not saying anything they portray emotions so well. Pretty much the scenes have meaning in the movie but the way they are pieced together looking at them they seem like they have loop holes like a dream and you just know what your doing because it happened but you dont understand how it got to that point.
I've had dreams about finding money but I can only really see the value of money and how happy I'll be and what I can do with it. I dont see how I happened to get there or why was I randomly searching for money or what I was even doing in my dream. I guess the house was supposed to be like mother nature and that's why Jennifer lawrence tended so well for it and Javier was god he could create like poems and the baby. But from my opinions I felt like jennifer lawrence was a person and Javier was their partner and when you love somebody you try to support them.
Things are fine for awhile and you develop feelings that can blindly make you follow them. You go along with what they say like Javier invited guests or when he has his whole followers be his life, you tune out ur brain and do stupid things because you trust people. Then at the end you sometimes give yourself away by being so nice and trusting people you burn yourselves out. I didn't get the whole god idea but I do feel like I could relate for past relationships. And like the movie goes back to the beginning I feel like you learn from making similar mistakes. Not my all time favorite movie but very well written and acted and u must definitely watch it is better than most movies I've seen. It's not average a solid 7 out of 10 stars."

","I have bad mouthed horror movies on the internet before but recently I have seen a few movies that are a exception to the rule. I am glad that directors are using their talents to create these masterpieces. Like Brightburn; Mother sent me to the internet immediately to try to find out if it came from a book or a comic book. In both cases I discovered; it did not. This alone shows the individuality of today's new bread of directors. How could you not admire that?<br/><br/>I had no idea what Mother was about. Even after watching it and thoroughly reading about it; I still am convinced that it solely came from someones very wild imagination. Captivating imagination that creates a movie like Mother is so rare today. Darren Aronofsky is a gem that should be cherished and not squandered. Javier Bardem had been a favorite actor of mine for years now. Jennifer Shrader Lawrence's performance was above and beyond the call of duty and what makes this movie a work of art. Who does not like Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer?"

"bilaltat","9","0","1","25 December 2019"," A symbolic journey
","Darren Arronofsky has so many movies that consist the themes of God, creation and myths. This movie is pushing the limits hard.<br/><br/>The movie is not transfer the message to the audience directly. Because, the movie is allegedly about problems in a house of a married couple.<br/><br/>The character that Jennifer Lawrence plays depicts Gaia which is the mother of earth. Javier Bardem's character is God's himself. Ed harris plays Adam, Michelle Pfeiffer plays Eve and their sons are playing Abel and Cain. The whole story and interaction between these characters are symbolizing these ancient religious stories in a different way within modern concepts. The symbolism for these creation myths are handled within a modern family problems in mystery movie. Quite a while, these symbolisms are used so well, that you can not easily get to the bottom of the story. Javier Bardem's God character sometimes reveals itself, but it is not true for the other characters. They really keep the secret well.<br/><br/>Symbolism concept is generally used in movies on specific inanimated objects and concepts. For example, On Suspiria or Hereditary, the symbolism that is used within these 2 movies is not directly change the route of the story but assissting to the audience to create more curiosity on them. It is spicing them up. These are good details.<br/><br/>However, the symbolism that is used within this movie is dominating the whole movie when it should just spice it up. I mean, the movie is depend on a myth's symbolism and therefore it decreases the pleasure of watching the movie. Because, at long last, everyone is going to be curious about the ending. Yes the myth is very good and the story is well written. Here, God always pardons everyone but Mother Earth does not. God forgives people even when they took Mother Earth's child and ate its parts. God shows great virtue on this matter but Mother Earth couldnot endure that and set everything on fire. On this matter, the child of Mother Earth can be seen as Jesus. God did not die and found himself a new Mother Earth.<br/><br/>The situation of arriving 2 visitors which are Adam and Eve, and duality between discomfort of Mother Earth and eagerness of Gods from this situation is really good and worth-pondering.<br/><br/>We understand from the point of view of Arronofsky on God, it does not want to be alone and always creating someone to worship and glorify himself. Actually, it is a cynical situation in terms of philosophy. If there is a creator which is pantocrator, these actions are redundant. As a matter of fact, loneliness and need of glorify is a feature of mankind not God's. From this point, we can see that Arronofsky used Antropomorphism view.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Mother Earth character brings everything on for God. She is loving god deeply but thinks that her lover coan easily decrease the loneliness feelings of God. With a suggestion from Eve she wanted to make a child. Eve character is portrayed a character which is fond of marriage and lineage a lot.<br/><br/>The disruption that is caused by the visitors such as Eve, Adam and other humans is a kind of depiction of brought of doom by mankind to nature.<br/><br/>On first midnight, we have seen a slit on Adam's ribs and he is coughing continuously. In the morning after the first midnight, eve comes which means that, God, took Adam's ribs and creating Eve. There were so many symbolic references throughout the movie.<br/><br/>God who could not find an inspiration to write his book, finally found his inspiration when got the first news of child. Worshippers, the mankind, disrupt everything after that. Mother Earth set everything and herself on fire and God finally took her hearth. We can see that heart at the beginning of the movie as a kind of diamond. That diamond depicts Tree of Life in so many esoterical beliefs. The house symbolizes the Earth and celing of the house is hexagonal and my interpretation for hexagon shape is, it is one of the most excellent shapes from other shapes.<br/><br/>Finally, it is not a movie which deeply attracts the audience but symbolism is very good, gives good messages, giving a significant myth from different perspective. I like the movies that has so many symbols but not the movies which symbols preponderate whole movie but this is a good exception 9/10"

The film is, above all, a manic run through creation, a tale of a psychopatic god and the ultimate mother, who has so much love that it ultimately kills her, and her son.<br/><br/>Arronofsky's genius take on creation can only be justly described as a fresh hybrid of Flower of Flesh & Blood (never dared to see it) and Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, on meth.

","In a Victorian-style house, secluded in a valley surrounded by forest defined as ""paradise"", lives a couple in intentional isolation. Since the movie does not name its characters, we can say that ""mother"" is ""his"" young wife, a poet who tries to rewrite a work that leads him to previous successes. She is in the midst of the restoration work of the old house, practically destroyed by a fire that only left a small gemstone, which the poet keeps on his desk as a relic.<br/><br/>Like traditional housewives, Mom! goes up and downstairs, often barefoot, doing everything from cleaning the house to paste the walls. We connect our perception with hers, because, except for two scenes, it is through her that the whole narrative of the movie occurs.<br/><br/>A doctor comes to the house, followed by his wife and, a little later, by his stranger children. Mom never gets an explanation about who those people are or why they are there in her home, breaking all the rules and the integrity of the house.<br/><br/>At first, we thought it was a farce, by the heat of the discussions and the nihilistic acting of man and woman, lived brilliantly by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. When the first violent death happens, and the kitchen sink comes down, we know that something inexplicable will happen in the movie than a simple psychological drama.<br/><br/>After a brief lull in which, for the first time, the husband fulfills a mother's desire and get her pregnant, everything seems to flow smoothly, and the poet completes his other creation, an overwhelming poem.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is packed with action that even the wildest spectator could not foresee: crowds invade and destroy the interior of the house, rival groups clash, armed struggle, anthropophagy, and chaos. There are disconnected apocalyptic symbols everywhere.<br/><br/>This is no longer an account: they are just sensations, lived with horror, bewilderment, and agony. But realizing that there is no more salvation amid the unruly mob, the mother goes to the basement of the house and completes (or begins) a life cycle."

","I was quite intrigued, after reading theories regarding a religious interpretation, especially since they made sense, even if mine while watching the movie was completely different.<br/><br/>What we, in my opinion, see unfold is the creative process and it's effects on a relationship. It feeds off of personal experiences, that you end up sharing with your audience, thus making your private life available to an insatiable public, which keeps intruding into your privacy to find out about every little detail available. They want all that you can give and lust for more until you can't give them anymore, which is the point at which their newborn child gets devoured by the masses. As soon as Jennifer Lawrences character leans up against them, she almost gets ripped to shreds by the court of public opinion, that only her husband as the public vs. her private persona can save her from, but in the end he cares more about the satisfaction his writing and creativity give him, so he sacrifices her to keep the process going.<br/><br/>Loved the direct comparison of gestation and creativity, that was made as clear as possible by her giving birth in his study as well as the small jumps in time, that showed how his life seemed to be moving faster than hers.<br/><br/>But as I already mentioned, the religious explanation seemed just as valid, so I'll have to rewatch this one."

Humankind is utterly chaotic and nothing more than a self absorbed plague on the planet designed to obsessively praise a mad God with total disregard for the planet, which houses, and feeds them.

The film is clever and even true on some levels, but has no grasp of how deep evil runs in world. Blaming environmental catastrophe on religion is cute.

","This film has great actors, excellent filmography and tries so hard for depth that general audiences will hate it. It's heavy use of allegory and over the top metaphor make it barely watchable for 90 percent of audiences. It's unnecessarily grotesque and goes from uncomfortable to dark without the necessary genius that has allowed films of a similar style to succeed.

"BennyBamLegacy","7","0","2","18 March 2019"," Sensationally Misguided
","While the theme is admirable, the filming suitably claustrophobic, and the actors beyond committed... there are still a lot of missed opportunities with this film. Make no mistake, it is a piece of art that should be discussed and interpreted like any other. My own is that it tragically falls short of a masterpiece. The ingredients were there but cooked incorrectly, separately from one another before being put into a melodramatic bland stew. Adding spice at the end does not fix the taste. It sits on a ledge afraid of its own moral, edging toward a lost sense of ""what is happening here"" and losing it half way into its own dinner. The tone starts out with solid consistency, trying to clearly slow burn to a metaphor about fame and sensationalism devouring the human element; literally. However, after what feels like a clear psychotic set of ""normalized downplayed"" psychological abuses; it reverts to intimate finding, then back to the abuse. Now, such is life, right? But the problem here is that despite Jennifer Lawrence's phenomenal pulse of the character, it never quite feels like this gets the meaning it sets out for. Gore can be stunning, meaningful, and poetic. Simply using a poet who achieves fame imagining he can contain it no matter what, is not in itself poetic. Obviously, displacement of real emotions and reactions plays to the decentization of modern social aged indifference. Missed in the climax are the things that made the first half of the movie so interesting; an unnerving but familiar discomfort. It tries too hard to justify itself through Javier Bardem's character, and ironically plays on abuse in a relationship, yet she knows where to draw a clear line. Simplicity in complications only further undresses this as not knowing what's unnerving about itself. Worth a watch, conversation, comparisons, not much more."

","It's worth noting the other reviews that clarify the allegorical nature of the film although it's pretty clear what it's about.
While the acting performances and underlying symbolism is well done, unfortunately the take away from the movie is that humanity is pretty terrible.
The way the message is delivered is only through the absolute unreasonableness of human nature which is portrayed through ""mothers"" interactions with the other cast members, even with ""Him"". Ultimately these are simply an exercise in frustration which becomes quickly tedious. The constant build up of unreasonable interactions only lead you to disconnect with the movie. That these also increase in violence as the movie progresses doesn't help.
Finally, that the mechanism of resolution is delivered as a symbol of replacement (namely the replacement of ""mother"") suggests that the whole affair (message) is just another bit of history repeating, isn't consistent with the main message.
It's also a shame that the sleeve packaging was so nicely done. It definitely appeals to ones feminine side, but this is clearly a tool to make copy sales.
We struggled through to the end but when we got there it was clear this isn't a feel good movie. Just the opposite."

","I just saw this movie and I must say that as much as I enjoyed the first half, it just got ridiculous on the last one. The name ""Mother"" doesn't really show why the movie got its name. Perhaps 'Le Miserables' would have been a better name. The movie has such a gripping start, which continues halfway through before it got ridiculous in the middle. There's no explanation as to why the writer's character, played by Javier Bardem, behaves this way. Every writer goes through this phase or writer's block at some point in their lives. The movie gets ridiculous when the guests behave strangely and start to smash things around the house. Suddenly, I felt the movie turned into some sort of 1940s war genre. When the baby got murdered, then the movie was too ridiculous to bear. If I had been seeing this one at the movie theater, I'd have felt that I was being ripped off. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome, and so is Javier Bardem, but they've done their job. Michelle Pfeiffer is my favorite gal. I love her. I must also give a shout-out to Ed Harris. So mature and so professional. Other than that, the movie gets weaker in the middle until the end."
"towsleysteven","6","0","1","23 December 2018"," Unnerving, disturbing, enraging, confounding
","Mother! begins like a Peter Weir film, with increasing unease as unwelcome guests proliferate in the young wife's large home. Then it begins to resemble Polanski's Rosemary's Baby as her husband seems to join the Dark Side of the crowd of intruders mistreating her and making increasing shambles of her house. In the latter stages this becomes like a Ken Russell film of Grand Guignol or the seventh level of hell.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is excellent, and that is apparent since the camera holds so tightly on her throughout that it seems almost her POV if not her hallucination. In any case, this is on some level a fable with a moral, but I wish it were clear what it was. I offer no spoiler because I'm not sure what to conclude.<br/><br/>The film as a metaphor is not without worth but it is challenging if not irritating to sit through, especially if one is sensitive to exotic violence and an infuriating level of repeating chaos in a helpless wife's life, with a husband who is of no real help to her or us at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was about a victim of mental cruelty who needed to leave her husband and seek a safe house, but that's not what happened and I really couldn't say. I'm sure the filmmakers would disagree with me on that deduction.<br/><br/>As an audience member I can stand some abuse as long as I find out what it was all for at the end. I can't say that here. I suppose the pointlessness could be intended to tell me the God of this world is mad. It would certainly please Ken Russell. Maybe polonsky too.<br/><br/>But again, I have no idea if I'm near the mark. Mainly, I praise Jennifer Lawrence's courage for toughing this one out."

I saw it in a Red Box one day, and figured my fiancee and I would give it a whirl. I wish I hadn't. I really, really wish I hadn't...<br/><br/>The movie is riddled with biblical and religious overtones and themes. Each of the characters represents someone or even something in the bible. An example of this for instance, Mother is actually the Earth. You know? Like, Mother Earth? I bet the writer/director thought himself especially clever for that gem! I'm not religious---I'm an Atheist, in fact---but even I thought this fellow Atheist was too damn preachy! The movie is self indulgent and not needed. What's more: seeing people break a baby's neck and then eating it is not smart or artsy or anything. It's shock value. It's more on the lines of, ""Look At Me!"". I don't agree with religious aspects and such, but I also don't go out my way to impose my non-belief beliefs on people.

"optimisticfatty","3","0","1","12 December 2018"," Perplexing but too ignorant and pretentious to deliver the needed emotional payoff
","Darren Aronofsky is undoubtedly a talented director who has made some terrific films (Pi, Black Swan, Requiem, and The Wrestler being my favorites). His ability to imbue the dark side of humanity into a spellbinding screenplay is enthralling. So when I saw this director team up with an A+ cast and saw the initial bad reviews, I figured it was a classic case of film-goers wanting a straight-forward feel-good story and not having the intellect to appreciate one of Aronofsky's sharp films. Sadly, the bad reviews were right this time.<br/><br/>The film is not as some have said the worst film ever. It is certainly challenging, as it had me trying to figure out what was happening the entire film. I was on the edge of my seat. It's not until the end (spoiler warning) when you discover it's an allegory to creation and Christianity that the film truly misses the needed payoff for what the audience must endure.<br/><br/>The director is not simply showing you the facts and allowing you to make your own decision. No, he is unequivocally making some baseless points here:
God created people because he's selfish and wants to be adored
Mother earth is His bride and despite her giving Him everything, it's not enough
All people are horrible and worship ignorantly
From simply rating this as a film, it's a long terrible exercise of watching people behave rudely. It's like having your in-laws leave dirty tissues on your pillowcase for two hours. And to eventually realize it's the director smirking and saying ""I know, it's terrible, right? And yet this movie is about you"" could have been deft but instead feels so pretentious that it's arrogant. Martin Scorsese has that talent to show how terrible humans can be and lets us feel righteous indignation about it and ponder our morality. This film by contrast feels as biased and intolerable as watching political ads.<br/><br/>As a Christian, I found this film ignorant at best and blasphemous at worst. It is so ill-informed it's as if Aronofsky read about Genesis on wikipedia. The theology is flat-out wrong. The bride of Christ is the church, not earth. Miss this point and you have no film. Then there are some critical themes that aren't represented here: that God foretold of the Messiah throughout the Torah (Old Testament), that He knowingly sent His one and only son, Jesus, to die for our sins because of His perfect love for us. I think if you're going to make a story that's an allegory to this but miss these ideas you've basically missed the ballgame.<br/><br/>It's a perplexing and fascinating film to unpack and the performances are solid, so I don't agree it's the worst film ever, but I think once you unpack it all it's as disappointing as a reminder to drink your Ovaltine."

","Ok, definitely not a 1 or 2, and surely not an 8, 9 or 10. But, depending on my mood at the time I watched it, I probably could have come down anywhere in between.
If you are a stickler for, you know, characters acting more or less like actual human beings, give this a miss. If you adore abstract art, come on down. If, like me, you can very occasionally find something interesting or rarely even moving in an abstract painting, maybe you should see this. If you're in the right mood.
It isn't easy to act characters who don't behave like any kind of real human beings; I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a heroic job. Her co star, in my mind, was the soundtrack which supplied punctuation to every moment. I'm not really sure if the soundtrack was brilliant or not; normally on a first viewing I don't expect to be hyper aware of the soundtrack throughout the movie, but it certainly had a strong effect. Perhaps the soundtrack took a workshop with Chubbuck, ""The Power of the Soundtrack"".
The movie is not about people, it is about themes (I think): presumably various religious mythologies, mostly Christian, sustainability, humanity,stuff like that. A lot of the filming is aesthetically interesting, in and of itself.
For me there were two LOL scenes, one was the ""MEDIC!"" scene, and the other I won't mention because it's way too dark. Not brilliant humor, but hysterical releases against the unsustained Rosemary's Baby atmosphere. Not sure if they were intended to be funny, but I sure laughed.

","This so-called ""movie,"" an attempt by some artsy fartsy Hollywood ""director,"" is utter BS. My husband is actually mad at me that I just wasted a WAY TOO LONG two precious hours of our time together, hoping it would make sense in the end. I was suspicious throughout the entire movie that it was an alligorical treatment of Biblical stories. However, I am not angry that it is trying to be what something the director has little understanding about, I am angry simply because it is a pretentious piece of garbage once again foisted on unsuspecting audiences most of whom simply want to be entertained! <br/><br/>When is Hollywood going to understand what we, the deplorables, truly want to watch? This garbage belongs in some art festival for the uninformed, idiotic, art loving, rich people's world. Please do not foist this nonsense on decent, intelligent, hard working average people anywhere in the world. EVER!!! This indulgent BS might have a place for a few, chosen, snotty upper class human beings. The rest of us NORMAL humans just want to be ENTERTAINED. Look up the definition of entertainment please. This is not it! What this shows me is Hollywood or the entire entertainment industry has completely lost their collective mind. <br/><br/>I can not unsee this movie. But, it will forever color anything Ms. Lawrence decides to work on in the future. Too bad, I actually liked most of her work until she stained it with this loser of a so-called movie. No wonder it was free on Amazon. Most likely average people are being warned to stay away from this tripe. Lucky them! We were not so lucky. So sad for us! BE FOREWARNED! The rest of you. Pretentious snots only will find anything worth watching in this horrible mess of a film, if you can call it a film."

","I get this was all metaphors/allegory, but the last 40mins was just too much. I think it could have been presented less chaotic and less satanic. Honestly I was pissed off watching this and felt like I wasted 2 hours.. I also don't get how it is under the genre of horror. It's barely suspenseful, but definitely a mystery as you're trying to figure out the entire time: ""what the hell is happening"", ""when is the madness going to end?"" And ""what the f did I just watch?"" I really really wish I knew wtf I was getting myself into before watching this. I love psychological thrillers- to count this movie as one would be a disgrace."

"rosgemchar","2","0","1","26 September 2018"," Disaster
","Up to the point when Pfeiffer and Harris depart with their obnoxious relatives and friends, I was very pleased with this film. But the second half devolves into a horrendous mishmash of horror and ridiculous staging. 
It would have been a better movie and made more sense to me if the roles had been reversed. The emotional roles. The woman as the one who is open and welcoming.
From the beginning it makes no sense that a world famous poet allows people to invade his house.
He has chosen to live in an isolated place, far from any neighbors. His behavior does not make sense to me.
And, it seems, the director, once launched on the horror genre, keeps adding horror upon horror, until it becomes disgusting and even ridiculous.
Very disappointing."
"jeffjewe11","1","0","3","26 September 2018"," Lucifer's Dream should be the title
","You can cut up or support the artistic value of this film but the simple fact is it follows a Luciferian's desire. That desire is to destroy what God has created, attack the mother, and an overwhelming desire to have murdered the innocent. The film is a modern tale of vanity, and the desire to be like God. This film attacks the very foundations of humanity from a spiritual perspective. You can dream about destroying the God child and his mother but the fact is that Herod failed as did this disgraceful film. We know how the real story ends. It ends with a man like this burning in a lake of fire for eternity with no chance for redemption and no chance to hurt any being God creates whom believes in him."

"richardwalmsley","9","0","1","4 September 2018"," Many reviewers seem to have forgotten the visual art side of film.
","What Darren Aronofsky has done with this film is create a visually stunning feast for the eyes. In the same manner with which Bryan Fuller (and team) took Hannibal and besieged viewers with some of the most stunning visual sets and scenes ever produced for television, Aronofsky has painted an Old Testament masterpiece with a modernist flare that seems largely misunderstood.
It is a given that any film portrayal of religious subject matter is going to create controversy, and this one is no different. I view it from the artistic side and enjoyed the updated visual ride as opposed to the structured religious paintings that we are used to. Don't think for a second that I am not a fan of the Sistine Chapel Ceiling et al; I merely appreciate that in today's world, Aronofsky didn't require papal approval to produce and display his portrait.
Many of the negative reviews seem to find common ground is accusing Aronofsky of self indulgence. I simply don't understand these opinions. Filmmakers like Aronofsky are artists and whether you are talking about Van Gogh, Goya, Orson Wells or Mozart; their interpretation of the subject they are sharing with the world is by default, self indulgent. These naysayers are entitled to not enjoy the art but accusations of self indulgence on the part of the artists are ridiculous and I suggest they stick to commercial cookie cutter comic book films instead."

What makes Mother! a spectacular failure is the waste of acting talent - and there's a lot of talent in the cast - on a script so poorly written, and on a film so poorly directed by the writer Darren Aronovsky, that the only way to bring this fuster-cluck to a conclusion was to make the whole thing a dream sequence.
Aronofsky's trademark moves are all here - especially the druggy montage scenes to suggest a 60s version of an acid-trip as imagined by a 50 Y.O. guy who never touched the stuff.

","I gave it 2 stars because Jeniffer Lawrence did a great job here. The movie is quite disturbing and you wait 2 hours for nothing in particular. I get the metaphores- god,mother earth, adam,eve etc. but there are too many plot holes and the ending is pointless. 
First plot hole: why is she taking medicines? When she finds out she's pregnant, she throws them away so we never know if she suffers from a psychosis.
Second plot hole: why is that ""Cain"" dude warning Her about her husband? Does he know something? Same scene, 'Her' finds the ripped photo of her husband on the floor and it seems like someone drew horns on his head. Why? It supposed to be the God-like figure everyone talkes about...is he the devil? 
Third plot hole: why is Him always doing the same thing over and over agian? This is not ok. The rebirth theme is pointless here. He always gets a wife, becomes famous, destroys everything she built, she dies, he takes the love outta her (the heart-stone scene) and boooom!..new wife, everything is repeting. Why? Is God so forgetful that he never remembers what happened before? ...silly
Fourth plot hole: why is that doctor sick? Is it tuberculosis,lung cancer? Why is he seeking refuge in God's house together with his familly that we learn to know they have no place to go but after the scene with the broken sink and everything they suddenly dissapear and they have where to go. Stupid
Fifth plot hole: what in God's name is that tunnel in the basement for?!???? It was pointed out several times! When the 'Abel' guy dies and his blood leaks all over the floor and happenes to go down to the basement while leaking on the walls it's revealing a locked door which 'Her' openes and we see a tunnel! What was that for? Enterteniment?!?? Ultra stupid and pointless.
I could go on but those are the major ones I encountered.
Don't waste your time and money. Go and see something else! 
I may not have an eye for the art displayed in this movie but I do have common sence and I will never find ok the brutal scenes,like the butched baby,even in horror movies. Some decency is required to respect all viewers.

I feel like I relate heavily to the series of feelings Jennifer Lawrence's character went through: confused as all hell, begging for answers, then just begging for everything to stop, and finally just saying screw it and just blowing the whole thing up. Even while I relate to her in these ways, I still manage not to feel anything for her character at all as the movie never really gives me a reason to. To top it all off, the ending leaves us with this woman (who we still know nothing about) burnt to a crisp with some truly garbage CGI, once again leaving me with no reason to feel anything at all. This movie tried to destroy my spirit."

","(with as much emphasis as possible) OBVIOUSLY this is High Concept. <br/><br/>If it was so smart, it could have been more subtle. Think about it.<br/><br/>I understand the attempts at metaphor. The reason why they don't work is because nothing about this movie resembles anything real. For one thing, in the real world, it's not ALL HORRIBLE. There are nice moments. They contrast this ridiculous depiction of creation. There is beauty. For example, I never believed the relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem for a second. There is nothing 'true' about this, there is nothing believable about this. If it actually seemed like they loved each other, maybe it might pull me in a little. Maybe it's intentional they don't really love each other, as it shows she's just recycled, but this still doesn't represent humanity, or our experience on earth, where there is some ambiguity about how people love each other, there is some love by degrees. Here there are no degrees. It just doesn't ring true at all. So forced, so painful to watch, because it doesn't seem genuine. <br/><br/>This movie is a nightmare, and intended to be so. Well done by the standards of it resembling a nightmare. In terms of resembling a movie, it's horrible, and you honestly wish you hadn't seen it. It violates you. I'm sure this pleases someone, maybe Aronofsky himself. But I've seen all of his movies and know he's too talented for just that. He must know this is garbage. He must have done it on purpose. Noah was so beautiful, in my opinion, in that it explored what kind of humanity we choose to be. So well acted, so passionately well-done, such a great movie. Aronofsky got ripped for it on all sides. It didn't please anyone but the few who actually have the capacity to think without overwhelming bias. I think Mother! was his answer. It was a giant expletive. It wasn't smart, if there was creative intelligence involved, it failed. There is purpose behind having intelligence, and those who have it and choose to use it must do so with something to achieve. There is function. It's not completely arbitrary, otherwise the value of what intelligence actually is would make no sense. <br/><br/>See Noah, Black Swan, and Requiem for a Dream, they are incredible films.<br/><br/>Please Mr. Aronofsky, keep making movies. But tell a story for an audience again. I know you can do whatever you want, but think about it. When you serve others, you serve yourself."

","Intrusive, heinous, extreme, sacrilegious, hopeless, brutal, unapologetic, and absolutely fascinating. What more do you want from a horror movie? The ""F"" grade on CinemaScore suggests maybe audiences were expecting something else, maybe more jump scares and traditional storytelling. The ""horror"" here stems more from claustrophobia, stress, disturbing imagery, and fever dream progression. It's a home invasion plot, but the absurd elements and allegory foils any attempt at face literal interpretation. Buyer beware.<br/><br/>It heavily borrows from the biblical narrative with creation, fall, flood, logos, eucharist, church, and apocalypse, but perhaps just as much a framework than strictly just message or meaning. It seems also to do with the creative process, frustration of writers block, the relationship of art and artist, distraction of fame, destruction of our planet, and the suppression and exploitation of women. Jennifer Lawrence's character could easily be a stand-in for The Giving Tree, but she could also quite possibly be meta-portraying herself by the climactic finish. The movie is a beautiful and disastrous telling of the world's history from a feminist, environmentalist, and gnostic perspective. It's an urgent plea in urgent times."

I spent at least the first half of the movie considering different plots and themes that may be going on, if its a story about male domineering presence, loss of control or the loss of innocence. The film cleverly has subtext of all these themes and more but the end revelation, its metaphor, if it does dawn on you, is so much bigger. 
The direction is absolutely flawless, all supporting actors give strong performances, Bardem is always great but special praise should be given to Lawrence. For those in any doubt of her range as an actress should see this film, it is not an easy or light role by any means.

","'mother!' is a deeply metaphorical masterpiece by Darren Aronofsky, that is daring as much as it is disturbing. This movie has sparked a myriad of discussions, with some people loving this film and appreciating its depth, while others detest it to the point of calling it one of the worst movies ever made. It's overwhelming atmosphere, the complicated allegory of a plot and the utterly disturbing climax will certainly repulse mainstream movie-goers, but will certainly appeal and be well-loved by those who are into unconventional art-films. I personally found the plot to be refreshing and highly unique, with its underlying Biblical themes a brilliant and well-thought move by Aronofsky. While on the surface, this movie may come across as confusing and messy, once one understands the deeper meaning Aronofsky was going for, and the message he wanted to portray, one can appreciate this movie a whole lot more. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is superb, and certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination. She is also supported by a great supporting cast, with Michelle Pfeiffer being another highlight. The directing in this film is also highly effective, with the up-close camera angles contribute greatly to the overall claustrophobic feeling of the film. The last half-hour of the film has got to be one of the most intense and overwhelming experiences in my movie-watching history that is truly brilliant. While it is certainly disturbing in its own right, and will definitely spark outrage in a lot of people, I personally think it was daring and justifiable by its deeper meaning."

It is an utterly disturbing and transfixing psychological horror, with amazing scenography and superb acting (both Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Berdem are great in their roles). Not just the story, but each scene is dense with symbolism and remains open to interpretation); it is perhaps gradually earning its status of one more cult film of Darren Aronofsky. Only if one strips this movie off its rich allegorical essence, it is possible to misunderstand the movie as being bizarre or weird. It is a masterpiece!"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","3","29 May 2018"," Darren Aronofsky shines as a director in the film he was born to make.
","People didn't respond well to ""Mother!"" because they either didn't understand its role as a biblical analogy of humankind or they didn't appreciate its artistic, unique directorial vision. From the second the film starts, you'll be able to tell Darren Aronofsky is controlling the set, using his stylish, dark vision to depict the events and meanings behind the most famous biblical stories. Jennifer Lawrence knocks it out of the park in her very best performance. The emotional toll she puts into this perforce is staggering. Lawrence is an actress I'm not usually big on, but all that changed after seeing this film. Few filmmakers are as poignant and brilliant in calculating humankind as Aronofsky. In ""Mother!"" he blends his passion for the environment and fascination with religion to deliver perhaps the most unique, daring, and unconventional masterpiece of the 21st century."
"tmpsvita","8","0","2","28 May 2018"," You can hate it or love it but definitely it will remain in your mind
","Aronofsky realizes another of his controversial films, born to create discussions, speculations, unworthy, admiration but in any case on which it is very much reflected, and probably this is one of the most enigmatic and introspective, to its conclusion you can hate it, you can love it and you can remain banned, but one thing is certain, it is a film to see, and in a different way from any other film you have ever seen, because it is a film different from any other, a unique, unrepeatable experience hard to forget.
Throughout the film there is a strange, almost annoying and deep feeling of discomfort and loss, a feeling shared with the protagonist through the eyes of which we witness surreal, grotesque, impossible and incoherent (at least apparently) events linked to each other in an almost frenetic, disoriented and confusing way and you can not help but assist, helpless, powerless, stifling from emotions and feelings that are difficult to repress but that consume us and consume her.
Aronofsky directs with great presumption, it must be said, but also ambition and cunning a complex film to be seen, understood and absorbed but also to be realized; through his claustrophobic close-ups and the constantly moving hand-held camera creates an insatiable puzzle of ideas and images connects each other with difficulty but which, once completed, can give gratification and satisfaction, thanks also to the really extraordinary and courageous sequences.
Inexplinable the Razzie Awards nomination of this year for Jennifer Lawrence (as well as the ones for director and Javier Bardem) who manages to take on the role of an extremely difficult character to play because is fragile, lost, confused, but with her hypnotic look manages to express a multitude of emotions at the same time and manages to create a strong bond between her and the viewer who remains immobilized to observe her by trying exactly what she feels.
Everyone can derive completely different meanings from each other and think of opinions that are totally conflicting with each other because everyone sees something of his own and personal, and I certainly will not be the one to impose my own but I can say that I found it brilliant, even if not perfect, and it's easy to hate it as much as love it so I will not tell you that you will definitely like it but I strongly recommend you to see it to really understand what I'm talking about and maybe you'll love it."

That said, whenever asked about favourite films, Pi is always first to my mind. So... Mother! First things first, this is an unusual film, with unusual people, living unusual lives, in an unusual house. A Seemingly calm world unravels with Lawrence at the centre of the storm, sensing there are more characters than the ones walking around her house, destroying the peace she craves. This is the kind of film you want to climb inside to stop the intruding madness. It borders on infuriation, with Bardem as the ringleader, inviting destruction into their world. There's several metaphorical layers to unpick and it's difficult to do so on one viewing, themes of fame, family, commitment, control and creativity. The house being the melting pot of life at the heart of it all, designed to get you second guessing. Time and perception become irrelevant as any humanity is forgotten in a war of attrition of godlike proportions. It's a diabolical mess. It's quite excellent... but it's not Pi."

"gengar843","6","0","1","12 May 2018"," Self-Conscious Absurdity Without A Point
","God, a noted poet with writer's block, lives in a house with his ""wife"" Jennifer Lawrence (gorgeous as usual), who is renovating it from a previous fire which destroyed everything, including God's previous wife. OK, first off, it's difficult to keep straight if Jennifer is supposed to be The Holy Spirit or Mary, mother of Jesus. Second, it's a pretty abstract cinematic device, so let's leave this alone for now. Third, I suppose the message is, God has done this before, which is not really Biblical and also quite disheartening.<br/><br/>God invites a stranger (Ed Harris, let's call him Adam) to stay the night in the house (let's call it Eden). During the night, Adam loses a rib while in a vomiting fit. The next morning, the stranger's wife (Michelle Pfeiffer, let's call her Eve) shows up and begins vamping it up. Eventually, the two sons (let's call them Cain and Abel) arrive, and Cain slays Abel, receiving a mark on the head from God. OK, so we are now clear that God resides in Eden, and has begun the process of creating mankind. If you want a film to have a moral, there must be rules which are to be obeyed and consequences for not. In THIS film, God never establishes any rules but just lets everyone run amok. While you might be able to make an argument that's what happens in the Bible, there is still the little detail called ""don't eat from the tree.""<br/><br/>After this, the movie picks up a little steam. God invites everyone into His house and they begin to destroy it, and each other, and to use God's name in vain for their own purposes (don't worry, radicalism was not omitted from the list of sins). I must say, these scene were quite Dante-esque, with a little Peckinpah for good measure. <br/><br/>Jennifer tries to save the house, and her baby, but fails in both. First, the film again and again fails to recognize that God makes specific commandments for men to follow and they don't. Instead, God is depicted as extremely permissive, which is false. So the film blames God for not giving us instructions, which is as obnoxious as it is not true. <br/><br/>Second, let's just say the cannibal scene is an interesting slap in the face to Christianity, specifically about ""eat my flesh and drink my blood"" which is obviously not supposed to be taken literally, or else this film shows what! The film also puts the cart before the horse, claiming that God wants to forgive men for murder because, well, ""we have to."" The truth is, men were told not to murder, but they do anyway. Most reasonable people should think the film is subversive here, slapping both God and man, as if the writer is smarter than all. No, I don't take the film to be a representation of the Bible, but a knowing leer. If it's not, the filmmakers are quite ignorant of what the Bible says.<br/><br/>FInally, after two hours of browbeating, the film mercifully ends by lending Jennifer the mise-en-scene as Christ off the cross, being carried. Confusingly, God takes her heart (her ""love"") and begins the process all over again, making us feel small and unimportant. After all that God did and hoped for in the film, He basically wipes the slate clean, like an Etch-a-Sketch. There is no hope, no love, no process. It's all despair, despite the sunny bedroom ending.<br/><br/>This is only ""art"" in that the filmmakers obfuscated their ignorance and biases by exaggerating the action and characters to absurdity. It's really more of an avant-garde cartoon, only without any humor. In fact, the intensity of every moment is so self-conscious as to feel like the joke itself, mocking any piety. <br/><br/>As I said, Jennifer Lawrence looks amazing here, and I will superficially give this a 6 rather than the 3 it deserves."

It's a movie that holds the viewer from the beginning to the end and when you think you've seen everything, it's just the beginning. I saw the movie in the cinema and during the two hours of the movie I felt all kinds of emotions to the point of wanting to leave the room because it was too STRONG. But I decided to stay because I like that type of movies, that play with my emotions.

"7DeadlyThings","7","0","1","1 March 2018"," 7 Deadly Theologies and Mythologies on Darren Aronofsky's Allegorical Horror Movie 'mother!'
","Mother! is an allegory for climate change
Aronofsky himself hasn't been shy about his intentions for the film as an allegory for man's destructive nature towards the environment, casting Jennifer Lawrence as Mother, the spirit of Mother Nature herself. She is an all-loving, all-caring feminine being who is trying to make her rural house an idyllic home, while everyone else around her seems intent on doing the exact opposite. Powerless and compliant Mother watches as everything she has given gets destroyed. In the final act she sets the house alight, a metaphor for global warming, perhaps.<br/><br/>mother! is about the Bible
There's power in the religious symbolism in this movie from the director who gave us 'Noah' (2014). It seems safe to interpret Javier Bardem's ""Him"" is God, who is an esteemed poet in the film, representing scripture. Lawrence is the Virgin Mary slash Mother Earth whose sacrificed child is the Messiah. Their home is Eden. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are Adam and Eve. The feuding sons (played by real life brothers Domhnall and Brian Gleeson) are Cain and Abel. The kitchen sink collapse is the Great Flood and the furnace in the basement is Hell. The structure itself is a timeline of everything up to the present day. In the span of the final half hour, Aronofsky charts the biblical plagues and the history of the world in a dizzying sequence.<br/><br/>mother! is about the temptations of fame
This movie is perhaps intentionally pretentious and is cast with some of the biggest stars on the planet. Lawrence is arguably the most famous and most talked about actress right now. Her character struggles with the attention Bardem's character garners, possibly mirroring her own experiences on being famous. However, Bardem gives in to temptation unable to resist the admiration and adoration of his worshippers, inviting all of them into their home. The crowds get bigger and so does his ego. Even as they begin to destroy his home and his marriage he seems to be bathing in adulation. He even gives in to their demands and offers up his own flesh and blood to them.<br/><br/>mother! is a home invasion horror
Superb home invasion movies that hang high in the hall of horror include 'Straw Dogs' (1971), the Austrian original 'Funny Games' (1997) and how 'bout those opening ten minutes of terror Drew Barrymore endures in 'Scream' (1996). You see the comparisons in mother! beginning with the arrival of an unexpected houseguest, which turns into a couple more, then more, and more and more. Stranger danger this territory certainly is. ""I thought the home invasion movie was very interesting, because everyone relates to having a bad guest who won't get out of the house when the parties over,"" said Aronofsky. ""So, I knew turning that into a nightmare would be an interesting place to start.""<br/><br/>mother! is a portrait of a relationship
Artist Monika Crowley suggests that the narrative is about ""the cycle of relationships in general, the shifts of power, each person having different needs from it,"" Crowley goes on to say, ""the fact that love fades or goes bad, but still exists even after going on a path of self-destruction. And then it begins again."" The story then is a depiction of love and it's consuming nature. That may explain the ultra-violent scene where Mother is getting knocked about as a metaphor for how it feels to be heartbroken. In Hindu religion it states that God created and destroyed the universe over and over until it was perfect. In the movie He asks a defeated Mother for the love she has left for him, and she agrees to give it to him so he tears open her chest and removes her heart. The heart disintegrates, the house rejuvenates, and the cycle begins again.<br/><br/>mother! is about an older man dating a younger woman
The movie explores the concept of an age difference in a relationship and how it can or can't work. Javier Bardem is pushing fifty and Jennifer Lawrence is in her twenties. The twenty-year age gap between the two is addressed by Ed Harris where he says to Bardem after being introduced to Lawrence: ""Your wife? I thought it was your daughter."" In an interview Aronofsky says, It's just a story about an older man with a younger woman. A creator and a caregiver and the inequality of that and their marriage falling apart.""Aronofsky (48) also started dating Lawrence (27) during production. Life imitating art imitating life.<br/><br/>mother! is about introversion versus extraversion
Those who have introverted tendencies tend to recharge by spending time alone. They lose energy from being around people for long periods of time, particularly large crowds. Extroverts, on the other hand, gain energy by being social and find their energy is sapped when they spend too much time alone. Ne'er were these two personality types portrayed so blatantly than in these two lead characters. Lawrence would like to single-handedly refurbish the house in peace while tending to the needs of her husband. By contrast, Bardem welcomes interruption no matter how bombastic it becomes. Once the pressure of being around people for too long gets to be too much, Lawrence burns the house down."
"bdburmeister","8","0","1","27 February 2018"," The best caution I can offer: know what you're walking into
","Rarely does a film come along that polarizes audiences immediately and intensely. But Mother! most certainly accomplishes that. The Jennifer Lawrence starring film has been labeled ""divisive,"" which puts it lightly. You'll either love it or hate it. But what makes Mother! truly special: either way, you'll feel the need to talk about it.<br/><br/>At face value, Mother! tells an unconventional home invasion story. The film starts with a slow-burn of mystery. Mother, wonderfully played by Lawrence, awakens in bed alone, calling for her husband. As she searches, we are introduced to their home, a Victorian mansion-massive, beautiful, but in various states of disrepair-which is a character in and of itself. This house, which we learn literally has a heart of its own, serves as the sole setting for the entire film. Shortly after finding her husband (the always terrific Javier Bardem), Mother and Him (we never learn their names) are joined by an unexpected guest played by Ed Harris. Why is he there? What does he want? The mystery unfolds as tensions rise and a rift appears between Mother and her husband.<br/><br/>Soon, another surprise visitor, devilishly portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer, appears on their doorstep. And as one character after another after another are introduced into the film and into their home, Mother's lack of control over the situation becomes more and more apparent. The uncertainty and terror she feels escalates. And escalates. And escalates into one of the most memorable final acts in film history. Over the course of its final half hour, Mother! will mesmerize, if not madden. The spectacle that ensues will either be devoured as brilliance or denied as insanity, but no one will say it is boring.<br/><br/>At its core, Mother! is the story of woman who is a passenger in her own life. Her husband, a famous poet, is dismissive of her desires and feelings. So, too, is everyone she interacts with throughout the film. The things she says and does have no authority, receive no respect, and are ignored. Much of the action and dialogue occur off screen, with Mother elsewhere in the house-in the next room, down the hall, upstairs--the events of the film unfolding without her input. The frequent physical separation we see reinforces how little control she has over anything happening in her life. The way she is talked to, discounted, even despised by other characters is rough to watch. Not since 2002's Dirty Pretty Things have I felt such visceral discomfort watching the complete powerlessness of a character. To that end, the film's writer/director, Darren Aronofsky, masterfully keeps the camera close to Lawrence's Mother throughout. He forces us to experience life in her shoes. Simply put: she is often as powerless over her own story as are those watching the film. And the frequently disorienting close-ups on Mother as she moves throughout the house amplify what is already uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>In classic Aronofsky fashion, symbols, metaphors, and allusions abound. The film explores ideas concerning the environment, idol worship, patriarchy, and the nature of creation and destruction. That's a lot to unpack. But for those who enjoy stories told as puzzles which you need to piece together yourself, there is much fun to be had in making sense of it all.<br/><br/>The best caution I can offer: know what you're walking into. Aronofsky's prior films, particularly The Fountain, offer insight into the risks he is willing to take in his storytelling. If you saw his commercially most successful film, Black Swan, and thought to yourself, that was weird-but not in a good way-you will more than likely hate this film. Mother! is not a straight story. It is not an easy film to watch. It will make you feel things you might not want to feel. It will make you work, hard, to make meaning of the visual metaphors and countless allusions. Mother! is a brilliant but challenging film. More than quality-and I vehemently defend the film's acting, directing, writing-acceptance of this film will come down to personal preference. So, if psychological terror and unconventional storytelling are your cup of tea, you're in luck. And to you, my friends, drink up!"

This is a piece of Art! While I don't like the hunger games movies but I love the beautiful Jennifer Lawrence here, and also Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer does it so well and Ed Harris is greatly casted in this movie.

"Shred_Master","6","0","1","5 February 2018"," A decent drama that turns into...a religious allegory?
","So, we all know how divisive this movie was when it was released. After finally seeing it, my thoughts are a bit like the film was, all over the place.<br/><br/>It starts out simply enough. Jennifer Lawrence's character is working hard to repair her house from, well they don't really tell you but you find out later, while her husband (Javier Bardiem), a famous poet, is struggling with writer's block. Some unwelcome guests drop by, because they think it's a hotel, rather than a house. It turns out, that's just barely scratching the surface. More and more guests come by as more drama unfolds. Then, after a tense standoff between husband and wife occurs, as if on cue, they conceive a baby. During her pregnancy, she has to endure the constant flow of strangers at the house. Then, a deadly family battle royale among the guests, a rave, a war battle and a SWAT raid all occur within the confines of their house. That's when you realize that there is more going on than your eyes are telling you.<br/><br/>The moment happens when the baby is born but Mother's happiness is short lived, as the baby is plucked from her, offered up to the guests and devoured. This is the moment when I said ok, what is the point of all this? Really? Understandably, Lawrence is enraged and starts killing the guests, leading to the penultimate moment where she causes the house to explode, killing everyone inside, except for her and her husband. Then we see him carrying her, lying her down and taking her heart out, which is supposed to represent the last thing she has to give, her love. Then the house resets and we see her wake up again, the same way the very beginning of the movie happens.<br/><br/>So of course, I had to look up what the heck this all meant. I am not a very religious person and I haven't been to a parochial school since I was a pre-teen. It turns out, this is a retelling of the story of the bible. Bardiem's character is God, Lawrence's character Mother Nature (now I get the ""Mother!"" title), the first batch of houseguests Adam and Eve, the baby was Jesus and so forth. Now that I understand the movie, I have to ask, why did Aronofsky want to do this movie? I also understand now the animosity from Lawrence that led to their breakup, ""can we not talk about Mother? I would like to talk about something else for once!"" Yeah, it wasn't a good decision to do this. I can understand that the more religious demographic will think this is brilliant but I find it disturbing for the sake of it. Don't get me wrong, I am a horror movie fan and I don't scare or disturb easily but I think he just wanted to put together horror elements, while excusing them by saying, ""oh, it's just the bible."" If it was just a slasher flick, it probably wouldn't get all that much attention but because it represents the bible, all of a sudden it's brilliant, is nominated for Oscars and what not. I don't buy into it.<br/><br/>I think at the end of the day, I would have enjoyed it more if they just stuck with the drama between the husband and wife and the houseguests and not went off the rails with all the horror elements. I understand that would have defeated the purpose but again, why would anyone want to do this? It's not interesting and it just makes all the disturbing content seem cheap and pointless. Either be a drama or be a horror movie but don't use religion as a base, because it's rather, as the British say, daft."

","If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, it's a clear sign of how generally reviled Darren Aronofsky's mother! was, as it's monumentally clear that nothing like it - at least with a $30 million budget made by consummately safe Hollywood players - will probably ever be attempted or allowed again. That's somewhat of a shame, as mother! is a genuine risk, and doubly so made by a mainstream Hollywood studio. A bizarre social experiment in aggressively polarizing arthouse wackiness disastrously mismarketed as Blair Witch style horror (an entire other movie could be made about the inevitable Hunger Games diehards walking out, bug-eyed and traumatized), mother! is a ferocious howl into the wind of a film. It's a surrealist Biblical allegory by way of gruelling, abjective Von Trier/Jodorowski-esq social satire, with scathing commentary on ideological gender disparity, the environment, mass media, the artistic process, and the breaking point of societal social norms, punctuated with some of the most harrowing imagery committed to cinema in years. It's a rough, beguiling, frequently frustrating, and utterly uncompromising fever dream of a film, and an intentionally difficult watch. In short: not exactly an airy, carefree Friday night popcorn romp. Still, Aronofsky's feverish vomit of ideas and themes are (overall) worth sifting through and grappling with, if only for the delirious pub night conversation to follow. <br/><br/>In terms of what the film is actually about... that's a matter of interpretation. Allegories span the Book of Genesis to the experience of childbirth to the sheer angst of waiting for overstaying party guests to leave so you can finally go to bed, though Aronofsky teasingly suggesting the film play as a double-bill with his 2014 Noah is a bit of a hat-tip. The thematic common denominator, in short, seems to be that the world is a fundamentally sh*tty place - and a fundamentally sh*tty place to be a woman specifically. The pathetic fallacy sinks it home with appropriate ickiness, with blood oozing from floorboards and squirting from exploding lightbulbs, as the walls crinkle and burn, exposing a throbbing internal heart, in feverish episodes which could be anything from mini-seizures to foreshadowing. Aronofsky accentuates the isolation with a disquieting lack of music and sickeningly claustrophobic cinematography (you can count the number of shots not primarily filled by Jennifer Lawrence's face or body on one hand), making the Grand Guignol grotesquery and proliferation of bodily fluids of all kinds all the more in-your-face. <br/><br/>Still, in the face of the histrionics to come, it's the film's first act that crawls under the skin arguably more memorably. A black comedy of manners, Aronofsky allows his pair of perturbingly oblivious uninvited house guests (Ed Harris - goofily cheery with just a glint of sinister unpredictability, and the utterly terrifying, scene-stealing Michelle Pfeiffer, like the Angel of Death circa Sex in the City) to push the boundaries of social acceptability like a nightmarish version of If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. It's an appropriately unnerving calm(ish) before the storm, and subtly twisted enough to squeeze out barks of uncomfortable laughter amidst the frowns and cringes. For the love of God, get off the sink. <br/><br/>One takeaway, which has most viewers particularly up in arms, reads the film as a life-imitates-art parable of artistic muses and the creative process, and an uneasy romance between a demure young muse and a tormented Creator twice her age (hmm... that sounds familiar). Reducing the film as such doesn't quite do it justice, but the cynical eye-rolling at its problematically antiquated gender roles is very fair, just as the antiquated arthouse trope of women grotesquely, violently suffering to underscore a thematic point is done to grisly, unearned excess here. Naturally, it all escalates to a hysterical boiling point, where Aronofsky doesn't just jump the shark so much as pole-vault the seven seas here, with a batsh*t climax seemingly geared to offend as many mainstream sensibilities as possible, and prompting even the most jaded viewers' jaws to plummet like a cartoon pantomime of Jim Carrey in The Mask. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, in a movie rife with chaotic imbalances, Jennifer Lawrence's formidably commanding performance provides a gravitational anchor throughout. Functionally a timid, 1950s housewife plopped into the middle of The Revenant, Lawrence is in almost every shot of the film, and the sheer mountainous deluges of feelings that burst out of her as she is raked over proverbial and literal broken glass, as well as every other imaginable tribulation, is exhaustingly worthwhile. Javier Bardem is similarly sickeningly magnetic, an enigmatic mix of charismatic and charming as much as he is sterile and sinister. And, as the conflict elevates to increasingly kitchen sink levels of insanity, Domhnall Gleeson, Kristen Wiig, and Stephen McHattie each pop up when least expected, generating performances as rawly affecting, only to disappear with as little fanfare. <br/><br/>Is there any value or remotion in mother!? Well, brushing aside all pontificating on how subjective an experience cinema is, it's safe to say that Aronofsky's film isn't meant to be 'liked' so much as seep in like a vicious hangover, its aftertaste like the sweaty, throbbing clarity that comes after a bout of violently throwing up. It's loud, abrasive, and clumsy, and its ideas are calamitously assembled at best (even Aronofsky, in the midst of animatedly unpacking his motivation, eventually sheepishly confessed ""It's probably best not to overthink it""). But as a raw cauldron of feeling and primordial angst, mother! takes bold, unsolicited chances, and, as Hollywood releases are increasingly taken to task for being placid and safe, it's too much of a worthwhile experimentation of sweat, fire and bile not to champion, problematic, confusing, and displeasurable as it may frequently be. Suffice to say - whether you find mother! fascinating or traumatizing, it is one of the few movies you will genuinely never forget. <br/><br/>-7/10"
"riaghan","9","0","2","20 January 2018"," A visionary mythical interpretation of the human story,
","If a story doesn't leave an impression, we as an audience are unsatisfied, in the case of ""Mother!"", I fell as though it has left a permanent scar.. . In the best way possible of course. (As I felt with ""Requiem for a Dream"")
The tension that this film brings to the viewer along with the brutal reality of human behaviour is horrific and confronting. As with any storyteller trying to speak about such a grand narrative as the journey of humankind, things are going to get real and nasty. But as an audience we should judge a film by many things; the story, the performances, the cinematography, the set design, the editing, the audio and most importantly how all of these things and the many others combine together as one. In the case of ""Mother!"" these various categories are all executed to the highest of levels. Aronofsky creates such beautiful and equally dangerous worlds and ""Mother!"" is no exception.
This is another one of Aronofsky's emotional roller coasters that will either enthrall the viewer who is up for the challenge or repel the viewer who would rather not have to engage with a film on a deeper level."
"Ricardo98","8","0","1","19 January 2018"," A work of art
","I really liked this movie from a visual standpoint. The cinematography is gorgeous, the hand-held shots put us in the same frame of mind as the main character Mother, without breaking your immersion or becoming too nauseating, like in the first ""Hunger Games"". This in turns helps you to connect with and understand Mother, how she feels, what she's going through, all because the camera shows us; the direct result of this, is that we can empathise with her and thus care where the plot is going, which is any director's dream. <br/><br/>On top of that you have Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem bringing in a pair of excellent performances, alongside a string of supporting actors, who are able to hold their own too. The acting coupled with the dialogue, really enriches the story, where every expression and word has meaning if you look hard enough and are familiar with the source material. <br/><br/>I really liked the plot. The movie is essentially a culmination of different events in The Bible from beginning to end, put within a modern context, told through the perspective of a character we wouldn't expect, through the lens of a director, who just so happens to be an atheist; if that won't get you so see the movie then I don't know what will. <br/><br/>The movie has something to say behind it. It raises awareness and questions on the nature of humanity, how we treat the planet, as well as God and if he's real, what part he has to play in all of this; how complicit is he?<br/><br/>This move will no doubt stir up some religious and non-religious folks, with the representation of God and humanity as a whole, which I, personally, find accurate and aligns with some of my own views.<br/><br/>One thing to take into account is that The Bible, just like any other book or work of art, will speak to everyone differently, because no two people are the same. So I would say going in, view ""Mother!"" as a representation of the director's interpretation of The Bible and what it means to him. It may not align with your own and the general Christian populace's viewpoint, but that's what makes it intriguing; it's unique and different. <br/><br/>Aside from the visual aspects, the plot and the themes, I really loved the movie sound-wise too. I loved the house, which is the setting for the movie and interestingly, is the basis for the soundtrack and all that could be heard on-screen throughout the movie, was the creaks and cracks as the characters make their way around the wooden house. This added a sense of a naturalistic and/or organic environment, which supported the material even more, considering that the house is essentially a symbol for Earth. <br/><br/>In closing: Yes this movie is controversial, I understand why people love it, I understand why people hate it; people's opinions are completely polarised. But that's a good thing, movies should have conversation and controversy around them, it keeps everything fun, fresh and exciting. I'd rather see a movie that steps out and isn't afraid to try something different, even if it means less critical and commercial success, rather than something that takes a step back and stays in a box, never trying something new, playing it safe, pandering to what the audiences want, or what they think they want. <br/><br/>""Mother!"" takes a step forward; it's unique and interesting and it features a different take on the stories found within The Bible and it also has a social commentary on the modern world interwoven throughout, projecting all the issues in which we face. The movie is excels in directing, in the script, as well as the acting. Overall I'd give this movie a 8/10."

The bad reviews come from people who didn't really understand the metaphors presented and expected God knows what. They can only blame themselves for their projection based on their expectations and not the author.<br/><br/>The story is a well balanced, very increasingly tense and very well filmed biblical metaphor. It depicts human kind as is, and that's the most terrifying aspect of this movie. I believe that the author of this masterpiece has put a lot of himself in the story. <br/><br/>I gave it 9 stars out of 10 because I think that the cyclical series of events could be presented in a better fashion, meaning that the beginning and the end of the movie kinda spoiled (over explained) the metaphor, much like the Lars von Triers movies Antichrist and Melancholia.

After that things become too large for real life and enters into the realm of dreams and metaphors.<br/><br/>Kafkaesque immensely existential. With its sense of isolation and ever building anxiety. The woman is completely in love and yet blissfully trustful of a man who doesn't actually love her and uses her for her passion, vitality and inspiration. <br/><br/>The characters spoke with certainty and without doubt, being almost perfect archetypes for what they represented. The young girl going from complete innocence in love, to her and her house being ravished by the horrors of the world. the characters had no ambivalence when speaking. Every statement was said with conviction. People came in and ruined her house in increasingly horrible and almost humorous and even biblical ways in its magnitude until she was backed up against a wall and had to fight and scream, albeit to little too late. <br/><br/>The piece is an all encompassing phantasmagoria of motherhood, fatherhood, tending to ones ""house"" and humankind. The piece starts off with a slow tempo and retains a sense of building apprehension throughout, crescendoing to a 10 minute climax in which the movie ends where it begins, bringing things full circle."
"michaelRokeefe","7","0","3","12 January 2018"," Disturbing psychological thriller.
","Jennifer Lawrence made me watch it! Darren Aronofsky directs and writes this unique and draining exercise in human relationship. A couple's marriage is put to the test in an ultimate manner. Miss Lawrence is married to an introverted writer in a secluded large home being remodeled. Lawrence will be referred to as Mother and Javier Bardem is her somewhat pretentious writer husband. Their relationship is subjected to slow boiling aggravation when some uninvited guests show up and split any domestic bliss. The guests keep coming and Mother becomes claustrophobic and very possessive. Her marriage is being challenged and her home is literally being demolished.<br/><br/>A very heavy atmosphere and a slew of sequences that need explaining.

","Normally I don't like weird movies. Movies with no real answers, where you lack the satisfaction you need after watching a story unfold. Most of the time, like almost every time, I hate those movies. And I can get why this movie divides people in haters and lovers. But for once I'm going to be on the side of the people that liked it. The story is starting quite normal, but the last half hour is just completely crazy, absolute madness, that's the least you could say. It surprised me completely. I wonder what kind of drugs the director took to come up with such a story. The reason I liked it was because Mother! made me feel very aware of my emotions. I started being angry and talked outloud about the things I would do in real life if I was in the place of Jennifer Lawrence. The acting was really good. Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence just smashed it. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, that I barely recognized, were also very good in playing that crazy couple. It's been awhile that I had mixed feelings about a movie. Do I hate it? Do I love it? Love is too strong, but I definitely liked it.

"parramina","6","0","2","12 January 2018"," Almost gave up but
","I'm no movie critic & I'm new to this but here goes...
*Spoilers* Mother! @#$&*% this was one of the most overwhelming, disturbing, slow, overbearing, frustrating, infuriating, brilliant, thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time. The first hour I wanted to take a nap. I'm quite sure I had this wtf glazed look on my face. It was really slow for the first hour. I almost stopped watching, but hung in there & I got it. Movie makers are like artists that have this vision that is open to interpretation. Usually you're going to get it or you're just not. I can see how it looks like a mess & hard to understand but besides the biblical metaphors what I saw too were metaphors for society. For example Him character for the first half of the movie seems kind, he opens his house to these strangers. He seems to be a humble person but winds up basking in the adoration & validation of his ""fans"" just like I've seen people in social media that start out kind but let these likes, followers, praise go to their head & their ego gets out of control. They become monsters to an extent. He let these people sacrifice his own child in the most disturbing way cause he wanted to please them. Jennifer, the Mother Earth character gives so much of herself & people take advantage more & more, disrespecting, till it reaches this fever pitch. I know it's hard to watch but think about how we treat the best things- the earth, our families, people, animals - people do the most horrible things, we as human beings break things, ruin things, take them for granted often times to pursue money, desires, fame, etc not thinking about the consequences down the road or how it might affect someone. They took from her until they killed her. Honestly at the end I understood her rage, the scorched earth feelings that seeped out of every pore. You get to the point where you see what's going on in the world around you & feel helpless. You think what can I do to change things against all odds sometimes. She said she had nothing left to give - that goes with anything you mistreat, eventually something has to give. It bends till it breaks. Great acting as well, you could almost feel when Jennifer was having these panic attack moments. It's not a movie for everyone & idk if people will get what I saw but it's open to interpretation."

","This is a true artist's look at life and its cycle, the beginning and the end. Life of Earth (mother Earth), God and man, represented by the mob. It has a lot of references and allegory, not sure I got all of it and I'm pretty sure I did misunderstand some of it or interpreted it my way.<br/><br/>It felt very random for about 2/3 of the runtime but in the end it all made perfect sense. You don't have to be super smart to understand multiple messages the it is trying to give. After completing it backtracking to some scenes make much more sense and it all starts to catch up to you.<br/><br/>It is very heavy on religious motives and stories as well (kind of what you expect from Aronofsky). I'm not a religious person yet it wasn't so hard for me to understand those, since those are just compiled symbolic stories about the nature of man.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a well crafted feature. I can't really call this a movie since it kind of isn't. If you expect it to have movie structure, character arcs and any sort of resolution you won't find it here. I was surprised to see how many people confused this for a horror flick or something and thus gave this 1/10. <br/><br/>If your mind is open and you want to give yourself some material to think about, give this a try."
"VVMini","10","0","3","9 January 2018"," A surrealistic masterpiece
","I can't pretend to understand everything/anything of what was going on in Darren Aronofsky's Mother!. I'm sure far more intelligent people have tried to dissect its ideas and worded them far more eloquently than I ever could. <br/><br/>All I can say is that I was just consistently drawn to everything that was on screen, from the intriguing and mysterious opening images to their equally as intriguing and mysterious closing counterparts. I loved the slow build up from quiet discomfort and unsettling imagery to complete batsh!t insanity at the end. At the simplest and most superficial level , I just felt such a deep sympathy for Jennifer Lawrence's character. Watching people taking such disadvantage of her hospitality was harrowing to the bone. I guess that is some sort of metaphor for the destructive nature of mankind and how we treat Mother Nature, as well as other human beings. Again, I leave that for the more philosophically inclined among us to ponder. <br/><br/>Looking at it purely cinematically, I thought it was gorgeously shot. There was a sense of discomfort and dread all throughout, without relying on cheap jumpscares or other gimmicks. Leave it to Aronofsky to give us plentiful colourful and gorgeous imagery. It had a very similar surreal vibe to The Fountain, another movie of his that I love. It came across as very organic and realistic, despite the obvious surrealistic nature of what was transpiring. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was excellent, particularly in the first half of the movie. Seeing as she was the focus of pretty much every single shot, she needed to be. She was at her best as the friendly, but increasingly disgruntled and frustrated hostess. I do think in the more dramatic and loud scenes she has a tendency to become too screechy and somewhat over-the-top, but for the insanity of this movie, I think it worked. Javier Bardem's character is consistently sympathetic and frustrating throughout, a solid job by him as well as the rest of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>All in all, another fantastic addition to an already impressive resume by Aranofsky. He is one of the best film makers currently around, and I am deeply excited and intrigued to see what he comes up with next."

","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped. I was eager to see this, I had heard so much about it. <br/><br/>Writer/director Aronofsky has always said he makes a movie to leave an impression, he has to make viewers think and react. He has no desire to make a middle of the road, nice movie.<br/><br/>""Mother"" starts off like a pretty ordinary movie, the wife wakes up, her husband is not in bed, she finds him downstairs. He is a somewhat successful author, a poet, and they live alone in a big house surrounded by a big field. We see at the very beginning the house had been almost destroyed by a fire but the Mother (as played by Jennifer Lawrence) has worked diligently to bring it back to its original condition. Not much out of the ordinary there. Her husband is Javier Bardem simply as Him.<br/><br/>However as the story progresses things get stranger and stranger, starting with a man, then joined by his wife, they break something valuable, their adult sons show up, they fight over jealousy, one kills the other. Adam, Eve, Abel, and Cain immediately come to mind.<br/><br/>As the story progresses we see more and more that Mother and the house itself represent Nature and the world, people come into it, become careless, personal pleasure trumps responsibility. Aronofsky has called himself ""Godless"" so he has to create his own kinds of God and he does it in his movies. This one is perhaps his clearest example so far. <br/><br/>Not a movie for everyone, as many of the ""1"" votes and unflattering reviews show, but taken as a novel viewing experience it in fact is a very interesting take on humanity. I say enjoy it for the movie-making craft if for nothing else. Don't read past the spoilers following.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As the house is getting overrun with more and more we realize it strays further from a possible reality, it begins to represent all the bad things that have happened in the world. Finally disgusted with the whole thing Mother causes a furnace oil spill in the basement, ignites it, and explodes the whole house and everyone in it. She burns to a crisp but Him, representing the Creator, is unharmed. He reaches in and grabs the crystal from Mother's body, and it becomes the spark for a new beginning. We see the house re-forming and a scene identical to the opening scene where a new Mother wakes up in bed. We see her face, it is not the same one as before. The world has a new beginning."

They create, and are swept up in, events that are implausible and unrealistic. I found it difficult to remain engaged or care about what I was watching as a consequence, and it made the film drag on for too long.<br/><br/>When I subsequently discovered that the characters are supposed to represent mother earth, and god, and biblical notions like Adam and Eve etc, the contrivance at least made sense. But, for the me, the fact that it feels so contrived just highlights how pointless the whole endeavour really is.<br/><br/>They were trying to tell an allegorical tale, I get it.

Mother also symbolizes all the men and women who want to do good. The husband is the corruption of Ego and the symbol of men in power abusing (often without even thinking) women and those weaker than them. He also symbolizes absurd manmade religions and cult figures who take advantage of fear, greed, ignorance, hate, etc. There are too many symbols to get into here. 
 In short, we are bitch slapped for our failure to appreciate our abundant environment, our horrific failure to embrace our ultimate power and only salvation, which is Unconditional Love (we just don't seem to learn). If we don't take care of Mother, Mother in all it's symbols will not take care of us. I challenge all who choose to see this film to think and make their own additional arguments and interpretations."

","This movie is an absolute gem and work of art. I know that Aronofsky films aren't for everyone but I highly recommend this movie even if you're not into allegorical storytelling. Each character in this film is a metaphor for something, and each plot trope an allegory of some sort. If anyone happens to watch it, keep in mind that she is Mother Nature and the husband represents god or mankind in general. If you keep that in mind, the movie will make perfect sense. It's great visual poetry that delves into the destructive nature of mankind to both nature and itself. It's a very cynical story, and if it would have ended on a more uplifting and inspiring note, it may have gotten better reviews."
"kosmasp","10","0","5","31 December 2017"," Many ways ... many views ... many feelings
","You can tell by how people react to reviews on this, that they have made up their mind. The director himself likes the fact the movie does not leave people without emotions. Be it joy for liking it or hate for disliking it. Even strong annoyance if you feel that hate is too strong a word is well received. And we also know that the director does have a tendency to go religious on us.<br/><br/>That is not a bad thing but it may be helpful for the viewer who want to know what is going on. Or want answers! They are sort of written down ... in a book. But this is not just the making of ... this can also be seen as an allegory on many other things. And Darren is not someone who'd squash anyones view on the matter. He said he made one movie, but he welcomes any other interpretation. And there is a lot to discover.<br/><br/>If you are open and receiving for the way the movie tells its story, for the way the characters behave (because they can be pretty annoying, especially out of context, but even if you get certain things, it'll be pretty stressing to see certain things happen) ... with certain life experiences, different feelings may arise while watching. That's why everyone watches a different movie (subjectively speaking). Yet there are so many universal themes (or even otherworldly?) in it, that there should be something for everybody.<br/><br/>Again slow pacing and agonizing horror are front and center. Though almost nothing can prepare you for that last part of the movie. Then again I wouldn't want it any other way myself. I was at the edge of my seat - even when I was frustrated by things happening. A movie that dares you to think all the time and is made for multiple viewings. And for a movie that is aiming for head/brain rather than the heart, it is able to get quite a lot of emotion from anyone watching ..."

","And then you find out it will never be over for the characters! Because, in fact (major spoiler here), this is a loop-de-loop movie with the last scene being identical to the first scene. What does that show? The last scene reveals that everything is starting all over again: ghosts who are caught in an endless circle of errors will continue to repeat their errors mindlessly time after time. <br/><br/>There is an old idea that if someone dies in a horrific, ""unsatisfying"" way, then their ""ghost"" may hang around for as long as it takes to resolve the contradictions of his/her death. With that in mind, since everyone in the movie is burned to death alive, everyone will be doomed to repeat this vicious cycle from the beginning until one or all do not make the same mistakes they made in the last days of their lives.<br/><br/>The movie makes sense if you consider that everyone you see must be a ghost - the four major characters and all the members of the crowd who invade the house. First, there is the Jennifer Lawrence character who never takes the opportunity to walk out on the nightmare of a husband she has who marginalizes her, neglects her and overrides all her wishes - the ultimate sexist; the Javier Bardem character who is so in love with himself as a writer that he non-stop feeds off of the admiration of the people who show up at his house, while never listening to his wife's pleas that he stop letting everyone into the house; the Michelle Pfeiffer character who undermines Lawrence and defers meekly to her controlling husband even when it hurts her own kids; the Ed Harris character who writes the dumbest will in the world which leaves his money to one son on the condition that everyone ""cooperate"" on the dispensation of funds. The resulting murder of one son by the other son is not surprising given that the parents have continually pit their sons against each other.<br/><br/>The crowd commits unforgivable ""sins"" such as pulling out fixtures in the house, literally destroying every room in the house, and then finally participating in the most disgusting, shocking scene in the movie which is to tear the tiny new-born baby limb from limb and to feast on its flesh so as to be ""closer"" to the great Bardem writer's essence, as if by that act they will elevate themselves to some plateau of personal esthetic value and purity that is supposedly encapsulated in the very existence of Bardem. Here you do get the idea of eating the flesh of the son of God.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people think this is a religious movie, but I think it's just a good old-fashioned ghost story about people who lived and died tragically, and who cannot find peace even in death,"

"kaptenvideo-89875","8","0","1","28 December 2017"," Aronofsky is back, and wants to make love to your brain more than ever!
","A couple's (Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem) tranquil existence in their majestic home is tested when uninvited guests started arriving at the door.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you liked the trailer or not, ""mother!"" is so unlike a regular movie that a regular review couldn't do it justice.<br/><br/>In fact, I wouldn't even know how to write one about it. So I don't, and try to jot down my most direct thoughts indeed.<br/><br/>What is ""mother!"" exactly, you probably ask while watching writer-director Darren Aronofsky's latest. Is it just an artsy (horror) movie? A political movie (some notice and center on its alleged pro-environment, anti-patriarchy or anti-immigrants message, for example)? A spiritual movie (biblical or otherwise)?<br/><br/>Based on the comments by the man himself, which I have read online, I get the feeling that it can be any and all of them, depending on what you are prepared to see.<br/><br/>But first and foremost it sure is artsy, so be prepared for 121 minute chaotic joyride which may look and feel like horror but is more about experience than belonging to a genre, or, indeed, telling clear coherent story.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's works are usually difficult to summarize, and ""mother!"" continues the tradition.<br/><br/>I happen to think that ""mother!"" is best understood and appreciated as a story of act of creation, be it in the shape of biblical allegory or human being's spiritual awakening (two versions of the same thing if you ask me).<br/><br/>In social dancing, there's a saying that woman is the picture and the man is the frame. It's probably due to my background as a social dancer, but ""mother!"" worked for me using that lens exactly.<br/><br/>I saw that act of creation needs both, frame and picture (content). Both are important and can't exist without each other, both are in some ways necessary to tear down the old and bring in the new. And both can be good or bad, depending on our viewpoint.<br/><br/>If, for some reason, you can't quite appreciate ""mother!"" as spiritual or artsy movie, there's also other angles to consider, at least for movie lovers. Aronofsky's latest echoes of different genres, directors and works.<br/><br/>For example, I was reminded of Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Birdman"" and ""The Revenant"", for how the camera is almost always up close and personal, in your face. Or ""Tree of Life"" for general feeling and approach to storytelling. Or some southern gothic stuff, even Sofia Coppola's ""The Beguiled"". Or even Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"", for setup and how it begins to evolve.<br/><br/>But beyond all the comparisions one can come up with, it's fresh and original work on its own.<br/><br/>The long last chapter - I will call it the creation section - is especially outlandish and defying easy descriptions, for both what happens on screen and how it's directed. It's so chaotic, always changing and yet majestically orchestrated that I just can't find words. Everything is in motion, everything is shattered. It's cool.<br/><br/>I liked the actors too. Lawrence is in her top form, as somebody living through a personal nightmare, plus camera almost always up close and personal. Bardem stays on the background, he's cool but not among the most interesting players here.<br/><br/>Then there are intriguing turns from Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, a long-lost American sweetheart from 1980-90's. We also see Domhnall Gleeson, Brian Gleeson, Kristen Wiig...<br/><br/>I like the comment of this one critic that ""mother!"" is easy to respect and hard to like, but I managed to do both.<br/><br/>It's too difficult to recommend, but do Aronofsky's movie need recommending at all? Based on his earlier works, you already know whether you are intrigued to see it or not."

","I feel this film is given negative reviews for all of the wrong reasons. This film should not be judged off of sensitive people that prematurely give reviews, lacking any kind of thought following their viewing. Saying that the film misogynistic, gruesome, or that it sucks because it doesn't make any sense is just silly. Yes, there are a lot of confusing parts in this movie - a lot of things that you won't understand unless you put forth effort into discussion, research, and thought. This is obviously a highly symbolic and metaphorical film. I promise you that if you try, you will find meaning to the contents of this film. If you don't like what you find after that, only then will your review be valid in my eyes. The only ""fact"" you can go off of as to what the meaning of the film is and how that is portrayed is by what the director says - and quite honestly, that's also subjective. If you don't like movies that challenge you to think and in some cases come up with the meaning for things on your own, then this movie is not for you. Yes, this film can be frustrating to watch sometimes but the overall theme and general meaning behind it supports that beautifully if you actually think about it. For me, the movie was fairly enjoyable to watch. Some parts did irritate me because it simply got unrealistic and redundant. Also, the pacing of the film was a problem for me. All in all the full came full circle quite nicely and I walked away with something interesting to think about. After some thought, the overall experience of the movie (during and after) was pretty good. That's what a movie is, right? An experience."
"lorridaz","7","0","1","27 December 2017"," A great return to true horror - had it not had a $30 million budget...
","Let's face it - great horror flicks are hard to come by these days. If you can't pick the killer five minutes in, don't have an exorcism or it's not full of absolute carnage, then Hollywood generally won't touch it. This was a different animal altogether. <br/><br/>Despite having a cast of highly paid all stars, this had the potential to be the stuff of low budget legend and anyone who was around when ""Requiem For A Dream"" came out will remember than Aronofsky can unsettle an audience to the point of turning away. <br/><br/>Unfortunately though, this constantly felt like Hollywood's version of an independent horror film. There were so many parallels and references to ""Rosemary's Baby"" it was as if they were trying to reinvent it. That said, the movie is very unnerving and the actors are so good that it is genuinely frightening. <br/><br/>All in all, despite some of the super harsh reviews it's getting on IMDb (probably by people under 21 who don't remember that part of a great classic horror was NOT knowing what was going on from minute one) Mother! is likely to be on the cult favourites list in ten years time."
"shuswapgirl","8","0","1","26 December 2017"," Very enjoyable once you know the story Aronofsky is telling!
","I am shocked by all the long winded reviews by people who tell us flat out that they do not understand what is going on. <br/><br/>I admit that I was not paying attention to the story in the beginning because I was so put off by JLaws appearance (Mother!) and how young she looks compared to her partner (Him), however this is key to the story.<br/><br/>I was also a bit turned off by the next two characters to appear (Man, Woman) in the movie, which is when I figured out what story Aronofsky was telling. And this was confirmed by the arrival of the next two characters (Oldest Son, Younger Brother).<br/><br/>For anyone who still has not figured it out ***SPOILERS***, <br/><br/>Aronofsky is telling a synopsis of the Christian bible. From the book of Genesis, it starts with the creation (Him + Mother (mother earth), Adam and Eve (Man and woman, and their children Cain and Abel), the flood (destruction of the house which causes Mother to be covered in water), and the progressive chaos in the world; moving into the New Testament, we see the birth of the Saviour and his subsequent death, then the apocalypse and the final destruction of creation and the rebirth of creation (with a new mother earth) as described in The Book of the Revelation.<br/><br/>I am sorry that so many people did not get this movie, and that just shows where we are in the world that so few recognize what is being shown to them, however that is also part of the prophecy of the bible, that people would follow false gods because they do not recognize the Truth. Once you do see it, it becomes a puzzle to solve, only deciding which parts of the bible are in the movie as you continue to watch it.<br/><br/>My first real clue to what was going on was the injury to Man's rib area that we see when he is in the bathroom. My suspicions were confirmed by the two brothers fighting over their inheritance, which is the classic story of Cain and Abel.<br/><br/>I agree that this movie is a psychological horror film to those who do not understand the underlying story."

The most harrowing film of the year and also the most divisive."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","23 December 2017"," Can a film be brilliant if you need help to figure out what it's about?
","When a film presents as a mystery, we come to expect that at some pivotal point in the story the filmmaker will reveal the film's true nature to us. Those of us story-consumers who chase after mysteries and thrillers do so for that feeling of profound epiphany when everything clicks, illuminating the past and setting the stage for a riveting finale. <br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has not made that kind of mystery. ""Mother!"" it turns out, is an allegory - a story that on the surface appears to be about one thing but is actually symbolic of another - in other words, no one's going to spell the true nature out for you. That's the poetic beauty of an allegory; either you find the perspective that allows you to intuit its meaning, or you don't.<br/><br/>So for many viewers, ""Mother!"" will be a confounding, maybe even terrible movie until a quick Google search for its meaning makes everything crystal clear. Once you know, you know, but the debate around ""Mother!"" will be whether Aronofsky's creative concept is nothing but pretentious preaching if the average viewer has to visit the movie's IMDb trivia page to understand it. <br/><br/>""Mother!"" immediately shrouds itself in secrets, beckoning us to guess them and pay shrewd attention to the story's details. From the opening shots there's a magical, surrealist element at play, but one we assume to be part of the film's hidden secrets rather than part of the film's very fabric. Recognizing this is a key to cracking the allegory without ""cheating."" <br/><br/>We meet Jennifer Lawrence's character, who lives with her husband (Javier Bardem) in a beautiful, secluded house - his house - that she has lovingly and painstakingly restored after a fire. He is a famous poet, but he has struggled to produce his next great work, and that preoccupation has made her feel neglected and forgotten. When a mysterious man (Ed Harris) and later his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up at the house, their questionable guest manners exacerbate the situation and suddenly things spiral out of control.<br/><br/>At surface level, the film is a homemaker's (and anyone who believes in order and structure's) worst nightmare - guests who come in out of nowhere and overrun you and ignore all the rules. If Aronofsky fails at conveying all his other messages, he doubtless succeeds at creating a powerful empathy for his main character, and that's probably the most important of all the elements this story needs to work. This also requires an actor who makes that easier and few talents today are as beloved as Lawrence. Her character serves as a stand-in for our own frustrations and confusion at what's happening around her and expertly conveys the hopelessness of losing control.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is too tough to dive into without spoilers, but things get pretty off the rails, especially if the film's meaning hasn't become clearer by the final act. Even so, only having a hint at some of the themes and ideas that are at work in this movie isn't really enough to bring audiences on board with some of the events and challenging visuals of the tumultuous finale. <br/><br/>Aronofsky at least deserves credit for the filmmaking. ""Mother!"" has a riveting intensity to it from start to finish which is all the more impressive when you realize there hasn't been a note of a musical score in the entire film. There's a reason 99 percent of films use music and that Aronofsky makes a compelling thriller without one earns him accolades regardless of whether the experience felt like a waste of time.<br/><br/>Anyone who does discover (or Google) what ""Mother!"" is about will surely see some if not a ton of brilliance in Aronofsky's vision, but can it truly be brilliance if it requires ""help"" from outside the film like some kind of secret decoder ring? Objectively, one would think not, but once you have that decoder, it becomes impossible not to see the film through that lens and begin rabidly reassessing the entire experience.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that cryptic films have been made before and some of the great ones do convey their ideas clearly enough to connect with an audience during the experience of that art. ""Mother!"" fails in that regard, and so even with Aronofsky's incredible ideas, vision and storytelling, it can't be hailed as great without discrediting the audiences it failed to communicate to through no fault but its own.<br/><br/>But it might just be a masterpiece upon repeat viewings.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"tomgillespie2002","8","0","1","23 December 2017"," Either preposterous nonsense or a cathartic masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky's Mother!, or mother! as it is often printed, has already generated more controversy than most movies can achieve in an entire lifetime. A fever-dream of chaos, violence and nightmarish imagery, Aronofsky's latest seems to provoke extreme reactions from both sides of the spectrum. After its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, the film received both a standing ovation and a chorus of boos. Whether you love it, hate it, or simply cannot make up your mind, Mother! will be successful at yanking a reaction out of you, be it repulsion, confusion or laughter. Yet the biggest shock is not the orgy of brutality at the climax or the religious undertones, but that a major studio would ever fund this at all. Paramount were apparently convinced when star Jennifer Lawrence signed on, but there is little here for fans of The Hunger Games, and not much more for those hoping for a straight-forward haunted house flick.<br/><br/>We open with a woman burning, before apparently jumping forward in time. The house in which the stranger met her demise has been repaired, and is currently being turned into a paradise by 'Mother' (Lawrence). She wants to shape the home into a place of tranquillity for her much older husband, 'Him' (Javier Bardem), an artistically-blocked famous poet who has failed to write any new material in over a year. Things seem peaceful, but something isn't quite right. The house is in the middle of nowhere, hidden away from civilisation, so Mother is shocked when a doctor - billed as 'Man' and played by Ed Harris - turns up at the door claiming to have mistook the house for a B & B. Mother wants to be left alone but Him seems eager for the company. It becomes clear than Man has no intention of leaving when his wife ('Woman', played by Michelle Pfeiffer) turns up at the door. She is obnoxious and rude, carrying a clanking glass and glazed eyes with her wherever she goes, and events start to spiral out of control when their bickering sons (played by Brian and Domhnall Gleeson) also show up.<br/><br/>Things seem to calm down when Mother becomes pregnant, and the couple withdraw into isolation once again. Fatherhood reawakens the artist in Him, and he soon has a new book published. But this only starts to attract more outsiders, which rapidly turns from a small crowd of book fans to a hoard of crazies, who start to systematically destroy the house. Think Gaspar Noe meets some of Ben Wheatley's more extreme works and you can start to grasp the tone of Mother!'s climax. It's a clusterfuck of unpleasantness and claustrophobia, like a house party crashed by Satan himself. Aronofsky makes sure that you're uncomfortable from the very get-go, with camerawork nearly always from point of view of Mother, or directly in her face. Classic horror elements also establish feelings of unease, such as a bleeding floorboard, a dingy basement with a bricked-up wall, and a strange instrument heard through the walls with the appearance of a beating heart. Aronofsky possibly thinks he setting the audience up for the nastiness about to be inflicted on the heroine, but nothing could have really prepared me for the last 40 minutes.<br/><br/>Mother! is one of only a few films I've really had to wrestle with. As I was watching, I felt disgusted, patronised, and in need of a good wash, and the end credits made me feel like I was exhaling for the very first time. As time passed, I could only admire the way in which Aronosky had forced such a physical reaction out of me, and the many ways in which the film can be read. Essentially it's a story of motherhood and creating a home for your family, but it also works as a religious parable, with certain characters clearly stand-ins for figures from the Bible. Most of all, this is an artist's reaction to terrifying reality of our times, with nuclear war, global warming and terrorism a constant threat, and dangerous, unpredictable leaders seated at the head of some of the most powerful countries in the world. The director himself stated that he woke up one morning and spilled out Mother! over the course of four days, and the film certainly reflects Aronofsky's urgent, scribbled approach. It's hard to recommend Mother!, but I would urge anybody to see it at least once. You may find it to be preposterous nonsense or a cathartic masterpiece, and you'd be right either way."

I couldn't tell if the characters had schizophrenia, ptsd, or something else going on. The war themes were piled on too heavily, distorting whatever the viewer thinks is going on. It didn't feel like a cohesive story. I had to look up other reviews to understand what I had just watched."

","This is the most bizarre movie I have ever seen. Nothing made any logical sense for most of it. I've come to the conclusion that the protagonist of the film played by Jennifer Lawrence is actually already dead and is stuck in hell on a loop. The actual hell as in fire and brimstone , the devil etc. Except hell isn't really fire and brimstone. It's torture on repeat. This is her hell and she gets to relive it over and over. What she did to deserve such a fate we don't rightly know but I suspect she killed herself in a house fire/explosion. Everything that happens is completely bizarre, unnatural and surreal. It's everything I imagine hell would be like. I really hope I don't get sent there someday. All in all the movie isn't as bad as people claim if you can go into it knowing that she's already dead.

The way it is filmed, e.g. often in a first-person with the main character, really makes you feel the tension of the main character, which is consistently developing and becoming more intense. Throughout the movie things get more and more tense and uncomfortable for the main character, and the movie does a fantastic job of making you feel that. There is a large focus on the character progressively losing control of themselves and life, and the movie also makes you feel that deeply. The way the movie progresses and how the story is told is non-standard and very enjoyable. The story goes deeper than the screen, but in a way you can appreciate as you are watching the movie.

"dalegaynor","8","0","1","21 December 2017"," There's no sitting on the fence with this one
","Aronofsky's Mother! Seems to be a film dividing audiences in two very distinct segments. You'll either hate it and wonder WTF such a talented cast, crew and studio were thinking or you'll appreciate the challenging story telling and admire it for its boldness and unflinching approach to presenting something quite as vague as this is.
In short, this is a movie which is open to interpretation on nearly all levels. The lack of distinctive plot lines and/or character development could mean you fight the movie all the way through as you try to figure out where you have missed an element that might explain what is happening on screen. 
The movie begins with a scene of Javier Bardem placing a diamond on an altar which seems to cause a previously destroyed house to regenerate to its former glory and Jennifer Lawrence awakening in the bedroom calling for him. The names of the characters are never mentioned, with the story allowing for the interpretation of their characteristics on a meta level rather than a personal one. Bardem is a writer, a poet, a creator whose demeanour around the refurbished home being tended to by Lawrences ""Mother"", is one of frustration and dissatisfaction. He appears to be in love with his ""wife"", who he refers to as perfect, his inspiration and a goddess. You get the sense he is more proud of her than actually in love, as he leaves her constantly to try and breakthrough his creative block. 
Mother has a calm and fragile appearance. Fretting over maintaining their space in the house, tinkering with colours for the render on interior walls using earthy hues and clay like textures. Any disturbances to her environment cause her to experience anxiety attacks which she nullifies by drinking an unknown golden cocktail. She seems to be utterly devoted to her Husband, providing him with support and constantly making food and offers of solace which he continually brushes off.
Soon enough there is a knock at the door and Ed Harris' sickly and presumptuous Man barges his way into the home under the guise of mistaking it for a B&B. He disrupts the relative tranquillity of the house with his constant coughing, smoking, drinking and overly familiar attitude. Bardem seems captivated with the man and invites him to stay. It is also revealed that the man is familiar with Bardems book, having read it many times over his life.
A scene where Lawrence investigates the sounds of someone vomiting downstairs reveals that the man is being nursed by Him after over-imbibing and possibly wounding his chest during the drinking session. 
The next day Michelle Pfeiffers Woman knocks on the door, claiming to be the Mans wife. It is at this point in the movie that the correlation with the biblical tale of Adam and Eve become all too obvious.
The remainder of the movie follows a path tracking a parallel with many of the iconic creationist stories from Genesis. Think Garden of Eden, Cain & Able and many other religious themes.
By the final act of the film the creative block suffered by Him is broken after Mother convinces him to make a child together as a symbol of their love. By the following morning he has written something that ""speaks to every man"" and soon enough people from everywhere are coming to the house looking for him as he soaks up his new-found adoration like a red carpet celebrity. 
After inviting everyone to his house things quickly begin to unravel during a frantic sequence of deterioration and debauchery inside the house where Lawrence struggles to be heard or attended to as she eventually goes into labour amongst the chaos. He finds her just in time and takes her back into the boarded up study, where the Man and Woman destroyed his most cherished item earlier. It provides her with a sanctuary from the madness going on throughout the house and she gives birth.
He wants to show the people their new born baby, but she refuses and a waiting game takes place where she eventually succumbs to sleep and he snatches the baby away and presents it to the masses.
The final scenes are unnerving and dark, especially for a major production studio to release and were probably the final nail in the coffin for those that hated it or the exclamation point (as per the title) that complete the circle of the biblical allegory.
It is no surprise that Aronofsky has again gone in strong with Christian themes running throughout another of his films and it should also be taken with notice that if you haven't been a fan of those previous films (Noah & Pi most notably) then you probably aren't going to like this one. 
Some have mentioned the allegory is more representative of relationship dynamics and centred around the feelings of isolation and how anxiety can impact on your perspective of what the outside world really is to someone suffering in these ways. As I said earlier, this is a film open to interpretation. 
A challenging watch. If you're not on board after 20mins you can probably save yourself the remaining 80mins and get started on something else."

"kartiknnagar","7","0","1","20 December 2017"," The mother of all allegories goes slightly overboard, still creative and thought-provoking
","One does not need any deep knowledge of Christian theology to see through the painfully obvious allegory of 'mother!'. As an allegory, it takes itself too seriously, so that every almost every action in the movie feels unnatural, and is not supposed to be taken on face-value but rather as a part of its metaphorical argument. This makes the movie highly creative and thought-provoking, but leaves no room for any realistic character development or plot. All the principal characters are also metaphors for specific qualities, so while their behaviors can seem one-note and jarring, they make perfect sense once you realize the underlying intent. As with any Aronofsky movie, this is not a cosy or comfort watch, and while there is an ominous undertone almost from the beginning, the movie explodes into a orgy of violence and destruction towards the end, albeit again with an allegorical intent."

","Mother! Is one of the most accurate movies created in years. Unfortunately, it features Jennifer Lawrence and that attracts an audience that is not capable of understanding what they are seeing, they don't understand that they are looking into a mirror for 2 hours.<br/><br/>I have read a couple of angry 1-star reviews and basically all it did was making the movie better. Most people believe; when there is a house, when there is blood and when there is an attractive woman it must be a horror movie and they keep watching for 2 hours and will be completely disappointed because it is not a horror movie at all, it doesn't try to be.<br/><br/>Mother! Is a movie about our society, entitlement, the environment, egoism, religion and many more.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a metaphor expressed in symbolism and here is the problem for the mainstream audience? They are waiting for THE shock moment in this ""horror house"" while they are just being told that their infinite sense of entitlement and their lack of manners and respect is destroying society and our planet. In fact one reviewer wrote that he only created an account to destroy this bad ""horror movie"" <br/><br/>Some might think the director overindulged in the symbolism because it goes beyond any logic and reality which is exactly what our world has become, the masses of people with an infinite sense of entitlement or disrespect towards others and their carelessness about our planet goes beyond comprehension, they beat you in the face everyday and there is nothing you can do about people who don't have the tools to understand their wrong doings.<br/><br/>If you accept the movie with an open mind, if you understand the symbolism it will leave you heavy breathing.<br/><br/>Each and every 1-star rating on this site is an emotional unstable outrage of a person who didn't understand what they were seeing. Jennifer Lawrence is laying down the best performance in her career so far, after all she is Mother ""Earth"" and the way she is acting the purity and the fragileness of the untouched earth in the first minutes of the movie is nothing but perfect. 
A movie needs to be rated by all it's aspects, unfortunately, and if you watch this film closely, there is only black and white left, no more shades of grey, 1 star or 10 stars, good or bad."

","This movie is one of Darren Aronofsky's masterpieces -to me lol, apparently many did not like it. Whoever watches it must be in the mood so that he won't get bored from the first 30 minutes. Every actor in this movie did their part so well (even the ones that appeared only for a scene). It is like a riddle solving itself, for example you might be confused at a scene but the scene after would explain everything. <br/><br/>It revolves around a peaceful couple living alone in a big house, but everything changes when a man 'mistakenly' stumbles into their home and the husband allows him to stay without the permission of his wife. Even though 'Mother' spent all her time to rebuild the house putting all her effort into it. The man then gets comfortable and invites his wife. More and more people get in the house for unreasonable excuses, which does not please Mother. The husband's unclear position was between pleasing his wife and pleasing his guests and fans. We then see how people turn the house into a chaos because of the forgiving husband.<br/><br/>People have different views so some might refer to 'Mother' as the mother nature and the husband as 'God' and the couple as 'Adam and Eve' etc, That was the director's vision but since people have different views, some see that 'Mother' resembles all the hard working, tough and loyal mothers in the world and how they get treated in return. What I liked the most is when the husband or 'God' keeps forgiving the people despite their sins and what they've done to 'Mother' and her house, this gave me a terrible feeling about us yet a good feeling about God and how forgiving he is. We also learn that earth/nature is not ours or at least we have NO right to ruin it. The ending was really tragic but also overwhelming like I never expected that GEM at the beginning to be another woman/mother's heart. It is really great I might as well watch it AGAIN!"

","What if someday I realize the true size I occupy in the earth and how my insignificant life doesn't interfere at all in this huge environment that I and my similar decided to call ""our"" planet? This question lingered in my head for days after I watched Mother!.
I knew Aronofsky wouldn't spare efforts to highlight human weakness, although this time I felt he went deeper, he questioned our real proposals in being alive and our extreme selfishness.
Besides the biblical theme that he brought out to maybe just create the plot, Mother! represents how is to be part of our society today, totally ignoring our real creator, the one with us and around us, which provides our food, air, and beauty.
Instead of living in communion with the Mother Nature and try to be smarter from all the knowledge we can get from her, we humanized the creator from a male figure, convincing ourselves that we are the representation of life and we can justify everything through God. Furthermore, why a male figure if we are all children of a mother? Maybe at this point the idea that women are here to breed has started.
I may have mixed up a lot of ideas here. This turmoil that comes after watching Mother! is true though. After reading more about the film, I understood the close-ups cameras and it felt like I was in the middle of that chaos. Regarding what one of the characters said to God ""I felt it was written for me"". Yes, it was written for us."

I am divided - on the one hand, I respect the artistic discovery of the creators (the director, the screenwriter, the operator, the actors), on the other ... it just comes to much to me. As for the idea - it is virtually self-centered, the author is not interested in the masses, and the masses would not understand it for sure, but I am surprised that he has received money to give us this product amid the full shitttt of Hollywood cinema lately ... The desire to present religion, the birth of Jesus, his sacrifice, how many people do not deserve Him, but the egoism and self-love of the Lord God in such a highly symbolic parable is too surrealistic and definitely for a narrow circle of viewers. You think the movie is what I wrote about here and it looks like this ???? Hey, just watch it and you can understand something else because it does not say any of these things directly and the action is completely different ... Maybe I've gone very wrong, so do not take it as a spoiler. Just do not get ready for something easy to digest.

","""Mother!"" is not a film to be taken lightly. Personally I watched it 2 times in 24 hours! When watching Mother!, it's important to know that you probably will not understanding everything from the first viewing in the state of mind usual viewing that we all when going to the cinema; in search of efficiency, chills, poignant acting and a desired scenario. In the end, Darren Aronofsky's latest achievement fits it perfectly but we just have to give our mind time to digest and assimilate this cinematic monster. In this sense, ""Mother!"" is a masterpiece and those who consider it the worst movie of the year simply think they find the same efficiency as a classic American Blockbuster with superheroes who save the world or zombies that invade the Earth . Do not take them into account, they just did not make the effort to understand. This film marks and leaves an indelible mark and I completely agree with the fact that this film provokes our habits of cinema and will not leave you indifferent. It's a film that divides. He uses a metaphor in a common frame to talk about a much more universal and powerful subject and in this we can only recognize the tortured leg of the director by thinking back to his previous films like ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Black Swan"" . Ambiguity and mystery seem to be the main words of this game. The atmosphere is heavy, even stifling with these shots very close on the faces of actors, especially that of Jennifer Lawrence, who, like us, is in misunderstanding and surprise at such behavior. If we look at this part at the first step, we could think of old horror films like ""Rosemary Baby"" or ""Amityville: the house of horror"", and inevitably we risk being disappointed because this part leaves room to a second much more amazing but very different. Always under the yoke of metaphor, she is more violent, heterogeneous and incoherent. I personally found it terrifying. Time has no value, human relations either. This house that seemed to be a paradise turns into Hell where the man takes possession of the place. Behind this magisterial hiding place hides a cruel portrait of our current society that forces us to rethink our place on Earth and our very existence and in this, I find that the director signs a coup de maitre! Everything is referenced and no element is left to chance: we then reflect on the value and meaning of our scriptures, especially Genesis and Revelation, the extremism of worship, and simply human nature who is portrayed as selfish and rotten from within. The explanation is not spontaneous, far from it. For my part, I came out disconcerted and perplexed and I left the images of the film decant in my memory and I also read the meaning that wanted to give the director behind all that and suddenly, all s is enlightened and then I saw the genius behind ""Mother!"" In addition, the film is performed by incredible actors who arrive very quickly to make the situations irritating and unbearable. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a performance while restraint but very sensitive and we understand only after all the subtlety with which she had to juggle. His role is incredibly complex. Javier Bardem, it is very disturbing: one does not know if it belongs to the same human race and its role remains for me a great mystery. I particularly enjoyed Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer who are chilling while being very friendly. The meaning of their role and the translation into a domestic setting is a real success. In any case, this film is a cinematographic experience that one very rarely has the opportunity to live in the cinema. This ultimate power and whirlwind of human horror does not make ""Mother!"" That's more gorgeous and intriguing and it's arguably the best movie of the year."

","You probably have to be familiar with the bible stories to understand what this movie is all about. If you're biblically illiterate, don't waste your time on this. Mother! is full of symbolism that could leave general audience clueless. The mansion is Earth. Lawrence is Mother Nature. ""Him"" is the Judeo-Christian God. The invading sickly man and his lustful wife are Adam and Eve, the warring sons Cain and Abel. The first half of the film is the Old Testament, the second half the New. Those are pretty obvious as none these characters has a name. And not just the plot, there're loads of other biblical references: the crystal (forbidden fruit), the flooding in the house (the Flood), frog and blood (curses to Pharoah in Exodus), the baby sacrifice (cruxifiction) and so forth. However, make no mistake, Darren Aronofsky is an atheist who made this movie to preach not the gospel, but environmentalism. In the end, the house is overwhelmed by the crowd of invaders who come to worship ""God"" but vandalize the house instead, so ""God"" sets the place and Mother on fire with oil - yeah, OIL, the ultimate devil, the source of carbon emission - as the divine punishment on mankind for their sin. The message is clear, but nonethelss it's awful, for it's sacrilegious and therefore controversial.

The film continually and cleverly plays on your emotions and sympathies for it's entire length, pulling the strings one time after another. It gently stacks up more and more characters and situations of increasingly bizarre, offensive and ultimately dangerous nature until it's final scenes of confusion and desperation for Lawrence.<br/><br/>What a fabulous cast; the camera is never off the excellent Lawrence. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer seem deliberately cast as part of Aranofsky's psychological game with the viewer, and Bardem produces another of his enigmatic, kooky performances to tie things up.<br/><br/>I hope that history will judge this film better than many of the reviews have done this year.

","Based on the reviews I read on this site, it seems like people are torn about the plot and ending. I get it, this film at times are very confusing, very disoriented and very surreal. I imagined that's how Mother (Lawrence) feels when her husband is dismissive towards her along with his cult of a following. Just like most, I thought this movie was similar to Rosemary Baby in the first act, but the longer it progresses, the more I feel out of place, and out of touch with what's going on. I thought Him was the devil himself, or someone that summoned the evil power to get what he thinks he deserved, a wildly successful story and adoring fans. But then it got more chaotic, and what i thought that WAS, is no longer what it is. The second act, in my opinion caters more to what the movie is about. To be very clear, this is NOT Rosemary Baby, it might play off as one through posters and marketing materials, but it is definitely a story of it's own. I thought Aronofsky did a great job in making me feel tormented by the film. Lawrence performance at times feel one dimensional but towards the end, I can see why. I can see her as a representation of Mother Earth, and I feel for her pain. TBH this movie makes God/Him/Creator looks like an egotistical dick, and I'm not sure if they're wrong."

It's in-your-face, strange, intense, vile and so much more. <br/><br/>Watching it alone was a great choice because I didn't have to answer to anyone or give my response to the film based on their reaction to it. We've all been guilty of that before, I think. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie. It will offend you. It will make you squirm. It will make you ask what the heck is going on. It will make you question things. It will tick you off. But, plenty of events in my life have created these reactions and I've either learned from them, questioned them, moved on, or never let certain experiences go.

","The meaning of this movie is so entirely obvious. It's just about the stupidity and selfishness of mankind.<br/><br/>The happy couple live in a lovely big house - an Eden, uninvited guests seemingly with nowhere else to go keep arriving. These arrivals could have been worthy guests, especially if they'd been good people and their visit had been announced. It's a big house and there is probably work that needs doing, but these guests are entirely self serving, loathsome and full of stupid and self-destructive habits. Many of the later arrivals are sociopaths and psychopaths that fight among themselves. They defile all that they see, even what is held sacred, and ignore good advice, as the most petulant adolescent might. On different occasions a few individuals try to help, but it's so fleeting to be of no consequence.<br/><br/>The film is clearly drawing parallels between the way humans behave towards nature, the unsustainable industries and fighting over man-made concepts, no reverence of nature or care for all its genuine riches. A fact that depresses me every day - built into this story. Similar to James Cameron's Avatar without the blockbuster obviousness. There are also echoes of Christianity, and how people have misunderstood the true spirituality and meaning of it.<br/><br/>I wonder if it's the case that people that see nature as something that's there to serve them and have dominion over, hate this film, or it's an effect of their cognitive dissonance or the style the story is told. Spiteful nonsense like Lars Von Trier films, often garner praise whereas Mother! being a similar concept with actors on a limited set is much deeper and far more meaningful on every level. I'll watch this film again to draw more from it.<br/><br/>I wanted to give this film an eight or nine out of ten but some of the hateful reviews are just unbelievably childish, so I've given it a ten, just to balance things out. Surely if you don't like the meaning of the story you can accept there are some amazing performances and some sublime cinematography and direction, at least making it worth a five out of ten. <br/><br/>If you like the Fast and the Furious, Transformers, going shopping to buy plastic products you don't need, or believe rigid fundamental religious dogma this film might anger you."

","How would the Hobbit have played out if Bilbo and the dwarfs had never left bag end? Mother! gives us a glimpse into the strange occult relationship wound tightly around a group of unexpected guests and the stains they leave on our soul. It's truly though provoking that one can live a life on cruise control that appears to be unwavering until a single drop in time of an others company diverts one to an entirely new plain of existence. Much like a murderers life is out of their hands once they are confronted, the meeting of people that had until now been divergent from our path creates a situation unfathomably out of reach to our own desires.<br/><br/>Mother! creates a seamless transition from the mundane to a rich tapestry of feelings and emotions almost completely disassociated from the norm. How does one measure the relevance of time by the day? The hour? The minute? The second? The infinite number of measurements between each of those? Aronofsky takes the audience on such a symbolic journey crying out to be dissected, confronted, and discussed. The very nature of such a film allows for a different experience from each point of view? How would we each comprehend the messages and symbols from these various positions defines a work of art as experienced from so much diversity.<br/><br/>Great directors have seldomly had the reins to truly strike out and create an experience so exceptionally unique as to ask their audience to have faith. Mother! delivers this promise that hand holding has no place in art.<br/><br/>Gone are the long wide shots of splendor and cinematography so often ripped straight from Kubrick himself. We are isolated, alone, and experiencing an existence out of our hands. When the final credits roll, have you finally come to grip with the fact that your life is not your own?"

"DuskShadow","6","0","1","14 November 2017"," Lets just have fun with a multitude of Approaches to this.
","THere have been so many reviews to this film, and unsurprisingly, they all just about touch upon the same topics: judeo Christian themes abound with no names in place in this film, everyone has a titular pseudonym. There's a Him and She, and Thief, and Neophyte, and Herald, and the main character refers to himself as "" I am I"". And sure, that angle was plain and obvious, aside from one other, tiny , teensy little thing...an unfortunate satanic aspect to this.<br/><br/>Talk about drinking the cool aid, this film starts off with a baffling chore of restoring an old mansion that seems to not only have a growing life of its own, but reacts to harm in a way( Gaia, mother earth blah blah, environment parallels) whenever its damaged or the woman of the house, its ""mother"", is stressed out. But more often than not, the ladies husband is a dual focus as a creator that has writers block, yet is writing a story, but is referred to as a poet. ""He"" hides away a fantastic crystal that is a momento of a love long lost, but is loathe for others to even look upon it. But when they do, they become enamored, healed of mental woes and physical ailments for however long they were in the shards vicinity. Memory is a covetous thing after all, made all the more palpable as a symbol that can reignite lost passion.<br/><br/>Now even when ""His"" stories are read by others, the only tale we are informed about touches upon an apocalyptic scene wherein the house is restored after a world shattering devastation, and the sparse surrounding area is brought to life, while all else beyond lies in permanent states of death. A sort of ""Book of Life"", in which all things are written, as if written just for each body whom reads its pages... Again, the Christian elements, such as the garden of eden is so palpable, its almost insulting. But the thing about all that god and heaven stuff, is it has an opposite in its own tales. Darker forces seem to amass upon the small, nameless home , as more supplicants arrive to see their exalted writer, literally coming out of the woodwork/ forest around the land. More and more the parallels to the rape of the land and excess are shown, but instead of some warning, cautionary tale, the story seems to only convey a type of ritualistic momentum that builds into orgy and sacrificing mode as time goes on. Everyone begins to party, a baby is born, but it is soon taken to a candle lit, dingy room, and upon an altar, its dead body is consumed ( don't be fooled into the claims this is just a metaphor for the body of Christ, though Christianity is technically a reformed cannibals anonymous group at times). The wife can take no more, she burns the house, but the husband is the only one unafraid, just simply let down. Again he may seem like god, but only so long as others obey him and allow him power over them ( devilish, non?), and all because of some manuscripts he is famous for ( satanists bibles, perhaps). He takes the dying love of his wife , which formed under the ""pressure"" of her stressful life, a lump of coal is pulled from her decaying body, soon to reveal a large, pure crystal, like a diamond in the rough while all else fades away. The man puts the crystal upon a dias( much like a relic of much needed power for stability. Something a true God would not need, but a nefarious kind of being might) and all rebuilds in an instant; walls reform, all debris and bodies vanish, the day dawns as a peaceful morning gently erupts through all windows, and where the wifes body was, a body rebuilds, into the visage of a different woman, to simply be yet another pawn for the man to crutch his endless parade of self indulgence upon. A vessel to rebuild that which he needs to maintain his power, and world, his form maybe even. This bares a resemblance to some stories about conjurers and mystics that try to maintain everlasting life thorough a medium of sacrifice and some object to be the crux of their existence. Still it was not a bad film, just kind of a thrill ride, that almost seems like an actress or actors worst nightmare should the paparazzi or fans storm into their lives, though they put themselves out there as icons, as if to be worshiped. For what is Hollywood, but the altar upon which our adoration is spent?"
"irene_j-892-280304","5","0","2","6 November 2017"," Not Aronofsky's best work
","First of all I have to say that I am a thriller/horror movie fan, so I went to watch this movie just because it was listed as a horror/mystery movie, and without knowing anything about the plot, besides the title and the cast. Judging by the superb cast I really had high expectations. I realized quite soon during the first part of the movie that there was an allegorical meaning, so I didn't expect everything that was going on to be completely explained. <br/><br/>What I got while watching the movie, was that Bardem was a poet that strived for inspiration and longed for recognition from his work, and when he achieved this, he became even more obsessed with it, leading ultimately to the complete destruction of his personal life , because of letting fans mess with his family and privacy. It all started when a fan went to meet him in person, then his wife came over uninvited and she started messing with personal affairs of the poet's family and snooping around, and their kids came over later on. The poet kept a room all to himself, with a precious stone inside, but when he let others get in the room and mess with the stone, they caused damage to it, and things started to get completely wrong. He didn't respect his wife and her needs, he didn't care about her, he enjoyed more the attention he got from his fans, and even when she was pregnant, he becomes more successful and famous, so we realize that having a baby with his wife didn't make him feel complete. So, when he becomes more famous his fans go crazy about him. Instead of keeping his privacy and protecting his family, he doesn't want to make them leave, feeding his ego and arrogance, he let more and more people in, so all hell broke loose. Fans and excessive publicity of his personal life destroyed his house literally, his wife was nearly crazy, even his newborn son was actually devoured from his fans. He sacrificed everything because the poet enjoyed being in the private eye. His wife gave him everything, but the house was eventually destroyed, his wife was also killed, meaning that the famous poet's personal life is destroyed, so he has to start all over again. We get now that love is what's left from his wife (precious stone), so he keeps this memory in a safe place to keep him going and start all over again, this time trying to set a new home from the beginning with another wife. <br/><br/>Well, that was Mother! movie for me. When I read that bullsh*t interpretations about mother Earth, the environment, Adam, Eve, I was really shocked because it didn't make any sense this way, biblical stories never crossed my mind while watching a movie that had a clear meaning for me, and I really find it frustrating when secret meanings are so deeply buried that the movie fails to explain itself, seeming rather superficial. The second part was very far-fetched and tiring to watch. The only thing that made it worth watching was the performances of the main actors. But after all, it feels like a waste of time to watch a movie that pretends and claims to be more than it really is."

","Mother! is the story of a couple that settle down in the middle of know where (so they think) and soon enough weird things start happening when strangers begin to let themselves in their own house. <br/><br/>First off, this movie is hella weird, but its a good weird. Its weird in a way that is unsettling and crazy at the same time. I liked the characters and their performances were on spot. But......with that being said i was a little disappointed with this film. <br/><br/>When i first saw the trailer for Mother! i expected a thrilling and intense mystery that would leave a horrifying taste in my mouth, but its not a horror movie at all. <br/><br/>Its a metaphorical movie that has some religious themes about how we treat our earth and how Mother Nature would feel about it. It irritated me that nothing is really explained. <br/><br/>So in the end this movie is a watch once and forget about it for me, but overall i would call it a somewhat enjoyable film. For me it was just a big Unsettling, confusing, crazy, unexplained mess. C+ or 6/10 <br/><br/>Some people love this movie and some people hate it, but i fall in the middle section of that argument."
"lukaslabisch-08768","8","0","3","22 October 2017"," Something... differennt
","""What the hell"" was the first thing i thought after seeing this movie. Why? Because it is next to other movies this year both original and shocking. Darren Aronofsky still has that ability to create something truly special. He masters it to give the story unexpectable turns from one scene to another. Saying that the camera or the characters might be to pretentious is understandable but I think that those aspects are quite unnecessary for the story and the whole experience. What's really important is the atmosphere which in this case is mostly a helpless and unpleasant one. Both the mother and the viewer just watch the events happening in the house of the couple but can't really prevent them. Aronofsky is successful in making you want to look away from the screen and simultaneously challenges you to resist and realize all the events. The rising action and the installation of some mysteries inside the house support Arronofsky's approach. This movie is an experience you shouldn't miss if you want to see something different which contains a story that in the end is even bigger than you would have expected."

","**mother! - review**<br/><br/>If I've been aware, by the time I watched mother!, that Requiem for a dream has the same director of it, perhaps, I'd be better prepared to face this adventure. I say adventure because this movie is, at least, as unexpected and insane as a drug trip. The movie starts with a nice and strange crystal, this last adjective being suitable for almost every scene of it, being put in a delicate support, a thing that will be just understandable in the latter scenes of the story. This, to give a hint of how mysterious and obscure are the movies' content and his nexus. But the dense core of the plot is in its middle part. There's a specific moment, which is hard to precise, that deflagrates an unstoppable sequence of nonsense. There's no time to think or even feel something, apart from anguish and anxiety, as the film goes on. There was a point I was literally on the edge of my seat, gaping, googly eyed, desperately trying, in vain, to grasp a tiny piece of meaning. Much I've heard and read about the director's arrogance, that the all movie is simply a ""self-aggrandizing piece of artistic-filmmaking"", which have absolutely no substantial content behind its piled madness. For me, the word 'art' only can be used for things either chock or inspire you. And this are the two reasons I truly enjoyed my 'drug-induced temporary psychosis'. Mother! is a unique, thought-provoking, breathtaking, mesmerizing movie experience. It definitely requires an open minded one to enjoy or even to not hate it, but those, who allow themselves to learn through sensations and not only by decoding and linking events, certainly will agree of me that, although may not be a masterpiece, clearly is a not to be missed movie of the year and proudly deserves its title exclamation, and why not a few nominations!"
"ZeeRaaN","7","0","3","20 October 2017"," A movie that makes you think and think and think
","I don't like that the director was selfish to say his take on the meaning. I wish that he left it open for us to interpret it as we feel. <br/><br/>I went to this movie not knowing anything about it and I thought I got the meaning because it represented what I was feeling at the moment. I thought the movie was a piece of art in the way it makes us think. but then when I read the reviews and found out the real meaning, I didn't find it as genius! here what I thought I understood:<br/><br/>I thought Javier is a washed-up artist who hasn't had a piece for a long time so he married Jennifer who was his biggest fan because, as she said at the end of the movie, ""he loved how much she loved him."" he was hoping to get inspired by her. The other people in the movie represents her feelings. And Javier letting them in represents that he was passive towards this relationship because he wanted to provoke all these feelings to get inspired to write again. The house represents his washed-up talent and Jennifer Lawrence fixing it day by day represents his talent building up again for a new piece.<br/><br/>The first guest who Javier let in was the first feeling which was her admiration for him, being his biggest fan, and how did they got along and had hikes together. The ""biggest fan"" feeling was also ""dying"" because it is what happens after a while. The second guest and feeling was her maternity instinct, and everything Michelle Pfeiffer was saying represents that. Jennifer also was pregnant with an actual baby at this moment (at the beginning of the scene we see the fetus growing). The boy who died represents her lost baby, while the other boy who killed him and was ""free in the woods"" represents the potential of a second child who Jennifer is ignoring and focusing on grief for the first lost baby. This gets clearer when the father asked her to say something at the funeral and she asked ""about your son?"" but Javier said ""both of their sons, one is still out there."" The many and increasing people in the funeral represents all of her feeling building up not being able to handle them anymore. One was nice to her (maybe her pity and understanding) one represented stubbornness (who keeps sitting on the sink until she broke it, and so on. When the water pipes exploded it represents her actually exploding and finally talk it through and say what she feels. Then they make up and she gets pregnant.<br/><br/>The second baby here represents his new piece of work. She was the ""mother"" of this piece, the ""inspiration."" She took good care of it until it ""kicked."" We see here that he finished his piece the same time the baby kicked. When she was reading the piece, we saw the house rising from the ashes to a beautiful house with a green yard. This represents that the piece was extremely personal and intimate with private details that she does not want to share with the world. The phone rings and he answers with excitement and tells her that everybody loved it. Then immediately things get crazy again. The feelings are back but this time more and stronger. Here she starts realizing maybe he was using her and she feels she's not really special so she gets angry and concerned that the people will read about her intimate life. Here I think the people represent both her feelings and his fans, as they were clashing. The police who came later represents her protective feelings which want to get her out of there. <br/><br/>Then, she gave birth to the ""piece"" and Javier wants to share it to the world but she was protective of it because it was very personal (the craziness outside till this moment was just marketing started by the publisher). He then tries to convince her to share it with the world as he is the ""father"" too but she refuses. While she was asleep (represents him going behind her back) he betrayed her trust and shared his baby with the world (published the piece).<br/><br/>The piece ""died"" to her as it is not personal anymore and people started pointing at her as the ""inspiration."" Crazy fans even took it further to hate on her and even beat her up. she gets angry and decided to burn the house (maybe sue him!). Everything gets burned but him, he carries her from the ashes and she asked what to you want still and he says your love so he reaches to her love and it becomes that crystal. This shows that he feeds on the previous love as an inspiration for the next piece. This also makes us realize that when the previous crystal got broken it was a metaphor of his love to the previous girl, and who broke it? Her maternity instinct and her admiration for him, despite that he hates it when anybody gets to this room (his memory of his old love).<br/><br/>So, in short, the movie is about an artist who takes advantage of the women in his life to be inspired. like many selfish people in relationships."

","Biblical, Shocking, Violence & Unsettling, Darren Aronofsky's 'Mother!' is a difficult but confounding film, that's likely to leave you either enthralled or unimpressed. I fall into the category of those 'who loved it'. And here's why: How many films can shock you & raise questions with such ferocity? I don't remember the last time it happened. And that's exactly why 'Mother!' is such big winner. It swept me off my feat.<br/><br/>'Mother!' Synopsis: A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.<br/><br/>'Mother!' is about us & how one is responsible for the surroundings we get. Mother Nature is all we have & we mustn't enrage or disrespect her, as she is our goddess now and forever. Aronofsky has made a film, that begins subtly, but turns into a nightmarish, violent tale of a Mother. And its all done skillfully. Aronofsky's relentless approach to this unsettling tale is of top order. His Screenplay, entirely biblical, builds up slowly, but grows on ferociously & ends on a highly intense note. Aronofsky's Direction is, as usual, effective. Weather its The claustrophobic setting or the shocking violence, Aronofsky's commitment to the subject remains highly commendable. Matthew Libatique's Cinematography captures the carnage, magnificently. Andrew Weisblum's Editing is mostly sharp. Art & Costume Design merit a special mention. The Background Score, also, is fabulous & adds to the intense proceedings.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Jennifer Lawrence is in top-form, yet again! As Mother, the Oscar-Winner expresses fright, shock & rage, with rare conviction. Its a terrific performance! Javier Bardem as her Husband, is effective. Ed Harris & Michelle Pfeiffer do some of their best work here, especially Pfeiffer, who leaves a strong impact in a small role. Domhnall Gleeson is appropriately creepy as Pfeiffer & Harris's troubled son. Kristen Wiig stands out in a scary cameo. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Mother!' is a winner all the way. Its truly something to be experienced. Strongly Recommended!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","17 October 2017"," It is an allegory, but of what exactly?
","In mother!, directed by Darren Aronofsky, a couple, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, live in an isolated house, far from distractions so as to allow him to finish his next poem. Meanwhile, she tends to their house, wanting to make it into a paradise, in her own words. But then strangers start appearing on their doorstep and things spiral out of control.<br/><br/>On a purely plot-level, the film juggles tropes and conventions found mainly in horror and drama genres. The imagery gets increasingly more gruesome, the unsettling feeling of having your home invaded is ever-present and the final third of the film ceases all attempts at subtlety, bombarding our senses with scenes so violent and out of the left field that you absolutely will leave the theater exhausted.<br/><br/>And if that was all, I'd probably hate this film. Because it would lack meaning. It would simply aim to shock, to maim your senses of propriety and value. <br/><br/>But the film is more than that. It shouldn't be seen as a straight and narrow story about a couple living through unexpected horrors. Rather it's a poem, an allegory about creation, about letting go and trusting your proverbial children to unknown masses. You need to think, who these two represent, what is the house, who are the strangers, why is he so accepting and why is she so guarded.<br/><br/>And when it clicks, when you can examine the film through its intended allegory, it becomes quite something else altogether. <br/><br/>mother! is not an easy film. And that is good. We need films like this to broaden our horizons. To break the borders of our thinking and force us to venture into paths not yet traveled."

Lots of symbolism and metaphors. If that's not your thing, then you might hate this film. On the other hand, if you start to figure out what is going on, it may just suck you in, wanting more. It's a film you will talk about and remember after viewing it, even if you despised it. Haven't seen one of those in a while. Loved the style of the film, with the camera angles, tone and very minimal music/score. This movie literally had minimal to no music, which added to the unsettling feeling. When things start to really get crazy in the second half , I felt uneasy, in a good way. Kudos to the main actors and background extras. There were some scenes that were downright crazy and intense. Overall, I thought this was a great film. Actually, it was more like an experience. It was a nice change from all the mediocre, lame brain , re-hashed, unoriginal crap that has come out recently.

"danielphillips97-251-836566","9","0","3","15 October 2017"," The Culmination of Aronofsky's Works
","'Mother', the latest film from Darren Aronofsky, starts off with an enigmatic shot of a scene near the end of the film, before we're introduced to a couple who live in a house, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), and Him (Javier Bardem), an artist struggling with writers block. One day somebody comes into the house, and this creates a divide between Mother and Him, pulling them further apart as the film progresses. Darren Aronofsky has described his film as a roller-coaster ride, focusing on the slow, steady climb, which is the gradually mounting dread and unease, before plummeting straight down in its final act, which is an explosion of frenzied insanity, chaos, and destruction. This film also leaves a lingering impression, both on the surface level and the underlying ideas it expresses, and in way, it's the kind of film that begins when it's over, shifting in your mind to become something different than what you experienced in the cinema, and we don't get too many films like that these days.<br/><br/>For all the the comparisons that could be made with the early work of Roman Polanski, such as 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Mother!' has no subtlety or restraint, no basis in character, psychology, or realism, instead opting for a freak show of garish, grotesque, extreme, and visceral excesses. The film only ever relents as a ruse, before thrusting us back into a nightmarish and unbearable insanity that is at once outrageous, exhilarating, and horrifying, displaying ghastly extremities of human behaviour, and a boundless energy and imagination that never once opts for the predictable, only the inevitable, continually pushing as far as it can be taken, even crossing the line, and proceeding to go further. It has the same frenetic intensity as the final montage in 'Requiem for a Dream', combined with the biblical mythology of 'Noah', the ambitious grasping's of 'The Fountain' and 'Pi', and the delirious insanity of 'Black Swan'. In a sense, this feels like the inverse of that films suggestion of the protagonists struggle with mental illness, instead depicting the rest of the world as insane, while our titular character Mother represents the order trying so desperately to hold it together.<br/><br/>The film works on multiple levels, as a blackly absurd farce, feverish nightmare, home-invasion thriller, and eco-parable. The characters aren't realistic or believable, but symbolic, which works for what the film's trying to achieve, and leads into the endless amount of interpretations and layers of meaning one can extrapolate from this film, which can leave one thinking and debating long after it's over, as well as stick with you for days, weeks, months, years even. It addresses terrorism, refugees, police brutality, imprisonment, marital breakdown, celebrity, martyrdom, biblical mythology, climate change, politics, artistic inspiration, and I'm sure it doesn't end there. This is a film with such ambitious aspirations, yet distills it into one location, and mostly into the final act. The films extremities and absurdities reflect the state of the world in a way only great surrealism can. This is a film that can stand alongside the great surrealist work of Buñuel, Cronenberg, Gilliam, and Lynch, that keeps pushing the boundaries, and is uncompromisingly the work of a singular vision, which is especially an achievement given it's such a mainstream film.<br/><br/>This film demonstrates Darren Aronofsky as a provocateur and showman as much as an artist, seeking to divide people, rouse controversy, stir strong reactions, and get people talking about it, and that in itself is admirable, even necessary, especially in a world with so many safe and pandering blockbusters. Moreover, Darren Aronofsky strikes me as someone who's gotten all this anxiety, frustration, and negativity off his chest by writing it all down and filming it. That's what art can do, give you permission to confront the deepest darkest aspects of the psyche, and healthily relinquish it. Therefor Aronofsky comes off as calm and reasonable, with strong ideas of what the film's about, but open to anyone's interpretations. 'Mother!' Is a film that works on both a visceral and intellectual level, a roller-coaster ride of insanity that provokes thought and discussion, that mingles spine-tingling excitement with ghastly shocks and underlying anger about the state of the world, whilst pushing the envelope and bringing an individualist sensibility to a mainstream movie. This is a film I imagine will stick with me for a long time."

","I've seen a LOT of movies, but this one is possibly the most bizarre MAJOR motion picture I've ever seen. I'm somewhat surprised that the lead actors were able to perform their parts. Like I say, it's a hard one to rate or review, but I would give it an 8 based on the intensity of the experience. Perhaps the best description I could give would be to say it's as if someone put ""Black Swan"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", ""Fun and Games"",""Antichrist"", ""Straw Dogs"", and ""The Amityville Horror"" into a blender . . . and hit HIGH."

","With just six feature films under his belt, Darren Aronofsky is still one of the most innovative and striking directors working in Hollywood today. With his unique visual style he creates intimate stories which have the power to grip you by the throat until the very last shot. 'Black Swan' is probably my favourite film of the last decade so you can imagine my delight at discovering that Darren had been secretly filming Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem in a horror film for God knows how many months. It was a shock well worthy of the cheeky exclamation mark pegged onto the title. It looked as though Darren had returned to his melodramatic roots after spending years working on a forgettable biblical epic.<br/><br/>Although 'Mother!' also has biblical overtones, it's perhaps less obvious than watching Noah's ark rock around a stormy ocean. It is interesting to note, however the almighty split of opinions on Aronofsky's latest work of art. People talk all the time about 'marmite' films, where critics and audiences alike seem to adore or outright detest a film for equally valid reasons and 'Mother!' is exactly that. Some find it tedious and ridiculous, whilst others find it gripping and intoxicating in the best possible way. I must admit that when I first saw the film, it completely went against my expectations and I was left sitting in a rare state of shock trying to process what I had just seen. Suffice to say that after about 10 minutes, my opinion landed directly on the 'love it' side of the fence.<br/><br/>The less you know about 'Mother!' the better the experience will be so I won't delve into plot points. The biggest surprise for me was discovering how funny the film is. The trailers make it out to be like some sort of hardcore horror movie in the vein of 'Rosemary's Baby' meets 'Repulsion' but I was amazed to find myself laughing so much, particularly in the first half. The preposterousness of the situations make for darkly comic viewing in a similar kind of way to 'Calvaire' a Belgian horror film with equally pitch-black comedy. It could be mistaken for bad writing, but it's entirely intentional. It all comes from the fact that J-Law's character is presented as the only sane person who the audience can relate to, whereas pretty much every other character is totally unrepeatable.<br/><br/>The film builds slowly but always intrigues. Just like Natalie Portman's Nina in 'Black Swan' J-Law's titular 'Mother!' character is always shown in tight close-ups with the camera intensely following her every move. It makes for claustrophobic and uncomfortable viewing at times, particularly as the action never moves away from the house, which makes the insane third act work even more effectively for it. The point of view is also very subjective, it's made clear that Jennifer isn't quite right in the head and we see all her strange and horrifying delusions as if we were in her shoes. It's fantastically focused filmmaking (nice bit of alliteration there for you) which helps to build up the intensity.<br/><br/>The first half might seem more than a bit weird to most moviegoers but it isn't anything compared to the hysterical second half which has to contain some of the most insane sequences ever committed to film. I won't go into details but I was left feeling incredibly stressed and bemused which is exactly how the film wants you to feel. Visually it's astonishing and some of the camera-work is dizzyingly terrific. It also contains some seriously shocking content which left my mouth agape and I'm someone who considers themselves to be a hardened horror nut. It's the kind of big budget surrealism which is devastatingly lacking in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Of course none of it is supposed to be taken at face value and there are plenty of metaphors to chew over after the film has finished. It's just a shame that Darren and Jennifer have been so open about what the film is actually about as it means that the sense of mystery has gone already. The film could've and should've been left up to interpretation. Directors such as David Lynch and Michael Haneke would never dream of telling audiences what their films are about because every audience member's ideas are valid and have meaning to them. Anyhow, although the metaphors and symbolism are a little heavy- handed in the film, they are no less brilliant and intelligent.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the excellent performances in the film. Although that really doesn't come as a surprise when you have heavyweights like Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer starring all in the same film. Each role is very challenging though and the fact that they all pulled each part off and made it believable is a credit to them. The real star of the show though is Darren Aronofsky whose directing style manages to unequivocally sweep audiences away on a mad, horrifying journey which isn't soon forgotten. 'Mother!' is a very special film. It's divisive but most great works of art are. You will get a strong reaction, no matter who you are or what that reaction might be."

","Well after opening scene in the movie, you want to find out the relationship between the name of the movie and what's happening in there. Mother she is, but who are these strangers that are welcome by her husband? Am I watching a deep mystery movie which is mainly a story told by a writer's wife? It is a brilliant collage of two main characters. After you happen to find yourself watching it, you understand that you are in labyrinth like story and your only keyword to find your way is the Mother. Aranofsky sophisticatedly has used some the actual elements between these characters. A pregnant women that could have some paranoiac feeling whatsoever, her hesitant relationship with her writer husband, a somehow famous writer who though loves her wife, is in a distant emotional relationship with her wife and a fascinating story that Aranofsky is about to tell us from all of them. The movie has some delicate references to prominent movies like Rosemary's Baby and auteur director of all times such as Michelangelo Antonioni, but to me Jennifer Lowrance , as a two times winner of the academy award, could not perform as expected. Sometimes you can see her cards when you don't want to and you want to tell her: Hey! it's a mystery movie! Watch your cards! All I would appreciate about this movie is the insightful job Aranofsky did in his style as a director. As an audience, be thinking of giving up this labyrinth though you may some time, you never try to check your watch 'cause you want to finish this adventure along with crew in the movie. The visual art works amazing considering the story we have to follow. This is technically the job he has proved to be an adroit professional at."

","Mother! is one of those riddle-movies I so adore. You have to pay close attention to what's happening and put all the pieces together to be able to decipher its metaphors and see beyond the plot. What truly matters isn't what's happening with the characters, but the message that those events look to convey.<br/><br/>A powerful and disturbing movie, I left the theater with a massive headache and couldn't sleep well that night. It was truly an overwhelming experience. For this, along with the cinematography and acting performances, everyone should watch the movie and try to make some sense of it. But ultimately, watch it for its important theme and hidden message. <br/><br/>*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>Whose mother is it? Through the first half of the movie one can be left wondering if this was some sort of auto-biography and thinking that the Director must have had a really messed up experience with a lady- friend or with his own mother. One may also wonder if there's something paranormal or cult-like going on, because of all the mysterious sounds around the house, the adoration of the poet and his ""horned"" picture. But no, of course not. <br/><br/>This mother is Our mother - Mother Earth/Nature - and that becomes clear as the movie progresses. Besides the Biblical references (I've heard some theories stating that the movie is about Christianity and the Bible in particular), there are other things going on that advise us to look beyond that.<br/><br/>There is vanity, greed, war, violence, abuse and even death. All of them committed against (or at great cost to) the Mother. She can't leave the house, as our Planet has no place to ""run away"" to. Jennifer Lawrence is young, voluptuous, curvy and ultimately becomes pregnant, all powerful symbols of Mother Nature. By the time her baby is born I was thinking that He (Barden) would die, thus confirming my theory that the movie was a kind of allegory to the pagan myth of The God and Goddess, since the God is born of The Goddess, becomes her lover and then dies after impregnating her. That wasn't the case, so I assume He is the representation either of Men and his desire to create (that can never be equal to the Mother's ability to create); or of the Christian God, hence making this movie the ultimate redemption of the female figure in Christianity.<br/><br/>The violation of Mother's space, the disrespect, the abuse and the violence are overwhelming on the big screen, but even more if we parallel them to what Humans are doing to Earth every single day. * <br/><br/>*** END SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>A mandatory movie for those who don't mind deciphering messages and/or for those who choose to read the spoilers for an easier movie experience.<br/><br/>An amazing work of art that will linger for hours in your mind, with an impressive cast of actors and a truly crushing message. <br/><br/>I'd give it an 8,5 out of 10 score."
"rcatelinet","10","0","6","9 October 2017"," mother! a dark comedy nightmare
","This is an experimental film. It refuses to follow cinematic norms in pacing, lighting, plot line, camera work (66 mins are close-ups of J Lawrence's face), even having no musical score, just relying on the sounds created in the house and silence to keep the audience in suspense. Because of this, it is a film that needs your full concentration (& patience) to follow what is happening and to engage with the characters' experiences. It therefore relies far more heavily than normal on the individual viewer's willingness to do this, hence the reason many find this film heavy going - we're all used to having our attention and feelings guided by musical scores, formulaic narrative and easily digestible dialogue.<br/><br/>Of course, other's will find some of the content distasteful, still more are politically turned off by the message and those with religious beliefs may be offended by the allegorical imagery. Add to that the flawed marketing campaign that has clearly miffed a lot of audiences (or is that CinemaScore F actually going to improve the film's art house pedigree long term?). Is it any wonder therefore, that this is an immensely polarising film as borne out by the reviews on this and other sites? <br/><br/>If, however, you don't fall into one of the above groups, then this can be an extremely rewarding film. You need to be prepared to invest yourself in it and allow the tension & irritation to build in a way rarely experienced especially in a multiplex!, The whole point of this film is that you should not be a passive viewer, simply witnessing someone else's suffering, the film aims to make you feel uncomfortable in a way we're not used to in a cinema, to identify with the character's pain so you feel it too. Is that entertainment? Probably not. Is it art with a capital A? Maybe. And that may be why many find the film pretentious.<br/><br/>To me, what it is, is exciting. For a filmmaker to try and create a sort of ""virtual reality"" for the emotions while watching a film is like taking cinematic viewing to the next level. To get there you have to accept the narrative is not time-linear, that the camera work is claustrophobic, that many scenes are chaotic and extreme - that's the point, the film wants to disorientate you, shake you up, wake you out of your emotional slumber. ""Feel something"" it shouts, ""Anything, just feel it!"" <br/><br/>That probably all adds up to commercial suicide but I suspect it's protagonists already knew that. This is a film with performances so committed (especially that of J Lawrence & M Pfeiffer in what might be awards worthy performances if the film's divisiveness can be overlooked by awards bodies), the camera work, sound and direction so ""out there"", that I think they only really cared about the message, the experience of making ""mother!"" and the cinematic legacy it's likely to leave behind."

","For me a film directed by Darren Aronofsky is very much event cinema and much of my admiration for him is the way he divides critics. He is a director with unlimited talent and absolutely no shame and for that alone he deserves much credit . On the surface MOTHER! seems to be a mystery drama involving a home invasion of sorts. However the way both the critics and the mainstream audience have reacted to its release gives a clue that you're not going to be seeing a mainstream thriller. We are after all watching a film by Aronofsky <br/><br/>One vocal criticism is that MOTHER! drowns in its own obsession with metaphor and allegory. Again this shouldn't be taken as a negative point. For much of the early part of the film we have something not too far removed from other home invasion movies where a couple take in a stranger and the stranger isn't who they seem. The plot turns start coming very thick and fast and before you know it the film has mutated in to something else very quickly <br/><br/>There's a downside to all this and that is that it stops being in anyway realistic . Okay you can excuse Javier Bardam's ""Him"" naive stupidity in order to set up the story but there has to be a limit and Aronofsky doesn't do limits so you have been warned <br/><br/>One gets the feeling that it's an extension of the director's previous film NOAH where these nasty human beings are destroying mother Earth but equally you can jump to the conclusion that it's a metaphor for America under the Trump presidency. Of course the production dates make this very unlikely but the constant conflict between Mother and Him as to letting strangers in to the house does strike a cord and perhaps in the future this film will be remembered as a social comment on America in the early 21st Century ? It's certainly a memorable film regardless of your politics and it's a movie that will take you a long time to work out if it's memorable in a good or bad way"
"justinwfirestone","7","0","4","27 September 2017"," A recurring bad dream
","Oh, brother, what to think of Mother!?<br/><br/>Is it a super-secret dark comedy, yet dually so anti-feminist that it turns a full circle by depicting a strong female character who is the core, the center of the world?<br/><br/>Is it about addiction to people and relationships filled only with one-way love and the corresponding one-way abuse and manipulation? Is it a lesson about pursuit of fame and the unexpected consequences of developing a fanatic fan-base?<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence (""Mother"") suggested Mother! is about the ""rape and torment"" of Earth with some Biblical references. I, on the other hand, am convinced Mother! is Darren Aronofsky's (""Director"") attempt to visualize one of my semi-recurring bad dreams: I sometimes dream I am throwing a party and a large group of strangers arrive unexpectedly, none of whom will leave, all of whom drink and eat everything in sight, perpetually perching atop unbraced sinks despite repeated and heated warnings. I, too, have screamed guttural screams at these interlopers. I am tired, it's time to go, I don't know you, I'm calling the police, I want to kill you all, why won't you leave?<br/><br/>Director likes to beat the drums into a fever-frenzy, and the progression is not so unbelievable if you've dreamed those dreams. The final scenes are supposed to be shocking, I suppose, maybe even gasp-inducing. Few visuals should shock the conscience these days, especially considering there was a trailer for another installment of Saw, and do we even need to mention Human Centipede 3?<br/><br/>Many have mentioned hints of Rosemary's Baby or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but I smelled hints of Antichrist, The Amityville Horror, and Room. If the imagery of The Spectacle can cause destruction and generate evil, it likewise must be able to cause creation and generate good.<br/><br/>I paid five bucks to see Mother!, probably would have spent $6.25 if asked."

","First Noah nor this.. but oh well I really do not want to go too deep into detail. Uh. Well. I usually like mysteries. I like movies with limited location when tension is building up between different characters - a kind of tension that is about the explode. And the first half of the film I did get exactly that. Too bad that the conclusion was too supernatural, too ""poetic"" (not sure if that is the right word to describe That. ) I mean you cannot expect a director like Darren Aronofsky to go straight forward (well except for that his little bible epic ), but this was just too out of place. The cast was fabulous the performances mostly great. Jennifer Lawrence gave the rawest performance of her performance and she really was good with the thin character given to her (Aronofsky was more interested in constant close ups of her face than really developing her character). Ed Harris was great and it was wonderful to see him in a role like this again. He did well. Michelle Pfeiffer was just as good and it was a perfect comeback for both of them but their potential was not really used by Aronofsky. Actually their character literally went nowhere and were not as essential to the story as they deserved to be. Still the part of the movie where they were in was by far the best and most interesting. I am not too sure what to think about Javier Bardem. He was rather bland. His character was the least developed and at the end they failed to give him meaning. It was a boring character. Bardem tried to make it interesting but couldn't save it. Don't get me wrong, the film makes sense and I understood it.. it was just too silly, too forced and too pretentious. He should have kept up with the first half and think about a more natural and interesting conclusion. Whatever.. worth to see for some good actors in mostly good performances. The production design is fine as is the cinematography and some of the editing. Nothing award worthy tho."
