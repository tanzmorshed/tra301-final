","I did not want to watch this movie but took my wife to see it, because we both saw the one with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, growing up. The crowd was a lot older than we were(we are almost 50) it was the biggest screen they had at our theater and seats a lot but it was maybe half full on Sunday afternoon. Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have."
"nancyldraper","7","1088","1525","6 October 2018"," This was a good movie but not a great movie
","This was a good movie but not a great movie (this will not be a popular opinion). First the good stuff: Lady Gaga was perfect for and in this role - acting singing, chemistry, song writing - all fantastic. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Gaga was believable and, at times, breathtaking. The first two thirds of the movie had a great arch and captured us (as a friend, who watched the movie with me, said, ""I could watch the first part of this movie on repeat."") I am also a big fan of about 5 of the songs, and would add them to my library without hesitation, they are beautifully written. Now, the not so good stuff: the last third of the movie was too long - it could easily be cut by 20 minutes, but Bradley Cooper, as director, was more than a little self indulgent with his own scenes (we got the struggle, drawing it out didn't serve the storytelling). Ally's character arch was disappointing. As her star rose she didn't learn to love what Jack saw in her. She didn't learn to take ownership of her own story, the very gift Jack was trying to give her. Ally's story wasn't resolved until the very last moments of the movie, it was eclipsed by Bradley's directorial obsession with Jack's decline, belying the original premise of all the STAR IS BORN movies and lessening her triumph. I guess what moved it from great to good, for me, was that the first two thirds proved it could be great but the last third got hijacked (no pun intended). I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Music-centric Romantic Drama}"
"superdupersentinel","6","1057","1514","5 October 2018"," Is it a good film? Yes. Oscar material? No.
","Let me start by saying that the performances are solid. Not mind blowing but solid. For her first film, Lady Gaga did very well but I can't say she blew my mind...but hey it's her first film and I like her, so good for her. That being said, the film seems to be getting WAY overblown by people. The first act is really great and the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is phenomenal but after that it sort of devolves into a melodrama. The character development of Cooper's character is lacking. He is an alcoholic and we certainly see him drunk many times but I didn't see enough struggle to justify his character arc not was Cooper's performance powerful enough to convey the devastating agony of addiction. The film then goes through a few cliches as we see Gaga's character ascend to fame but again, we also don't see enough struggle from her character either. In all, the character conflicts are addressed but the film never fully dives into them in the way it certainly could have. I loved the first song of the film but the rest of the music was surprisingly bland and didn't captivate me at all. Lady Gaga obviously has an incredible voice and Cooper held his own surprisingly. Overall it was a good film, not great, just good."

","This is the 4th version of A Star Is Born I've seen - 5th if you count What Price Hollywood - each version had a life of their own and reflected the times of the time in which it was made. The 2018 version is no exception. For me represented also the revelation of Lady Gaga as a phenomenal film presence. She is, quite simply, superb. Moving, powerful and real. Janet Gaynor had brought a form of overwhelming innocence, Judy Garland exploded in heartbreak in a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore and she was, unquestionably, memorable. Barbara Streisand was tough with a strong sense of self even during her tribulations. Lady Gaga brings a little of each of them as well as something profoundly personal. Kudos to Bradley Cooper. His Norman Maine has a new name and a totally new presence. At times this version seems more about him than about her. In any case, I loved them both - Bravo!"

","A magnificent movie, captivating performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. The ultimate shock was how brilliant Lady Gaga was, we knew she could sing, but didn't have any idea just how far her acting talent stretches!

The movie is outstanding, the music is annoyingly perfect, the cast is great and everything shouts Oscar worthy movie.

","If you're even a casual moviegoer, chances are you have already heard the argument; that originality is dead in Hollywood. We live in an era where even Ghostbusters is no longer sacred. Where you wouldn't be surprised if one of the large studios announced a remake of the Godfather or Citizen Kane. Those remakes might capture some audience members, but those films almost certainly don't capture the audience's hearts. They certainly don't capture the praise critics. They certainly don't take home any major awards.<br/><br/>That all changes with A Star is Born.<br/><br/>Change, however, is a key word when it comes to remakes. (Or remakes of remakes of remakes...) In order to make the venture worthwhile, the film makers not only have to stay close to the ideas of original film, but they have to have a reason to retell the story. It's a delicate balance. Every version of a Star is Born follows a broken celebrity, in the Winter of his career, damaged by years of drinking who is suddenly reborn when meeting a young ingÃ©nue. The two fall in love, but while their relationship develops, their entertainment careers go in different directions.<br/><br/>Director and Co-Star Bradley Cooper's film seemingly borrows more from the Streisand/Kristofferson iteration of A Star is Born (the last time this story was retold), as the dynamic between the two lovers hinges on the music industry. When Streisand and Kristofferson remade the film, (for the fourth time at that point) in 1976, they broke one of the aforementioned expectations, as they both took home Golden Globes for their performances. Perhaps Cooper was more inspired by performance, rather than aesthetic, as the acting is one aspect out of many that shines in Cooper's version. The characters of Jackson Maine (Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) drive the entire story in what is essentially a film with only half a dozen notable characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have amazing chemistry, and from the moment you see the two on screen together for the first time you feel the connection.<br/><br/>First time director, Cooper, deftly creates intimacy between Jackson and Ally, without which the story would certainly not be as successful. In stadiums housing thousands of fans, in small dressing rooms packed with screaming Drag Queens, in a loud dive bar, in the parking lot of an all-night-grocer, Cooper uses tight framing and sound impeccably to make it seem like they're the only two people in the world. You understand his charm, you see her vulnerability, and the two actors give side-by-side stellar performances.<br/><br/>That isn't to take away anything from a small, but powerful supporting cast. There were some brilliant and surprising moments from Dave Chappelle as Noodles, an old friend of Jackson's who reiterates how much Ally has revitalized Jackson. The largest surprise came from Andrew Dice Clay as Lorenzo, Ally's father. Both Clay and Chappelle brought great moments of love and humanity in their criminally small interactions with the two main characters. Sam Elliot also surprised me in his role as Bobby, Jackson's (much) older brother. They explain the age discrepancy, but the rest is self-explanatory as he and Cooper truly are brothers on screen, with all the frustration, fights and familiarity that goes with that relationship. Elliot in his similarly small time on screen, often showed the softer side of his craft, hiding touching instants of sadness when it comes to his difficult relationship with his brother, concealed only slightly by his iconic mustache.<br/><br/>It begs the question, does Cooper deserve all the praise as director, or does the cast? What I can glean from the film is Cooper definitely had his cast on the same page, as regardless of screen time, these actors made you care about their characters. The audience is invested. There are countless pivotal story beats where these characters may do something frustrating or angering. Instead of merely recognizing that these are hurdles to push the story further, I found myself almost vocally upset, akin to yelling at a character in a horror film to not go in the room where the killer is hiding. This film makes you want the protagonists to succeed, even when dealing with topical subplots regarding celebrity, regret, depression and substance abuse.<br/><br/>And that's because you're along for the ride the entire time. You're a part of this love story. The film sucks you in from the beginning with the roar of a raucous concert audience, the hard beat of the drums on Jackson's stage, and his hypnotic swagger as he plays for thousands. If you were one of the millions of people who have seen the trailer for this film, I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about (kudos to the promotional department of this film, as that, is an extremely engaging and powerful trailer) but it stems from an extremely engaging and powerful film. The music, much like it did with the trailer gets inside you, not just inside your head where you find yourself humming a gentle country lilt sang by Cooper, it gets inside your heart and soul and rattles around. It repeats over and over until you're the one who doesn't want to let go. While Cooper should be commended for taking his craft seriously and improving his singing, this is where Lady Gaga shines, to no one's surprise.<br/><br/>Ally is a perfect role for her. The performer has spoken about how vulnerable and ugly she felt in some scenes when shooting this film, but it made her so real on screen. Ally's career, much like the first half of the film, blasts off, and all you can do is hold on until you realize the songstress is belting a powerful ballad. You wonder, much like her character ""how did we get here"" but at that point, you're just happy to be along for the ride. It is a testament to Lady Gaga's ability, because being such an iconic figure, if it weren't for her conveyance of sincerity and humility, the character's journey would seem forced and unfulfilling. Because of Gaga's performance, however, you relish the moment Ally can finally embrace who she is and bravely belt out her songs with no inhibition. In a film with so many moments that grab you, the music is undeniably one of my favorite aspects. I can't wait for this film to get a wider release so the studio can also make the soundtrack available.<br/><br/>If and when Award season comes, and A Star is Born is undeniably a forerunner for several major awards, I think Cooper should be commended simply because as director, he brought everything together. The songwriters, the actors, the cinematography, the sound design was superbly balanced to create the best possible version of this story making it, the brightest star for both critics and audiences."

","I'm a little lost on how this movie is getting so many high reviews. Its a good looking movie, but the characters are relatively uninteresting and the best thing about the music is that they're not always singing. <br/><br/>It just seemed to drag on and on. And on. And on."
"Ed-Shullivan","4","808","1349","8 October 2018"," A Star is BORED
","I am more than just a bit surprised how many of the IMDB reviews just glow about this remake, of another remake, of another remake of yet still another remake. In case some people don't realize it, this film has been over cooked since the 1930's.<br/><br/>Maybe women love Bradley Cooper so this is his vanity project in which he is credited as the writer, director, and star. Heck, Bradley Cooper even went as far as having a Sam Elliott voice over by copying Elliott's gravelly voice and Mr. Vanity (Cooper) even gives himself several minutes of solo face time singing as a past-his-prime-time weary weathered alcoholic singing star.<br/><br/>Oh sure, Cooper pulled out as many pity points that he possibly could by including his loyal dog pining for our over the hill rock star. While Jack hides behind his closed garage door his dog rests in front of the door resting alone and waiting for his master Jack to come out from behind the closed garage door. Awwwwww shucks. Cooper's screenplay denotes ""sappy sucker tears called for here"".<br/><br/>I wish Hollywood would welcome some fresh new screenwriters blood with some really creative ideas for screenplays rather than just use bonafide stars to re-write old screenplays and re-hash old movies and expect us avid filmgoers who enjoy going to actual movie theaters to suck the old crap up again and again.<br/><br/>I bet that more than half the people who wrote a praiseworthy IMDB review in 2018 for this film won't even remember who starred in this 5th version of A Star Is Born because it is simply not a memorable film, nor is it worthy of the bloated high praise it has been garnering. In reference to the great P.T. Barnum ""There's a Sucker Born Every Minute""...don't be the next one. Pass on this overrated remake."
"themadmovieman","7","248","402","3 October 2018"," Starts in exhilarating fashion, although loses steam
","It's a story as old as time, and that's evident in the fact that Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born is the fourth (yes, FOURTH) remake of the movie classic. However, with clearly passionate directing and acting throughout, furthered by wonderful music and an efficient portrayal of the classic rags-to-riches story, this proves a thoroughly entertaining and memorable watch that absolutely flies by over the course of nearly two and a half hours.<br/><br/>But before we get into all that, I have to start with the film's opening half hour, which is exceptional. Despite its long running time, there's so much packed into the opening act, and it's delivered with jaw-dropping passion and energy, to the point where I felt absolutely exhilarated by the film within such a short period of time.<br/><br/>The passion with which Bradley Cooper is directing the movie is clear from the opening scene, and as we see our superstar musician form an unlikely and unexpected bond with a young local singer, the film begins to tell that age-old story about finding fame in beautiful and riveting fashion.<br/><br/>In fact, in the knowledge that it's a story that you know like the back of your hand, Cooper ingeniously ramps the dial up to eleven as we watch our young up-and-coming star caught up in an exhilarating whirlwind as she is suddenly transported from a small waitressing job to singing in front of thousands, culminating in a stunningly moving musical sequence that feels like a true epiphany, as you watch this young woman overwhelmed as she gets her first taste of stardom, something that I was absolutely blown away by.<br/><br/>That opening half hour is truly exceptional. Full of emotion, drama and moving at a pace that mirrors the dramatic transformation from ordinary singer to superstar, it's exhilarating to watch at every moment, and easily the best opening act I've seen from a film this year, setting up the rest of the film fantastically.<br/><br/>Rather unfortunately, however, things don't quite pan out in the same stunning fashion through the rest of the movie. While the remained of A Star Is Born is still good, I was left feeling a little disappointed that it couldn't keep up that same exhilarating energy and emotion from the first act, as things quieten down and become a little more predictable.<br/><br/>Of course, there's nobody who doesn't know this story, so being predictable isn't as much of a problem, but what I found frustrating about the film was how it failed to keep delving deeper into the lives of the lead characters as their careers start flying in completely opposing directions.<br/><br/>As a director, Cooper did an incredible job with the opening half hour, and his passion for the subject matter remains strong throughout, but the problem comes in the way that he portrays the main points of this age-old story in a rather plain fashion, moving a little too readily onto each new stage in the two singers' careers without leaving enough time for things to settle.<br/><br/>In that, the film has a good pace to it that makes it a thoroughly entertaining watch right to the end, but with the exception of the opening act and the finale, there just isn't enough depth to the individuals here, leaving me a little detached from their emotions throughout the middle portion, and having to rely on my knowledge of the classic rags-to-riches story to understand more about what they were feeling.<br/><br/>So, a little bit more clarity and patience would have gone a long way here, and I would have been genuinely happy to watch another half hour or so of the film.<br/><br/>While the second two-thirds of the movie aren't so profoundly moving, that doesn't mean there's nothing to praise, because along with Cooper's passionate directing, we see two fantastic performances from the director himself as well as Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>Starting off with Bradley Cooper, his portrayal of an aging and fading star is thoroughly fascinating to watch. While he doesn't appear as the story's main focus, the quality of his performance is such that I was at times even more invested in his character than the rise of the starlet, as he pulls off the maturity and likability of his battle-hardened character while still putting in a powerful portrayal of his deeper weaknesses, something that makes him both delightfully appealing and still deeply interesting to follow throughout.<br/><br/>Alongside Cooper is Gaga, who is a real revelation here. Given that she's never been in a role of this magnitude before, her acting ability is truly stunning, and she gives a performance that's just as profound and striking as any experienced A-list actress. Taking from her own experience of life in the music business and her rise to stardom in real life, the passion that she feels for her character is clear in every scene, with that previously mentioned epiphany-inducing musical number 'Shallow' featuring the best example of her incredible acting.<br/><br/>She holds fantastic chemistry with Cooper, and the two make their characters' relationship both convincing and genuinely appealing, even through the inevitable ups and downs of the story, keeping your interest strong as the film moves through the story towards the finish.<br/><br/>In the end, I was very impressed with A Star Is Born. It's unfortunately not pitch-perfect all the way through, but after a mind-blowing opening act, and featuring passionate and likable directing and performances throughout, it proves a massively entertaining watch regardless, with some excellent music to boot."

Jackson is a man who's got plenty of personal demons besides the bottle as his family friction with only brother Bobby(the great Sam Elliott) weighs on his heart heavy. Things change when Ally(Lady Gaga) captures his heart along the way the two get to know each other in an intimate way as passion becomes love.<br/><br/>Still the love is not without struggle and heartache as Ally becomes famous and well known while Jackson's music and personal life both take a downward path with alcoholism as he just can't escape his own dark shadows. It's like you as the viewer could see the tragedy coming all along.<br/><br/>Overall entertaining film with fine and beautiful music and the on screen chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is in top notch form, as clearly this is one love drama to see that showcases the rise of fame and stardom, also while showing a grim personal downfall."

","This story has been filmed three times before: in 1937 (with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March); 1954 (with Judy Garland and James Mason) and 1976 (with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson). In all of these films the story has been the same: an alcoholic and over-the-hill actor (or with Kris Kristofferson, rock star) finds a young talented ingenue to love and develop into a superstar.<br/><br/>The modern day remake is a little different in that Jackson Maine, our older star (now played by Bradley Cooper), is a stadium-filling mega-rock-star, recognised and idolised in every bar he goes into.... and he frequents a LOT of bars. Maine mixes the cocktail with drugs in this version meaning that as one star is ascending, his seems destined to be heading into a black hole.<br/><br/>At its heart, this is a good story of having self-confidence in your own abilities, no matter how people around you try to put you down. Gaga's Ally is one such person; a waitress who is constantly being told, especially by her blue-collar dad and his boozy friends, that although she has a great voice she's ""never going to make it"" because of the way she looks. In chilled fashion she meets Jackson Maine, who hears her sing and thinks she might be on the edge of glory. Not worried about her big nose, he appreciates she was born that way: in fact he likes her so much he wants to poke her face. (Sorry... couldn't resist it).<br/><br/>I appreciate from the IMDB rating that I am probably in a minority here. (At the time of writing this is (imho) a ridiculously high 8.3). But for me, I found the whole thing a dull affair. I can't remember the last time I went to a film when I actively looked at my watch... but 1 hour 45 into this, I did (it had another 30 minutes to run).<br/><br/>For one thing, I just didn't believe Bradley Cooper as the rock star character. He just came across as totally false and unbelievable to me. I had more resonance with Gaga's Ally. Even though she is a novice actor (and it showed at times) in general I thought she did a creditable job. But given these two factors together, there are long and indulgent exchanges between the pair that seemed to me to go on in-ter-min-ably. Best actor in the film for me was Sam Elliott as Jackson's brother Bobby. The mellowing of the brothers is a scene that I found genuinely touching.<br/><br/>I'd also like a glance at the original script, since there are some passages (the ""boyfriend/husband"" lines is a case in point) where it felt like one of them made an script mistake and, instead of Cooper (as director) shouting ""cut"", they kept it going as some sort of half-arsed improv.<br/><br/>What is impressive is that they got to film at live concerts (including at Glastonbury), although most of this footage is of the hand-held nausea-inducing variety. There is zero doubt that Gaga can belt out a song better than anyone. But I didn't get that same feeling about Bradley Cooper's singing: like a lot of this film (with Cooper as co-producer, co-screenwriter AND director) it felt to me like a self-indulgent piece of casting.<br/><br/>I know music is extremely subjective, and ""country"" isnt really my think anyway. But the songs by Gaga and Lukas Nelson were - ""Shallow"" aside - for me rather forgetable.<br/><br/>Overall, in a couple of years that have brought us some great musicals - ""La La Land""; ""Sing Street""; ""The Greatest Showman"" - here's a film about the music industry that did nothing for me I'm afraid."

I quite enjoyed the start but the slow pacing, monotonous gravelly voices and hackneyed story made me grateful for the ending, when it finally arrived."

","Yeah, you read that headline right. I absolutely hated this cliched mess of a movie that did absolutely nothing new or interesting. I could go on and on about the specifics of the movie that I disliked (and I actually did on my blog), but I'll make an attempt to keep it brief.<br/><br/>The first third or so of the movie was pretty good in my opinion--the characters really shined and the soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal. It was this first third or so of the movie that made me respect the love story and convinced me--even for a second--that it would be a new take on this kind of love story. Then a record producer showed up and everything went downhill. From there, every single aspect of the plot was dull, predictable, and unexciting. I wondered what the point was in staying and watching through the entire thing if I could predict it all. The characters are what ultimately got me through the movie (or more specifically Jackson, since I found Ally nearly unlikable by the end of the film).<br/><br/>I only cried once while the other moviegoers in my theater were blubbering over every other line of dialogue. The end of the movie--where Jackson committed suicide--is the only part that got me. Other scenes were just predictable and boring to me (if well acted). The movie's commentary on the suicide (""It was HIS fault"") enraged me, since it's NOBODY'S fault when someone commits suicide.<br/><br/>Every other aspect of the movie (with the exception of the aforementioned soundtrack and performances of the actors) is either dull or unnoteworthy. The movie clearly has nothing new to say other then new artists with crappy music deserve a Grammy. I wasn't happy I saw it and I am wholly unsatisfied with the experience. At least Gaga and Cooper have amazing singing voices."

I can't disagree.<br/><br/>However, alcoholism and drug addiction is NOT a disease. It's a habit. The habit is formed by running from and suppressing emotional pain and trauma.

"phoenixandrew","5","182","358","4 October 2018"," Who are these people giving this film good reviews?
","I was shocked to see that this film had a pretty high rating on this site. Compared to the 1976 Barbra Streisand/Kris Kristofferson version, I didn't think the Lady Gaga/Bradley Cooper film was all that great.<br/><br/>If you know the stories from the first three movies, then you know that this story is no different. It's about a rock star named Jackson Maine (Cooper) who's being tortured with booze and drugs and is about to see the end of his career. One time after a gig, he instructs his chauffer to drop him off at a local bar near downtown L.A. He walks in to discover it's a drag bar, but he doesn't seem to mind. In there, he discovers a local singer (who is a real woman) named Ally (Gaga) and after her performance he is just smitten with her. After a show, he invites her out on a date. During that date, they have a nasty run-in with Ally's ex-boyfriend. After Jackson gets Ally away from him, they sit down in front of a supermarket where she tells him that despite her talents, she has difficulty finding her big break. Jackson then listens to Ally belt out a song and then he tells her without a doubt if she finds the right person to help her, she will have a successful career. Then throughout the movie with all the ups and downs by fate, Ally finds herself becoming a new A-list star.<br/><br/>""A Star Is Born' is basically the same old story in which a local singer with no ties to the industry has the fortune (or misfortune) to have a chemically dependent addict bump into her to make her dreams come true, they fall in love, get married, but his alcoholism and drug addiction threatens their marriage. Once Ally is on a roll, Jackson starts to develop jealousies over her success in which he begins to feel threatened by her wondering if this means the end of his career. Ally also has to decide if she wants to continue staying with him as it is becoming apparent that Jackson could be a seriously liability to Ally's success. <br/><br/>Unlike the previous version, this version has an editing style that I thought left a lot to be desired. Except when Jackson and Ally are singing, there is no background music throughout the film which could have been helpful to guide the audience. Plus this film does not have any fades from scene to scene, the film just has very crude jumps from one scene to another. Finally, while Lady Gaga is a wonderful singer and the music in the film was quite good, the same cannot be said of her acting abilities. With the exception of the music, I don't see this film getting any Oscar nominations on acting or technical merits. Instead of getting emotional at the film's conclusion, I was impatiently waiting for this film to end.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I think Bradley Cooper slipped up on the directing of this film and Lady Gaga doesn't know how to act either. On a scale of 1-to-10, I give this film a very generous 5."

 had the worst costume design work recently in any film large budget or small. Bradley Cooper certainly has no eye for design. As for the film generally speaking it was paint by the numbers.The first bar scene where Gaga sings, it is mentioned that they do this Drag thing once a week.Moments later we have a Drag Queen say Something to the effect that she does not want to lose her alcohol license. This is not a gay bar. It is a straight bar that has Female impersonators once a week. There was not one original moment in this ASIB. For a women like Ally who claims to be insecure performs diva like from the start singing La Ve en Rose. Then we have Boring Montage's and flashbacks that did nothing. Where this film really fell apart was in the SNL number. It was quite possibly the worst musical Number in a film ever. I should have seen Venom with a real talented actor.

","My mother wanted to see this movie and as I had heard many good comments about it, I agreed to go. After about 15 minutes I wanted to leave but couldn't as I had company. Where do I begin (and end)? Bradley Cooper, co-writer, co-producer, director and lead actor. His performance is painfully artificial. If only he had paid attention to his co-star Sam Elliott who outshines his director with his naturalistic and very effective performance. I just did not believe Mr. Cooper and unfortunately the movie seems to be mostly about his character the despite the movie's title.<br/><br/>As director Mr. Cooper equates dark shots and bad sturm and drang acting (by himself) to miraculously create a dramatic masterpiece. Sorry Mr. Cooper but is your movie and you are responsible for how bad it is. So many two headed shots of Cooper and Gaga zoomed right in so one cannot see the contours of their heads. Very claustrophobic film overall. I felt nothing when Mr. Cooper's character plays his final scene.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is no actress but her acting is okay.Her saving grace (and the movie's) is her beautiful singing voice.<br/><br/>The best actors in the movie by a wide margin are Sam Elliott and non-actor Andrew Dice Clay as Gaga's father.<br/><br/>Basically, a badly directed, dramatically phony story with a painful performance by the lead actor."
"andyjamesdavis","3","97","187","5 October 2018"," Do you think professional critics get backhanders? Possibly, lol.
","Cooper's painfully earnest depiction of a (very unlikeable and greasy-haired) addict is far too heavy for this frothy material. As one reviewer said, more 'A Star Goes Out' than 'A Star Is Born'. At least the self-indulgent focus on him spares us much of Gaga's precariously near-wooden acting. If Cooper was insistent on giving it the heavy-handed treatment he should have had the character's addiction stem from the pressures of fame and not from his family background. The resulting premise makes the music industry setting redundant. Subsequently, there is no palpable reason for tension between the leads, which makes for a very lacklustre experience. This might have been saved by a crackle of sexual chemistry but there is none. Cooper looks good without his shirt on but so what? Nobody wants to stare at those two weird faces for two and half hours. Some of the gruff-voiced dialogue is embarrassing (Sam Elliott, anyone?). Following in the unfortunate footsteps of 'Mother!' and 'Hereditary', it's unintentionally funny in parts and boring in others. The songs aren't bad but they're not in the same league as those from the 1976 version. Gaga's performance on the stage is, of course, good but not that good. She screeches out the songs from the beginning and consequently has nowhere to go for the denouement. Let's face it, she has about a quarter of Streisand's talent and none of the charisma. I can see the effort, but mediocre results. Next!"

","Shrieking, loud, interminable re-telling of a familiar story that didn't need to be re-told. This is nothing but a vanity project for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper with terrible music.<br/><br/>There's no need to recap the story since everyone knows it. Aside from the killing pace that drags this one on to 135 minutes, it's also notable that there's not a likable character in the film. That includes the stars, the grasping manager, the dim father, and the bizarre character played by Sam Elliott. What point was trying to be made my casting 74-year-old Elliott as 44-year-old Cooper's brother? It defies logic.<br/><br/>The story was better told in WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD? (1932) starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman, A STAR IS BORN (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, A STAR IS BORN (1954) starring Judy Garland and James Mason, and A STAR IS BORN (1976) starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, as well as several others with the same plot.<br/><br/>This one has inane plot points like the tribute to Roy Orbison and a one-word cameo by Alec Baldwin. And what's the point to the drag club? This was lifted from Bette Midler's THE ROSE (1979).<br/><br/>This version is about as entertaining as an open wound scarring over. Indeed, a scar is born."

"itgirlx","4","53","98","16 October 2018"," A Star Dies but won't go away.
","This won't be a popular review based on the high ratings this film is receiving but I have to say it-this film is all about Bradley Cooper rather than the star Ally. 
Cooper's Maine character just eats up the scenery throughout the film; Gaga's Ally just enables him despite her hurt feelings and his destructive behavior, while she is barely given the screen time to shine.
There are a number of tropes from the previous incarnations of this film, some from '54 and many from the '76 issues of this great love story.
I warmed to the beginning of the film and Jackson's charm while courting Ally. It soon melted into too many scenes that were disjointed and all about Jack. Ally's meteoric rose was depicted in an odd way-her music morphed into much more a Lady Gaga style which seemed not to fit the character of Ally. All the while, Jackson's dive was just more of the same stumbling drunkness without truly showing how his pain affected Ally and himself.
The last 30 minutes of the film were painful to watch because I just wanted it to be over but needed to see how he dies and how she handles it. I was nonplussed. 
Finally, the last performance was lackluster and Bradley Cooper had to be all over that as well. Too much Brad, not enough Star."
"stephanebarbier","3","53","98","9 October 2018"," The narcissist and the singer
","Mark my words: Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born is going to win a bunch of awards this fall, and for all the wrong reasons.
Cooper is playing a successful rock-star (complete with addictions) and he has the look down to Hollywood perfection, long greasy-but-attractive hair and husky mid-western growl. He sounds about right too as a singer (and people will marvel at the work he's put into vocal and stage training) but his soul isn't quite there. He's manufactured a contradiction: a boozy self-destructive drug addict who always stays clean and agreeable. In a scene intended to show his lowest point, he pisses himself, drunk onstage at the Grammy's, but even that moment is presented tastefully. His urine has no stink or colour.
When Bette Midler played a fictionalized version of Janis Joplin in The Rose, you could smell the sweat and the substances, and that performance really stabbed you. She was exactly the right performer for the material (a fully-developed script by Bo Goldman), and she was directed (miraculously by Mark Rydell) to her full potential, and then some. 
Lady Gaga does come alive when she's singing, but her scenes here don't amount to anything. They're snippets of a characterization, and you're not sure whether the inferior script or the underlying sense of self-control is responsible. She seems to be acting with one eye on the monitor. My guess is it's as much a Gaga project as it is Cooper's. Again moviegoers and fans alike will gasp at the self-proclaimed (and I think highly self-monitored) de-glamorization of Gaga, a performer known for visual hyper-creativity, and mistake it for mastery. She's also the wrong person to begin with: who can buy a performer so over-exposed and self-exposed as Lady Gaga as a reluctant newcomer? It just feels dishonest on her behalf.
Very early in the film I became so disengaged that I started thinking about why I didn't feel anything. About an hour in it struck me: every time Cooper and Lady Gaga were onscreen together it felt like the first time, like two actors who'd never met (their characters often acting surprised to see each other without explanation also created consistent gaps in continuity). Whether this is intentional to allow improvisation isn't clear, but I was constantly longing for a connection that wasn't there. The words weren't there on the page, and the two star performers kept acting out their own narcissistic movie."

"anonymouscontent-14248","1","51","95","9 October 2018"," Blinders off
","I'm going to write this review as though I didn't know there were four previous remakes.<br/><br/>I thought this film would really focus on a hidden talent with a beautiful soulful being discovered.<br/><br/>This is what happens. A beautiful vulnerable open singer (gaga) who sings at a drag club is discovered singing la vie on rose by a famous singer (cooper). The chemistry between these two actors works. The opening moments are vulnerable and honest with a few cute and endearing moments. Bradley looks lovingly at her and twinkles his eyes with a wide tight grin, which he reuses over and over again in the movie. <br/><br/>There are holes in bad editing about why the characters keep getting pulled together when you look at it frame by frame. Lady Gaga has vocal range and can rise seamless from a deep loud belt to a soft vulnerable falsetto. Her acting is great in the opening and in the second half it falls through and is incongruent with her arc and relationship but is still relatively good. The directing choices made for gaga by cooper were not good for the second half of the film. Gaga also lacks emotional depth in her eyes and facial expressions though I've seen her in interviews and She is capable of making them. The female character is not well or strongly written. Bradley coopers character and arc get really good in the second half of the film and it's a killer performance. There are a ton of cheesy cliche lines that are delivered by the actors as such. The sentimental nose thing that they do three times in the movie endearing how Bradley loves her nose is over done and forced every time it is done after the scene where she is outside her house which was done well the first time.<br/><br/>The story is what gets me the most. I am no stranger to addiction or careers in the arts but this is a problem with Hollywood that will persist to getting oscars. A male alc addict who was drinking buddies with his dad finds a beautiful rose (Gaga) and does not want to pluck it or kill its soul because that would kill the talent. So instead he lets her be added to his performance. She is poor waitressing tables and he is a millionaire. He feels bad about killing her soul musically when she makes cheap music after her manager transforms her into something that she is not. His relationship with her is not enough to push him over the edge so the manager tells cooper he is bad for Gaga when he is finishing rehab which pushes his to commit suicide. His relationship with her and guilt wasn't enough to do that it was this strange manager who was very guilt tripping and aggressive and wasn't deeply developed enough as a character. She is untraditionally beautiful but has a beautiful soul but is coerced into making cheap music and lyrics changing everything about her appearance and dancing sexily. She has the ultimate struggle that everyone women faces but the depths of it are not seen and the focus protagonist and one we are directed to sympathize with is cooper. He is sad about how the industry takes women with soul and cheapens them to make money and she has a beautiful soul and has to sacrifice herself to ""make it"" but none of the emotional strides she goes through in that department are truly seen or felt. Instead she feels guilty about his addiction and he kills himself because he feels guilty for her soul dying in the sacrifices for fame because the manager pushes him to do so through guilt tripping. Gaga struggles the most with her character being a deeply profound lyricist with critical thoughts about the world having to ""so easily"" give up herself for stardom. The transition is not present in the direction or writing but is critical to the pathos of the story. Instead we sympathize for an rich rock star that got to write deep lyrics and sing on stage by himself while she was happy singing with her drag friends being her full self and then had to lose all of her soul and change her looks to something she was not for fame. That struggle is not even depicted in the movie or felt. And it ends up being a sympathizer movie of an alcoholic that faced way less life adversity and then committed suicide. While we know her situation financially was weak but artistically and soulfully full in the beginning and then gets flipped upside down, but we do not truly or deeply see that struggle and transformation. Coops acting at the second half was great, but a lot of the self indulgent directing took away for what this movie could have been and the depth of their relationship."

","Despite scattered individual moments of interest, this long dull remake needs a writer, an editor and a concept. Only one song survives without butchery, La Vie En Rose. The story details are ludicrous, the relationship unexplored, some dialogue unintelligible, and the ending preposterous. Her not-very-big big nose, his non existent manager, the big brother's mumblind instead of speaking, and her bulldozer cliche driven manager all contribute to the unbelievable fairy tale romance that leaves with one word: REALLY. This film is just some beautiful dead space. And cutting her final song for a shot of the dead male singer doing a duet. No thanks. Save your money"

If Garland and Mason did not win, no way should they in this version. I did not get the intimate feeling between them and career nurturing for her

Perhaps writing and directing as well as learning to play the guitar really badly was a bit of a strain.<br/><br/>In the end this is no more than a 'tribute movie'; a tribute to the Streisand/Kristofferson version.

","So boring. There is no ""chemistry"" between the two leads - everything is so rote, so cliched and so dull. As a viewer I was not rooting for anyone, did not see any real reason for these two to be together and I found the songs utterly uninspired. As poetry, they are trite in the extreme and the music adds nothing. If anything it makes them even duller. The lyrics are clunky and barely accommodate the trudging onward of the music. The one exception is the pop song which knows what it is meant to be, does not pretend to be anything else and succeeds in its chosen genre.<br/><br/>I am stunned at the rave reviews that go so far as to suggest that if you did not like it you are somehow emotionally lacking. No, there is a way to make romantic sparks come alive on screen and in song, this movie had NONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>This sentence, buried in a review full of apologies for not sufficiently liking the movie, sums it up: ""I just felt the lead characters were ultimately cardboard cutouts of music cliches without any nuance or originality.""

I didn't enjoy watching Bradly Cooper stumble and mumble around drunk for most of it and Lady Gaga's singing talent was mostly wasted on lackluster songs. The movie lacked depth and character development so it was difficult to be emotionally invested in the characters. I didn't even care that Bradly Cooper's character killed himself.

And I always love seeing Sam Elliott.<br/><br/>But...I just didn't find it compelling at all. Cooper sounds like he's doing a Sam Elliott impression, which is fine, but it also means he ends up just mumbling and you miss a fair bit of dialogue.

The relationship between Ally (GaGa) and Jack (Cooper) moves along so quickly that it is simply not believable or interesting. The movie itself is moving at a snail's pace, though, and I found it terribly boring. Wow, I mean BORING! On top of that Bradley was mumbling so much that I could hardly hear what he was saying most of the time. Was this done intentionally in an attempt to make it feel more realistic??<br/><br/>I liked the music - and that's as much as I enjoyed about the film, although - towards the end - even the music started to bore me.

","Bradley Cooper thoroughly understands the soul of an artist and what makes great art, and I think that he wanted to express that meaning in this film. For the most part he accomplished that mission.<br/><br/>There are so many times when Stefani Germanotta or Bradley Cooper said something in a manner that made me slightly emotional. When Germanotta said simply, ""you hurt me"" as Cooper's character was apologizing it was just gorgeous. She didn't overplay it or try to embellish the line. It was just naked and honest, like their awesome musical performances.<br/><br/>Cooper and the production team also know how a corporate hack will try to steer an artist away from his vision as one steered Germanotta away from her voice. I love that she regained her voice through tragedy at the end of the movie, but I hated the tragedy itself-- it seemed so forced.<br/><br/>I understand that they wanted to remain true to the original version, so the suicide was retained, but it just seemed to throw off everything. When I was in film school so many aspiring screenwriters included suicide as part of their stories, which was obviously usually lazy writing. Our teachers admonished us for it and said that we were all intelligent students who should strive for more. It's what I felt about the ending to this movie-- it had so much potential, and it could have amounted to so much more."

Honestly the acting wasn't bad or anything, Cooper, Gaga and Elliott were believable and the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga was definitely there. Only thing with Gaga was I didn't really buy her first ""oh I'm an average girl on a big stage, now I'm getting shy"" performance, but ok she gets away with that.
Real problem for me is the movie itself, it just didn't capture me cause the storyline was too thin and to me it just felt like they filmed a bunch of scenes and then just pasted them together. It jumped from one moment into the other! Also it annoyed me that Ally was constantly soooo understanding towards her husband. He acted like a miserable a*hole with way too much selfpitty if you'd ask me, but I only saw them arguing once. And last but not least, I'm assuming that the 'star is born' part is supposed to be about her, but in the end it basically wasn't about her reaching fame, it was mostly about his decline.."

Throughout you often wonder where you were, what house, what state, what universe. Gaga is not a great actress, the songs were forgettable, Gaga even seemed weak in the upper register when she sang, and the story was such a cliche.

"akamri","2","16","27","19 October 2018"," A Star is Dead
","Instead of being about about a talented and ambitious woman climbing up the stairs to fame, this movie was about a once star slowly fading away. Bradley Cooper put himself as the main character of this movie and completely emptied out the storyline. The film opens and closes with him. Also, this movie gets the top place in not having any women, except for Gaga, in it. Her best friend is a man, all her friends are men, her agent is a man, his agent is man, his best friend/driver is a man, she only has a father, no mother, and he hangs out with his male colleagues. Of course no two women ever hold a conversation. And this is not a requirement of the story line - women are out there in daily life and in the music industry. This is not the story of a bright star born- this is the story of a random girl who an older and much more powerful but broken and incompetent man, who first drags her into the spotlights, and then hurts and embarrasses her time after time with almost no objections from her side.<br/><br/>The music and the shots were also not to my liking. The acting of Gaga leaves much to be desired. There is no chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Gaga, and the supposedly intense emotions dont transcend. I am really surprised at the formidable reviews- I guess movie critics are not trustworthy..."

"bastille-852-731547","7","48","96","6 October 2018"," Cooper Delivers A Potent Directorial Debut
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, ""A Star Is Born,"" is a very satisfying and well-made remake of the classic story. While it does have some flaws, the film is generally powerful and thoughtful. In the film, Cooper stars as a troubled country/rock musician who falls in love with a pop star (Lady Gaga.) Viewers will likely be thrilled by the considerable musical talent on display here, as the songs are incredibly well performed. The acting in the film is very strong, with Bradley Cooper giving a wholly convincing performance as such an ambiguous and flawed protagonist. I didn't expect Lady Gaga to be completely convincing in her role, but she did a great job with both acting as well as singing (she has several moments in the spotlight during the film's concert or other music-based moments.) Sam Elliott headlines the film's supporting cast, and he also does not disappoint either. Look for these positive qualities to absolutely be recognized during awards season this winter.<br/><br/>While the film's music and acting are superb, some notable lapses are present over the course of the movie's 135-minute running time. The first concern with the film that I have is that it does run a bit too long, and could have easily trimmed 20 or 25 minutes off its running time without sacrificing anything of importance. The film does, from time to time, take the unfortunate route of indulging in some cheesy clichÃ©s of romantic dramas. This isn't surprising, but it's a bit unfortunate for a film that otherwise feels fairly structurally unique despite being a remake of a film that has been made multiple times before. But at the end of the day, viewers who see this film are here for strong performances and a great soundtrack. On those merits, they will certainly be rewarded, and I do recommend this film for sure. 7.5/10"
"Jared_Andrews","8","32","61","8 October 2018"," A Remarkable Achievement
","Sometimes weighty expectations can crush a movie before it has any chance to pop. With ""A Star is Born,"" a moving trailer and excited murmurs from film festivals, created seemingly unreachable levels of hype. Then, somehow, it reached them.<br/><br/>In Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, he manages to instill life and a reasonable degree of freshness into a movie that had already been made three times previously. He clearly has a knack for capturing intimacy, and he uses that skill to make a movie that is deeply personal to himself, to co-star Lady Gaga, and to the characters they portray.<br/><br/>It's a remarkable achievement that this movie works. Cooper certainly deserves heaps of credit for his directing acumen and committed acting performance (he worked with a vocal coach for months to lower his speaking voice a whole octave). His voice is low, rumbling, and worn. He sounds like someone who has just finished coughing for four and a half days straight. It suits the character, Jackson Maine, who struggles with drinking and drug use, all while still managing to perform nearly every night in front of thousands of fans who adore his music.<br/><br/>One night he stumbles drunk into a bar and sees Ally (Gaga) performing. She wows him with her talent and inspires him ways that we sense he hasn't felt in years. In an approach that vacillates between creepy and romantic, he woos Ally by accepting her as she is, not who she thinks others want her to be.<br/><br/>The next night when she attends his show, he whisks her on stage to sing the song they wrote together. The crowd goes berserk and soon the two are touring the country together. As her level of fame rises, he warns her that she must dig deep into her soul to create her art or she will lose everything.<br/><br/>They each fight their own battles, his with drugs, alcohol and demons from his past, and hers with not letting fame change her. Cooper's character has more to work with, but it's Gaga who shines brightest on screen. We're all well aware of her immense musical talent, and now we know that she's also an exceptional actor, one who could find herself seriously in award conversation later this year.<br/><br/>She may not be the only one from this film in the award conversation. Cooper's acting and directing will rightfully garner consideration as well. He aptly handles an ambitious, emotional story that does not hold back in any way. Its lack of humility should probably cause its downfall, but that's not the case. Credit both Cooper and Gaga for pulling this off. It looks like two stars have been born."

","I am shocked to see all the Gaga fans rating this film months before it even came out. The film is getting a lot of hype because Gaga is in it. I'm not really a Lady Gaga fan, but I do know her music and respect her as a musician. Here is my take on the film:<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper stole the show. I was never a fan of his until now. If anyone were to win an award from this movie, it would be him. He was so good that he made me cry. To me, the movie felt more like the Lady Gaga documentary: part 2. The film is supposed to be about a woman songwriter who never wanted to share her music to the world, and was too embarrassed because she thought she was ugly. It sounds exactly like Lady Gaga's own biography. So it was almost as if she was playing herself- No acting needed. She was not bad at all, but definitely not Oscar worthy. Bradley, on the other hand was so good, but not surprising because he was already a great actor. His directing here is stellar too. I've never seen the original so I can't compare. I'm all for remakes, reboots and sequels, but this one was made too many times. People at the movie theater today were constantly checking their phones to see what time it was. It was a good movie, but nothing extraordinary. Cooper shined and stood out to me the most, though."

"vinylvanilla","1","16","28","27 January 2019"," Definitely the worst ""A Star is Born"" remake
","I dare to differ from the bandwagon here. Bradley Cooper's debut as a director is okay, but nothing beyond that.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly an unremarkable movie, and perhaps the weakest of all ASIB remakes. The first mistake Bradley made was to remake a remake. And if he was trying to do something new, he didn't accomplish the mission.<br/><br/>Cooper's ASIB looks and feels like a movie made for TV. Pace is absurdly slow, cinematography is as basic as it gets and the acting of both Bradley and Gaga is mediocre and I honestly cannot understand the buzz over them, especially when it comes to Gaga.<br/><br/>I can acknowledge that she wasn't terrible as Ally but she wasn't brilliant, either. In all honesty, playing a singer with an unique nose is not something out of Gaga's comfort zone. And the basic, underwhelming plot kept Gaga locked in that comfort zone. I didn't see one single scene (not even the so much talked about bathtub scene) that made Gaga work hard or use her so-called acting skills. Everything was dramatically easy there. If there really is a brilliant actress inside Gaga, this role didn't enable her to show it to the audience.<br/><br/>Cooper's performance is way better than Gaga's - and his character, dramatically speaking, is much harder to be played - but unfortunately, he is not getting much appraisal while Gaga is getting nominations that to me are not justified. I honestly think that people are mistaking Gaga the actress for Gaga the singer and judging her acting skills (?) based on her singing skills.<br/><br/>Regarding the songs, by the way, the only one that is not that bad is Shallow, but any vocal coach would agree that those high notes in the chorus are definitely not Gaga's comfort zone and she shows it. She is almost screaming in the chorus and the rest of the songs are just a pop pastiche that you don't want to listen at home. And to think that the latest remake had the greatest singer alive, Barbra Streisand!<br/><br/>Anyway, this is to me a movie that won't be remembered in the next 10 years. I am pretty sure Bradley Cooper has a lot potential as a director, but he has to keep working on that and maybe cast better actresses for his movies."

But - his character just rolled around playing every rock n roll cliche in the book. <br/><br/>Lady Gaga is so obviously talented, it made the difference between the characters age seem like Lady Gaga was the road-worn talent and BC was just a dude in a beard that got the girl.<br/><br/>Better movies to watch: ""That Thing You Do"" has a solid story evolution and tender chemistry between Liv Tyler and Tom Everett Scott. ""Music and Lyrics"" has more charm with the relationship between Hugh Grant (as the old dog) and Drew Barrymore as the shy emerging talent character, and if you really want the darker side, then 'Walk the Line' did it better because there was a real story behind it and I was rooting for Reese and Joaquin to succeed, carrying an unfamiliar acting role.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie for date night."

","If you've had the opportunity to see the first version with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, the second version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and the third version with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, then you're more than schooled on this story. Why another version is made, I'll never know. Hollywood is losing their originality in film. This particular version was just OK for me - the usual hype and usual story. Nothing fantastic, nothing fabulous. Just another remake. Music from Streisand's version was the best for me. Gaga is too old for the part and Cooper doesn't fit the part. Can't see all the hype in this - but if you're the 20-30 year old crowd, it will hit the charts. And, if you are in that bracket, take the time to check the other versions of this story. They might surprise you. This one just does not."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","32","67","4 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga shine in this powerful and inspiring drama.
","If you had told me that I would have cried at a movie starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in 2018 a few years ago, I would have laughed. The two A-list stars have done something nothing short of iconic in Cooper's directorial debut in A Star Is Born. This is the fourth feature with this title, first appearing in 1937, followed by the 1954 version starring Judy Garland, and then later followed in 1976 with Barbra Streisand. Remaking a film for the fourth time's a risky move, even by mainstream Hollywood's standards. Luckily, Bradley Cooper does it perfectly, creating a film that will be talked about for decades. 
 Bradley Cooper directs himself in the lead role as Jackson Maine, a drug addicted alcoholic who happens to be a famous musician. Despite his career success, his life is haunted by his troubled past and his addictions. It comes as no surprise that our male protagonist meets a woman who changes his life. It sounds like a familiar tune (no pun intended), yet what Cooper does is different. Casting the talented and world famous Lady Gaga as Maine's partner Ally, a struggling waitress who's looking for a breakthrough into the music business, the two characters form a passionate relationship that transports both of them musically and spiritually. 
 Few first time directors are as talented as Bradley Cooper. Within the first five minutes of the film we're easily aware that this talented actor has a gifted eye for storytelling and the craft of filmmaking. The only issue with this talent of Cooper's is that it's easy to miss due to his magnificent performance. Few actors are capable of captivating audiences with such an authentic and rich character portrayal as Cooper does in A Star Is Born. He presents a man traumatized emotionally and gives us a raw, natural look at the human condition and the desire for belonging and change. 
 Bradley Cooper's performance is especially terrific due to his chemistry with Lady Gaga. The two actors complement each other beautifully, their characters and performances growing with the audience in a nuanced and artful fashion. Gaga sings better than ever in her entire career in this film, most notably in her duet with Cooper titled Shallow, which has already become a popular song before the film has even been released. It's hands down one of cinema's best original songs to date. Gaga's musical talent is contagious. Her powerful voice and unscathed emotions while performing is the stuff stars of made of. Her acting, however, may even be better than her singing. Few actors can act so naturally and impact the audience in such an effective way as Gaga does here. Expect the singer and dancer to be in more films as a serious actor. 
 The singing and acting is beautiful and terrific, yet what hits home the hardest is the fresh and powerful story. Few films allow us as viewers to care so much and relate to people who, even though might be famous musicians, we can identify with and root for to succeed and overcome their obstacles. Stories in general are there for us to connect with, which is what this film excels at marvelously. It's an unexpected gem that is simply not to be missed."

","Big names do not always guarantee high quality products. Despite the fact that this is a remake, the directing disappointed. The same can be said about the play of actors. Lady Gaga from the first scene works in public as a high-class professional, and not a timid debutante with adrenaline boiling inside. Bradley Cooper clearly outplays with alcoholism and in his condition it is impossible to believe in his role as a popular rock star. The soundtrack is quite boring, although it may appeal to fans of the singer."
"heisenberg12","6","8","13","19 October 2018"," Overrated but decent
","This is a little overrated. Just because a movie jerks a few tears doesn't mean it's anything great. Many average films have evoked sadness, but that doesn't mean they are special. While the end was much better than what came before it, it didn't elevate it enough to raise the overall rating. I had mixed feelings about the movie:<br/><br/>The Good- Pretty good pace (if you're not into love stories or musical type movies, it's not that hard to sit through due to the decent edits and cuts) although at times I uncharacteristically could have used longer scenes at times, by the end of the movie you have to give credit to Cooper as the director (I didn't realize he directed it as I was watching), Lady Gaga's voice is an asset to the movie, and it does evoke emotion at times.<br/><br/>The Bad- It misses on some notes, especially early on how the formation of the relationship feels rushed and almost not believable in a way, despite some aspects of charm which were decent (the scene where Gaga hits the guy at the bar wasn't buyable and isn't that assault), unfortunately even though I appreciate actors taking risks, it's a little bit masturbatory throughout the first quarter of it with regards to Hollywood stars celebrating themselves, I thought Cooper overacted just a little bit in this with his voice that reminded me of what Tom Hardy does and despite it I never saw anybody but Cooper in the role (in other words, the staple of a great acting performance is you don't even recognize the actor anymore but even with the voice focus, it didn't make me see Cooper any less than ever), it is comparable to a long music video at many times (but it's a movie), and it was somewhat superficial at times when it could have used more depth to increase the quality (for example, the way her career was able to develop and take off was done well enough to make you invested in it, but at the same time it happened so fast and what seemed like somewhat easily, which is hard to believe with the difficulty of that industry, so by the time the final quarter of the movie arrived, I didn't feel as much as I should have felt for Ally's journey).<br/><br/>On an end note, the film does have charm and Cooper's character's story was poignant and lead to a place that had some power. While the movie is overrated, it's not bad at all and is slightly above average. I would recommend a watch, but don't expect anything super sensational or an elite classic or anything that you would want to watch again or over and over. ""Walk the Line"" is a similar movie that is probably a little bit better than this one is overall.<br/><br/>
6.8/10"
"Lamiae","5","14","26","29 October 2018"," Missed Opportunities
","I enjoyed the first 45 minutes of the film. I found the way Jackson (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Gaga) met, began their collaboration, and fell in love, to be captivating. The high point of the film was the first time they performed live together. The on-stage scenes were filmed beautifully and realistically.<br/><br/>I found the rest of the film to be mediocre because of minimal character and plot development. Here's an example: Ally gets into a fist fight with policemen early in the film, which set an expectation that this side of her character would be elaborated later on. But - oddly - she never portrayed any form of (physical) aggression thereafter. This fist fight snippet had me waiting for scenes of jealousy and heated arguments, in response to the many challenges of being involved with a major rock star (e.g., him being on tour, late nights with band members and roadies, long-distances, infidelity, groupies etc). Ally didn't get the chance to explore and react to these kinds of experiences at all, which made me question why the fist fight scene was even shot to begin with. In relation to this, I have to ask: where were the groupies? Where were the backstage stories? How can a rock extravaganza exist without any backstage action? I just didn't find the 'context' of the relationship between a rock star and a rising star to be realistically portrayed.<br/><br/>Another character/plot weakness included Ally's development as a musician. She started as a scruffy, unconventional, rock singer (which suited her), but then rather abruptly ""sold out"" to become a pop star (we got to hear horrendous songs at that point), and ended up in a posh concert hall propped up like a Celine Dion (!) I found these transitions to be bizarre, boarding on the surreal.<br/><br/>I think Gaga was the weakest link in this film. While her role could have been 'easy' for her (she has relevant experiences to draw from after all), she struggled. To the contrary, Cooper's rock star performance was almost effortless, but still, I was expecting more complexity, more to be going on in his personal life. Apart from the references to his troubled childhood, it was as if he had been carrying no other personal baggage at the time he met Ally - how could this be? Give us an ex-wife, a child from a woman living in another country - something to show that he has... well, lived! Didn't Cooper read any rock star bios prior to this?<br/><br/>I also didn't like the end. Jackson may have had weaknesses, he may have been a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but I found his last move to be out-of-character. He did show quite a bit of maturity throughout the film and I thus felt that he could have ""helped"" Ally in a different way. The end was a classic example of cheap sentimentalism; some viewers were crying, so I guess you could call the film a tearjerker.<br/><br/>It's an okay film that's been overrated by viewers and critics alike."

Maybe he got a lot of advice from Eastwood or O'Russell, but this is cinema on a grand scale.<br/><br/>The film denotes tragedy from the very beginning, Cooper is a drug addicted alcoholic, and with the bluntest use of foreshadowing I have seen in a film in a very long time (look for the neon sign just before the car pulls into the bar where GaGa is singing) you can tell that it's not going to end well.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two leads is good, especially in the second act when the narcissist comes out of Maine, Ally stands by him, even though he is pointing out her fears she described in the first act, she is loyal and his rock.<br/><br/>But the real chemistry comes with that of the Maine brothers, I really wish there were more scenes between Elliott and Cooper. They are just so believable as bickering brothers, and the scene where Elliott is pulling away from Cooper is one of the most emotional scenes I have seen this year.<br/><br/>And Dice Clay is brilliant as Ally's father, again the chemistry between those two is paramount to the films success.<br/><br/>It's a bonafide classic, touching in places, funny in others, but the element of despair the film has is a little to rife for me.<br/><br/>But all in all, it's wonderful"

","A Star is Born was met with a rapturous reception at its Venice Film Festival premiÃ¨re earlier this year, and has since gone on to receive near universal critical acclaim (90% on Rotten Tomatoes at time of writing), with much speculation as to its staying-power come award season. And whilst I liked it, and found a great deal to admire, I didn't love it. At least I didn't love all of it.<br/><br/>The fourth version of the story (the fifth if you count <a href=""/title/tt0023686/"">What Price Hollywood? (1932)</a>), this particular version is written by <a href=""/name/nm0177896/"">Bradley Cooper</a>, <a href=""/name/nm0744839/"">Eric Roth</a>, and <a href=""/name/nm3391497/"">Will Fetters</a>, and directed by Cooper, who sticks pretty close to the beats of the previous versions. Jackson Maine (Cooper) is a fading drug-addicted and alcoholic country and western singer suffering from tinnitus, who is just about being held together by his tour manager and elder brother, Bobby (an exceptional <a href=""/name/nm0000385/"">Sam Elliott</a>). When Maine encounters Ally Campana (<a href=""/name/nm3078932/"">Lady Gaga</a>), he's impressed by her singing abilities, inviting her to his next show. During his performance, he unexpectedly invites her on stage to sing one of her own songs, and the crowd love it. Joining him on tour, they soon they begin a romantic relationship, but as Ally's popularity grows, she is approached by Rez (<a href=""/name/nm1969169/"">Rafi Gavron</a>), a music producer who offers her a record deal but moves her away from her pseudo-unplugged origins towards a more manufactured style of pop, Meanwhile, Maine begins to voice his disapproval, whilst increasingly indulging in drink and drug binges.<br/><br/>To begin with what I disliked. Firstly, the first half is markedly superior to the second, which comes down to pacing issues and editing rhythm. Whereas the first half really takes its time in setting up the characters and their relationship (it's nearly an hour before the first kiss), the second half often feels rushed, offering almost a highlight reel of events spread out over many months, without really giving any of them time to breathe.<br/><br/>Secondly, I had some problems with the character of Maine. As is the case with all previous versions of the story, although the woman is ostensibly the lead, the man's troubles are the focus of the narrative, with the template established in 1937 (or 1932) inviting the audience to pity the man more than admire the woman. But with Cooper writing, producing, directing and starring, this can come across as a little self-indulgent in ways which weren't an issue in previous versions, with the film going to some lengths to ensure we never think really badly of him despite his, at times, utterly reprehensible behaviour. Additionally, Cooper's Maine is the least convincing and wantonly self-destructive drunk of any of the four Star male leads, with only one scene where he genuinely seems to be completely hammered (although, to be fair, it's a cracking scene).<br/><br/>Another issue, and one which I totally recognise I'm in the minority regarding, is that I found Gaga's performance a mixed bag. I hated her work in <a href=""/title/tt1844624/"">American Horror Story (2011)</a>, where I thought her sultry and seductive vampire was a mass of clichÃ©s and overacting. She's a lot better here, but still nothing spectacular, essentially doing a <a href=""/name/nm0000659/"">Barbra Streisand</a> impression (albeit a decent one). Additionally, her performance doesn't really go any way towards showing us why this young woman would want to be with an alcoholic twice her age (apart from the fact that he's good for her career). Gaga never lets us see her fall in love with him, despite the framework being right there in the script.<br/><br/>The gender politics are also (somewhat) troubling; firmly rooted in the 1937 (or 1932) original, Ally is controlled and manipulated by men from start to finish, and the entire story is predicated on the fact that she needs a man's help to enable her to make her breakthrough. In this sense, it might have been interesting to reverse the genders, and instead have the film tell the story of a fading, substance-abusing older woman mentoring a hungry up-and-coming young man. It would probably be automatically criticised by the type of men who downvote anything gender progressive, but it would have been an interesting modern spin on an old story.<br/><br/>To counter that suggestion, however, and move onto what I liked about the film, it could be argued that by effectively maintaining the themes of the previous iterations of the story (and, in relation to the 1976 version, actually returning to plot points which were ill-advisedly discarded), the film is simply embracing its histrionic Classical Hollywood genesis, unapologetically retelling a traditional story in much the same manner as it was originally conceived.<br/><br/>Which is not to say it tries nothing new, or never goes left when you expect it to go right. For example, the film never once implies that Ally's new style under Rez is any less authentic than it was under Maine's tutelage, or that his is somehow more ""truthful"" than hers. After she has her hair dyed, Ally looks in a mirror and says, ""it doesn't even look like me"", and I fully expected this to be the beginning of an arc which satirised what the industry has cost her, pointing out that the only way she could make it as an artist was by abandoning the art that meant anything to her, in favour of something synthetic. But that doesn't happen. Her new style (which becomes closer and closer to the real Lady Gaga as the film goes along) is presented as simply different from Maine's, in the way that his would have been different from those who came before him. If anything, the film presents the whole thing as a fairly organic evolution, with a lyric of what appears to be Maine's best-known song telling us, ""maybe it's time to let the old ways die.""<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film which worked well is that there was genuine sexual chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. Sure, having a good script helps tremendously in this sense, but just because there is chemistry on the page, doesn't necessarily mean there'll be chemistry on the screen (think of the wet fish of a relationship that is <a href=""/name/nm3229685/"">Kit Harington</a> and <a href=""/name/nm3592338/"">Emilia Clarke</a>'s romance on <a href=""/title/tt0944947/"">Game of Thrones (2011)</a> - I've seen more chemistry between siblings). And although I do have some issues with the performances, the element of sexual attraction is very much there for all to see.<br/><br/>Copper's direction is also pretty impressive, giving the rock world milieu a sense of lived-in verisimilitude - from the drugs, to the living out of limos and hotel rooms, to the whirlwind nature of it all, the film presents perhaps the most vibrantly realistic portrayal of the music industry since <a href=""/title/tt0181875/"">Almost Famous (2000)</a>. Visually, Cooper's direction is functional (more the laconic style of <a href=""/name/nm0000142/"">Clint Eastwood</a> than the hyperkinetic style of Cooper's frequent collaborator, <a href=""/name/nm0751102/"">David O. Russell</a>), never drawing attention to itself, and allowing instead the camera to be a fairly passive observer. For the most part, Cooper as director is invisible, which makes sense, given the nature of the story (the ominous nooses seen hanging above Maine on a billboard are a little over the top, however). He also avoids the type of clichÃ©s we usually see in this kind of story. For example, to suggest the increasing success of a character, a standard music film will undoubtedly feature either a single scene or a montage of hasty autograph signings, a scene or two of an increasingly rabid fanbase, and at least one, but usually more, chaotic press conferences. Cooper features none of these, relying instead on scenes which illustrate to us Ally's popularity in a more organic manner (for example, we know how successful she has become when she is asked to perform on <a href=""/title/tt0072562/"">Saturday Night Live (1975)</a>).<br/><br/>Yes, Cooper is trying to make a gritty version of one of the most glitzy show-business narratives, which might strike one as an oxymoron, but, for the most part, he strikes a fine balance between over-the-top showbiz fantasy, populated by larger-than-life characters and cartoonish histrionics, and a more grounded and intimate romance imparting universal truths about the sacrifices one may have to make for the person one loves. To cite just one example of how well he handles this dichotomy, the scenes which introduce the two leads are as far as you can imagine from razzmatazz - Maine is shown alone in a green room popping pills before staggering onto stage, and Ally is shown in a toilet cubicle breaking up with her boyfriend over the phone. These two scenes set the tone nicely, and are a credit to Cooper's directorial choices.<br/><br/>All things considered, A Star is Born is an impressive directorial debut, and is probably the best of the four versions of the story (it's certainly better than the 1937 and 1976 versions). Signalling the advent of Lady Gaga as a leading lady, the film also marks the arrival of an interesting new directorial voice. I didn't think it was as good as a lot of critics and fans have made it out to be, finding it a little too disposable at times, but I certainly enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to whatever it is that Cooper does next."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","10","18","18 October 2018"," One star that really does shine
","Had heard nothing but great things about this latest 'A Star is Born' film, with even my own sister saying it was a must see. There was also the interest to see how Lady Gaga would fare in her acting debut and how Bradley Cooper would fare as first-time director. Decided to see it when taking a break from practise with nothing else better to do, going in with very high expectations, as part of my ""seeing as many 2018 films as possible"" quest.<br/><br/>This is not the only, or first, 'A Star is Born' film. There is one from 1937 with Mitzi Gaynor and Fredric March, my personal favourite. There is one from 1954, the most famous, which is overlong but does contain Judy Garland's best ever performance and terrific songs (especially the heart-wrenching ""The Man That Got Away""), love James Mason in it too. There is the 1976 film with Barbra Streisand, personally don't care for it but Streisand sings beautifully and ""Evergreen"" is to die for.<br/><br/>As far as the versions of 'A Star is Born' goes, this one from 2018 compares extremely favourably. Not quite as good as the 1937 film, but on the same level as 1954 and better than 1976. May not love it as much as others, but the appeal is justified and the acclaim is deserved from my personal perspective. In terms of films from 2018, 'A Star is Born' is among the better ones.<br/><br/>It's not perfect. A few story elements are a touch rushed and lack credibility, like Ally getting stage spotlight in such a short space of time, and occasionally it's a little on-the-nose like the making Ally glitzier advice from Rez.<br/><br/>The final act also could have been tightened, slightly too padded and dragged out.<br/><br/>What 'A Star is Born' does so well is taking a familiar story and making it still fresh and relatable. It's always entertaining and glamorous yet the love story is every bit as important, and even more so, and is both charming and emotionally impactful. Everything about 'A Star is Born' is slick, endlessly entertaining and with lots of heart and surprising poignancy, also had the experience of not a dry eye being in the auditorium with tears silently rolling with me.<br/><br/>Visually, it's very eye catching and sumptuously made, beautifully shot with lots of glitzy glamour and style. Loved the songs, none are quite on the same level as ""The Man That Got Away"" and ""Evergreen"" but they are extremely well written, easy to remember, have a wide range of emotions, are very well sung and staged, are integrated beautifully integrated into the story, some moving the story forward or telling it through the song rather than being a grinding things to a halt distraction. ""I'll Never Love Again"" and ""Shallow"" stand out.<br/><br/>Dialogue has wit and heart and the story shines particularly in the first third. Cannot say anything bad about the performances, with Lady Gaga providing a contender for the most surprising performances of the year in a quite outstanding acting debut (her singing is also absolutely great of course), a star is born indeed. Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances as a charismatic and charming yet conflicted leading man, do not associate him with musicals and worried as to whether he would fit but it fits him like a glove. He too directs for the first time, and it is hard to believe that a directing job this slick and audacious was only his debut, really do disagree about his contributions being a vanity project with so much effort being put into everything. There is fine support from particularly Sam Elliott and the chemistry between the two leads is wholly believable.<br/><br/>Altogether, very, very good and often splendid. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","My partner and I sat through the majority of the movie wishing a) it would hurry up and that b) we went to Bohemian Rhapsody instead. I'm never going to trust the critics and audience reviewers again: this movie was straight up disappointing.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga can sing, and Bradley Cooper can act, and that's the extent of it. The plot was slow and shallow, if not predictable. Lady Gaga's character started out quite intriguing, then sold herself out to become some version of Lady Gaga herself anyway. She wasn't authentic at all (which probably summarised the music industry quite well, but her music didn't add to the soundtrack). About an hour in, I started checking my watch repeatedly ... I think I even fell asleep at one point. I haven't fallen asleep in a movie since The Revenant. I guess it's one of those movies trying so hard to be Oscar Nominated they forgot that viewers are paying to be entertained.<br/><br/>On the way home from the cinema we tried to figure out why we hated it. Was it because there was no depth to the characters despite potential for it? Was it because Lady Gaga was trying to play Barbra Streisand (rather than, like Judy Garland and Janet Gaynor before hand... playing someone original?), was it because the music was too Lady Gaga-pop instead of ballad? I mean, we're both musical fans with differing tastes, I hated the Greatest Showman and he loved it, I loved Hairspray and he hated it (so we both have different opinions on what makes a good musical), and we bring agreed that this was Bad. Or at least Boring. It simply wasn't all it was hyped up to be.<br/><br/>It might have been different if it was slightly faster, and it was about Jack's story. Then they could have renamed it a Star Dies or something less cliche. Anyway. Overall, 4 stars."

","I cannot believe I managed to sit through this entire movie. I nearly walked out of the theater like 10x I was so bored. So far, this is the worst movie I have seen all year (and I've seen a lot of movies released this year). Do NOT waste your money on it. If you must watch it, wait until its freely available online.<br/><br/>Story - This movie doesn't have a story. I mean, technically it does but its easily summed up. A musician wants a drink, goes to a bar, meets a woman, sees she is a good singer, creates opportunity for her to become famous, she becomes famous, and that is it. Any and all conflicts with the potential to become interesting aren't developed, and are instead resolved within the scene it is introduced, or just a few scenes later. There is an event where the male lead does a thing (I'm not going to spoil because there are people who are delusional to think that this movie is good) and he only does it so that people who were otherwise bored will feel sympathy for that character because the thing he does is inherently sad. It was an extremely cheap move on the filmmaker's part. I hate it when boring, meandering movies with no plot are seen as good because something sad happens to some underdeveloped characters at the end. Its manipulative and annoying. I can't believe that there were people in the theater with actual tears in their eyes. They may have been tears of boredom though, I know mine were. There is no tension or anything that builds up to that event, and it is completely unearned. I know I'm repeating myself, but this movie is so unbelievably boring. Nothing of interest happens. Before I saw this movie I remember seeing all the reviews praising Lady Gaga and for some reason I thought that it was about her and not that she was playing a fictional character. Honestly a biography about Lady Gaga would've been way more interesting than this. Pretty much anything is more interesting than this. The most interesting thing about this movie is its ridiculously high rating.<br/><br/>Characters - As I already said before, the characters are all severely underdeveloped. Its insulting to the word ""character"" to describe these entities as such. The acting is also pretty bad all around. Everyone mumbles their dialogue, and at times it is next to impossible to tell what they are rambling on about. There are very few scenes where the speech is actually coherent.<br/><br/>Visuals - This movie's one strong point is its presentation. It looks pretty. There are a lot of nice shots, and the camerawork is competent. Unfortunately, there isn't anything impressive enough to save this movie.<br/><br/>Also, a random thing I want to point out. For some reason Ally's (the female lead) isn't said until like halfway through the movie. Its kind of odd and annoying. Also the love story is super underdeveloped and rushed.<br/><br/>Ok. That's all. This movie really sucked and I can't believe I saw it in theaters."

"zkonedog","7","8","14","11 October 2018"," High Floor; Low Ceiling
","After watching this iteration of ""A Star Is Born"" (I actually had not seen any of the others previously), there's no way I could give it a ranking lower than seven stars. It's too solid of a film, featuring so many great auxiliary things happening, to go any lower. At the same time, however, there's also really no way I would rank it higher than maybe eight stars, either. To me, this was one of those movie experiences where the floor is very high, but the ceiling is relatively low.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""A Star Is Born"" tells the romantic tale of Jack (Bradley Cooper) & Ally (Lady Gaga). Jack is an on-the-way-out music star with a drinking problem and a bad case of tinnitus, but when when he chances upon Ally working at a drag bar and is completely enraptured with her voice, the chemistry between the two is immediate. He needs her to keep him out of the bottle, while she needs him to stay true to herself and remember to be confident. The relationship is tested to the brink, however, when Ally's own burgeoning career takes her further and further away from Jack.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting part of this film experience for me was seeing Cooper (also the director) produce a very gritty, down-to-earth, ""now-feeling"" flick using a concept ripped from the glitz-and-glamour dramas of Hollywood's Golden Era. Cooper takes this simple, relatively straightforward story and perfectly adapts it for these modern times. Jack & Ally are both characters that feel very relatable to the audience, the types one could find carrying on a similar romance even outside the cinema doors. This part of the equation is done perfectly.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why I can't quite call this film a true ""great"" (pulling the punch just a bit), though, is rooted in that very simplicity. I'm not going to say that every film's plot needs to be twisty or mysterious, but I will say this about ""A Star Is Born"": I feel like it was more a labor of ""let's turn this old story into something updated/better"" than anything. An emotional speech from Sam Elliott towards the end of the film really sums this up. While I respect that approach, it just isn't going to vault the movie into my film stratosphere. Hence, the 7/8 star rating is very much subjective to my own personal likings.<br/><br/>I don't want to sell the movie short at all, though, because it does so many things right:<br/><br/>-The music is indeed truly incredible. If you aren't listening to the soundtrack almost immediately after exiting your theater seat, you may not have a soul :)<br/><br/>-The acting is also top-notch. Cooper's performance might be award-worthy, and Gaga is practically just playing herself (which works because she's such an interesting individual even off camera).<br/><br/>-Never once did I find myself bored or disinterested while watching, as Cooper always infuses a sense of energy or forward motion into the proceedings. I also legitimately did not see the ending coming that was given to us.<br/><br/>So, despite perhaps not ranking extraordinarily high on my ""Best-Of"" lists, there are still a lot of things I will take away from this film, most notably the music and Cooper's performance. As I said in the opener, it's a little odd to see a film with this high a floor have such a potentially low ceiling in contrast."

","What do you have deep inside that you want to say? In Director Bradley Cooper's ""A Star Is Born"" his fading rock star Jackson Maine holds in his arms Lady Gaga's rising star Ally as they gaze at the billboard of her record album cover. Gravelly voiced Jack says, ""Dig down into your soul... Say what you wanna say, because what you say is the stuff of angels."" Director Bradley Cooper's feature debut poignantly asks what do you have to say to the world, so people want to listen. <br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" is uncompromising in discovering one's voice in the world acknowledging the darker humanity of addiction and depression. Bradley and Lady Gaga, in her first starring movie role, are authentic and genuine: strength and frailty. Sam Elliot is eloquently powerful as Jack's older Manager brother Bobby, who loves his self-destructive baby brother. <br/><br/>Not only did Bradley direct ""A Star Is Born"", he wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth and Will Fetters. He learned to sing for a year and a half. He wrote songs for the movie with Lady Gaga. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Lady Gaga said that she was blown away by Bradley: ""He sings from his gut."" <br/><br/>As country rock star Jackson Maine, he is so convincing singing, ""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."" He pops painkillers going on stage. He downs a bottle of Jack Daniels in the limo ride from his concert. Bradley embodies Jack's weary numbing suffering. <br/><br/>Looking to get a drink, Jack drops in a dive drag bar in Los Angeles. His eyes widen listening to Lady Gaga's Ally singing a French song classic. Ally is special. <br/><br/>Over drinks Jack discovers Ally, who works as a restaurant server, is a songwriter. He asks her why she doesn't sing her songs. Ally says that people like her songs, but not the way she looks. <br/><br/>Lady Gaga is ""unplugged"" in natural brown hair, sans glam makeup. Gaga inhabits Ally's insecurities like a glove. Yet like Jack, we see her greater within. Jack tells her, ""If there's one reason we're supposed to be here is to say something so people wanna hear it..."" That's the beauty of ""A Star Is Born"": It says something we want to hear. <br/><br/>Predictably, yet naturally Jack and Ally fall in love in their star-crossed romance. Ally's star ascends when she sings her song ""Shallows"" with Jack in concert. Sadly, Jack's star tragically descends in drug and alcohol addiction. Ally and Jack are truly in love: They see the greater within each other. However, love alone may not save Jack from his addictions. <br/><br/>Bradley and Gaga are fearless compassion in the kind of poignant sadness that can heal. Director Cooper trusts his actor's humanity in stark authentic conversation. Ally cries to Jack, ""You hurt me!"" Jack breaks down to Ally, ""I'm so sorry..."" When Jack confesses to Bobby about ""stealing his voice"" I cried. <br/><br/>Lady Gaga is the star. She is so fierce in Ally's vulnerability. Her singing amazes. And you never catch her ""acting""; she is just being. She and Bradley don't romanticize the suffering of loving a drug addict; loving someone suffering from depression. You can only do your best. Responsibility is often a two-way street. That's the eloquent message of ""A Star Is Born"". <br/><br/>Listening to Gaga's closing song moved me. Being in love is perhaps most important in life. Yet, we can't know what goes on inside another, even ones we love. ""A Star Is Born"" reminds us that we must also have forgiveness in our hearts. I truly loved ""A Star Is Born""."

Bradley hands to the character an incredible Jackson Maine. The soundtrack packs the tragic romance in a way that takes us straight into that story. Already in the first minutes of the movie, we're immersed and in love with the couple. Sharp photography is another highlight of the feature film. The theme song is worthy of receiving an Oscar for best original song. Academy voters will be amazed at Lady Gaga's talent as an actress.

","""Maybe it's time to let the old ways die."" Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper)<br/><br/>After three previous versions at A Star is Born, director/co-writer/star Bradley Cooper has added a version worthy of the best of them. Cooper's Jack is a charismatic rocker whose flaw is substance abuse, and Lady Gaga's singer/songwriter, Ally, is an ingenuous talent who remains innocent through all the shenanigans required to be a star, not born but made. <br/><br/>Her opening number strutting on a bar singing La Vie en Rose clarifies why Jack fell for her immediately and why she is headed to glory. As the opening lyric might suggest, they are change agents for each other, not always in easy transitions.<br/><br/>Although the two first movies were about Hollywood, and the dangers of stardom we all knew even in 1937 and 1954, then Streisand's (1976) and Cooper's are all music, with Cooper's superior take a lived-in rock atmosphere. In that way, Cooper's is even better than Almost Famous. <br/><br/>Streisand and Kristoferson seem to exist for Streisand where Cooper's couple is deeply in love but not strong enough to save Jack.
Although I tire of Jack's incessant drinking, a tedium to watch after a few minutes, I accept it as the tragic element of a cliched story about the glory and the hell of the biz. Both Cooper and Gaga sing with such depth of feeling it is hard not to shed a tear at the sad outcome.<br/><br/>The film is also strong about the challenges of that road to stardom, uncompromising as it displays the forces changing Ally from a wholesome natural singer to a manufactured pop singer and marginalize Jack for being a substance abuser and too old. The resonance today with the #MeToo emphasis on male domination is only too obvious. However, Cooper transforms Maine into a loving, not jealous lover. <br/><br/>The times they are a'changin'."
"AlsExGal","5","15","31","18 November 2018"," An OK rendition of a tired story...
","... it is so tired it dates back to 1932. The first rendition was ""What Price Hollywood"" starring Constance Bennett as a woman who is looking for fame in the movies and Lowell Sherman as a director with a drinking and punctuality problem who discovers her while he still has some clout. In this version the starlet's husband is a sound citizen. The second version is from 1937 and stars Janet Gaynor in one of her last roles before her retirement as the country gal who comes to Hollywood seeking stardom. In this version it is the starlet's future husband (Fredric March) who discovers her and whose career goes downhill due to alcohol. In 1954 Judy Garland plays the actress on an uphill trajectory with James Mason as the matinee idol husband who is on a downhill slide. What is different here? Due to the actress playing the lead role, the star is made to be a great singer too so full advantage can be taken of Garland's voice. Why make a 1976 version? In this case both the woman on the rise/husband on the decline are singers exclusively. The movies have exited stage left. Also, this is the first post production code era version of the film, so you have sleeping around before marriage, graphic infidelity, drug addiction, and a close up view of the suicide scene.<br/><br/>So now we have FOUR versions of this film. Why make a fifth? Because Hollywood is out of nerve. They want to go for the safe bet and safe buck. The plot for this fifth version is pretty close to the fourth. The differences I could see? The husband does not accidentally hit the wife during the award ceremony - if it's not PC it's not going to be in an American film. And finding the future singing sensation in a drag bar - not even in the post production code era would that have gone over in 1976. That's pretty much it. Oh, and therapists get involved in this one. Got to have therapists in these situations now, they are the priests of 21st century America. Other than that, no difference. Everybody carries themselves believably, nobody makes a fool of themself, but other than that - meh. Oh, one more thing. There is zero chemistry between the two leads - zilch, zip, nada. There was chemistry between each of the leads of all of the ones that came before it except for the 1932 film, and that was because the starlet's husband may have been a sober guy, but he was a bit of a caveman in how he treated his wife.<br/><br/>My final verdict - for what they charge for going to the movies these days I would expect more. You want music in your film? Go see Bohemian Rhapsody. That tells a story worth telling mainly because it is a biography so the script was pretty much already written. Just my two cents."
"brecht-vereecke","7","15","31","8 October 2018"," Okay, not great
","I think the movie was beautifully shot, certainly a good first from Bradley Cooper. Also very well acted, from both Cooper as Lady Gaga (although I didn't really like her character). Songs were very good as well.
The script however was a mess. Formulaic and cringy at times. You know exactly what is going to happen. I hear people are praising the first act, but the whole meeting and falling in love of these 2 people felt very forced to me. 
Like I said, I didn't like Ally's character at all. 'Oh no I don't want to perform my own songs, because people think my nose is ugly' yes you do, you perform at a bar every night. And punching the cop who asks (maybe a bit impolitely) for a picture. And the way she treats her boss. For some reason she can't have it that her boss tells her it's not okay to be late. This she takes as an excuse to quit her job and do what she wanted to do in the first place.
Jack's character was great, but there was maybe a bit too little time to really delve into it properly.
Sometimes I was very impressed by what Cooper did as a first time director such as the suicide scene, which was very subtle, but then the film ends with a tear rolling on Lady Gaga's cheek, and I'm like 'really?'.
Also: The film criticizes the music industry for turning talented singers into Lady Gaga clones.
Also: When Jack talks it's like Kris Kristofferson, but when he starts singing it sounds exactly like Bradley Cooper singing a song. It does make for a very funny moment when Sam Elliot's character cries out to Jack 'You stole my voice!'."

"SnoopyStyle","7","7","12","27 November 2018"," solid remake
","Famous singing star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is tired, alcoholic, and slowly losing his hearing. His older brother and manager Bobby Maine (Sam Elliott) is trying to keep him together. After a concert, he stops at a random bar to drink. It's a drag bar and he is taken with performer Ally (Lady Gaga). She's an amateur singer who is afraid to sing her own material. He pulls her out of anonymity onto center stage.<br/><br/>At first, I was slightly annoyed with Bradley's mumbling. I figured it's his poor attempt at drunk acting. It's not until it's revealed that Sam Elliott is playing his older brother that I realized that Bradley is imitating Sam. On the other hand, Lady Gaga is perfectly cast right from the start. She has the vulnerability and quite frankly, her average looks fit the character. The biggest scene is her first time on stage. The tension remains mostly flat for the rest of the movie. Bardley's directing is functional. There is a straight forward style to the proceeding or it may be the familiarity of this often told tale. Other than a few moments, this movie doesn't shock or surprise but it is very solid."
"wekirch","5","7","12","24 October 2018"," Great Music, but not enough to rescue the movie from mediocrity
","This is the third remake. I've seen the other two, and they are much better than this one. Lady Gaga (Ally) is a great performer, her rendition of La vie en rose is worth the price of admission. There were other great moments and scenes (I liked the ""I just wanted another look at you"" moments), but overall the movie doesn't hang together. Should it show character through the work of being in show business (and it is work, hard work, with its constant demand to be up for the audience, to present to them the fantasy they've paid for and insist on seeing). Or should it show the work through the character's viewpoint (and so let us see what kind of character needs to be in the business of displaying a persona in order to feel validated as a person).
Jack (Bradley Cooper) kills himself so that Ally will be free of the effects of his drink and downers. A tragedy? A noble sacrifice? Or a typically sentimental Hollywood gesture? Ally may have some self-esteem issues, but underneath it all she's a steely-souled striver for fame. Jack thrives on stage, but has deep doubts about the value of his music. We get glimpses of what's underneath the surface, but it's not enough.
Cooper (who co-wrote the script) tries his best to show us the pain, he's given to long silent closeups of Jack's face as he tries to understand himself. But he shies away from the dark side. We get glimpses of what drives these people: Is show business the only way they have of facing the central questions of existence? In the end, Ally and Jack end up as cardboard cutouts, pop-psychology figures instead of fully rounded characters. A pity, since the story is about character. Show business is merely the means of displaying the flawed glory of being human.
I found the movie boring in places, pretentiously portentous in others, with a handful of great moments. The music ranges from pretty good to awesome. The acting is generally good, and Lady Gaga is excellent. Sam Elliot is as always a treat to watch. The script overuses the F-bomb, it's become a mere schtick. The photography is very good, never calling attention to itself, generating ambience and character, and carrying the story smoothly from one scene to the next.
Go see the movie, if only to get some idea of what makes a movie popular despite itself."

By inviting her on stage with him, her star starts ascending while his decline continues. They fall in love, but there are four individuals in the relationship, the other two being alcohol and her manager.<br/><br/>I have seen none of the previous films with this title, but the rags-to-riches vs riches-to-rags story is hardly new territory. So how does it stand up on this particular occasion?<br/><br/>Pretty well. Bradley Cooper does well on his first outing as director: some scenes are perhaps dragged out a little longer than they need to be, but both Cooper and Lady Gaga act well. I wouldn't go so fas as to say she's a revelation, but she is pretty solid and has some moving moments.<br/><br/>The music is well recorded and presented, with superb sound design. I can't say I cared for every song, but one or two are standouts. And both Cooper and Gaga sing well. Incidentally, Stefanie, couldn't you start using your real name now?<br/><br/>For me, though, the best moment was a 5-second shot of Sam Elliott's face as he reversed a truck out of Jackson's driveway.

"ferguson-6","8","24","55","3 October 2018"," the circle of stardom
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is the 4th iteration I've seen of A STAR IS BORN. First there was writer/director William Wellman's original version in 1937 which won the Oscar for Best Original Story, had 6 other Oscar nominations (including Best Picture), and starred Janet Gaynor and Frederic March (he playing a veteran actor and she a starlet). Next came the 1954 remake with James Mason and the fabulous Judy Garland (he playing a veteran actor, she an upcoming singer/actress). Both were nominated for Oscars, and the film was directed by George Cukor (10 years later would win an Oscar for MY FAIR LADY). 1976 brought the second remake (third version), this one starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. It won a Best Song Oscar for Paul Williams, and was directed by Frank Pierson, known best for writing the oft quoted line ""What we've got here, is a failure to communicate"" from COOL HAND LUKE (he also won a Best Screenplay Oscar for DOG DAY AFTERNOON). So perhaps it's understandable that 81 years after the original, Bradley Cooper chooses this familiar story for a generational update and his directorial debut.<br/><br/>When it's announced that a new version of this story is being made, the obvious first question anyone asks is 'Who did they cast?"" Many were surprised when it was learned that Bradley Cooper had cast himself, and that Lady Gaga would take on the female lead. Sure, we all know Bradley Cooper as an Oscar nominated actor from SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012), AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013), and AMERICAN SNIPER (2014) ... but can he SING? And yes, many had seen Lady Gaga in TV's ""American Horror Story"", but could she possibly carry a major film - sans heavy make-up and gimmicky stage gadgetry?<br/><br/>The audience reactions are in. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga blow away the 1976 version, and where they rank versus the other two versions, comes down to personal preference. Mr. Cooper delivers an odd, yet effective, performance as the boozy, aimless rocker Jackson Maine. Not only does he mimic Sam Elliott's speaking voice and cadence, his performance seems purposefully close to that of Kristofferson from 42 years ago. The great Sam Elliott does play Cooper's (much) older brother, so the oratory choice makes some sense ... it's just a bit off-putting at first. Cooper is believable as the rocker thanks to his stage presence and charm. We never doubt Jackson Maine is a rock star.<br/><br/>The most stunning and pleasant surprise here is Lady Gaga as Ally. For anyone who still thinks of her in terms of raw meat fashion at industry events, prepare yourself for astonishment. Her beautiful and powerful voice is on full display throughout the film. In fact, her songs and singing are the highlights of what is a terrific film that should have wide appeal. The first song she sings, ""La Vie en Rose"" (made famous by Edit Piaf) is quite simply jaw-dropping in its beauty.
Ally is a pretty grounded woman from humble means. She works as a waitress and sings whenever she can ... having been held back from pursuing her dreams by a well-meaning father (Andrew Dice Clay) who says she doesn't have the looks to be a star. Ally has a Carole King ""Tapestry"" poster on her bedroom wall, and we soon learn she could probably sing most any song from that classic album and make it her own. When Jackson and Ally meet, a complex romance and professional partnership forms. We know those rarely end well. As Jackson shuns his protective brother, battles an ever-worsening hearing issue and a self-destructive drinking problem, Ally tries to remain loyal to the man she loves ... even as her own career explodes down a path Jackson barely recognizes.<br/><br/>In addition to the aforementioned Dice Clay (surprisingly subtle here), there is a musical duet with Marlon Williams (in the Roy Orbison tribute) and Presley Cash, and surprising supporting characters played by Dave Chappelle and Eddie Griffin. Probably not as surprising, Jon Peters is listed as a Producer on the film. If you are unfamiliar with Mr. Peters, he was once a hairstylist to celebrities and in the early 1970's fell in love with Barbra Streisand. His first credit as Producer was for her film ... you got it ... A STAR IS BORN (1976).<br/><br/>Mr. Cooper does a nice job tackling such a large scale and familiar project for his first directing gig, and we are certainly appreciative of his avoiding inclusion of Streisand's ""Evergreen"", and instead showcasing the talents of Lady Gaga. It's likely Lady Gaga will receive a bit more credit for her acting than is probably deserved (an Oscar nom is possible), but her impact on the movie cannot be understated. Bradley Cooper's next project as actor/director has been announced as BERNSTEIN, where he will play the great composer Leonard Bernstein. Kudos to Cooper for dreaming big!"

Some are great, and some aren't. Not all people can act in front of the camera just because they had courses attended, you know? It's sort of talent to make it looks natural.<br/><br/>The story itself is good in some way, but it's still boring. For most of the films, except Blade Runner 2049, I could finish them in one sit. And whenever I have something to do in the middle of the film, I don't want to stop watching because the film got control over me. Even if I must do that something and stop watching, I always continue to watch. That is the only thing I want to do the most. So, no matter how busy I am, I always remember to continue watching. But this movie? Well, it didn't get my attention that much. When I was watching this film, of course I had to stop watching for a while and had to do something in the middle of the film. By the time I finish doing my work, I didn't even remember to continue watching this film. After some time passed, I recalled that I haven't finished the film yet. So, I continued. On three times, I could finish the film. I even said, finally!<br/><br/>I like Lady Gaga for her songs and I'm a fan. But as an actress, I'm so sorry to say that I'm not. Her acting is terrible. (In fact, almost all actresses are bad at acting in this film.) I totally dislike her acting.<br/><br/>The presentation of the film is normal. It needs something. Some scenes are touchable and some are terribly boring that I want to stop watching the film.<br/><br/>The story needs to improve more. And I don't like the ending. It should continue, so, this is the one which doesn't end with proper ending. It should have continued. Therefore, it's sort of annoying.<br/><br/>One more thing I'd like to say is that so much use of F word. I get that we're all adults and most get used to it. But exclusively use of that word is kind of making me feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is quite simple. Because of the director's presentation, it's sort of boring.

It's a tragic love story of a rock & roll musician (I think anyway, maybe country) whose sudden love affair with a young, talented unknown singer spirals out of control with booze, coke, pills fueled by the memories of a hard childhood with an achoholic father on a pecan farm in Arizona (the pecan farm stchick is about the only originally part in the movie & provided a laugh). If you want to see a much more iconic movie about this subject matter that was actually based in reality, try ""Walk the Line"".

","I was initially going to avoid watching this film since the trailer didn't appeal to me, but given all the buzz I decided to give it a chance. This movie is definitely the most over hyped and overrated film to come out this year (that I can think of). <br/><br/>Most of the songs were slickly produced, but really simple lyrically. While there are some good character moments that feel genuine, everything pertaining to the story felt hollow. The direction was over all competent, but a fair share of it struck me as amateurish. There's an overabundance of lens flare and a lot of unnecessary camera movement, for instance. <br/><br/>The overwhelming fantasy of the story gradually annoyed me more and more as it went on, I guess mostly because of how serious it's presenting itself, building to a climax that doesn't feel entirely earned, and somewhat inconsistent. I feel like the only way you can buy into everything that happens is because we expect the things that happen to happen, if that makes sense. Like, for example, we only buy they're falling in love with each other because that's what two characters in love stories do, despite the blatant contrivances. On top of everything, the dialogue is laughably bad in a few spots. I've seen other people point out the pacing is off, and in retrospect I'd agree, but it didn't stick out to me when I watched it. It just all felt long.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is on point, except for the manager. Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Elliot in particular were highlights. Lady Gaga was fine playing herself with some subtle hints of subtlety, and Bradley Cooper did the best he could. Gaga has more to work with and does more with her role, but Cooper's is very one note, and is getting by on charisma alone. I will say that when it goes for being embarrassing and uncomfortable it mostly hits its mark.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie was prestige Oscar bait that felt twice as long as it was. I have not seen the other versions to compare it to, so maybe that colors my perception. If you're a Gaga superfan, you'll get a lot more out of it than I did."
"ozjosh03","4","13","27","24 October 2018"," It's a man's, man's world, eh Bradley?
","Bradley Cooper's take on this classic fable should really have been re-titled A Star Is Dying because his film is far more focussed on the collapsing career of Jackson Maine than on the rising star of Ally... err, what's her name again? ... oh, that's right, we never learn her second name. Cooper's film reverses the focus and the dynamic of all previous versions to make this primarily a story of addiction, self-destruction and family tragedy, only slightly leavened by the lead character's new romance (albeit doomed) and his girlfriend's new stardom. Thus Cooper gives his character far more screen time than was ever granted to Frederic March, James Mason or Kris Kristofferson. Now, let's be fair: Cooper may be right; perhaps the fall from grace of a big music star is inherently more dramatic than the rise of a self-doubting singer-songwriter. Perhaps he is also a better actor than Lady Gaga will ever be, and therefore more capable of carrying a movie. Perhaps it's also just a good way of wringing a new twist on a much-told, somewhat cliched story. But even if all this is true, I still wonder why Bradley Cooper making the film all about him has attracted only good reviews and Oscar buzz. Nobody has attacked him for rampant egomania. Nobody seems to be questioning the amount of screen time he gets, or the number of juicy (""hello, Oscar voters!"") close-ups. Or suggesting that even when drunk and dishevelled he is still styled, lit and shot to look better than poor Gaga, who is scrubbed of all make-up for most of the movie and often dressed in the kind of gowns bitchy brides bestow on their bridesmaids. In short, Cooper has done everything and more that Barbra Streisand was accused of with her 1976 version of A Star Is Born - yet, I would suggest, rather more egregiously, and certainly to the much greater detriment of his co-star. Even when Jackson Maine is dead and gone and Ally finally (or so you might think) has the spotlight to herself, Cooper can't resist superimposing flashback shots of Jackson in happier times over her performance. He even chooses to cut off her final notes for a silent shot of her teary face. So where the finale of Streisand's film takes grief and turns it into art, Coopers' takes art and reduces it to grief - again, making it about his character's death, not about survival and transcending tragedy through music.<br/><br/>Cooper's egomania aside, I still found his movie less impressive than the glowing reviews led me to expect. Yes, it's well enough directed, Cooper's performance is excellent (probably Oscar-worthy), and Gaga acquits herself well. But it's no masterpiece and I seriously doubt that Gaga's performance will stand alongside Garland's or Streisand's in either film history or moviegoers' affections. She's great in the few musical moments where she is allowed to shine, but none of her musical sequences have the dramatic impact of Woman in the Moon or the With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now finale from Streisand's movie. Nor do they come anywhere near the sublime musical heights of The Man That Got Away or the Born In A Trunk sequence from Garland's movie. I'm also inclined to think Gaga is sabotaged twice over in the film - first by the drab, make-up free, girl-next-door look she's given in the first half, then, rather more seriously, by the utterly hideous star makeover that lumbers her with an unflattering red wig that could have come from the drag bar featured early in the film. Without the make-up she's vaguely pretty if you're being generous. Post-makeover she looks like a cos-play fan at Comic Con. Even worse is the musical makeover Ally gets. Say what you like about how Streisand never meshed with the rock setting of her film, at least her musical numbers showcased her unique talent and she was thrillingly herself. Gaga, on the other hand, is required to morph into some gyrating Beyonce/J-Lo hybrid that does nothing to highlight her real and genuine talent.<br/><br/>And here's where I have another serious issue with Cooper's film. In all previous incarnations the heroine fights against attempts to package her as something she's not. She becomes more herself through the rise to stardom. Esther Blodgett becomes Vicki Lester, but she baulks at any extreme makeover. Esther Hoffman defiantly keeps both her name and her style. Ally, in Coopers' version, submits to both a musical and personal makeover without any real protest - and with seemingly no awareness that the physical makeover makes her look ridiculous. In the final scene she's ditched the red hair, but that's the only sign she might be standing up for herself. Ally is also more submissive generally. Jackson is already pretty far gone when they meet, so she knows he's doomed. But she goes there anyway, which makes her something of a masochist and rather more of a victim. And when she's not trying to keep Jackson in line, Ally is running around cleaning up after her widowed father. There's no mention of Ally's mother, only a passing mention of Jackson's mother, but a great deal of talk about his father, and much screen time devoted to the tortured relationship with his older brother. All in all, it's a very male film, more concerned with male characters and male relationships. Ally gets a male best friend too. And the only ""women"" in her life are drag queens. This movie sure doesn't pass the Bechdel test. Indeed, it offers up a classic case of female erasure. So where Streisand's film is consciously feminist, with points to make about women's place in the world and in relationships, and a determination NOT to depict Esther as a victim, Cooper downplays Ally's strength and independence in favour of a narrative about men and their problems. In fact, if it weren't for the 70s fashions you could quite easily believe that Coopers movie was made in the 70s and Streisand's was made today. To that extent Streisand's movie has a sense of social purpose that Coopers' entirely lacks.<br/><br/>In short, I'd suggest Streisand's A Star Is Born deserves to be very favourably re-assessed in the wake of Cooper's film. Yes, the Streisand film was a vanity project. But hardly more so than Cooper's. Yes, her film was flawed and compromised, and copped a lot of flak. Cooper's film is, in my view, rather more seriously flawed, yet has attracted mostly unstinting praise. It sure pays to be a man in Hollywood."

","This remake of a remake - made many times before, has nothing to offer the viewer except possibly a peek into today's cultural obsession into victim hood, and yes, the ridiculous idea of toxic masculinity. First of all the chemistry between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper is like ether, it is there, barely, as it unfolds from scene to scene and then it is gone, evaporated into the unknown. It is almost painful to watch, actually it is painful, and the fact that Cooper delivers his lines with his head down most of the time and that Lady Gaga needs another few semesters of acting classes makes for a very looooong two plus hours of cinematic purgatory. Aside from the obstacles of not having any memorable scenes and a wooden performance from Gaga there is this nagging concession that what one is watching is some writer's excruciating attempt to rewrite a simple love story so that it incorporates all the political and cultural angst that we must all be burdened with in the early 21st century. Imagine that , the lead female role falling in love with a man after declaring how much she hates men in an early scene, and throughout the movie incessantly goes on a ball-busting campaign until he buckles under the abuse and fights back with some very hurtful words. Folks, at this point this gets very difficult to watch. Especially since the tale is such a simple tragedy, it just topples under its own weight ufortunately. Finally, the music was mediocre at best. Now I'm not saying the soundtrack from the last remake was earth shattering but with so much hype, and focus on production you would think the producers would have spent the cash to hire top notch hit writers. Not here. All in all a dud."

"Sanctimonious_Bakuto","8","5","8","8 November 2018"," A great directorial debut for Bradley Cooper
","Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job as a first time director - the scenes are beautifully shot and the way the atmosphere is built around them, largely through sound, is very strong. Lady Gaga similarly shines in her first role as lead actor. She, of course, showcases her fantastic singing voice but also portrays her relationship with Bradley Cooper's character incredibly well.<br/><br/>The music in the film is great throughout and, while this may come as no shock given that Lady Gaga is a seasoned musical professional, it is a pleasant surprise to see that Bradley Cooper, who reportedly took 18 months of vocal training prior to this role, really committed to the role and sang his songs himself. It must be said that he doesn't sound half bad either!<br/><br/>The film itself explores a lot of the big issues that those in stardom, especially the music industry, often suffer from. It's sad to see that these problems have persisted through the ages as one can easily draw comparisons with modern day artists. The original film was made just over 80 years ago yet the issues presented in this remake have stayed prevalent throughout the decades.

"adrian-43767","6","5","8","25 October 2018"," Apparently serious, actually glib approach to serious subject. Lady Gaga steals show
","Bradley Cooper took on the tough task of directing, singing and acting in, the latest version of A STAR IS BORN. To be honest, I have never found this story particularly interesting, and in fact I suspect that the 1954 version with James Mason and Judy Garland borrowed quite a bit from Charlie Chaplin's LIMELIGHT (US 1952), and the 1976 version, with Streisand and Kristoferson was a mishmash that relied solely on starpower and deservedly bombed with critics and box office alike.<br/><br/>And now, this third version which I do not find any better than its predecessors. Lady Gaga singlehandedly keeps the film interesting. Her unusual beauty and wonderful voice kept me wanting to see her, eagerly waiting for her to come back on screen.<br/><br/>Sadly, the character who plays her father comes across as very uneven, unintentionally funny, and it is hard to decide whether he is just greedy, or a liar, or both... and at one point he seems willing to beat the stools out of Maine but, before you know it, he is conveniently doing something else.
Bradley Cooper took on too much: he should have directed only. Although be begins well enough. he is far too long on screen, giving the impression that he cannot have enough of himself.<br/><br/>Ally's manager is also played by a completely unremarkable actor.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Jackson Maine, the character he depicts, is a drug addict and an alcoholic who feels continually and annoyingly sorry for himself. In the end, his decision to cop out of life makes him a real loser.<br/><br/>I do not know if Cooper sings his songs in the movie. If so, perhaps he should have sung only, because his voice is quite pleasant.<br/><br/>Photography is generally very good, the second saving grace after Lady Gaga, and dialogue is rather patchy.<br/><br/>Even after he has died in script, Cooper does not go away. At the slightest opportunity, everybody remembers and cries over him. It must have been tough for Cooper to get rid of himself - which is a pity because this film could have done with about 20 minutes less (overall) and 30 minutes removed from Cooper's performance would have hurt none at all."
"ironhorse_iv","9","5","8","17 October 2018"," This musical film hits nearly all the right notes with me. I love this movie!
","The classic rags to riches story of a struggling young artist falling in love with an older veteran performer battling addiction, has been told time after time, again by Hollywood, with great acclaim; as early as 1929's film, 'The Broadway Melody' to, as recently as 2011's 'The Artist'. However, none of them, had the sights & sounds as 'the Star is Born' movie series (original 1937 motion picture, 1954's musical version, 1976's rock musical and 2013's Bollywood flick). These films are some of the finest movies about show business ever made, with 2018's version, by far, being the best. It's probably, my favorite of all the five films. That's pretty hard to do, because there is many things to like, with the other versions, but debuting director, Bradley Cooper & his crew indeed pull it off! Written by himself with Eric Roth & Will Fetters; the movie expands on some elements that were lost in the previous adaptations, such as giving more of a solid flesh out backstory to the main leads, Jackson (Bradley Cooper) & Ally Maine (Lady Gaga) than we got in previous adaptations. In this film, we get a lot of context on how real life struggle with substance abuse honestly starts. I just wish, the movie shown more of Jackson's fame, disappearing like the other movies. I just didn't get the sense that he's not in the limelight, anymore. After all, he still capable of selling out concert arenas and giving incredible performances. Plus, the musician got to perform at the Grammys, which is more than the previous characters ever got. There wasn't a lot of moments, showing Jackson having trouble, getting gigs as I would like. Despite that, Cooper still gave a good portrayal. He spent a lot of time, preparing for the musical aspects of the role, by getting himself a music coach and spent five days a week for six months, how to sing & play not just as himself, but also in character. He also spent months working on his speaking voice using a dialect coach to help him develop the rich tambour he wanted. Lowering his range to the point that it match the register of actor Sam Elliott who plays his on-screen brother, Bobby. That's a lot of work. You kinda knew that, this role was really importation to him, because in real life, the actor has also struggles with alcohol abuse. As for the female lead. BeyoncÃ© was considered for the role of Ally, but thank goodness, she wasn't pick. That singer can't leave the celebrity glamour side of her life, for any film. Instead, Lady Gaga AKA Stefani Germanotta was chosen, because her wiliness to strip the over the top gimmicky persona, she has, to allow the audience to feel more of real, grounded, and vulnerable performance. She really wanted to expose the real world insight of why modern day musicians acts the way, she does. There is a lot of similarities between, Ally and Germanotta, the performer. Both had to change their normal day image into something more over the top and flamboyant to gain the audience's attention. Its sucks that modern society has turn beautiful music into a shallow, vapid version of their former self. In a way, this movie was very powerful social commentary about the negative of modern pop music. Regardless of her celebrity persona, Germanotta has already established herself, as a wonderful powerful singer. Still, a lot of people still had doubts about her acting ability, even after her award winning break out role in FX's television show, 'American Horror Story'. In truth, I think, she really does pull this role off. Gaga can truly acted with Cooper, during the darker moments in the film. Both were outstanding. Not only that, but both performers had really amazing, on screen chemistry with each other. It really did seem like their characters, were in love with each other. Plus, both of them, have really beautiful voices. Who knew, that Cooper could hold his own with Gaga, during the singing sequences. Songs like 'Shallow' & 'Maybe It's Time', were very catchy. The style of music really does evokes the highs and lows of Jackson and Ally's relationship, and the song lyrics reveals the difficulty of staying true to your artistic voice in an era when everything, even their personal lives is market to the public eye. I can see, a lot of people buying the OST for the soaring, dramatic ballads; especially with ""I'll Never Love Again"", where Germanotta gave a genuine heart wrenching performance for her best friend, who passed away, the same day, as the recording. In truth, every performer in this movie was equally as wonderful, even the supporting cast. Mad props goes to Elliot for his powerful portrayal. I can see him, being nominated, come award season. As for the visuals. The cinematography, especially, when the main characters driving in Arizona, were beautifully shot. Even the way, the large stage was frame to make it, look smaller, and personal with middle shots and close ups, was a very nice tough. It made, nearly every musical performance in the film, seem special, with the vocalists singing their heart out. It was very emotional. However, the movie does have some flaws. The movie has this deafening ringing sound throughout the film. I get that it was done to sympathize more with Jackson whom suffering from tinnitus. However, the way, the sound design is done, it will make you, want to cover your ears. It was a bit annoying. Despite that, I do like the foreshadowing to the hearing loss and the tragic climax. I just wish, the film show, the antagonist getting his comeuppance. It was a little too depressing of an ending. As for the pacing. It does seem rush a bit at times; especially, during establish Ally's career. Regardless of that, overall; the movie was an entertaining sensational watch. It's worth going gaga over. Highly recommended seeing."

Then, when you reach the end of the movie, you feel nothing for this characters. They feel empty, distant, like they aren't real people but characters from a theatrical play. The dialogue and the choices the characters made also felt really forced and uninspired. And to add to that even the plot's weren't that original. They were just stuff you have watched before in 100 better movies. They were all over the place. It had no focus. And the reason for that, obviously, is that Bradley Cooper is an amateur in filmmaking. The camera work wasn't anything special, the atmosphere was non existent and the acting was forced and sometimes unbearable. Even the music, the thing this movie is most proud of, wasn't that great, it just felt like boring recycled stuff that gave me nothing new. It sacrificed any depth to please the masses and it lost any individuality along the way. It didn't feel personal in any way, it only felt like a product. And i didn't enjoy that at all.

Without giving away any spoilers, the following things made this movie a very poor example of filmmaking:<br/><br/>1. Absolutely zero chemistry between the leads. All the romantic scenes seemed fake and contrived. As an audience member you feel awkward watching it.
2. The acting was NOT natural and effortless. Everyone was plodding along mumbling vaguely like they were unsure of what's going on.
3. The relationships between the characters were not fleshed out and were developed poorly. I had trouble empathizing with the backstories as I was just not emotionally invested enough. It was very superficial.
4. Direction and editing were choppy and shaky. Too many uncomfortable closeups. Scenes abruptly ended and began. Very poor flow.<br/><br/>As a positive point, the music was decent but not immersive enough as I expected. Also, Lady Gaga looks gorgeous in every scene and outfit.<br/><br/>As Bradley Coopers directorial debut, it might be unfair to be this harsh. But unfortunately, all the above points are heartbreakingly true. The industry and fans have been kind to give this movie better reviews than it deserved.

Then she just floored me with her first ""big number"" in the movie.<br/><br/>I keep waiting for THAT moment, the moment that would show me WHY she was cast for this movie. Surely, there had to be a singer worthy of the role? yeah, she can sing, but it's nothing special. She's not Baba Streisand, not Garland, and DAMN sure not the likes of Whitney or Aquilera. I mean...are they kidding? WHY did they cast her? Just because she's not pretty? I mean, what about the chick from ""The Magicians,"" Jade Tailor, who has an 8-octave range? And blows it out when she does? That's just ONE actress that would have been better for this than Lady Gaga, whose singing just ain't that great.<br/><br/>Dunno...don't get the mad love.

","I had read and heard too much about the Bradley Cooper - Lady Gaga chemistry and I was already sick of it. So maybe I watched it with a little negativity to begin with but the film did nothing to redeem itself. The only way a cliched older-jaded-successful-man-young-naive-talented-girl tale can be interesting is to add some depth of emotion and dimension to their connection, a critical point that Hollywood always misses. A Star is Born missed it too. Bradley Cooper was rather too much in character as alcoholic-and-drug-addict Jack with his low raspy voice and facial water retention. His acting was off the mark probably because he was working so hard on his false voice all the time (gazing bemusedly at Ally all the time does not qualify for acting). And he certainly did not have chemistry with his leading lady. Lady Gaga did a reasonable job with her part. Neither character inspired in any way. The cliches of Jack romanticizing his alcoholic dad, fighting with doting brother, peeing & falling over on the grammy stage etc were truly cringe-worthy. As for Ally's devotion to this schmuck is derogatory to the self respect of women and doesn't fit into modern day values. On a positive note it exposed the pop music culture for what it is and it has some good music. I enjoyed most of the songs, I really loved Bradley Cooper's low false raspy voice and his singing was surprisingly good. Shallow is a lovely song. Unfortunately, this movie is just that, shallow."

"jadavix","6","3","4","15 December 2018"," Could have been so much better - too trite and clichéd
","What's surprising about this second remake of ""A Star Is Born"" is not just the strength of Lady Gaga's performance, but the weakness of Bradley Cooper's.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen any of the previous versions of this story, you'd be familiar with it: an aging, has-been star locates a young up and comer and gives her their start, ushering them on-stage as they exit stage left.<br/><br/>This version makes the has-been not only aging but also drug-and-alcohol addled, which feels like an attempt to side step anything interesting about the other side of fame.<br/><br/>You don't need to mess up on drugs and booze to stop being famous. That's what's so cruel about it. Fame is fickle. You can lose the interest of your audience through no real fault of your own. So why was it necessary to make Cooper into a druggie and alcoholic? Did the filmmakers not want to depict what show business really is?<br/><br/>Cooper's character is a boring stiff. The movie only comes alive with Gaga. He speaks in a weird low groan which is maybe supposed to sound southern. The movie never, ever convinces you that he is a great artist. Gaga is so dynamic that you wonder why she had to be discovered by a loser like Cooper. It would have been much more believable if the reason why he was an alcoholic and addict was because he knew his music sucked and that he didn't deserve the fame. The movie expects you to take it for granted that he is a big star, but doesn't give you any reason to believe it."

Despite the fact that A Star is Born has been retold several times in its iteration from 1937, 1954, and 1976, the excellent screenplay and direction clearly shows an effective and superb storytelling that can make an devastating and powerful impact while making itself as fresh as its own that serves as a contemporary modern musical classic for the modern generation.

","""A Star Is Born"" (2018 release; 135 min.) brings the story of Jackson ""Jack"" Maine and Ally. As the movie opens, Jack is hitting the stage at a massive outdoor show. After the show, he boozes up in the getaway SUV, and orders his driver to stop at a nearby bar. It happens to be the place where Ally, after her daytime kitchen job, performs regularly. That evening, she brings ""La Vie En Rose"", stunning Jack with her singing. He meets Ally after the show, and they hit it off... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the 4th incarnation of ""A Star Is Born"". The previous version starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, from 1976, is the version I grew up with. While that movie's flaws were obvious, I nevertheless quite liked it. Now 42 years later comes this up-to-date remake. This marks the directing debut of actor Bradley Cooper, and what a debut it turns out to be! Cooper also co-produced, co-stars and co-wrote the script. Cooper's challenges/risks were formidable: would he be a credible ""rock star""? More importantly, would he be a credible singer? Answer to both of those questions is a resounding YES. Even more surprising is Lady Gaga as Ally. Who knew she'd be able to give such a nuanced acting performance (obviously we already knew that she has the singing talent). The on-screen chemistry between these two leads is palpable, making the movie such much more believable. But wait! there is more! For me arguable the movie's best performance comes from Sam Elliot, as Jack's road manager (and elder brother). What a stage presence! The musical performances are generally speaking outstanding. Cooper's backup band features Lucas Nelson (son of Willie), who co-wrote most of the songs, and the Promise of the Real. It's fun recognizing some of the venues and festivals where the concert footage was filmed (I spotted both Coachella and Glastonbury, among others). The only criticism I have is that the movie, which is pretty much flawless in the first hour, is a bit overly long, in particular towards the end. But all in all, kudos to Cooper for taking on what could've been a disaster, but instead ends up being a remake of a timeless classic that is just right for this day and age.<br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" premiered at the Venice film festival in late August, to immediate and universal acclaim. The movie opened wide this past weekend. The Monday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was PACKED. Yes, on a Monday! I am going on record already that ""A Star Is Born"" not only will get multiple Oscar nominations early next year, it will in fact win the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, among others. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","After watching A Star is Born, I was disappointed from the hype of the movie. I love Bradley Cooper, he is phenomenal actor, and Lady Gaga is a very talented and innovative performer. However the movie just lacked the chemistry and character building it needed. The movie is a multiple remake, so the nuts and bolts of the movie was already established. I liked the idea of making the movie contemporary and giving it a current context. The soundtrack was great. But I think the story was undercooked. I think the movie suffers from The Bodyguard syndrome where the soundtrack and other peripheral aspects were there, but there was a bit of an emptiness with characters and story. The movie was shot with high energy, but it's just window dressing for a bland movie. Once passed the soundtrack and cinematography, it was tedious to watch. I had higher hope for the movie."

I haven't seen any other reviews touch upon his tinnitus, a plot line which I was trying desperately to follow, despite mumbling dialogue between the brothers about it. Yes, the alcoholism and pills were a problem, but the tinnitus was a big part of that problem, and a separate issue, especially for a musician.
I was disturbed by the suicide and the way he did it. I can't recall how Kristofferson died, in the '76 version, but it either wasn't so stark or my young self was more accepting of melodrama.
I thought Gaga's performance was blah, nothing like the rave reviews.

","It's a watchable movie, but not oscar material. There is an extreme hype for this movie which is unfounded. Gaga did an ok job acting (not oscar material), a great job singing (as expected, perhaps best song) and Bradley Cooper did a very good job acting (I'm ok with a nomination, but not winning). The move has no pace, it seems like a bunch of different takes stitched together without rhythm, and the fact it got nominated for best picture is disappointing.<br/><br/>From a screenplay / editing perspective Gaga's rise to fame was too fast - you blink and she goes from accompanying Jack in his concerts to 3 grammys nominations. Perhaps if Cooper had been more generous with how much screen time he gave Gaga's character vs his own, this could have been addressed. In addition, I didn't connected with Jack's reasons for addiction. If Cooper had inserted a few flashbacks from Jackson and his dads relationship that would help us emphasize with the character better.<br/><br/>I think Cooper's ego prevented this movie from being significantly better; He should have brought in someone else to direct or co-direct and focused on making a good movie for his viewers rather than to create a platform for his 1st best actor win.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, especially for the songs and to see Gaga's debut in the big screen, but I would have enjoyed it probably better if it wasn't for the super hype that have been generated around it."

The story isn't surprisingly new, what is no wonder for a re-re-re-make. Bradley Cooper is perfomaning well, as always, but his role stays very one-dimensional. Him directing as well surprised me though. The movie has no dynamic, as a viewer you don't no where it's heading, and the only music is on-stage which is slowing everything down even more.

Never being a real fan of Lady GaGa, but appreciating her voice, and my wife adoring Bradley Cooper, I knew this was the correct choice as soon as Cooper started singing. Lady GaGa's singing as to be expected was exquisite, but her acting was totally unexpected, it is deserved of an Oscar nod. The acting between the two was so natural. Bradley Cooper's singing was unreal. I forget the previous renditions of this movie, and that's OK. I have read everything there is to read on IMDB and any other source in order to soak up the artistry of this movie. I will see it again, this time at a theatre with an enhanced sound system, get the soundtrack and of course the DVD when it comes out. I usually don't rate movies 10.

But wow when I came out of the cinema I was way too mind blown of how perfectly this was filmed and conveyed the message.<br/><br/>Quite a number of symbolism used in the film showed real good directing skills too (for example, how Cooper tells the driver to turn right into the bar a billboard showing the hanging knot passes over his head but after that he meets the girl at the bar and his life quickly turns around. But after realising that he is stopping her from having her dream he goes back to the initially symbolised method of suicide.)<br/><br/>I didn't even know Cooper was the director for this but oh my, he did a fantastic job directing and acting out the character that he was portraying. A pathetic mess of a human being meeting the love of his life to turn his life around but slowly sees himself decaying while his partner gets all the spotlights and when he is finally in a rehab to be healthy, just to be with his wife again, he is told and realised that he's the one stopping her.<br/><br/>Fantastic film to watch. 10/10."

","So I watched the new adaptation of a Star is Born at the theater. I walked into the film with high expectations. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper, but the 1954 Judy Garland version of a Star is Born is one of my favorite movies. I'm happy to say this was one of the best movies of 2018 so far.<br/><br/>The movie has a simple but rich and compelling plot. In a fairy tale like beginning a talented struggling young singer meets and falls in love with a popular musician after a chance encounter and begins her ascent into music stardom. Of course what makes the movie so compelling is that it is also a precautionary tale about stardom and the impact it has an individual. The film also masterfully combines a tragic love story with a realistic depiction of alcohol abuse and depression. The film also manages to squeeze in a condemnation on modern manufactured music pushed out just to sell records. The movie had a lot to say, what did a great job saying it.<br/><br/>Acting wise I was very impressed with this movie. Bradley Cooper has really demonstrated his range over the years, but this was one of his most memorable performances. Of course he aptly played the role of a charismatic and popular celebrity well, but it was his human depiction of substance abuse and depression that stole the show. I should also mention that this was one of Sam Elliott's best performances in years.<br/><br/>On top of that I was absolutely floored by Lady Gaga's performance. Of course she was competing against a high pedigree of past actresses who have also portrayed this role, but she was outstanding. She managed to play both the mild-mannered insecure struggling artist and the rising pop musician in a believable manner. At times it felt like she was really living the role instead of acting. She also had a genuine chemistry with Bradley Cooper which really helped to sell their love interest.<br/><br/>Of course speaking of Lady Gaga I have to mention the incredible music performances in this role. I'm not normally a fan of her genre of music, but her voice was so powerful and layered it added an emotional intensity to all of her performances. The range and depth of her voice really added quite a bit to the movie. I will be very surprised if this film does not get nominated for best original song at the Oscars.<br/><br/>It should also be mentioned that Bradley Cooper not only starred but also directed in this film. It is quite brave to take on one of the most memorable stories in Hollywood as a first-time director. Bradley Cooper all around directed the hell out of this movie. The cinematography was great, the changes to the story were perfect, and he really captured what makes this such a compelling story. I look forward to his future endeavors as a director.<br/><br/>My only real criticism being there were a few scenes that seemed to drag on and repeat them self. The film could have been cut down by at least 15 minutes or so which would have helped to tighten the flow of the plot.<br/><br/>Overall I absolutely loved this movie. I think it was one of the best of 2018 and is the first serious Oscar contender of the year. It not only perfectly captured what makes the story special but added an additional element to make it feel original. Highly recommended, a 9.25 out of 10."

","Wow! <br/><br/>To say the least, A STAR IS BORN truly lives up to its hype and deserving of its rave reviews that had people talking.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, in his first directorial debut, really directed the heck out of the movie and the film turned out to be pretty impressive for the actor-turned-director.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the movie was given meticulous details and no stone was left unturned in making sure that movie was made really well.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I was truly blown away by Cooper, of course. Taking three roles in the making of the movie (as actor, producer and director), Cooper add an extensive part in his acting role, that is as a singer. Although I'm not surprised that he could sing and play music (specifically playing the guitar), doing all those jobs was by no means an easy feat to pull off but he did all of them that ought to deserve the Academy's attention and recognition. Otherwise, the Academy is truly blind.<br/><br/>And even more impressive was on the part of Lady Gaga. Even though this was not her first acting gig as she had made quite impressive performance in the TV series, American Horror Story. But Lady Gaga truly shone her acting chops in a leading role that demanded a lot from her.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga stripped away her renowned celebrity status to showcase a vulnerable yet powerful role that demanded of her.<br/><br/>All in all, I could confidently say that this new rendition of A STAR IS BORN could easily be up for Oscar consideration in the following categories:<br/><br/>Best Motion Picture
Best in Directing - Bradley Cooper
Best Actor - Bradley Cooper
Best Actress - Lady Gaga
Best Supporting Actor - Sam Elliot
Best Cinematography
Best Editing
Best Original Song - ""I'll Never Love Again"" AND/OR ""Shallow""<br/><br/>In any case, it is undoubtedly that A STAR IS BORN is sure to win Best Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical) at the Golden Globes. I can guarantee on it."

"mattlynch-37672","8","11","23","3 October 2018"," What is the price of fame, and how far are you willing to go to achieve it?
","In Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, we see him take on the lead role as the haggard and disturbed Rockstar, Jackson Maine. Whilst Jackson's career has begun to falter he finds inspiration in a gifted dive bar performer, Ally, played by Lady Gaga (Stephanie Germanotta). The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is incredibly genuine, their love and admiration for one and other radiates from the screen. This adds a relatable human element to their journey, helping to engage the viewer. Which results in an engrossing journey, watching with baited breath and dizzying exhilaration, the subsequent cost that so often goes hand in hand with fame. <br/><br/>Cooper portrays Jackson as cyclically wretched but always convincing; his complex life has taken its toll with alcoholism and hearing loss now damaging his reputation. Gaga turns in a fantastic display as a budding but unlikely waiter/performer who stumbles upon success, and with it the complexities of stardom. Gaga not only highlights her outstanding voice but also her deft acting ability. There is a refreshing emphasis on the importance of talent over superficial looks. However, Gaga's character struggles against shallow image issues from the music industry throughout.<br/><br/>The character Ally mirrors Gaga's own rise to pop-celebrity status. Light is not always shed on this in a positive manner, with jabs at producers and a flurried celebrity lifestyle corrupting her originality. Which in turn compromises Jackson's morals, whose ardent stance causes him to slip behind in a changing world. This further drives the story as Jackson's fall reflects the rise in Ally's career. 
Despite the premise of an uplifting and heartwarming drama, A star is born is much more than that. The storyline tackles themes of addiction, loss and love. Particularly shown in Jackson's character, ever bleared eyed and slurring his words. This at times can be hard to watch as addiction is ugly, frustrating and often, it's tragic. These flaws in his life help to flesh out a memorable and thought-provoking character. The narrative doesn't shy away from the darker complexities in life culminating in some deeply moving scenes. The meaning and lyrics behind the songs bolster overarching themes in the film; such as the pursuit of happiness and the pain of loneliness in life. This is effective as it creates an authentic and approachable feel to the character's turbulent lives. <br/><br/>Gaga's insistence on the music scenes being live thoroughly pays off, providing not only convincing shows, but scintillating ones. Combined with masterful sound design and genuine sets, the viewer is immersed and pulled in amongst the crowd. The, decision to go to venues such as Coachella and Glastonbury, and play in front of a roaring audience, brings power and realism to the screen. Cooper's singing ability and general demeanor on stage, combined with Gaga's powerful performance are levelling. The song 'shallow' is sung with particular reverence: ""In all the good times, I find myself longing, for change."". It's difficult not to get goosebumps when you hear the opening riff and Gaga unleash her fantastic voice on the chorus.<br/><br/>Expect a whole host of Oscar nominations, including Best actor/actress/song. A star is born, is a fulfilling and powerful watch that seeps with humble authenticity. An instant classic? I have no doubt about that."

","Bradley Cooper, the Directors Eye you poses is a true gift my friend. The beautifully captured and measured nuance you were able to render brought me inside of the movie. For the first time since 1999 i was transported into an experience while watching a movie. You and your cast took me on a roller coaster of emotion. I believed you were Jackson. The authentic and naked delivery of Lady Gaga's performance when coming on stage with Jackson for the first time made the hair on my arms stand up it was so electrifying. The on screen chemistry was able to successfully weave a romantic tapestry that was later used to show the frayed edges that would be prayed upon. <br/><br/>The moment in the film that is one of the most powerful i have ever seen in a movie, is the conversation between Bobby and Jackson in the driveway when he is dropping him off. I was blown away at how you and your cast were able to render such powerful and emotionally charged seconds on screen that made me have to hold back my own tears. I lived inside of that moment with Bobby and Jackson from both of their perspectives. <br/><br/>If i had any criticisms for this movie, it would be that the initial romance happens very quickly, but because of the effective eye of director, it was pulled off successfully.<br/><br/>Lastly, I could appreciate how you used a very diplomatic approach in addressing the shortcomings in the music industry by pruning the tree instead of chopping it down.<br/><br/>Thank you all for a beautiful experience!<br/><br/><ul><li>VÏNTÓRY BLAKE MAGNUM MOORE</li></ul>"

","There are some directorial debuts that are just fine and there are others that are complete train wrecks. Bradley Cooper knocked his debut right out of the park because this film is one of the best I've seen all year. I loved this movie and it even pulled some legitimate tears from my eyes, which is saying a lot because I've also seen the 1976 adaptation of ""A Star Is Born"" starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand; a film I also love.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the previous iterations of ""A Star is Born"" or don't know the plot then here is a synopsis; Jackson Maine is a drug addicted alcoholic musician with his career going on a steady decline, one night runs into a girl named Ally in a bar who is an unknown singer with the potential to really do something with her talents. From there a love starts to bloom as Jackson helps Ally start off her career while he battles his own demons of depression, regret and addiction. I have to say that this film is an emotional powerhouse. There is some real impactful human drama here that is made all the more poignant by the actors who do an incredible job.<br/><br/>With a film like this, pretty much everything can fall apart if the romance isn't believable. Luckily with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in the lead roles, the chemistry is amazing between the two and one hundred percent believable in every scene. From the start of the movie it is apparent that these two people are somewhat of a mess, but in completely different ways; Cooper's character is a hardcore alcoholic that is squandering his music career away while Gaga's character lacks motivation and confidence to do anything more with her singing. However, when they find each other it's clear that they supply a lot of positivity to one another, such as Jackson finding a rekindled love for creating music and Ally finds the confidence to put herself out there. However, with those positives also comes consequences. These two actors, without a doubt, convey a truly authentic feeling love that can be seen clearly throughout the film; because of that it is easy to be charmed by their romance and route for them when things hit a down swing.<br/><br/>Every conversation in the film feels real, I don't just mean the ones between the two romantic leads, but the entire cast. There's just something about the dialog that comes across as discussions I could picture myself or anyone having, rather than something cleaned up and manipulated to fit the Hollywood world. When Jackson and Ally are talking about music or just getting to know each other, it feels heartwarming but never cynically ""cute"". Or if two characters are fighting, it could have come across as melodramatic, but here it feels legitimate and relatable. Speaking of characters in conflict, Sam Elliot also plays a supporting character in the film as Jackson's older brother and Elliot is brilliant in the role. There are scenes where Elliot doesn't even have to say a word, but the performance that he gives just in his face alone says everything you need to know and it hits hard; especially in one scene in particular between Elliot and Cooper that really tugged at the heart strings, I don't want to say too much as to what is said but there is a moment of silence for Sam Elliot after Cooper leaves the scene that was really emotionally difficult to watch because of his performance. And I mean that in the best way possible.<br/><br/>That reminds me, there's another silent moment in the film involving solely Bradley Cooper that really delivered such a strong emotional response for me. It was towards the end of the film, again, I won't say exactly what is happening but the whole scene starts with a somber tone that ramps up with suspense in anticipation as to what this character is going to do. Then with one look on Cooper's face, you understand everything that is going on in this guy's head and I couldn't help but get choked up. It was terribly difficult not to simply cry through whole scenes because of the tragedy going on in these people's lives. That's one of the great things about this movie, I forget that these are even characters, I feel like I am getting a peek into real peoples' lives. The movie really hit me right in the gut with one of its final shots involving Jackson Maine and Ally. When it got to that moment, I'm not going to lie, I shed a lot of tears...I mean...I'm a manly man, I don't feel feelings. Feelings are stupid...I need another tissue.<br/><br/>One brilliant thing that I would like to touch on is the cinematography; as a whole it is terrific, but there is something specific that this film does that I absolutely love. Throughout the entire romance there are these really specific moments that happens between these two characters that are made to feel even more significant because when they happen it switches to Jackson's point of view. Such as when they look directly at each other for the first time, the camera switches to Jackson's point of view staring right at Ally's face. When it is their wedding day, Jackson and Ally are standing at the alter and say 'I do', the camera briefly looks right at Ally's face. And then at the end it does it again, but in a slightly different way that I won't say. For me, this was a genius way to help the audience fall for this girl and understand exactly what is going on with these characters internally. Another technique the cinematography takes is how it films Jackson when he's intoxicated or high; a lot of the time it takes a while for the camera to give a full look at Jackson's face and everything feels just slightly off kilter. I thought that was a cool way to make certain scenes feel kind of odd and even on edge, much like how it is when you're in a room alone with someone who's completely drunk and you're sober. There's just a different vibe in the room, I think anyone who's been there knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The music of this movie blew me away. I was in awe of how much character and story could be fleshed out in just a single song. But again, the actors pull it off perfectly. Whenever they have to perform on stage or they're just simply playing along together in a private setting, it is made wildly clear how these people feel and what is going through their heads. When Lady Gaga's character is somewhat coerced into singing live on stage with Jackson for the very first time, you get everything going on with her in that moment. The terror of failure, the excitement of singing to a crowd full of thousands of people, the joy in finally letting go, back to fear, back to excitement. It's a flawless performance honestly that's made even better with the use of very long takes. Instead of constantly cutting, the editing is very minimal while you get a full look at everything going on with her. Lady Gaga really was a bright spot in this already great film, I loved her in this movie and cannot wait to see what she does next.<br/><br/>A funny little tidbit about this movie is that it has a lot of supporting cast members who are comedians; Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, Alec Baldwin, and Eddie Griffin to name the ones that I noticed. Andrew Dice Clay plays Ally's father and he's surprisingly really solid. I've never seen him outside of comedic roles before and I've certainly liked him in those, but never in a dramatic role like this and I think that he nailed it. Dave Chappelle, while briefly in the movie, also does a fantastic job and I actually kind of wanted to see him more in the film interacting with Jackson.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen. A bold statement, I know, but this is a bold movie. It doesn't pull punches or ever feel manipulative, it's raw and heartbreaking and beautiful. I said it before, I'll say it again, I love this movie. The acting is perfect, the editing and cinematography is outstanding, and the story solid; possibly more so than any of the other adaptations quite honestly. If you're emotionally stable enough to make it through a heavy romantic tragedy then this is well worth your time. Check it out as soon as you can, if nothing but to feel something great."

","Before I begin, I need to admit I expected to dislike this film. As the 4th version, I expected some misconstrued attempt to make an old story new again.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>First, the actors are excellent. Bradley Cooper handles his scenes with significant competence and artistry. Lady Gaga's performance is pure genius.<br/><br/>We have seen Lady Gaga in costume, looking glamorous when she performs a concert. We saw her bring a vampire to life in American Horror Story, looking glamorous.<br/><br/>In ""A Star is Born,"" we are introduced to her without the glamour, and she shared her authentic and incredible beauty with the world. She performs the role of Ally with such honesty that your heart literally aches for her to find happiness.<br/><br/>We are fortunate to have many stellar performances in film each year. Lady Gaga's Ally is beyond that.<br/><br/>In the 1930's Greta Garbo was cast in Camille. The 1940's gave us Mildred Pierce. The 1950's started off with Bette Davis as Margot Channing in All about Eve. Elizabeth Taylor's Martha from the 1960's is unforgettable.<br/><br/>Joining those ranks is Lady Gaga. With subtle brilliance, she conveys emotional pain with the slightest change in her facial expression. With a single tear she conveys the tragedy of being hurt by someone you love dearly.<br/><br/>Cooper's Jackson Main starts with the promise of being a knight in shining armor, and you soon learn he could have been, had he not been plagued with addiction. As he succumbs to his addiction, his career takes a nose dive as Ally flourishes.<br/><br/>The jealousy Jackson experiences may sound petty, but it's really too common. Fueled by alcohol consumption his actions become more cruel.<br/><br/>The characters are so well crafted in this film, viewers yearn for a happy ending that will never come.<br/><br/>The use of close ups to tell this story is very well done. In the biggest crowd, Jackson and Ally are each other's world.<br/><br/>Days after seeing the film, I still think of ways to find a happy ending. Could we get Jackson help? Could we find a way to get Ally to stay home that night?<br/><br/>That's something that differentiates a good film from a great film. Great films stay with us after the credits roll.<br/><br/>This is the best film I've seen years."
"pambingham","6","7","13","25 October 2018"," I enjoyed the film, but...
","I was looking forward to seeing this film as I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper and an even bigger fan of the previous version of the film starring Barbra Streisand. I was surprised by a couple of people leaving the theatre sniffling from tears as it just didnt do that for me, and I've been know to shed a tear watching the flinstones.<br/><br/>There was definitely chemistry between the characters and you really wanted them to be together; I was rooting for them. Gaga is a phenomenal singer, but an ok actress. This is where I think the film fell short for me. Given her inability to carry a film, more pressure was put on Cooper to do so, and while he did a good job, I think it lost the love story aspect for me or certainly lessened the impact.<br/><br/>FinaIly I wish this film would've just been made without the pressure of bring a remake. Remakes are or should be better than the original in my opinion and this film fell short. (I know btw. the Streisand version was not the original but the 3rd version). Full disclosure, I watch the Streisand version at least twice a year and cry each time I watch it. But i walked into the theatre watching Cooper and Gaga with high expectations and by the time Jackson offed himself I was done, I actually watched it with disappointment as I believed it was a cop out move and was so contrite. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to be moved and was not. Ally's scene following the death of Jacson was so empty and void of heart wrenching emotion.<br/><br/>I did like the friendship between Dave Chappelle and Cooper and wished we could've explored that a bit further. Good movie Oscar contender not."

"wilfredlucas","9","7","13","14 October 2018"," Powerfully-acted and moves you to the core
","It is hard to believe that this is Cooper's directorial debut, especially with the way he directed himself in such an empathetic character as rock star Jackson Maine. Even though Jack's addiction is affecting everyone around him, you could not resist but still care for his character. On the other hand, a movie star is literally born with Lady Gaga as Ally. Although her character was relatively underwritten compared to Jack, Gaga does the most of the character's rawness and authenticity. Gaga transcends the most in her musical numbers, specifically in ""I'll Never Love Again.""<br/><br/>Cooper and Gaga's chemistry in this film is the most genuine I've seen in a romantic movie in a while. Their relationship felt so intimate and deep that I felt like I was intruding in their personal space. The supporting cast shines as well, with comedians Dave Chapelle and Andrew Dice Clay providing an effective dramatic turn, and Sam Elliott's poignant performance proving to be so impactful given the limited screen time he got.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Matthew Libatique used a striking, saturated colors in a variety of shots, and his unique choice of filming the dialogues and musical scenes close to the actors situated the viewers in that same spot where the actor is. The music narrates the story of the characters well, and the songs hark back to 1990s Hollywood when ballads elevated the film. The songs in ""A Star Is Born"" are ready to be considered as classics.<br/><br/>The pacing and writing issues sometimes made the film feel both too long and too rushed. That said, this is a screenplay that almost avoids every cliché in this story. Even if this is a story that was told a number of times, Cooper managed to give a fresh and effective take on it."

"cultfilmfan","9","9","18","14 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born
","As it is plainly visible from the homepage on this site for the new film, A Star is Born, there are so many user and critic's reviews for this new movie, that I can safely say that I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, or written about it, but in my effort to try and review most of the new films I see at the theatre, I will certainly try my best to do a worthwhile review, even if the majority of the people who usually read these reviews have had enough reviews of this new film already. As, I think it is also pretty clear, this new version of this story is nothing new as it has been made already three times and I also have to be honest and admit that I have never to this day seen any of the other versions, so how closely this new film follows them, or if they have a certain sequence, or story arc between them I do not know, but from what I understand, writer/director Bradley Cooper borrows a little bit from all versions, but also certainly makes this film his own with his own unique stamp on it and also a very unique and worthwhile debut as a writer and director as well also in this case as a singer and songwriter as well. I think over the years having seen many films about showbusiness and the lives of either actors, singers, or people in the entertainment industry in general we as an audience have come to expect certain things from these movies. Usually they feature a celebrity of some kind who can not deal with the various pressures from being famous and this causes them often to go off the deep end with either alcohol, or some kind of substance abuse, or abuse of their bodies in some excessive way. I think it would be something new and even perhaps refreshing to have a story about a celebrity who avoids these pitfalls and basically can hold their own both while performing and keeping a handle on their personal life, but perhaps I am being the naive one here and the many deaths of musicians and people in the entertainment industry just goes to show that success and fame truly can be a hard act to juggle and maybe more credit, or understanding is due to those who in some ways we know very little about outside their public persona. The substance abuse issues are certainly on display in this new version as well and jealously, power hungry managers and agents and the various pressures that stem out of and because of this is all here. It is handled in an interesting if not altogether entertaining version and the performances can be very powerful here even if at times it does border a little bit on melodrama. I think a lot of questions people had about this film include how is Cooper as a writer/director/singer and how is Lady Gaga in her first starring role for the big screen? I can safely and assuredly tell you that Cooper directs and writes like he has been doing it for ages and he truly is a wizard behind the camera and his writing as well as singing is all well done also. For his performance I can also say that I think it is the strongest as well as the best performance of his career thus far and I think choosing to write and direct films and to only direct films he has written himself is a wonderful career move and gives hope to Hollywood as we have another true auteur in the making and a good one at that. Lady Gaga who I know has appeared on American Horror Story, which I have never delved into, but here for her big screen debut she is certainly very impressive not only with her singing and songwriting, but also a emotional performance and a moving one at that. I think it is pretty much guaranteed that both Cooper and Gaga will be up for acting Oscars as well also with Sam Elliott in a wonderful supporting performance. The songs where Cooper and Gaga accompany each other are well done and should also be up for nominations as well as writing, directing and even Best Picture. The film is certainly not my favourite film that I have seen this year, but that is not to say it isn't worth seeing because it certainly is and I was impressed at how many people at my theatre came out to see this film in it's second week and overhearing how much they loved it. For a mainstream outing it is as good as it can get in a time of remakes and cliches being done countless times, but I look forward to seeing more from Cooper and Gaga and what they have left us with is certainly impressive and worth the time out at the theatre."

","This version is very average. Gaga is a musician, stick with that. Cooper is a good actor who showed off his singing chops, well done. 3rd act was very over indulgent, could have done without a lot of it.

I do believe Lady Gaga will earn an Oscar for her performance--she deserves it! And Bradley Cooper deserves an Oscar for directing and acting as well. I absolutely love everything about the artistic choices in this movie! From the moment Ally first went on stage with Jack, I decided I had to see this movie again on the big screen. <br/><br/>I also pre-ordered the soundtrack and was happy to have it available to play this morning.

","This movie is definitively great in many aspects, yet a little bit overrated in my opinion.
Lady Gaga did an excelent job, not only as a singer but also as an actress. I was suprised when, at the final credits, I found out that Bradley Cooper was also the director, apart from being one of the main characters, Jackson Maine, who he plays very well.
The plot is good, but nothing like the connection between Ally and Jackson: Gaga and Cooper give life to a real, not perfect, really touching relationship, that might make you emotional a couple of times!! Even if you are not usually into romance it might suprise you...And if you love Lady Gaga's voice or good vocals in general, go for it!
At the end of the movie you might think ""Hey. Just wanted to take another look at you"", because you'll probably want to see it again!"
"davidgee","7","6","11","24 October 2018"," A star is - loudly - born
","Two major revelations: Lady Gaga can act! And Bradley Cooper can sing. This is very much a remake of the Barbara Streisand/Kris Kristofferson version (1976) with 'country rock' songs rather than the 'Some Enchanting Evening' sound of the 1954 Judy Garland/James Mason version, which I still prefer. Funnily enough, the ending of this new movie does carry a strong echo of the Garland movie and a fainter echo of 'The Man That Got Away'.<br/><br/>The love story works thanks to onscreen chemistry and quality performances. Gaga actually reminds me of Streisand in FUNNY GIRL: she brings that sense of a raw burgeoning talent. I'm not a fan of her singing: she has a shouty style that reminds me, not pleasantly, of Carly Simon. Bradley Cooper sings as well (and in similar voice) as Kristofferson in the 1976 version. He also directs with considerable flair and has an amazing screen presence. Not sure he'll get awards for this, but clearly his star, unlike Jackson Maine's in the movie, is rising.<br/><br/>This is a loud, gutsy movie. I'm an old softie, I wanted more ballads."
"kylerafa","8","6","11","20 October 2018"," BEAUTIFUL, CLASSIC DESPITE SOME IMPERFECTIONS
","A Star is Born is far from being the best movie of the year. The screenplay is kind of ""very basic"", and without surprise ""guessable"", but tells a lot and perfectly about the romance of Ally and Jack. Even though the first part if thé film is truly an ""excessive succession if storytelling"", the music on it brought easily tje emotions that the director wanted the audience to have, hence the first hour seemed too short. It's in the second part that we can find how damn talented and brilliant is Lady Gaga as an actress. Her voice and face expression make us enjoy a lot that simple classic story which is A Star is Born. However, the original music written for the film fits perfectly with the story and brings instantaneously the emotions to the audience, so are the cinematography and the brilliant first directing from Cooper. The ending is truly BREATHTAKING and EPIC that the final scène only won't let you forget the entire film si easily, and how beautiful it was to experience watching it. The film won't win ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars (unless there is a miracle) because of the lack of originality in it I Guess, but there are so many chances for it to win in other categories."

","Lady Gaga had a good performance and Copper continues to demostrate his talent. I went into the movie expecting a great movie based on reviews but by the end was disappointed. The first 30-40 minutes are good then it's just downhill from there. The rest of the movie feels like a drag. The best thing is the music, the last song it's very good."

It was spectacular then lost it's way.<br/><br/>Watch it for Bradley Cooper, his best acting to date!

"ROCKAFELLA71","8","6","11","14 October 2018"," Great film!
","Had a choice between this film and an action film. This got hire ratings so I watch the trailer again and decided on this film. 
Based on the trailer I thought the characters were country music stars, to my surprise he is basically a rock star and she a pop star. Bradley Cooper was great as usual, for Lady Gaga this was the perfect role. The acting was well done, the love story so beautiful, the hereditary alcoholism was real. Although a good film there two areas that could have been better, 1. If Bradley Cooper's character was such a big star why was there no paparazzi all the time he was hanging around town, sleeping in the grass, etc. 2. Jackson taking his own life for fear of ruining his wife's career was not believable. Allys manager was actually right....not very tactful but right but even still we are to believe that Jackson was so distraught that he would end it all? And him telling a story of him trying to kill himself a 13 but failed to help justify why he died this way. Overall this was a great film!"
"blackolig","5","6","11","13 October 2018"," Lackluster. Go watch Judy!
","The film is fine. The acting is fine. Gaga can sing, we know that already. Cooper can act, we know that already. We get more of a ""backstory"" on the guy in this remake, which is not surprising, given that Cooper directed it himself. A quarter of the acting is borderline growled instead of spoken. Less focus is given on Gaga's character, which is perhaps a good thing, given this is her first staring roll. Not enough chemistry is there between making it hard to care what happens to either of them in the end, because, after two hours of no passion, death does seem like the only way out. The film is shot almost entering in closeup (and not in a Bergman way), so I hope you like their faces. Watch it if you have movie pass and have nothing else to do. If you want to see this film done right. Go watch Judy's '54 version or even Streisand's version, as both demonstrate the talent of their leading lady, unlike this dud."
"belomestnykh","4","6","11","10 October 2018"," Mediocre
","This film is ok. It's not worth the $15 I payed to see it. It's over two hours long for no reason, it drags the story where it needs to speed up and jumps when it needs to take its time. Many scenes and many shots don't cut well together. It's clear that there were reshoots and pick up days, lighting doesn't match a lot. Story is overtold and it is yet again a white nobody girl is set for life by a popular handsome and ritch white guy who later on ruins his own career and Jill's himself. If you feel like this is the story for you, don't watch it anyway, you already know everything. Watching this for Gaga is useless too, because most of the songs are intentionally bad, so it's not like you will see her perform much. Other than singing she doesn't act amazing either, ok, but nothing special."

The movie was drawn out. They tease Jack dying early in the movie (the whole time I'm thinking OD). So for most of the movie I'm thinking, ""quit teasing me and let Jack die already"", which was distracting. Movie is very slow in the 2nd and 3rd acts. I was board for most of the movie.

This is my first time seeing any of the The Star Is Born movies but this one has to be the least positive and the most dramatic BY FAR. I'm pretty upset with how beautiful the trailers look when the movie itself is 1/4 beautiful, 3/4 DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA and heartbreaking, ruin your life kind of drama.

One second it feels like Queens or Brooklyn (Accent Andrew Dice), then it seems like they are in Texas, then California. What? Could you establish just the basic geography first?<br/><br/>And no subtleties at all. Could they make the characters ease in a little, or do we have to open on a raging alcoholic (Cooper)?<br/><br/>So he leaves the concert, alone, looking for a bar, and why not a gay/drag queen bar? Because after all, that is where an alpha male country boy would enter. What? Mind you, the driver doesn't know the neighborhood, so it was randomly picked, but right after he meets Gaga, he takes her to a bar he knows. Why didn't he go there first? Because nothing makes in Hollywood for the most part. But I digress. The Gaga meeting was so movie staged. He JUST met her and they are already hand fondling and staring each other down.<br/><br/>And the reason why she hadn't made it is because of her nose? What? Because everyone in the world thinks she is a star and an amazing singer but passed on her because she had a ""bad"" nose.<br/><br/>What happens next? Gaga punches some random fan? What? Who wrote this? No one living in reality.<br/><br/>And why is Cooper trying too much to be Kris Kristofferson?<br/><br/>After a romantic night spent together, Gaga RUSHES out of the car.... what?<br/><br/>Cooper tried so hard to make it ""real"" it became staged and phony.<br/><br/>And then the phony ""playing hard to get"" by Gaga, but her body language screams YES! Did they write the script with an ax?<br/><br/>And then we get the cliche ""no, no, I don't want to go on stage,"" but she does eventually after 3 seconds and then the scene we have seen in a million movies: ""shy at first on the mic, then belts and gets the ovation.""<br/><br/>This is so all over the place, I am not sure why people would like this? They gave ZERO reason why Gaga would fall for him. She played hard to get and then boom they were a couple. Forget that he is a raging alcoholic because that is just what this girl wanted. She usually uses a typewriter to write lyrics, because that is what girls use. What?<br/><br/>I literally had to force myself to continue to watch a few minutes more without cringing.

","I can't remember the last time I expected to dislike a movie and ended up loving it to this extent. I actually had no intention of seeing 'A Star Is Born' but got invited along to it and decided to give it a chance. In exchange I was treated to 136 of the most enjoyable minutes of my life. I actually thought to myself at one point in the movie that I would be happy if this movie never ended. It was just so perfect in every way. The music sounded great, it was heart-warming, heart-breaking, inspirational and relatable in every aspect.<br/><br/>There was so much to love about this film, but the thing that was simply the best for me was the love story between the main two characters 'Jack' and 'Ally'. I can't remember the last time I saw chemistry this good between two actors (you may have to go as far back as 'Titanic'). I didn't even recognise Lady Gaga until about the halfway part in the film when her character takes a visual transformation. Even now, knowing that it was her, I still have to ask myself was that really Gaga the entire movie? She is completely different to how I've always seen her. I can't remember a transformation this big since Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. Her acting also blew me away. She was truly incredible. Her singing was always going to be great, but it was her emotional range that blew me away. She even out-acted Bradley Cooper overall in my opinion, and that is no mean feat because he was also absolutely incredible. She unquestionably deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.<br/><br/>Cooper has outdone himself with 'A Star Is Born'. He wrote, directed and starred in the film and did all three to an incredibly high standard. His character broke my heart. You could see in his eyes how much he loved this woman, and yet he was facing so many demons that it wasn't allowing him to be truly happy. The story arc of his character is a work of art. He is also much deserving of an Oscar win for Best Actor.<br/><br/>If you haven't worked it out by now I absolutely loved this movie. There isn't a single fault I could come up with. If this film doesn't have you glued to the screen and drag emotion out of you then you are made of stone and film is simply not for you. I would be very surprised if this film didn't take home the Best Picture award at the Oscars. It would be an extremely worthy winner."

","I saw ""A Star Is Born"", starring Lady Gaga-American Horror Story_tv, Machete Kills; Bradley Cooper-War Dogs, All About Steve; Sam Elliott-Up In The Air, Road House and Andrew Dice Clay-One Night At McCool's, Amazon Women On The Moon.
This is about the 4th remake of this movie-the first was in 1937 with Janet Gaynor & Fredric March, the second was in 1954 with Judy Garland & James Mason and the third was in 1976 with Barbara Streisand & Kris Kristofferson-and one of the stars of this one, Bradley, is also directing it, in his first time directing a movie. For those unfamiliar with the other versions, Bradley plays an aging rock star that discovers Lady G, an up and coming singer, that is just looking for her big break. She is working in a restaurant while singing part time in a bar at night. Bradley decides to take her under his wing and help her get a leg up in the industry but he has his own demons to fight, including alcohol and drug abuse as well as family problems. As Bradley's career is spiraling downwards Lady G's starts getting more popular. Sam plays Bradley's brother/manager and Andrew plays Lady G's father. I read that both Bradley and Lady G did their own singing live during the filming of the movie-it was suggested by Lady G that it would make it look more authentic. There are a few cameos; I remember seeing Alec Baldwin and Dave Chappelle and Lukas Nelson-Yep, Willie's son-taught Bradley how to play the guitar and also wrote some of the songs that are performed in the film. I wasn't expecting it to be very good but it was a little better than I anticipated.
It's rated ""R"" for language, alcohol & drug abuse and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.

It's highly OVERrated.. nothing like a good movie.. the only good thing here is the music .
Waste your time somewhere else 😏"
"ronckova-zuzana","6","5","9","25 November 2018"," This movie is way overhyped.
","I did love the music scenes, which the whole movie is pretty much built upon. Both Bradley Cooper's and Lady Gaga's vocal performances were Top-Notch, although Gaga's acting... not so much. I found she was naturally great in those parts where she was playing herself (singing on stage), however, I had a really hard time believing her in the rest of the movie.
As the narrative is nothing new, the ending was also very predictable. And I just did not buy it... Final scene was a cheap move to make people emotional, which I see happening for many in the casual, non-critical part of the audience. To me, it just didn't do it."

"filledenlille22","9","5","9","10 November 2018"," Almost perfect!
","Characters with splendid chemistry gets you emotionally involved already in the first minutes. The storytelling has great pace and it makes the seemingly fast love story feel very genuine, there aren't many scenes or moments that feels wasted or forced.<br/><br/>A lot small acts off affection is done by Coopers character, and even thought it isn't much, its very likable and helps with the development of the characters. With many moments like these, great music, fantastic characters and perfectly catching a very realistic feeling of our contemporary society I would say it is a film worth seeing. The only thing making keeping this from a 10 is the ending, which is a bit dragged out. I feel like the point of Jacks struggle has been shown and film could've done with a few less minutes in the end.<br/><br/>Lady gaga makes a phenomenal debut as an actress and nails her character. Cooper also does an amazing job with his broken, but still, charming character. With a lovely script and the emotional rollercoaster it gives you I am still thinking back to the movie long after seeing."
"PotassiumMan","10","5","9","10 November 2018"," Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in a remake for the ages
","When I first heard about this, I did not know quite what to expect. On the one hand, Bradley Cooper had never directed a film before and I had no feel for Lady Gaga's acting chops. On paper, it was hard to know if this would be any good.<br/><br/>Needless to say, my doubts were answered and put to rest forever by the time I left the theater. This age-old story of a young woman who meets a celebrity on the downward spiral of his career and who becomes the next big thing is wonderfully revived here, with Lady Gaga as a young waitress and singer who meets the legendary country singer Jackson Maine, whose career is beginning to slide amid his drug and alcohol addiction. Sam Elliot is dynamic as his long-suffering older half-brother and manager.<br/><br/>What makes this film so memorable aside from its stellar performances? First off, there are a handful of amazing ballads sung by both Lady Gaga and Cooper. Their vocals bring this film to such grand heights, that I might now have a couple of new favorite songs. Lady Gaga's stirring delivery anchors this film and then rockets it to the sky. Just thinking about it makes me misty-eyed. Equally realized besides the music, are the themes of holding onto love and discovering your true potential. In that regard this film had an amazing flare for insightful dialogue.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a film that comes from the heart and is as good as people think films used to be and offers some hope, then this one most surely is for you."
"shelleytunney","10","5","9","10 November 2018"," First Review Ever
","This movie is simply breathtaking. It's been over a month since I saw this with my husband and we are still talking about it. It is magical, sensitive, and as equally gut-wrenching as it is heart warming. Walking out of the theatre I would have rated this an 8 but it just keeps growing on me. Gaga is brilliant in the role but it is the magic between her and Cooper that will leave you breathless. A must see."
"chakra-indra-negara","10","5","9","10 November 2018"," I HAD TO WRITE SOMETHING
","This is for all the haters here, it doesnt matter about this film was remake or this film has a boring romance story or whatever you say, the important things in here all about the emotions of Gaga & Cooper blended just like their own story.<br/><br/>If you already watch this movie without touched your heart ? Then, probably there something you need to embrace as human being... and its ""LOVE""."
"andrewestrella","Null","5","9","10 November 2018"," The Best Romantic Chemistry Ever Displayed on Film
","I must be on a streak with the amount of excellent films that I have been seeing lately, because A Star is Born is fantastic. If this film does not get nominated for Best Picture or Best Actor, Best Actress, or Best Original Song, then I will literally be stunned, because every single aspect found within the film was perfect. I would really love to see Lady Gaga win the Oscar for Best Actress because she totally nailed it here. She went from poking faces in 2007, to make the audience's heart sink in 2018.<br/><br/>Honestly, the one thing that I love the most about this film is the fact that the chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is so genuine and authentic. Their relationship is so perfect, so real, and I honestly felt like I was getting a realistic perspective of a couple, with all of their happiness, struggles, and everything in between. It is so funny that I thought Bradley Cooper was absolutely awful in American Sniper, so I was incredibly shocked to see how well he did here. Like in American Sniper, Cooper is also suffering from an alcohol addiction and relationship, but in A Star is Born, it is handled much more brilliantly. You see, we actually get to feel for his character. He is such a likable guy, that even when he makes a horrible decision, we understand why he is doing it, and we sympathize with in throughout it all. I loved both his character and Lady Gaga's so much. They were so damn perfect together.<br/><br/>As for the music, on its own it may have not been my cup of tea, but in the context of the film, it was outstanding. From country, to pop, to a little bit of rock and roll, I was sold on every song. Even with the final song, which totally wrecked my heart, along with everybody else's in the theater (who was sobbing like I was), I was hooked all the way through. The music was so perfect and I loved the transition in the tone of the music from the one-man show of Bradley Cooper at the beginning of the film, the duo of Cooper and Lady Gaga towards the middle, and the one-woman show of Gaga at the end. It was just outstanding.<br/><br/>You know, as much as I love La La Land, I started to understand why some people disliked that film after watching this one. A Star is Born is far more realistic, grounded, has better chemistry, and is just much more powerful. I loved this film, not only more than La La Land, but more than any other movie I have seen this year. This was excellent, without flaws, and if anything, really started to make me feel that love might be real.<br/><br/>So many soundtracks to continue listening to: A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, Mid90s, and now A Star is Born. I love it!"
"christopherorozco","10","5","9","9 November 2018"," Movie of the Year!
","I usually don't watch dramas but wow this movie amazing and spectacular! Great acting by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, they should win an Oscar for their performance. The movie was emotional towards the end but such a beautiful movie and I would recommend anyone who is a fan of music to see this."
"pinemaples","9","5","9","7 November 2018"," A Director is Born
","A Star is Born, contrary to what the title might imply, is not a Christmas movie. It is in fact the newest remake of a story that's been told several times over the past century, beginning with the 1937 original starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The most recent version prior to this year's edition was released in 1976 and starred Kris Kristofferson as a drunken rock star whose career is in the beginning of its decline. He has a chance meeting with an aspiring singer, played by Barbra Streisand, and works to launch her stage debut in his place.
This year's adaptation follows a similar story, and features Bradley Cooper in his directorial debut, also channeling his inner Keith Urban as rock/country artist Jackson Maine, who becomes infatuated with Lady Gaga's character Ally after watching her sing at a hole-in-the-wall drag bar. This is easily the best I have ever seen of Bradley Cooper onscreen. He inhabited this character so completely that Cooper himself was gone and Jack was all I saw. Cooper, who hails from Pennsylvania, put on the most authentic southern accent I have ever heard from a non-southerner. Actors typically put on a hillbilly twang when they attempt to portray this type of character, but there was nothing artificial going on here in the least. Lady Gaga, while not on Cooper's level, still surprised me with her acting talent. I would argue that she mostly played herself, but this is exactly what the character called for, and she did it well. Sam Elliot was a surprise -- I didn't expect to see him in this movie, but as Jack's (much) older brother Bobby, he gave a very subdued, yet powerfully emotional performance. If I could, I would absolutely nominate him for best supporting actor, and he was a consistent highlight to the movie.
A Star is Born is a romantic drama, first and foremost, but the music is absolutely central to the story. Most of the music, particularly the country style, was thoroughly enjoyable, and sounded like something I'd throw on to listen to while driving with friends. Once the movie delved into pop music, it lost its charm and came off as some of the more rote stuff I'd expect to hear from Bieber, but I think that was part of the point, as it helped us understand some of Jack's frustrations.
The movie is pretty long at roughly 2 hours, 15 minutes. The story, unfortunately, seemed to meander a bit and got a little slow in parts, but I would still say that each scene helped to build and develop the characters and the relationships defined over the course of the movie. We really got to know these people, and it also provided an interesting look into stardom to help us see celebrities as fellow humans with real problems and real flaws.
I'm very glad I finally found time to watch this movie before it left theaters, and I'd encourage others to do the same. If this is any indication of Bradley Cooper's future as a director, I'll be there day one to see his next movie."
"sbockbookblog","10","5","9","7 November 2018"," Amazing... just... amazing!
","This movie is so amazing! The on screen chemistry between Cooper and Gaga was absolutely soectacular. The music, for the most part was worth listening to, her ""pop"" music not so much but everything else was absolutely breathtaking. The song at the end had me in tears. Overall I am impressed with this one and I'll be seeing it again."
"ohsolovelysu","10","5","9","5 November 2018"," Moving, Magical, Marvelous
","I saw A Star Is Born (2018) opening weekend, having never seen any of the other three adaptations. I had no idea what to expect, no idea what the story really WAS, I only knew I was excited for Bradley Cooper's directorial debut and Lady Gaga's acting debut. That, and I knew it was a film involving music and love - the two things that will always steal my heart. I watched it the one time and it has not left my mind since. It broke me but still somehow inspired me and set me on fire. This movie is about so much. It HOLDS so much. It's about love, it's about struggle, it's about pain, mental health, substance abuse, the tragedy that can come from those things. But also, the beauty. You can see and feel when watching this film that everyone involved poured their hearts into it. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have the most authentic chemistry I may have ever seen on film, or perhaps even off. The respect and admiration they have for each other in real life carries through into their characters and their stories and makes this film so REAL. You will fall in love, you will laugh, you will cry. I can not recommend this movie enough. The music is incredible, the acting is phenomenal, the composition of this entire film is nothing short of a masterpiece and it will stay in my heart forever. Watch it and fall in love."
"blackwaterjulia","9","5","9","5 November 2018"," Music fueled drama, that excels at its integrity
","I went to this movie with very little background knowledge on the story and/or most of the actors. I had heard of Lady Gaga, but since I hardly listen to radio I was unaware what she sounded like. As far as Cooper goes, I might have seen one movie with him and that was it. Still the trailer looked good, Lukas Nelson (yes son of) helped to write the music, and all time favorite Sam Elliott played a part in it. Reason enough to go check it out, and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The story line is very well executed, and although based on the original and its remake, there were plenty of unique touches, making this story stand out from the others. Script wise we see a well balanced movie that alternates between music, dialogue, and that was is left unsaid. It is hard to believe this is Cooper's writing and directing debut, and he should be given high praise for doing an excellent job.<br/><br/>Being a story about two singers, this movie wouldn't be much without its music. Of course music is always a matter of taste, and whether or not it's to someone's liking comes down to personal preference. That said, the music does have a high standard of quality which I like. Not all songs met my personal preference, but the three main songs did. Reading an interview after seeing the movie, I was mind blown to learn Cooper had learned to sing and play the guitar from scratch for this movie. Now that's what I call dedication.<br/><br/>The last part of this review leaves me with the acting. To my surprise Gaga turns out to be an excellent actor, that plays her part convincing yet seemingly effortless. The same can be said for Cooper, who transitions between being a jerk and being extremely vulnerable in moments. Although the two leads know how to put down a strong and realistic character, the real surprise in this movie is Elliott. It's said that some things get better with age, this definitely goes for the actor who is in his 70's by now. In the role of Cooper's big brother he plays the emotionally charged scenes with a heartbreaking conviction. I'm not exaggerating when I say I saw over half the visitors leave the cinema that day with red eyes."
"sarahakimah","10","5","9","2 November 2018"," Beautiful movie
","I'm by no means someone who's a film expert or such, and this is my first time writing a movie review. I walked into the cinema without any expectations and walked out with red eyes (yes, I was sobbing real hard) and somehow pleasant feeling. The storyline was kind of cliche for me and I can guess what is gonna come on next (I haven't watch the 2 A Star Is Born movies before this one though) but it has something special to it. The casting, the acting, directing, script, is all perfect. The script is written so beautifully and so natural that you get so immersed in the movie. It was like real moments happened smoothly and I can feel myself really 'being in the movie'. Cooper & Gaga acting was great, they did a really good job. Their chemistry was unbeatable. Don't have to question their singing performances. But I think what really moved me was how deep the connection between Jack and Ally, how they deeply in love with each other and keeping supporting each other is beyond me. I like the character Ally who genuinely want Jack to be better and to be healthier and how she keeps being on his side no matter what. It was like a true love. I always have this soft spot for movies like this, that tells a story of love that is so pure and not over-exaggerated, just natural and beautiful, like love actually is. And now I found myself cry everytime I hear Shallow and I'll Never Love Again. Beautiful, inspiring, heartwarming movie."

","A modern remake of a timeless classic tale, Bradley Cooper's ambitious project in his directorial debut will be and should be heralded as nothing less than a masterpiece. The writing, the directing, the acting and above all the singing were spot on. Who would have thought Bradley Cooper could sing and, even more pleasantly surprising, that Lady Gaga could act. At the minimum Cooper deserved nomination for acting and directing and to date Gaga deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.

","Just brilliant, if you are an artist/musician it will probably be the best movie you have seen in a very long time.... if not the best. The way Cooper and Gaga worked on this is nothing short than amazing, the real stuff, not acting. So much garbage spewed out these days, made in a studio with some high end fake graphics and effects has gone on long enough. This hit me emotionally on so many levels, I'm still in awe, and trying figure that part out, the songs alone hold this picture up high. This is coming from a die hard Rush fan and musician from childhood, who has recently lost his favorites... so..... I just want to thank everyone who had a part in this for seeing it through and making me feel emotions i have not had in a very long time. I am a big fan of Gaga for her insane musical creative skills and her very unique voice, but this was something totally different from her, and Cooper, they just aligned at the perfect time.

","There's so much to like about this film, from the opening, the music, the energy felt from the live crowd performances, Cooper singing for real, Gaga belting out her first new song and their love for one another felt so big on a screen this size. I was lost in it from their first meeting, but then it kind of fizzled out for me. I watched it happily and with great anticipation, but maybe I researched it too much before I went to see it, as there were so many frames which I'd already seen in the trailers and some spoilers and didn't feel so connected to it by the end, which did take me by surprise. It's definately a film to see on the big screen, and I was very moved by it, but not enough to feel it's one of those films that stays a favourite with me for a very long time. I'm giving it 7 stars for first time director, casting, the shots of being backstage and what that felt like (which I really appreciated), as well as the strong attraction these two had for one another, but other than that, it lacked depth in the leading characters, and jumped around a little too much for me to remain invested."

"chrisguest","8","5","9","22 October 2018"," A Star Is Born is true to its title for both its director and starlet
","If the title and premise of the new film A Star Is Born sounds familiar to you, it's because it probably is. Bradley Cooper's new adaptation marks the fourth re-creation of this classic film. Despite not being a stranger to the big screen, this version may be the most impactful of them all.
Believe it or not, the original version was released all the way back in 1937, starring stars of yesteryear - Janet Gaynor and Frederic March. It won an Oscar for Best Original Story, a writing category that no longer even exists, and was nominated for six others - including Best Picture.
In 1954, Judy Garland starred along with James Mason in the original remake of the film 17 years after the aforementioned original. Like the first version, it too was nominated for six Oscars.
A little more recently, the legendary Barbra Streisand starred alongside Kris Kristofferson in the second official remake back in 1976. The film was nominated for four Oscars - winning Best Original Song for ""Evergreen."" However, the film itself was not as well-received by both critics and audiences as the other versions of the film, but Streisand's popularity allowed it to achieve most of its successes through its soundtrack.
That all leads us to where we are today - 2018. A Star Is Born is back for a new generation of cult followers. Like its predecessors, this depiction of the film has rapidly gained financial success, received high praise from critics and become a ""must-see"" of its time."

","It has been a long time since I've experienced a movie that literally had the entire theatre laugh,cry and applaud together as one. At one point it was entirely silent followed by an explosive sobs. What's fascinating is Bradley Cooper spent a year and a half learning to play guitar and sing. He did this all will it being his director debut. As for Lady Gaga it was just as exceptional being her first movie debut. It was if she was a well seasoned actress. Not to mention her powerhouse vocals once again proven to be outstanding.
I feel like it was perfectly portrayed the lives of those touched by alcoholism, codependency and suicide. Our Country needs to see how these diseases affect an individual, family and loved ones. It also shows that we must be open to listening to and being sympathetic to everyone because our thoughtful words could save a persons life or if not careful contribute to its demise.

So, this movie ""The Star was Born"" is a common and unremarkable one-time film, thousands of them. Undoubtedly, the film also has its disadvantages. Lady Gaga, ""Merlin Manson"" in a skirt, has always been a singer, about whose vocal data I do not intend to spread, but she was only a second actress, and even in those small stretches of her triumph, she managed to replay, then lose. Taking it to the main role purely because of an unattractive appearance was not a good idea. Bradley Cooper is not bad, but it is a pity that he cast his talent on such cheap films. The plot develops for a long time, the tape is tightened, it became harder and harder to sit on your comfortable chair. But I could, as I regret, I do not recommend this slag for viewing."

","People overhyped this movie too much. This movie is definitely overrated. Bohemian Rhapsody has a lot of praise too but that one actually lived up to the hype. If you have better things to do, avoid this as it will be a waste of your time and you'll constantly be looking at your watch/time.<br/><br/>The movie is honestly really boring/slow/predictable. It's more of a promotional concert/music video than a storytelling movie; surprisingly, on the other hand, Bohemian Rhapsody doesn't drag it to make it a musical/concert but more of a storytelling - that's what makes that film more entertaining.<br/><br/>The romance between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is extremely forced from the beginning and not heartfelt/romantic at all - I'm sorry but this is no Jack/Rose chemistry.<br/><br/>If you actually bought the romance between the two stars, you probably believe in the ""romance"" between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers. They're both very superficial.<br/><br/>While I did like the music and there is a sad moment, it doesn't merit the praise it is getting because overall the movie really is dragged out about really nothing.<br/><br/>There is some theme about alcoholism and mental stability, but I believe that part is a major afterthought/falls in the background and the movie is spent too much time on the concert/music performances. Overall it's more of a superficial film.<br/><br/>If you had a choice between this movie and Bohemian Rhapsody, definitely see Bohemian - that one is a must-see performance/story wise. I think people are overpraising Gaga's performance too; I mean, we've seen it from Cher and even Mariah wasn't THAT bad in Glitter."

","A STAR IS BORN: This was a case of either tears or chills. After the final credits rolled, I just sat there and wept. When I got to the car, I just sat there and wept. I can't remember the last time I was so blown away by a film. I predict Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best performances for Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, Best Direction, Best Screenplay (Cooper), Best Score, Best Original Song (Cooper and or Gaga), Costume, Makeup. Gaga is absolutely electrifying in her musical numbers. She's a phenomenon without peer. She earns the the term incomparable. There is simply no one like her, not now, not ever. (Sorry, Barbra) Her vocal range and her ability to change the quality of her voice from opera to country is something to behold. She's no Streep, at least not yet, but her presence is pure honesty which must be there because most of her performance was shot in extreme closeup where there is no margin for fakery. Cooper's direction is brilliant: the camera placement practically puts us in the scene; moves only with purpose and holds still to capture pure performance. How he managed to direct himself is beyond my ken. He was brilliant. Gaga and Cooper wrote most of the songs, individually and collaborated on many. This is also a love story which examines the price we're willing to pay to stay. She and Cooper share and explosive screen chemistry which is palpable. If you like movies at all, this one is not to be missed. Score: 10. It's that good"

Love, addiction, ambition, abandonment. I'm still finding new layers.<br/><br/>The love story was believable and breathtaking. I'd watch this 100 times more just to watch them fall in love again in front of me. The directing and camera work really makes you feel like you're a part of that process. And the music keeps you right there. The soundtrack and score is perfection. <br/><br/>One thing I've found interesting is the reviews talking about jealousy- Jackson jealous of Ally's rising stardom. I didn't take this at all but what I felt was that Cooper really portrayed jack's escalating downward spiral as a result of feeling abandoned by Ally. Once the manager entered the picture he lost his partner, his muse, and his rediscovered joy in his art. And for what? For her to relinquish her art to the pop machine. <br/><br/>The ending was tough. So beautifully tragic. Go see it. You won't regret it. Oscars all around!"
"FlickChick82","8","6","12","13 October 2018"," Not ""Shallow""
","Lady Gaga blew me away! I have always known that she could sing, one of my favourite songs is ""Edge of glory"", especially the acoustic version, which could've been easily included in this film. She showed that she can act. Chemistry between her and Bradley Cooper is palpable, unforced, totally natural and intertwined with some shadowy moments. Their love is bittersweet but never a cliche of a country song. They are two people fighting their insecurities with uncertain outcome. I also loved Sam Elliot's performance, simple but true to the point, Oscar please for best supporting actor. There's one particularly endearing moment between two brothers. Songs are heartfelt and the interpretation of them throughout the film gave me chills, apart from one over-the-top pop song. Near the end of the movie there was something so riveting that I couldn't help but start crying. The entire story touched and moved me deeply."

The music blew me away, and the fact that the two main actors were both really singing, a trait that I believe has been lost in recent years. I have not been this emotionally involved with a film since Saving Private Ryan, I left the theater feeling moved by the film. I hope that Bradley has several more of these up his sleeve."

"drew_cedric","9","4","7","18 November 2018"," A Movie Star Was Born
","For this to be Lady Gaga's first movie, she gave a Oscar winning performance. This movie locked me in from the very beginning and just kept on getting better."
"ElMaruecan82","9","4","7","17 November 2018"," ""Bad Romance"" made Lady Gaga a Pop Star, a Good Romance will make her a Hollywood Lady...
","""A Star is Born"" is a cinematic contradiction. It reveals a lot and yet doesn't reveal much.<br/><br/>There's a moment that caught my attention and doesn't feature any of the two lead actors. Ally's father (Andrew Dice Clay) tells his colleagues about people who had enough talent to compete with the likes of Sinatra (with Sinatra actually) but didn't have their big break or didn't believe in themselves enough. Point was: it's not enough to have what it gets, it also takes to believe in getting it.<br/><br/>Now, let's get back to my contradiction: Lady Gaga is an international star, as soon as she popped up in the pop scene, it was quite obvious she was the true heiress of Madonna and a star in her own right. It wasn't just about her talent but also her eccentric looks, her unique sense of fashion, and the fact that an ordinary-looking Italian girl-next-door could become a legitimate icon. So everyone thought she was the new Madonna but who would have thought one second she would also be the new Barbra Streisand?<br/><br/>What Lady Gaga delivers in ""A Star is Born"" is a performance that shines through its straight naturalness wrapped up in an artistic talent that blooms under the comforting direction of Bradley Cooper, the director and his character. That an established star would be able to get back to her roots and play a shy newcomer (with an uncanny resemblance to Sofia Coppola) slowly overcoming her insecurities is actually more impressive than any of your routine Oscar-bait mellow-dramas.<br/><br/>So Lady Gaga is Ally, a girl who's got the talent but has entrapped her motivation behind the bars of a nose complex (can't help but see the Streisand parallel). It takes the encounter with Jackson Maine -an aging rocker played by a handsomely bearded Bradley Cooper- to realize that she's got it after all. It's not just the talent but that she's got something to tell. It might sound corny but the film is actually immune against such criticism because one can't ignore the self-referential aspect.<br/><br/>Now let me open a parenthesis: I was looking forward to watching ""A Star is Born"" before that version was even in the talks, I wanted to watch the Judy Garland then the original and the 1976 remake. It ended up with Cooper's being the first version I saw. It's obvious that the titular star can't not-be played by a complete artist with a few personal demons to slay and Streisand and Garland must have a great deal of adversity in their lives. It is obvious why some confessions from Ally hit the right chord acting-wise.<br/><br/>Indeed, being Ally allows Lady Gaga to open up about her insecurities in the kind of bravura performance that goes deeper than making yourself uglier, it's about undressing your soul. Ally represents Stefani Germanotta before all the ""Roma-Romama"" and ""Ga-Ga Ou-lala"" started spreading all over the radios. I discovered her at the end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, Lady Gaga was a brand-name already. So yes, a star can be born that quickly because there's something about talent.<br/><br/>Hips don't lie, said Shakira, I would say talent is an even worse liar, which takes me back to the initial contradiction. The show reveals that Lady Gaga is not only musically gifted but can play her heart out and is worthy of more demanding roles than Madonna or BeyoncÃ©... but I wasn't surprised, it wasn't just her Golden Globe win that rang a bell but the fact that some people just got what it takes. And for that, even Bradley Cooper deserves some credit, that he recycles material and works on a timeless story doesn't mean he couldn't fail, he jeopardized his credibility on this directorial debut but proved to do half the job well by having the right cast.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga was perfect for the role and so was he as the lead role, the fading star Jackson Maine who discovers accidentally Ally singing Piaf in a shacked up bar and decides to take her as a protÃ©gÃ©e. It doesn't fool us one second that what go between these two persons are vibrations that venture in the realm of love rather than any dream of musical achievement, but it's through music that they find a way to seal their romance, through the future Oscar winner ""Shallow"", a song that I would have kept humming outside the theater if it wasn't for ""Bad Romance"" interfering with it.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""A Star is Born"" is that it works as much as a romance than a music film and combines these two aspects expertly. It's the kind of love story that doesn't need any artificial plot device, no cheating, no prison, only the ascension of a young woman and the descent into the hells of alcoholism of a man. The film opens with their romance and the rest is all about how one slowly rises above her demons while the other sinks into. It's a love story and the process of a separation going through scenes that are rather painful to watch and one so embarrassing I couldn't stare at the screen.<br/><br/>To think that I suspected Bradley Cooper would give himself a very grateful role but he's got perhaps an even more challenging one as he goes against his charming persona and is surprisingly good at conveying pathos without never being totally pathetic. For a directorial debut, the result is quite impressive and I envision at least four Oscar-nominations with a few technical nods such as Sound and Editing. I'm not sure Sam Elliott would get a nod but he was also a highlight in a film that full of them.<br/><br/>And beyond these Oscar considerations, even without watching the predecessors, ""A Star is Born"" does justice to the story, if not a masterpiece of originality, the performances are sincere and draw you into caring for every character and the songs memorable. What more could you ask for?"

","I am a 50 something male and took my wife and stepdaughter to see this. I wanted to see Bohemian Rhapsody, but the teenager got her way. And I am glad she did.
First with the negatives, skip this paragraph for spoilers.
This was a very powerful movie with really only one fault. In the transition of Gaga from a duet country/rock/folk singer to a Grammy winning new artist pop solo star with dancers was a bit of a misstep. The message of ""Telling ones story"" was lost in this process. As my step-daughter pointed out, any new pop star today lives in social media to drive their stardom. There was none of this. It would have been more complete is she stayed in the same lane of the same genre she was in with Cooper. It would have been more believable in an ""Adelle"" sort of way.
It might sound like nitpicking but if the performances were not so outstanding this would have stood out like a sore thumb probably a rating of 6 from me.<br/><br/>The acting by both were once in a decade performances. Each scene everyone was so drawn into the characters. I mean at the level of Streeps Sophie Choice and DeNiros Raging Bulls stay with you for a decade level. A 12 out of 10 to raise the overall review to a 9"

","I went to see this movie with someone special to me, thinking it was a documentary but realized, upon arrival, that it was a remake of the 1937 Classic movie, A Star is Born. Not another remake, I thought. Specifically, of a Classic movie that happened to have three remakes altogether, not including the Original. Bradley Cooper's directing was, nevertheless, good throughout the movie. The editing, however, felt a bit off, thus affecting the pacing of the film at times. There are also scenes where characters are literally showing up out of nowhere. For example, when Jackson shows up at Ally's house whilst she is sleeping. I do not know whether Bradley Cooper has had much involvement in the editing process so I cannot say whether it was his oversight or not. Let's not forget that it was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, mistakes are to be expected- He does, however, show great potential. I have to say that this remake was not bad. I sense that there is the potential for a few Oscar nominations here. The singing performance throughout the movie was nothing short of remarkable. Until this film, I didn't like much of Lady Gaga's music, except for one song. But, thankfully, because of someone who may be a Star in the making and is dear to my heart, I discovered how talented Lady Gaga truly is.<br/><br/>For Kristina."
"Troy_Campbell","9","4","7","10 November 2018"," A must watch.
","Remakes, reboots, re-imaginings, modern updates - whatever you want to call them, they've been around almost as early as movies themselves. In the last couple of decades they've attracted a bad reputation due to an increasing over-reliance by studios on letting brand recognition do the heavy lifting, quality be damned. Retelling this old-age tale for a new audience, first-time director Bradley Cooper has hit a home run. This is no thoughtless cash-in for the twitter generation. This is good ol' fashioned storytelling with intelligence and maturity. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a country-rock megastar with a drinking problem from hell. Sparks fly when he meets Ally (Lady Gaga), an inspiring singer who hasn't been able to catch a break. We already know Cooper is an extremely versatile and engaging actor (who's a bloody decent singer as it turns out), but Lady Gaga, in her first notable acting role not playing a version of her on-stage persona, is an absolute revelation here. Stripped of all the flare and over-the-top theatricality associated with her musical career, Gaga delivers a tour-de-force performance of raw emotion and soul-bearing, more than holding her own opposite experienced actors like Cooper and Sam Elliot (always gripping). Ambitiously shot in close-ups with a roaming camera, the concert sequences are suitably amazing. Ally's impromptu duet with Jackson in front of tens of thousands of fans is a contender for most powerful scene of the year. At times the drama veers into melodrama (perhaps even intentionally, this is a modern day rags-to-riches yarn after all), but there's so much goodwill generated throughout that those moments of heavy-handedness can easily be embraced. Knockout performances, a compelling story and a great soundtrack combine to make A Star is Born a must-watch."

Pleasantly surprised to report that it is one of the best films of 2018.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Jack (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) who are surprisingly thrown together. Jack is an aging rock and roll performer whilst Ally is a down trodden singer. The film is made by the performances of the two leads who are both outstanding. You feel very little empathy for characters in so many films nowadays. With Star is Born it as if you become the characters who go through a roller coaster of emotions during the movie. In addition to this many of the supporting characters are also very rounded and interesting. It also makes you realize why so many celebrities struggle with the demands of fame.<br/><br/>If you don't catch it at the cinema make sure you take a look when it hits the small screen."

I never expected it to be this great. 2 talents were discovered in the making of this movie.
Bradley Cooper not only can act so darn well but he also can sing beautifully. Lady Gaga is a well known singer and she also can act convincingly. I was not a Lady Gaga fan before this but I'm absolutely her fan now.
The scene that I love the most was after Ally's manager talked to Jackson on how he is an embarrassment to Ally and that he can bring her down. There Jackson lying in bed looking so sad, and when Ally joined him and said maybe he can join her on stage that night. That look on Jackson face, it's hurting me to see that sadness. I couldn't get it off my mind and this movie is so unbelievably feel so real."

","This year is a difficult one for my Oscar choices, because so many incredible movies were made this year already and there are still more to come, but what I really love about this remake of ""A Star is Born"" is that it stands on its own, in a complete and original way. It's heartfelt, it's funny, it's traumatic, it's real, it's what I would call, beautiful trauma. The original sound track is incredible and I love how Lady Gaga has stayed with what she calls, ""This girl"" - which she states with love in her 5'2 documentary about her life--saying she needs to stick with this side of her, because she is the hold (as in, not hiding her beautiful voice behind heavy tracks and beats, like she used to do), and yes, oh yes, she was right. She believed in herself and the world is her Oyster now. She has slowly but surely found confidence in her own vocal range and strength in her acting ability which we saw come to life since her Emmy win for her role in American Horror story. She is incredible and is definitely my pick for next years best female Oscar win. Bradley Cooper is also growing in depth as an all rounder in the entertainment industry. It's no easy feat debuting his directing skills at the same time he debuts his own singing skills (which blew my mind) and keeping in tune with his broken and soulful character in this movie as well. His character holds love and pain in such a harmonious way, which makes you want to reach out and help him, because you want him to clean up his act, you want him to get better, you want him to win, which makes it even worse as the movie goes on, knowing he is like a beautiful meteorite flying through the sky, which will inevitably find land and destroy everything it comes into contact with. A beautiful tragedy of the modern world. A movie to learn from. Music that won't be forgotten. Beautiful in every way. Definitely a few Academy nominations for Best Director, Best Actor and best musical/drama. Brads going to have it tough with Rami Malek who stats as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody in the Male Actor catagory, but since Rami isn't singing, who knows what might happen..."

","I just saw A Star is Born and enjoyed it very much. It is a remake of a few other movies by the same name but with some differences. Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper) is a middle-aged singer who meets the younger Ally (played by Lady Gaga) after she sings at a bar and he immediately notices her talent as a singer and songwriter. He asks her to perform with him at a concert, and they begin to collaborate musically and end up falling in love; however, as Ally's star is on the rise, Jackson's is fading as he increasingly struggles with his alcoholism.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is not only an incredible singer, her acting was very good and natural as well. And Bradley Cooper has an amazing voice, along with being a very talented actor. It is also a very impressive directorial debut for him. You could tell that they were both very much invested in their characters and the story itself and were both incredibly believable, and moreover they sound really great together. There was some very strong work by supporting actors as well, most of all Sam Elliot as Jackson's much older brother, Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's father and Dave Chapelle as Jackson's long-time friend. The script is smartly written, at times funny and other times heart-breaking. It is very moving without being cheesy, and it features some great music, namely the song ""Shallow"". It is sure to garner some Oscar nominations next year, and I highly recommend this movie."

"Benslie","10","4","7","4 November 2018"," Best movie of the year by far!
","First off, the acting in this movie. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had great chemistry in this film. Of course, everybody at this point knows that Cooper's a great actor, but not a lot of people know that Lady Gaga is a fantastic actress as well and it shows in this movie. She deserves to be nominated for -hell, she should win- an academy award. She came across so genuine and like a real person that you can relate to. In every scene, she stole it. Bradley Cooper just turned himself into Jackson. He took voice lessons to work on his singing and he learned to play guitar. Bradley Cooper also directed this movie. It's his first time and it doesn't show. His directing in this movie seemed so professional like Krasinski, and I hope he keeps directing. Now, this film is a musical, and the music in this film is fantastic. I love all the songs in this film. The lyrics and tone were both meaningful to what was happening in the movie. When a scene was sad the song would be sad along with it. The Cinematography in this film was also stunning. The lighting, like the music, helped set the tone of each scene. If it was going to be crazy the lighting was more intense but it was calm the lighting was calmer. The last thing I want to talk about is the realistic relationship between the two main characters. It doesn't show a constant happy couple but shows how couples go through ups and downs but stick together no matter what. In the end, ""A Star is Born"" is a great movie that you should check out."

","On the one hand, we have a brilliant actor who all of his life seems to have dreamed to direct and sing and who demonstrates that some people just do well whatever they're doing. And on the other, there's a great singer who seems to have forever wished to act. Or is it to be herself? Because there is so much authenticity in Gaga's character that I couldn't help but wonder if it's not the first time we're seeing the real her, unfolding, depleted of any mask. Also, there is so much happening in their eyes it seems that they're made for each other, displaying one of the most ravishing, if not the best chemistry in film history. Go see it and feel it, then play 'Shallow' at the top of the volume while thinking at the last time you felt alive."

","From the moment I heard the opening notes of Just Dance for the first time as a 15-year-old sitting in the back seat of her Taekwondo instructor's car on a trip to Burntisland, I fell in love with Lady Gaga. Her talent and shine upon this world left me in awe, and I had always hoped to see her make the transition to the Silver Screen. This movie is everything I had anticipated over the last 10 years and more. Every scene in this movie seems as though it came naturally to everyone involved, as if they were merely filming a day in the life of whoever is on screen at the time. With Mr. Cooper at the helm, it has become a clear contender for this year's Oscar nominations and deservedly so. The music has such passion in both lyrics and delivery, the story is compelling and emotional, and the cast could not have given a greater performance. Ms. Germanotta has succeeded where Madonna failed, by transitioning from global superstar to on-screen megastar. I like to be as honest and fair as possible when writing reviews, and I am desperately trying to recall if I found a single flaw with A Star Is Born. I did not."
"burlesonjesse5","6","4","7","30 October 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of A Star Is Born
","A famous, alcoholic country singer befriends an aspiring pop singer. They fall in love, perform on stage together, and eventually marry. There's a rock concert ambience feel going on here as well as a tainted romance. Oh and did I mention there's also an unrecognizable Andrew Dice Clay doing supporting work? That's the gist of 2018's A Star Is Born, a sun-drenched uber-biopic that clocks in at a dragged out 135 minutes.<br/><br/>Starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga as crooner Jackson Maine and muse Ally Campana, ""Star"" is a remake of a remake of a remake. Cooper channels his inner Kris Kristofferson while Gaga proves she can decently act and react (she's an even better singer though, trust me). As far as musical dramas go, ""Star"" ain't bad but it feels too much like a downer (don't let the blithe trailer fool you). To be honest, I'd rather smile a little while watching Almost Famous again.<br/><br/>Anyway, A Star Is Born is a kaleidoscope of pills, booze, rocking tunes, Solid Gold remnants, and show business fortitude. It's somber but not as heavy as I thought it would be because Cooper's Maine is a milder, pacifist drunk (unlike sleep-deprived Nicolas Cage via 1995's Leaving Las Vegas).<br/><br/>Oh I almost forgot, Bradley Cooper helms ""Star"" as well? His direction is claustrophobic yet largely canvassed at the same time. He loves his close-ups, his jittery camera movements, and his lighting technique which is very Last Waltz-esque. Coop also likes his widescreens too and his concert sequences are surprisingly deft for a rookie director.<br/><br/>What ultimately fails A Star Is Born, is its script by three writers (Cooper, Eric Roth, and Will Fetters). Outside of the live music, the searing guitar solos, and the cheering crowds, the film never quite takes off. It's like an earnest work of dramatic hooey, a slight of hand vanity project from Cooper, and a seen it before, rise and fall requiem. The actors spew improvised dialogue with conversations between a boozed-up rocker, his brother, his wife, and his wife's manager seeming repetitive as ever. Yup, it just goes on and on.<br/><br/>Based on other critic reviews and audiences going ""gaga"" with the box office take, the Academy might make ""Star"" its darling and give it some award nominations. I'm going to retort and saddle A Star Is Born with a mixed rating of two and a half ""stars""."

The second thing is guessing the category, and I bet you will go for all of them.<br/><br/>This movie is the fourth version of the same story, where each of the ways it has been told (each one of them) has something different that identifies itself: #1. The original version wasn't a musical, #2. Was something Over the Rainbow, with Judy Garland on it, #3. Felt like you were at Woodstock and rock and rolling and #4. It feels like a real story adapted to today's times.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper directs, produces, writes, acts, sings and performs. He is simply fantastic on his role as a singer who is going through a rough path. That is, until his path crosses with the one of Lady Gaga. Then, you forget about him and sorely focus on her. All your attention is drawn to her, because she is the movie. She is basically playing herself, and it is here, while you are watching this movie, that you truly realize what an amazing singer she is (even more if you are not a fan of her work) and also that she is not a bad actress. On the contrary, she can act, and if you think that as she is playing a singer role it's easy for her, go watch the fifth season of American Horror Story and check for yourself what she can really do in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Then (of course) there is the music. The forever actor in this kind of movies. Real, up to date music. It doesn't mind if you are not into country or pop music, you will definitely enjoy this movie and once you leave the theatre, you will go to get the movie's soundtrack as soon as possible.

"Vivkon","6","4","7","25 October 2018"," Screaming is/as Singing
","""Scream,"" as an explosively loud voice, is a part of the modern music industry. Just try listen to Lorde, Adele, Gaga. TV Talent Shows also admire the artists whose primary vocal attribute is a powerful vocal range (Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, Tessanne Chin). ""Scream"" was a typical feature of metal culture, but ""A Star is Born"" shows us how new artists can gain fame by ""screaming"" in pop music. The movie plugs in to this idea in several ways. One way is the brilliant casting choice of an artist and her lyrics with a strong voice and the ability to be vocally explosive. Another way is a dramatic line ending metaphorically with ""scream"" as feedback on the tragic events (substance abuse & suicide). From a directorial point, the movie had some dramatic ellipses which are never resolved. Throughout the movie, the sound department perfectly complements the mood and drama of the story. Lady Gaga (Stefani Germanotta) in the role of Ally never transcends her own established persona. She never creates a sovereign, unique character. However, for Bradley Cooper his character portrayal is a real breakout in his career as an actor. He has transformed himself visually on the screen, as well as vocally and psychologically. Cooper expresses this transformation amazingly. It is a great achievement for him. His character, Jack, fantastically portrays the dilemma which comes with fame and the easy access to illegal substances. The way the picture is presented it is difficult to tell whether Jack downfall is the result of his wife's enormous success or of his inability to control his alcoholic and drug excesses. Probably, Cooper's character would rather express a typical infirmity which some talented artist struggled with (Janis Joplin, Amy Winehouse and others)."

","It might have been easier for me to watch A Star is Born not watching the previous incarnations of the story, including the original 1937 film and the two musical adaptations AND the Bollywood adaptation, but honestly there's a ton of good here that I just feel like overall it's just a damn good movie, albeit over-hyped.<br/><br/>The acting is great all around, especially from the two leads. While I wouldn't call this Bradley Cooper's finest work, at least compared to performances like Silver Linings Playbook, it's still a solid performance all around. He matches the role of the aged and drunken rock star well, plus his voice sounds absolutely amazing backed by some fantastic country and Americana tunes. However Lady Gaga shines in this role. I'm not much of a fan of her music outside of a few tunes, plus I've heard from friends that she's not all that good of an actress from previous roles (and more specifically her Golden Globe win for American Horror Story), her first leading role here works really well. She's great in this! And while I'm not a huge fan of her singing style, I'm not going to deny that she can sing! Although whether or not she deserves an Oscar for this is certainly debatable (she will probably win because the Academy LOVE to give the Best Actress award to roles like her's *coughcoughGwynethPaltrowcough*)The rest of the supporting cast is great, from Andrew Dice Clay to Dave Chappelle to Anthony Ramos. However the real standout has to go to Sam Elliott, who absolutely kills it in this movie, and dare I say one of his best performances in a film!<br/><br/>So let's talk about the music. Largely co-written by Lukas Nelson, son of country legend Willie Nelson, along with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and including a ton of talented musicians behind the scene, ranging from the likes of Dave Cobbs, Jason Isbell, Mark Ronson, DJ White Shadow, Diane Warren, and (unfortunately) Julia Michaels, the music is some damn great country and Americana songs backed with some fantastic playing and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's great vocals. Standouts for me include Black Eyes, Shallow (which will win Best Original Song I guarantee it!), and Always Remember Us This Way. There are a few duds here, like Heal Me and Why Did You Do That?, which the R&B style doesn't work for Gaga and just felt awkward when she sings it. And the closing song I'll Never Love Again just reminded me of a song Whitney would have done for the Bodyguard (specifically I Have Nothing, and double specifically because when the song is performed in the movie like that scene was so obvious it took me out of the film) and it's just not that powerful unfortunately, just felt like a pale imitator.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie is that, while the story has been told before and the themes are not new, the film makes up for it with just interesting characters for our leads. We can relate and see what each character is going through and feel for their triumphs and their downfalls. The movie benefits not just from the performances, but also from Cooper as a director. It's his first time directing and for a debut it's pretty great! He chooses to adopt a more up close and personal, hand held approach at directing, getting a personal, intimate, and at times unflinching look at these characters lives. This movie is a lot like La La Land in that it might not be original, the effort and care there is with making the film more than makes up for the shortcomings.<br/><br/>Speaking of shortcomings, Bradley Cooper is no Damien Chazelle. In terms of visual blocking and film language, Cooper's approach can't help but feel basic at times. Now to be fair not all debut films from directors can be Reservoir Dogs or Eraserhead, and Cooper certainly shows a ton of promise too, but he falls into a lot of other actor-turned-directors when they make films and go for a safe approach to film-making. His directing style is a lot like how Ben Affleck directs a film, in that it's competent and certainly does capture the feeling of a scene well, but also pretty average too in terms of what's being communicated too. Although the movie doesn't help from the editing, which can be jumbled and at times pretty bad too.<br/><br/>The script also has some problems too. While the movie does feel fresh with it's themes, that's largely from the performances and the direction, and certainly not from the script. Whenever the movie addresses the dichotomy of pop and rock feels dated and sticks out like a sore thumb. I wouldn't say the intent of the film is to say that pop is a shallow genre, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Plus it's not like pop was always an artificial genre that lacks substance. I mean look at acts like the Beatles or Michael Jackson or Madonna or Prince, or even with the current generation like Lorde and Grimes and Beyonce and even Gaga with her last record Joanne, who are all making some truly excellent pop music with a ton of auteurism. I'm also not a fan of how the film ends, which I won't spoil but it felt so forced and really unnecessary other than to provide some cheap emotional manipulation (which is to be expected given co-screenwriters Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, Benjamin Button, and Extremely Loud) and more egregiously Will Fetters (Remember Me, the Lucky Ones, the Best of Me) it's something to expect).<br/><br/>I mean a more cynical me would write this movie off as cloying Oscarbait in the style of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves, but I'm not gonna lie there's a lot that works with this movie that makes me look pass the flaws. It's just a really great and likable film! Go see it if you are interested!"

","A star is born. Superb acting by lady gaga and Bradley cooper and even better (filmed live) music. A story about a rock star on the way down (cooper) and how he meets and falls in love with a musician very much on the way up (GaGa). Apparently a tearjerker and indeed some in the cinema were audibly emotional. But despite a very good boy meets girl first half of the film, it lost its way in the second half and neither my wife nor I felt remotely moved. Seen the washed up star done so many times before and much better (Crazy Heart comes to mind). Great music and performances but a flat film. 6 out of ten"
"mjpemboss","9","4","7","20 October 2018"," Great movie for those that love good acting and a good story (and music)
","Wow! I can't remember the last time I saw a movie at the cinema that I greatly enjoyed. Most of the time I feel that Hollywood movies nowadays are very ""Meh"". (To the lay person, this means so-so).
This movie moved me. Bradley Cooper was amazing. He should win Oscars for his performance and for directing. Never have I seen a better example of ""showing the audience and not telling them."" The plot was great. The editing was sharp and well done. The dialog was realistic and endearing. The characters were flawed and beautiful and engaging. The music was amazing as well!
Lady Gaga also deserves a mention. I don't know much about her acting chops but I've seen her in a few little things here and there (mainly American Horror Story) so I wasn't sure what to expect. She exceeded expectations. I could feel the audience fall in love with her.
There was a theme running through the movie about how the industry can ruin lives - drinking, drugs, changing who you are to succeed and make money. In a way, this movie is a cautionary tale.
I could almost give this movie a 10/10.
I feel like Lady Gagas' character didn't really have a satisfying arc. I've seen other reviews that imply it's because Bradley Cooper focused his directorial powers at his own character. But I don't think it is that. Without giving anything away, her character was trying to maintain her integrity but ended up compromising to succeed. This wasn't fully realised by Gaga and therefore not resolved. So it felt a little unfinished.
Still a great movie! Very entertaining."
"oskar-goodwille","5","4","7","20 October 2018"," Emotionally shallow and staganant filming
","Unable to let the movie simply breathe, the camera seems unable to film anything other than gaga and cooper. Sweeping shot of the audience, environment, location (save a wind farm) being absent leave you with no sense of space or atmosphere. A score that seems to have been written by seperate committees for lyrics and notes who refuse to work together. Sparingly bradley cooper saves this performance with some instances of genuine emotional vulnerability, while leaving gaga to sit with an uncompelling performance that only fails to capture any sense of empathy with her character. The score sat with the movie like oil on water leaving the audience emotionally signposted to a very cheap facsimile of feelings. While attempts to convey gravitas were made, the nascent entry of an actor into directorship, combined with an untrained popstar for a lead, made this movie sat like a lump in the throat that simply wouldn't retch up."
"dseisner","9","4","7","19 October 2018"," Amazing songs and performances - one disappointment
","This is Cooper's Magnum Opus. What he was able to achieve in his directorial debut is spectacular and enormous. Actor, singer, songwriter (GREAT songs), producer, AND director? That's intense for anybody. And he pulled it off. His acting is Oscar-winning-worthy. His voice is an exceptional talent, in my humble opinion. And he's writing songs that people have been asking to hear for a long time with something like ""Black Eyes"". I believe he will come home with minimum 5 Oscars, unless something else can stand in his way in the next 3 months. I can see him winning one or several Grammies as well. I don't know if he can quality for best new artist but he's certainly the best new one I've heard recently.<br/><br/>Similar can be said for Gaga, who's film debut was convincing and captivating. I believe she will also win an Oscar for best actress. But also her musical contribution to the movie was superb. Watching her open up her voice in ""Shallow"" with that vulnerability on her face, almost with a shock of what she's doing, continues to move me every day I hear it (daily since I've seen the movie). That moment still brings chills to me I'm not sure will ever stop.<br/><br/>Where I feel the movie fell short was the 3rd act. The story arch fell a bit on its face. Emotional, yes. But it lacked a resolution and a true triumph of Gaga. Many of the scenes were full of real shock and despair (the Grammy's scene, the apology scene in the rehab center)... but the movie lacked a certain satisfaction for me. It did not seem Ally learned anything. Sad, yes. A hero... not really.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story and did find it touching throughout the movie. However, the reason I rated it so highly is the music, the performances, and the accomplishments. My wife and I are still talking about this movie and the accomplishment of it by Cooper/Gaga, weeks later. I highly recommend everyone see it. Let the music move you."

","Never really got in to Lady Gaga thing, and wasn't expecting much from her. Oh was I wrong her performance is sublime. The chesmisty between her and Bradley Cooper is intense, electrifying and 100 percent believable. The direction is a little annoying at times, too long on holding an image in close up, but it's a minor irritant. The first 24 hours in their relationship is beautifully played out on the screen. It's raw and fresh.

"BlueFox94","8","4","7","19 October 2018"," Gaga & Cooper Bring the Grit & the Pipes in A Star Is Born
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)<br/><br/>""Hey."" ""What?"" ""I just wanted to take another look at you."" - Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga)<br/><br/>Potential spoilers below<br/><br/>A Star Is Born - the story of a crossroads romance between a fading and alcoholic male star and a woman whose stardom lies just around the corner. For Hollywood, these four words link the years 1937, 1954, and 1976. (Some would even include 1932 and 2011.) Now, thanks to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper (also writing, producing, and making his directorial debut), 2018 joins that list with vulnerable and raw energy.<br/><br/>The life of grizzled country rock star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) has begun to unravel. Despite the care of his much older brother and manager Bobby (Sam Elliot), Jackson's tinnitus is now affecting his playing ability, further hampered by severe alcoholism. Thirsty after yet another sold-out concert, Jackson stumbles into a drag bar. There, he discovers Ally (Lady Gaga), a struggling daytime waitress who moonlights as a bar singer, and becomes enraptured by her voice. Jackson soon convinces Ally to join him on tour to sing as well as contribute her own songs. As their romantic and artistic partnership blossoms, others rush to thrust Ally into stardom.<br/><br/>For Ally, fame and fortune might have to cost her the love of her life and the toxic habits he cannot overcome.<br/><br/>One trend I have noticed in each proper A Star Is Born version is how the actress, despite playing the rising starlet, edges out her male co-star in terms of fame. Fredric March's credits extend to three years before Janet Gaynor's start and he had already won a Best Actor Oscar (and would go on to win a second); Gaynor had won her Best Actress award at the 1st Oscars, had reigned as a box office queen, and would effectively retire from acting soon after the 1937 iteration returned her to the top. James Mason was more popular in his native Great Britain and his role in the 1954 musical numbered among his early substantial Hollywood parts; Judy Garland was seeking to bounce back from the end of her lucrative tenure at MGM that included The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis, and Easter Parade. Lastly, even the biggest Kris Kristofferson fan could not deny the mega-stardom of Barbra Streisand at the time of the 1976 rock musical's release.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga and Bradley have seen steady success in pop music and film acting, respectively, yet Gaga's medium has given her the higher profile. Thus, the two maintain the Star Is Born co-star trend of a more famous actress and a somewhat less famous actor. However, Gaga has since grown from the aggressive and radio-friendly The Fame, The Fame Monster, and Born This Way to the more polarizing and less radio-friendly Artpop, Joanne, and Cheek to Cheek, her throwback collaboration with Tony Bennett.<br/><br/>To counterbalance the diminishing top five hits as the 2010s continued, Gaga has ventured more into acting, including appearances in FX's American Horror Story (seasons 5 and 6). Gaga's artistic maturity, along with a slight focus on her unglamorous facial features, contribute to the naked and rebirth-like luminescence of her performance in A Star Is Born. Even as she evolves (or regresses) into someone similar to her real-life self from 2009, you believe and become inspired by Gaga as she takes the rough first steps to musical stardom, especially during the numbers ""Shallow"" and ""Always Remember Us This Way"".<br/><br/>The summer of 2009 that, if not ruled by the sounds of the Black Eyed Peas, was ruled by Lady Gaga, saw the release of The Hangover. The Golden Globe-winning comedy, which arguably defined 2009 along with box office behemoth Avatar, propelled Cooper and his several of his co-stars to heights of fame yet unattained. (Cooper and Hangover producer-director Todd Phillips reunite here as two of A Star Is Born's producers.) Cooper soon followed two disappointing Hangover sequels with appearances in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, and American Sniper (also as producer), earning him four Oscar nominations in three consecutive years.<br/><br/>2015 through 2017 were comparatively quiet for Cooper, though one can attribute that to his four-fold duties for A Star Is Born. Cooper labors to achieve Jackson Maine's rugged and tragic drunkenness without making it appear overwrought, though emphasizing the unpreventable tinnitus would have curbed the melodramatic touches of depicting alcoholism. Cooper diverts such potentially distracting passion into the kinetic direction of the musical performance scenes. The crosscutting between Jackson and his band playing ""Out of Time"" and ""Alibi"" and Ally and her friend Ramon (an underused Anthony Ramos) quitting their restaurant jobs and flying out to Jackson's gig is a standout segment. Outside these and the central relationship, I would not rush to nominate Cooper in Best Director over other 2018 efforts, including Christopher McQuarrie for Mission: Impossible - Fallout, but A Star Is Born serves as a fantastic directorial debut nevertheless.<br/><br/>In all likelihood, the populist factor of 2018's A Star Is Born might guarantee the movie a spot in the next Best Picture category. It continues the focus on musicians rather than actors that started with the 1976 rock musical, yet it scales back the excesses of post-Paramount Decision Old Hollywood in 1954 and of New Hollywood in 1976. The result is a grounded and updated reflection on the tug of war between fame, fortune, romance, and addiction. The story, though a fixture of Hollywood's long-held resistance to originality, always manages to reach a new generation.<br/><br/>Who knows? Perhaps sometime in the next two decades, I too will sit before the silver screen to review once again the latest version of A Star Is Born.<br/><br/>(Parental Note: A Star Is Born has been rated R by the MPAA ""for language throughout, some sexuality/nudity, and substance abuse"". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""strong language"" and ""drug misuse"", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""a suicide, implied premarital sexual activity, fleeting upper female nudity, occasional drug use, a couple of profanities, and frequent rough language."")<br/><br/>R.N.B."
"pranderson063095","9","4","7","19 October 2018"," Some Things are Hard to Get Past
","Because we are (unfortunately) familiar with some of the things Lady Gaga has done in her past, seeing her in this role was really difficult. Gaga is an exceptional singer and performer and in recent time has made an effort to be a bit more serious in those skills. As the film develops her natural expertise overcomes the effort to play a newbie on stage. But that just makes for us a more enjoyable time watching her sing and is soon forgotten.<br/><br/>Bradly Cooper is simply superb. He carries the role of Jackson precisely and so convincingly. If he can really play and sing that well it is amazing we haven't seen more of him doing so. Without a doubt, this time around was much better than the previous one with Babs and Kris Kristofferson. This time both sides of the characters roles - singing and acting - were exceptional.<br/><br/>Not normally subject to tear jerked endings, we fell victim this time.

","Dear Lady Gaga fans, I am with you. A Star is Born is a proof that Lady Gaga can do both acting and singing. Her acting is great, so natural, funny, full of meaning, and memorable. Bradley Copper is also fantastic. The main story of the movie is so simple, about how an ordinary singer girl named Ally finds her true love, coincidentally, a famous singer, then they build up an empire together, but the problem of the man is embarrassing Ally in her career. The scenes and plots are dramatic and natural, because all tended to create the love story. I really like the Director and Screenwriter idea to make Lady Gaga to be herself while acting and to replaced her own story to have role as Ally. I believe in every scenes she played, there contained also her entire true life; about how being in love, being in success, having international award, being famous, having trouble, then being sad, and being holding everything she believes to be happy after all. Just prepare your tissues to cry!"
"Plamen_Nenchev","10","4","7","13 October 2018"," A Doomed Love Story with an Incredible Score
","This is a movie where everything - plot, acting, characters and soundtrack - comes beautifully together in a whole that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Despite some choppy editing in the second half, the great acting, minutely measured plot and the sheer beauty and tragedy of the love story, combined with a score that somehow reflects what is happening on the screen to the letter, is bound to leave you with a ball in your throat when the credits roll.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is called 'A Star Is Born', it could have easily been named, and just as appropriately, 'A Star Goes Out'. The ascension of Gaga's character to stardom is a mirror reflection of Cooper's own spiralling descent into oblivion. Cooper seems to have landed the role of a lifetime, delivering a poignant and heart-breaking performance as a masculine, yet extremely vulnerable ageing country rock star.<br/><br/>By the time Ally comes into the picture, the only thing that can fill the hole in his soul and keep him together is an enormous amounts of booze and pills. Ally's advent will shake him out of his vegetative state, but will also give him something very dangerous - hope. The decline of his own career, the ascent of Ally's and his own battle with addiction will create such strong centrifugal forces that his already fragile mental stability will soon start flying apart at the seams.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga also delivers a good - perhaps not stellar, but good - performance the is most striking by its sheer contrast with her on-stage persona. Her vocal prowess is remarkable, the songs are a sure Academy Award contender and the chemistry with Cooper's character is electrifying.<br/><br/>But the guy who steals the show is Bradley Cooper. It takes nothing short of a battle with addiction of your very own to be able to give such a credible performance of someone who is as damaged and broken as Jackson. I am perplexed by the number of people who have been bashing him for being over-the-top. You are lucky to have not seen mental illness or alcoholism up close, otherwise you would not be moralising this way.<br/><br/>Despite an enormous success with audiences and to some extent with critics, I do not expect the movie to rake in any Academy Awards, except in the music categories. These days, you either have to act in an autobiography or turn yourself into a monster (like Charlize Theron) to even get a nod. In this connection, Lady Gaga might as well get a nomination - just because this is perhaps the first time we ever see her without make-up."

","A star is born
Directed and starring Bradly Cooper in duet with Lady Gaga form a magnetic couple with a great connection.
The most interesting point that Cooper put in the flim is the intimate touch in the musical numbers that I think is the most impressive of the film. The two protagonists are very well although after the hype that has been given to Lady Gaga, I think the role of Bradly Cooper seems better and more complex.
The conclusion is a film, which is a remake of a remake, which clearly seeks to reach the Oscars. I do not like much the direction that is not that bad, to be the first Cooper film has good ideas but abuses the short shots for all conversations removing the weight to important.

The close-ups to Gaga's eyes are just fabulous.<br/><br/>The co-stars were fabulous too, albeit in limited parts, have crusty veteran actor Sam Elliott who plays Cooper's brother, who has worked with him over the years, their differences are clear, but they love each other & Andrew Dice Clay (as Gaga's father) who provides a performance you've never seen out of him, way different from his stand up foul mouth ways, and he's even funny & at times, rather dramatic too.<br/><br/>Lastly, Dave Chapelle did a nice job too as Cooper's longtime friend.<br/><br/>There's no doubt in my mind that this film will win numerous Academy Awards in the Spring of 2019, and if Gaga doesn't win the female best actor in a lead role, they better conduct a thorough investigation.<br/><br/>If you have a great appreciation for Lady Gaga and the gift of her brilliance as a musician & vocalist, you will simply be overwhelmed, call me overly sentimental, but my eyes were glossy several times, and once I was completely drawn to tears.<br/><br/>I Love Love Love her.....<br/><br/>If you never understood or believed in Gaga, you will have a new found appreciation for her, I promise.<br/><br/>Go and see the movie, and do not be late, get your popcorn & be in your seat for every minute of it.... It's two hours & 15 minutes & never once boring.<br/><br/>~Georgio Sette"

"mrdmp-21311","1","7","15","20 January 2019"," Mediocre at best
","I do not understand the hype around this film. It has an uneventful storyline with a horrendous soundtrack.
Bradley Cooper, who I usually like as an actor, mumbles through the entire movie with many of his lines inaudible. Gaga's acting is c grade at best and their chemistry as a couple isn't believable at all.
It was shot in such a way I wasn't convinced that Ally actually rose to fame, one minute she's releasing a song, the next she's some super star and receiving a Grammy. The whole thing was messy.
Over hyped film that does not deserve the buzz it's getting. It certainly is not deserving of Oscar talk!"
"Theroux721","1","7","15","11 November 2018"," Cooper's directorial debut is a flop.
","Unlikable one-dimensional characters, slurring dialogue, scarce yet forced punching drama...and oh yeah, let's add (spoilers!) a dog, drag queens, and SNL into the mix too. Because, you know, it's the modern version. And here I thought we watched movies to escape reality, not look at it in disgust more.<br/><br/>The whole movie was just eating, booze, drugs, or singing fake songs, with constant cringy gurgly dialogue all throughout. It's like the culmination of a 12 year old cluelessly creating a movie in their head.<br/><br/>Maybe I just don't like Bradley Cooper? He spent half the movie inebriated (or was it pretend rather?), and the other half passed out. What a marvelous character.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure: Lady Gaga is way less ugly without makeup. But we always knew that."
"brooklyn-59663","1","7","15","8 November 2018"," Flashy cast and waste of cash who don't deliver on the promised exceptional performances
","Due to the raving reviews and the hype of this movie, I had expected much more. I had partly liked the previous versions of this movie, however struggled to be captivated by this one.<br/><br/>Whilst Lady Gaga is a good actress, she isn't a great one. I watched this movie hoping to fall in love with the cast and story telling, having seen the previous adaptions, I really thought this would bring it into the 21st century and be an instant classic yet when I watched it I wondered where all the Oscar worthy content was.<br/><br/>This movie was a massive let down, perhaps my expectations were too high for this or perhaps I found the tropes underwhelming and the performances much more mediocre than anticipated or deemed by reviewers.<br/><br/>I honestly wish I had saved myself the money of going and waited until it was available on tv, that way I could have turned it over once I realised how utterly tripe it is. There were times when my friends and I felt like leaving yet stayed waiting for the superb performances that we were promised. We also stayed for our friend who is a major Lady Gaga fan, who was too blinded by her obsession to see the many faults with this movie, though she did admit once over that there were moments when she felt her eyes begin to wander.<br/><br/>I don't understand how the reviews are so good."

","Who would ever give this movie a good review? A tired mess of a 4th remake and I cannot believe anyone outside of a delusional little monster would ever think this was any sort of Oscar contender. If that lifeless leech of the gay community even gets a nomination, much less win anything, I will lose my faith in humanity. If this were a short that featured 1 or 2 songs, maybe it would be sort of watchable. Her lack of ability cannot a feature film, especially one running over 2 hours, make. Boring, bland, lifeless, confusing, and ugly, and that's just she who thought she could walk in Gaynor/Garland/Streisand's shoes? In the shadows it stays."
"aciessi","6","7","15","6 October 2018"," Shining Stars
","Life has a funny way of making things happen. Such is the case with movies I was convinced I would never see. I was once convinced A Star is Born 2018 would be that instance. Firstly, I never saw the original 1930's classic and the two remakes that followed afterwards. Secondly, when the trailer surfaced, it reeked of Hollywood self-aggrandizement and schmaltz. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a musical romantic romp. Look at how beautiful they are compared to us slobs! Cinema lovers are sick of this game. They want something new. So imagine my surprise that the reviews turned up well above the 90% fresh rating on RT. Some of the most trusted names in the business even hailed it as one of the year's best. Could it be that Hollywood has found a way to make tired formulas relevant and exciting again? After all, I am many things, but a betting man I am not. I like to admit when I'm wrong. Cooper and Co. brought me into the reclining seats last night. Kudos to him for that.<br/><br/>A Star is Born is, above all else, an aesthetically pleasing motion picture. It's shiny and beautiful without purposely doing so. It's sweet and sentimental without being condescending. It's sad, without becoming sappy. It was everything it needed to be to work, and It's a great thing that it does work. Bradley Cooper is a natural charm and practically loses himself as country music icon Jackson Maine. A fine study in method acting. I'm pleased to tell you that beyond looking like Cooper (at least after not shaving for a month), he's the farthest thing from a role we would expect to see him in. Jackson is a demon riddled, suffering alcoholic and we believe him. His muse, Ally, the Star of the picture is played by Lady Gaga herself. Or perhaps, we ought to refer to her in respect to her true person, Stafani Germanotta. A Star is truly Born as a pop superstar is taken apart from her wacky costumes, and returning to her roots as your average, beautiful Italian-American girl trying all she can to make it by and hopefully make it big. She is a dream come true and the precise reason to see this thing if you want to. To the unassuming eye, you couldn't tell that this is a role tailor made for Mama Monster. Does she properly fill the shoes of Streisand and Garland? You know, I think she does and I think she can be as big as the two of them put together.<br/><br/>But granted these two very positive things, I wasn't knocked out of my socks at any given point of the film. It's beyond anything remotely grueling about a superstar celebrity vehicle, but don't expect a life-changing experience that leaves you talking about it for days after. This is just a satisfying, if not unforgettable, musical journey."
"conn-57441","8","7","15","27 September 2018"," Rocket raccoon the musical!
","I have to admit when I first heard about this film I thought it wasn't going to be my taste, but then I saw the trailer and it gave me goosebumps. We managed to get into a preview screening and the goosebumps didn't go away. Bradley cooper ( in his directorial debut and lead) has done an amazing job here, with his character Jackson Swaine being a declining, washed out star who believes all his answers are at the bottom of the bottle, what could come across as an annoying selfish character however is flipped on its head as Cooper gives his role real heart and depth to the point where I just wanted to help him. Then you have the other lead..... Lady Gaga. Many may see her being picked for this film as extra star material, but fair play to her she can act. Not only does she nail her on stage performances but she also brings vulnerability to a character rising through stardom, and without going into spoiler terroirty all I will say is she nailed the final scene. Why not a perfect score then you may wonder? Well personally I felt the middle act dragged just a little, with it being more of a slow burner and not adding much drama. I also felt that certain scenes seemed to be edited in an odd way, almost as if they were cut short then skipped over, but again that might just be me. Before I finish this review though I have to at least mention the songs, while I still feel 'shallow' (the song from the trailer) being the most memorable, the rest of the track list really is something, I can see the album being a chart topper for sure."
"sondrolproductions","10","12","30","4 October 2018"," A MUST SEE
","A Star is Born was a lot different than I anticipated, much darker in fact. But, Bradley Cooper hits a GRAND SLAM with his debut in directing! This movie does something that most films don't do anymore and that is feel emotions. Not just laughter, or agony, or anger, but a combination of all of them! This isn't just another movie in 2018... This is THE MOVIE OF 2018!"

","It was autumn of 2002. I was 14 and it was my first year in High school. I wasn't that excited about my new adventure but it was just the start. One month into high school, I am lying in my moms bed watching tv wearing only my underwear. She comes in the room and she looks at me with a weird face on and she goes : Have you seen your belly, on side of it is bigger than the other. She insisted to go to the doctor the next day. Naturally I wanted to avoid classes and I went with her knowing that I wouldn't go back to school for the day after the doctor. On my way in I cracked one of my finest black humor jokes, "" don't worry doc, Its probably cancer"". She put me in bed and started checking my belly. Her face suddenly froze. She called my mother in and told her to take me to the hospital right away. For the next two days I was in an out in every doctors office in the building and did every test existed. In some point I realized that I havent seen my parents for a while and got out of bed to look for my mother. I turned on the next corridor and she was sitting on the stairs crying her eyes out. We took off and went to the childrens hospital in the capital. I had painful surgery the next day and they started me with chemotherapy three days later. Months went by, full of pain and difficulties. In the end everything went well and I got out of the hospital safe and sound. Until tonight I thought that was the most painful experience in my life. After this movie, cancer feels great."

"Prismark10","6","12","31","1 October 2018"," Another star is born
","This is the fourth version of A Star is Born. It is an adult orientated blue collar musical drama.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga plays Ally, a waitress who sings part time in a drag bar. She writes her own songs but realises she will never get that big break because of her looks, especially a prominent nose.<br/><br/>One night country rocker Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) walks in looking for a drink after a concert. Maine is still famous touring with his past hits.<br/><br/>Maine is enchanted by Ally. He invites her to see him in concert where he asks her to sing one of her songs with him onstage that goes viral. They have a whirlwind romance which perks up Maine's life.<br/><br/>For Ally, the future is bright as she is pursued by record executives. For Maine, it is a life of booze, drugs and tinnitus.<br/><br/>As Ally achieves success, Maine's life spirals downwards. It is a question of whether Maine is hindering Ally's success with the drugs and booze.<br/><br/>Cooper stars, directs, produces, sings and co-wrote the screenplay. For him it is a labour of love. <br/><br/>What caught my attention was that it was a working class drama. The film does not show the glamorous side of LA. It is a blue collar look of Ally's life and family.<br/><br/>Even Maine lives a humdrum life. Probably why he need drugs and booze to keep him going.<br/><br/>The romance might had been a bit too quick but it needed to be make the film tick. It is overlong and some of the songs are not that memorable. Lady Gaga gives a good performance but she is not stretched by playing a singer. Although it is interesting to see her face without her normal heavy makeup. It is also brave for her to show some nudity even a glimpse of going full frontal.<br/><br/>The film is muddled regarding Maine's backstory, his relationship with his much older brother and some of the dialogue was muffled. However I found the first half better when the focus is on Maine rather than the more pop oriented second half when it shifts to Ally."

Most of the movie was just Bradley drinking or taking drugs, which was interrupted by 3 songs sang over and over again. It's not even that those songs were really naive with simple lyrics but hearing the same three songs over and over again was too much.<br/><br/>Gaga can sing for sure, but still no, boring, boring, boring.<br/><br/>Save yourself 2+ hours and do something else instead, really anything will be more entertaining than watching this movie."

Its about the time you put in. Bradley Cooper, who I already liked as an actor, reached a new bar with this film for me. It showed me he is willing to go above and beyond for a role like the greats. Lady Gaga absolutely amazed me throughout the entire film. I believe the two of them were born to star together. Absolutely breathtaking the way that their chemistry fused so well. I was entertainwd througgout the entire movie. It has been two days since I saw it and when I listen to the songs and think of certain parts I reflect on the entire movie again. It brings a smile to my face to even talk about the movie. The music was great and it didnt feel like ayone was lip syncing too. Music felt live and like the on screen was the performance given.

"MOscarbradley","3","7","16","12 October 2018"," Mr Cooper's vanity project
","Do we really need another version of ""A Star is Born""? You may ask did we ever need any of the previous versions but if nothing else they gave us Gaynor and March and Garland and Mason which, in anybody's book, is more than enough to be getting on with. Then, of course, there was that version with Miss Streisand who by then was already a star so the film was really a showcase for her talents. It helped that her co-star was Kris Kristofferson; his weaknesses showed up her strengths and it also had a very good song score.<br/><br/>Now we have a new version, even if not much has changed, and one that was presumably meant to launch a certain Lady Gaga on the big screen and, to be honest, as a movie it's pretty terrible but this is ""A Star is Born"" with a difference, the difference being that the film's male lead, Bradley Cooper, also directed the picture and for once this is a showcase, not for the leading lady, but for the leading man. Seldom have I seen a more shameless vanity project.<br/><br/>Here Miss Gaga, (sorry, Lady Gaga), is almost relegated to a supporting role as Mr Cooper hogs the screen. Admittedly he is very good and probably knows it. While all the talk is on Miss Gaga, (sorry, Lady Gaga), winning the Oscar I think Mr Cooper has always had his eye on making it a double. Will Miss, sorry Lady, Gaga win the Oscar? Personally I can't see it. I know shamelessly audience-pleasing performances have won countless times in the past but Lady, (ah, I got it at last), Gaga has nothing going for her but a damn good singing voice and a few good tunes.<br/><br/>As, in the other versions, our leading lady is given the final number, (in this case next year's Oscar-winning Best Song), and she performs it to the manor born but even here Mr Cooper, (dead at this stage of the film), has to get a look in with some flashbacks to earlier, happier times. Really sir, have you no shame!"

","Gaga always puts in a world-class performance and this is no exception. The movie is a bit long and depressing, but the acting is phenomenal. She sings and gets Grammy after Grammy. She stars in her first major tv role and wins a Golden Globe, and now stars in her first major film and deserves an Oscar. Even if you don't enjoy her style, you cant deny she is iconic and helped define an entire generation. She is the rightful queen of sound and stage. She is also very bright, sincere and caring, and doesn't let anyone stand in her way. Such an amazing person and inspiration."

","Let me preface this by stating that I was really excited to see this film. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper and was stoked after seeing the trailer. The casting of Lady Gaga intrigued me, and I wondered if they could pull of what 8 Mile had accomplished. To my disappointment, they could not. <br/><br/>The film certainly had some brilliant moments. Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, as expected, and I thoroughly enjoyed a couple of their duets. I even cried a few times at the Cooper's depiction of the broken troubadour. But the film never closed the sale that they spent over two and a half hours pitching me. <br/><br/>In the end, there were just too many cliches. While I admire their attempt to go big with the story, it came off less Crazy Heart and more cautionary tale, brought to you by Live Nation. I couldn't help myself considering the irony that the industry this film is warning us about is the one that was selling us this film. <br/><br/>I wish they would've let the film be smaller. I wish it had been a little less calculated and, like the Gaga's new look and the trailer seemed to promise, honest."

I had never seen any of the other versions of this story that have come out over the years.<br/><br/>It takes place in a world where extremely mediocre music is hugely successful. Oh wait, that's our world, the one we live in now. So this film gets points for that. Except it thinks much of its music is really good. There are 2 pretty good songs in it, one being ""Shallow."" It has some good lyrics. I was never sure though, if we were supposed to enjoy Maine's songs he didn't sing with Ally. Or if they were just there because he was a rock singer and needed to sing songs. Someone with songs of that quality would have difficulty filling bars, let alone a stadium full of music fans. Same goes for Ally's ""pop"" songs, which are worse. Complete garbage in fact.<br/><br/>But enough complaining about the music. Let's talk about the performances by the lead actors. Lady Gaga is a really talented actress and musician. She manages to shrink her own persona just enough for this, and I think that's why she received so much praise for this performance. Wow, we all say, see how she can transform herself into just a regular gal with dreams to chase? What a trooper. But I guess that's what most of the acting corps in Hollywood must do, right? Becoming the everywoman or everyman becomes that much more difficult as the cash starts piling up. Cynicism anyone?<br/><br/>Then there's Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine. It's a fine performance, which he mumbles his way through. I couldn't help but recall Jeff Bridge's performance in True Grit, and suspect he drew inspiration from it.<br/><br/>My favorite work here is that of Sam Elliott. He does his best work here.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way the entire film is about alcoholism and is pretty much the story of a rock singer's nosedive into deeper alcohol and drug addiction, to the point where he hangs himself in his garage. As I said, I had not seen any other version of A Star Is Born, so maybe I should have known it was coming. But the film does not seem to be setting this up, for most of it anyway. It went hard after the tears and certainly got it from most audience members.<br/><br/>Instead of making the film a tragedy of a life wasted and Jack's death, The tragedy should have been that Ally's dreams of being an artist were crushed by her ascent into superstardom. If she was really being true to herself, with the dancing and stupid lyrics, wasting the talent within her, then why should I care what befalls her? What makes her stand apart from any other sellout in showbiz? We are left to wonder, would Jack have been better off without her coming into his life? Addiction is a disease, so probably not. Right? The film should offer a crystal clear answer to this. It thinks it does, but really does not."
"cjwilkinson-81808","3","3","5","10 July 2019"," Although it's a remake, it feels very dated
","The positives:
Good to see a movie about music where the actors look like they're actually playing their instruments.<br/><br/>The negatives:
The central characters, and therefore the whole movie that centres around them, are both pretty boring.
He's a tedious drunk, she's a solid performer with virtually no back story of any interest at all. She bafflingly sticks by him through thick and thin, and when she does finally lose it at the end of this 2 hour plus bore fest, it's almost impossible to care, assuming you can still muster the effort to pay attention. I think he might have died - by this point concentration on the film was impossible and disengagement was total.<br/><br/>I guess making movies as long as this with so little depth was ok when the original was made, but now it just seems like it belongs in a different era - and not in a good way."
"suehempel-68140","2","3","5","30 June 2019"," a major disapointment for 2019
","A major disappointment. A very slow movie and the actors tried to be like the 1970s movie to no avail. I turned it off half way through. I think Lady Gaga should stick with singing and not acting. I also thought Shallow would have being sung towards the end of the movie, as it is a great song. The movie just didn't captivate me at all. I rather watch a good Aussie DVD."
"NatKaminska","5","3","5","25 June 2019"," Overrated. First part of the movie is good, but then it turns into boring mess. Gaga sings great, but she plays herself & Cooper is good alcoholic, but overall bland.
","This is the one movie of the year, in case of which, I really wonder, how it has been recognized as such a masterpiece by almost everyone, but really it is just one more average remake of very well - known Hollywood story, cliché love story and familiar tale about glamour and pain of fame. For me it is nothing special, I prefer movies that bring something new to the art of cinema, from the technical side or from the plot/storytelling side, this film brings nothing new.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga plays Ally, a very musically talented girl, who works in a restaurant and occasionally, in the evenings, gives performances at a local bar. She dreams of being a real, recording artist/singer, but like so many artistic souls, she has complexes and little faith in herself, she doesn't have enough strength to face brutality and falsity of the show business. And then one night, she meets Jack (Cooper) - famous and accomplished singer& artist, who is on the way down, destroyed by fame, his demons and alcoholism. He is watching her performance, is delighted with her talent and from that moment things go fast - they fall in love with each other, Jack helps Ally become a real star etc. However, of course, only then, the real problems start to emerge. Jack cannot defeat his demons, the finale is tragic, but can be seen from miles away, the most cliché ending in the world, calculated for cheap emotions.<br/><br/>Yes, the first part of the movie : all Ally's way to the top and a thriving romance is a well made story, and Gaga& Cooper have an undeniable chemistry, but that's absolutely no masterpiece.<br/><br/>Problems of this film begin in the second part. The screenplay very quickly and superficially jumps to Ally's success and although we see Jack struggling with addiction and childhood demons, his motives are still presented very superficially and unconvincingly, the whole drama/conflict is rather ''talked'' about instead of shown, and this is screenwriting mistake 101. I was so bored with the second part of the movie, that I found myself thinking about something completely different during it.<br/><br/>Cooper is good alcoholic, but so were 10000 actors in 100 different movies before him, the rest of his role is bland. There was even one really bad moment from Cooper, when Jack started crying, talking about attempted suicide - it was so fake and over the top, really bad acting.<br/><br/>The same goes with Sam Elliott, I genuinely don't understand what the fuss was about and how he was supposed to win Oscar for best supporting role. He has maybe 5 scenes in the whole movie and he's not doing anything innovative or amazing acting- wise in them.<br/><br/>Music, I admit, is very good and I knew from the start that ''Shallow'' will win Oscar for best song. Gaga sings great and imo is better than Cooper with her acting, but she still just plays herself, nothing special. I was hoping Glenn Close will finally win her Oscar for best lead actress, she was fantastic in ''The Wife'', but it didn't happen.<br/><br/>I feel like a lot of people are exaggerating in the assessment of ''Star is born'', because how they feel about music, great music makes them emotional ( the same case with ''Bohemian Rhapsody''), but we are supposed to rate the movie/acting not music and singing.<br/><br/>Generally a very overrated movie, it doesn't deserve more than 5."
"leonardo-lara","4","3","5","25 May 2019"," Overated
","I dont understand why everyone made such a fuzz about this movie, the acting is very poor, the voice Bradley Cooper makes, wtf?! The characters are awful, music bad"
"WhoMadeYouGod","6","3","5","11 May 2019"," Self love from Cooper & Gaga
","I'm not even sure this deserves the 6 I've given it, but I'm trying not to be too harsh.<br/><br/>This film smacked of two 'stars' completely in love with themselves. Apparently Gaga didn't wear makeup for her role (shock horror) - clearly deserving of an Oscar in that case.
Coopers put on husky voice was ridiculous but overall he was ok.
The singing of course was good as Gaga really does have an amazing voice. Cooper was v impressive too.<br/><br/>It really did however feel like a completely self serving film for the both of them. Even seeing Gaga's face when she didn't win the Oscar proved that. Over hyped over acted and over rated."

","Bradley Cooper was just too similar to Kris Kristofferson in that role. Lady Gaga is a NYC girl just like Barbra Streisand. The music is obviously more contemporary, but gee whiz... many of us older people have seen the movie already. I kind of wonder why it was necessary to make this remake.

Don't waste your time with this lame, cheesy film."
"jecamisovic","6","3","5","4 March 2019"," Overrated
","I have to give credits to music in this movie, Bradley suppressing perfect vocals and good acting. He really convinced me in his akcent. I give credits to Lady Gaga's singing but she didn't ""buy"" me with her acting. I didn't see chemistry between them that all others were speaking about.
Movie is watchable but not for a score more than 6.
It could be a nice love movie if their love could win over his depression. But I didn't see love at all"
"blahmiley","4","3","5","1 March 2019"," What?!
","I'm sorry but what did I just watch? I didn't see this in theaters and I saw it in Redbox a couple times before I decided to rent it. In my mind I thought that it wasn't going to be anything I haven't already seen, a tragic love story. I like Lady Gaga, and Bradley Cooper, and this was a decent cast or actors. And if I watched it on mute I'd say it was shot well. It's the story and the characters that ruin this story.
Jack in a pill popping alcoholic with NO REDEEMING QUALITIES!! Ally is a singer/song writer who can't get into the industry because she's been told she doesn't have the right look (I get that, the industry is messed up. They want you to change this, fix that, lose weight, dye your hair, change who you are, and be like someone else etc)<br/><br/>Ally meets a drunk Jack one night and he tells her she's beautiful and tells her she's talented (and apparently that's enough for her to throw herself in his arms and run into the sunset.)
Ally sings a snippet of something she came up with on the fly in her head about the feeling she gets from Jack (tell me something boy..) and the next night Jack gets her to come to his show, invites her on stage, and they sing Shallow as if there was a scene I missed where they spent the night putting the song one paper together..<br/><br/>*the crowd goes wild*<br/><br/>Everyone loves it and Ally goes on tour with him singing this one song Shallow. Then Ally becomes an INSTANT STAR!
The song Shallow is what? A country song that has its foot in the door of pop? Jack is a country artist?<br/><br/>Ally gets signed and next thing you know she's making some kind of pop album and dying her hair orange and now she's doing dance rehearsals with back up dancers? By the end of this movie I still don't know what kind of artist she is.. first country, then pop princess, then soulful like Whitney Houston at the end.. I don't get it.<br/><br/>She marries Jack for reasons I don't understand.. because he believed in her? Because he said she was beautiful? Because he said she was talented? He just stays drunk the whole time!<br/><br/>(I get it. Addiction is a desease. Addicts need love too. But you got to have redeeming qualities. You have to want to be a better person. You have to want to fight and strive to be better for yourself and to be a better person for someone else. Was Jack that? No.)<br/><br/>Ally wins a Grammy for best new artist for music that sounded just mediocre and Jack stumbles on stage wasted talking nonsense and pisses himself in her spotlight.. WHAT?! Is there no security in this place?! He stumbles and sits on the steps for a minute and you don't think no one would go up and be like ""let me help you back to your seat, man."" Of course not. AND SHE STAYS WITH HIM! What is so amazing about this man?!<br/><br/>*this already contains spoilers so I'm just going to go there*<br/><br/>Ally goes on tour and Jack is supposed to be there to perform Shallow with her, but he has gotten drunk and hung himself in their garage. (This was by far the best shot in the movie, not that we didn't see it coming, but it was executed extremely well.) THE END.<br/><br/>They say the movie is coming back to theaters for one week with, get this, TWELVE additional minutes which will undoubtedly save this sinking ship but whatever. If you read this I thank you :)"

"Sophoclaw","1","3","5","27 February 2019"," AN INSULT TO THE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISH LANGUAGE
","I am aware that this is an appealing film for the most; other viewers with reason criticized the structure and mostly the plot of the film. I got confused, but now it is some time I have been in the USA, perhaps things have changed since the last time for the better. I saw this film hoping that it was going to be a clarifying experience. I have not seen the first two versions, but I saw the third with Streisand and Kristofferson and I thought it was great at the time, so I wanted to give this one a shot and compare mostly for the sake of the art of filming. You know like you have seen different versions of certain iconic themes in painting or hearing different versions of let's say the 5th of Beethoven or the Four Seasons of Vivaldi and you find interesting to appreciate the qualities of each of them, while some have certain faults or virtues in certain passages is often theme of discussion with other enthusiasts. While I find this version interesting is mostly because I wanted to find out what was wrong with it. There was something that bothered me and it was certainly not the story because in principle it was the same story as all the other versions, so after seeing it several times, eureka! I found that the script is wrong because it is repetitive, boring and full with clichés that unfortunately all in all give a negative result. I have nothing against the use of vulgarity in drama because that's what we usually do isn't it? At least that's what this film is trying desperately to convey at least among country, rock and pop musicians, and I mean desperately because of the constant use of the F word. I mean I have nothing against the use of the word in drama, but when in a sentence with let's say 20 words, 5 are the F word; that causes some kind of a degenerative effect in the language because it's misleading the real meaning of the plot. My conclusion, the version with Streisand and Kristofferson is still the best."
"peter-alexandris","3","3","5","25 February 2019"," I wanted to like it
","I am a huge fan of Gaga and so I finally got around to watching and dont get me wrong she was actually really good but the story felt incohesive. Some characters were never really introduced and I didnt understand a word that Bradley mumbled. I wish I had subtitles on cause it was hard to follow."
"lavatch","Null","3","5","20 February 2019"," Jackson Maine is a Pitiful Creature
","Of the four film versions of ""A Star is Born,"" this Cooper-Gaga version is the bottom feeder. One notch above is the Streisand-Kristofferson film at #3. The #2 version is the March-Gaynor black-and-white film. And the sublime Judy Garland version wins the sweepstakes at #1. For this new version, problems abound in the acting, directing, and music.<br/><br/>The film was not successful in the rise-and-fall structure built around the two singers. While Miss Gaga was successful in portraying the meteoric rise to stardom of Ally, the character of Jackson Maine essentially started at rock bottom and fell into greater depravity as the film progressed. This was a pitiful creature with no backbone, and his treatment of Ally was meaner than the Norman Maine in the three other film versions. In those films, the Norman Maine character is at least likeable, and the audience roots for him to overcome his alcoholism. In Bradley Cooper's interpretation of Maine, he never seemed to want to resolve his troubled relationship with his father. In his rehab treatment, he even fails to keep his journal and bring it to the support group.<br/><br/>In the film's direction, Cooper's work was also substandard. The pacing of the film was uneven with too many slow stretches. There were occasional lapses in dialogue overlap and timing in delivery of lines. The camera work included too many close-ups and awkward compositional choices, often appearing like a made-for-television project, as opposed to a big-budget feature film.<br/><br/>Above all, for a film musical, the score was not exciting and the songs tended to blend together in a single, limited musical style. Cooper was not convincing as a famous country-and-western star, and the music all too predictable. In the Judy Garland version, the songs evolved organically out of character interactions, such as delightful improvised number at home where Garland's character Vicky Lester sings to Norman about her day at the studio, using household objects as props for her routine. Even the Streisand-Kristofferson film had a decent score.<br/><br/>All in all, this fourth version of ""A Star is Born"" was a major disappointment. The sluggish pace, lackluster performances, and amateurish sound track all added up to a major flop. The Judy Garland version, as brilliantly directed by George Cukor, stands tall as one of the great film musicals ever produced."
"SweetWilliam63","6","3","5","20 February 2019"," Ga Ga Land
","Well, here I am again not getting it. I didn't hate this movie. It was okay. Did I miss something? Yes, Lady Gaga can act. (It is an impressive debut performance.) And Bradley Cooper can sing. But is there anything 'oscar' worthy in this film? I went through this same problem with 'La La Land'. I guess I just don't like musicals. I found the music to be innocuous, Bradley Cooper's voice annoying and Sam Elliott as ""big brother"" too much of a stretch for me. I liked the dog though. Not to mention that this premise has been done and done to death at least five times. (And they weren't very good pictures either.) And like 'La La Land' I felt that all the hype about the movie was a bit manufactured. And another thing, didn't people get tired of Cooper's character ""mansplaining"" everything to Ga Ga's character? I thought it was 2018? Look, I didn't love 'Black Panther' either. Maybe, I'm just getting cynical in my oldish age. I have been talking back to the TV lately."

"vegeta-julian","5","3","5","19 December 2018"," Rockstar cliche meets Mary Sue
","I don't get the hype, watching this I felt like this is a Disney movie for grown ups. The storyline is foreseeable and the characters miss depth.
The male lead Jack is a cliche of a Rockstar: Rough voice, alcohol and drug abuse problems, doesn't care about boundaries of socially acceptable behaviour. The female lead Ally on the other hand is a typical Mary Sue. She succeeds in everything she does at the first try, is a natural talent in everything she tries and gets no setbacks whatsoever.
The only interesting thing in this movie is the dynamics of these two opposites leading to a foreseeable catastrophe and to wait for it to happen. That's it.<br/><br/>The kind of storytelling is also very old: The underappreciated damsel in distress who just by chance meets the prince to make everything right for her. This and of course all the singing parts strengthen the feeling of watching some kind of very old, cliched Disney movie.
The acting is solid and the cinematography nice, I just don't get the hype and praise."

"cinemawithcj","2","3","5","1 December 2018"," A Star is Born - Cinema with CJ Review
","A Star is Born (2018) is a movie I don't get but the rest of film criticism seems to. Apparently it's a revelation, Cooper's directorial debut is apparently stellar with a deep, rich story, apparently it's Oscar worthy. Pfft.<br/><br/>The thing about A Star is Born is that even ignoring it's a remake, it feels like a million movies you've seen and doesn't do anything new, and it doesn't really do it better.<br/><br/>It has pacing issues, it feels hollow, it feels like Cooper still wants that Best Actor Oscar he still doesn't deserve just yet, and for that...You're finding me checking my watch an hour in and dreading the hour left to go. The good I can pull from the movie is that Lady Gaga is great. And it's a 2 hour 15 movie that shows me how well she can sing. Unfortunately, I already know Lady Gaga can sing, so it's a bit of an unnecessary production.<br/><br/>The editing is a bit janky, and there are seriously only two good shots in the film. There's a lack of scale to a lot of the performances, and there's a lack of a sense of time and rise/fall of the characters.<br/><br/>A Star is Born fails at improving the structure of even the lighter versions of this genre. Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping and Josie and the Pussycats (a legit underwatched underrated 2001 flick) manages to handle its characters, pacing and comprehension better.<br/><br/>Those two examples also have better music. It will undeniably get Original Song Oscar buzz, but it doesn't deserve it. The big trailer song isn't even the key. It's the gateway to the rest of the film, followed by lacklustre country and pop that is bolstered only by vocals.<br/><br/>A Star is Born is a lot of things but none of them include anything really good. I couldn't care less about Cooper's fall. Because I've seen it before, and I've seen it better.<br/><br/>I'd much rather see more of the star being born, dying, and coming full circle than Cooper making it about him and betraying the good story that's actually there. It's overrated, it'll be overseen, and potentially over-rewarded. Which is a shame."

This movie is so good on so many levels, and I know many will champion the performances, which is justified... but this is truly great movie making.
The script is so wonderfully nuanced, I can't wait to see it again to comb through all the beautiful detail. Bradly Cooper has obviously listened well to some of the great directors he's worked with, because he now is one himself. Every scene is so well thought out.
The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard in a film, I couldn't wait to buy it after I walked out of the film.
I'm sure the cast will be garnered with award after award for this, and it's well deserved.. but it's the lasting images they've created that will truly stand up over time.

"LilyMuti","10","3","5","22 October 2018"," All-time favorite movie
","I haven't been writing movie reviews for ages but I can't be not writing a review for this one. I've seen this movie three times so far and I still haven't move on. I've been reading behind the scene stories and watching the stars' interview footage. That's how good the movie is.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the three earlier versions of the movie, and I might, but I should say that the movie doesn't lose its originality. The fact that Cooper is incorporating many details of his and Gaga's personal aspects in life make the movie easier to relate to and very down-to-earth; and making the story very understandable. Cooper is a great actor and Gaga is a great singer; I didn't know until the first time seeing this movie that Gaga isn't just an EDM singer. She sings beautifully while Bradley acts convincingly and they both fulfill each other in their roles; you can feel the chemistry outpouring from both of them. Some stories were simplified yet it didn't reduce the audience engagement with their struggle, and after three times watching, everything just makes better sense on why one thing happened after another.<br/><br/>Overall to prevent me from bursting spoilers while gushing you should see the movie yourself, download the OST album (including the dialogue clips) afterwards and sing along. All of the movie's original songs stick with me since the first time I heard it and seem to stay with me until who knows when."

","The original 1937 version with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March was good, the 1954 Judy Garland and James Mason was great, and the 1976 version with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson was worth watching, then came this next incarnation in the classic story, the first leading role for the ""PokerFace"" pop star, and the BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated directorial debut for actor Bradley Cooper. Basically Jackson Maine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bradley Cooper) is a famous country singer privately battling alcoholism and drug addiction, he plays a concert in California (""Black Eyes""). His main support is Bobby (Oscar nominated Sam Elliott), his manager and significantly older half-brother. After the show, Jackson goes into a bar, that happens to full of drag performers, there he witnesses a performance by Ally (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Lady Gaga), a waitress and singer-songwriter (""La Vie en rose""). Jackson is amazed by her talent, they spend the night talking, where Ally discloses to him the troubles she has faced in pursuing a professional music career. Jackson invites Ally to his next stage performance, she initially refuses, but she does attend and, with Jackson's encouragement, sings on stage with him (""Shallow""), they receive a standing ovation from the audience. Jackson invites Ally to go on tour with him, and they slowly begin to form a romantic relationship (""Maybe It's Time""), they begin to initiate sex one night, but Jackson passes out drunk. In Arizona, Ally and Jackson visit the ranch where Jackson grew up and where his father is buried, but Jackson is angered after discovering Bobby sold the land, Jackson punches Bobby, who subsequently quits as his manager. While on tour (""Always Remember Us This Way"") Ally meets record producer Rez (Rafi Gavron), who offers her a contract, Jackson is visibly bothered by this, but supports her decision. Rez wants Ally to turn from country music and towards pop (""Heal Me""). Jackson misses one of her performances, after passing out drunk in public, he recovers with the help of his friend George ""Noodles"" Stone (Dave Chappelle), and later makes up with Ally. Afterwards, Jackson proposes to Ally with a ring made from a loop of guitar string, and they are married that same day. While Ally is performing on Saturday Night Live (""Why Did You Do That?""), Bobby reconciles with Jackson. Later, Ally is ecstatic hearing that she has been nominated for a Grammy Award, but she and Jackson fight after he drunkenly voices his disapproval of Ally's new image and music. At the Grammys, Jackson is intoxicated but just about manages to perform in a tribute to Roy Orbison, and Ally wins the Best New Artist award. Ally goes on stage to receive her award and starts her acceptance speech, Jackson follows her, he wets himself and passes out. Ally's father Lorenzo (Andrew Dice Clay) berates Jackson and Ally helps him sober up, shortly thereafter Jackson joins a drug rehabilitation program. Jackson recovers in rehab, where he discloses to his counsellor that he attempted suicide as a teenager, later he tearfully apologises to Ally for his behaviour, and returns home. Ally wishes to bring Jackson to perform with her on the European leg of her tour, when Rez refuses to allow this, she cancels the remainder of the tour, so she can care for Jackson. Rez later confronts Jackson, informing him of Ally's decision to cancel her tour and accusing him of holding Ally back. That evening, Ally lies to Jackson, and tells him that the label has cancelled her tour, so she can focus on her second album. Jackson promises that he will come to her concert that night, but after Ally leaves, he commits suicide, hanging himself in his garage. Ally becomes inconsolable after Jackson's death, Bobby visits her, he explains to her that Jackson's death was his own fault and not hers. Ally takes a song that Jackson had written but never performed and decides to sing it at a tribute concert, where she introduces herself as Ally Maine (""I'll Never Love Again""). Also starring Anthony Ramos as Ramon, Alec Baldwin, Ron Rifkin as Carl, The Terminal's Barry Shabaka Henley as Little Feet, Michael D. Roberts as Matty, Michael J. Harney as Wolfie, Rebecca Field as Gail, Heroes' Greg Grunberg as Phil (Jack's Driver), D.J. 'Shangela' Pierce as Drag Bar Emcee, Drena De Niro (Robert's daughter) as Paulette Stone, Eddie Griffin as Pastor and Bruno's Luenell as Cashier. Lady Gaga is a superb singer and acting as the aspiring singer who dreams of stardom she is also terrific, Cooper is also great as the hard-drinking country and western crooner who finds his own career dwindling, together they are a convincing loving but troubled couple. This version is closest to the 1976 version, with the story being about a young woman rising to fame and fortune as a singer (not an actress), the love story and chemistry is convincing, the songs and singing voices from the leads are fantastic, and the emotional stuff all works well, it is a splendid musical romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""Shallow"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Sound Mixing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Music, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","A Star Is Born tells the story of aspiring singer Ally(Lady Gaga) & famous rock/country singer Jack(Bradley Cooper). Jack has full confidence in Ally's singing prowess. However, his addiction to alcohol might hinder Ally's promising singing career. <br/><br/>A Star Is Born is a masterpiece. It is right up there with the other recent romance/drama/musical, La La Land(2016). Bradley Cooper has outdone himself in his directorial debut, both in front of & behind the camera. The songs co-written by Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper & others are unforgettable. My personal favorite is 'Shallow' sung by Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper. Lady Gaga excels in her big screen debut, as Ally. Bradley Cooper has given us the best performance of his career, as Jack. Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga share this raw & electrifying chemistry, that is the highlight of the film. Sam Elliott is spectacular as Bobby. Andrew Dice Clay is brilliant as Lorenzo. Rafi Gavron is outstanding as Rez Gavron. Anthony Ramos is great as Ramon. The supporting cast is good. A Star Is Born is a must watch for romantic musical fans & Bradley Cooper fans. Go, believe in love all over again!"
"mayhem-54206","6","3","5","15 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper stuns, and that's It.
","I give it ip to Gaga for taking on such an ambitious role as a non-actor (apart from her role on AHS, which I feel is more of an extension of some of the caricatures she has created for herself). Unfortunately, when she and Bradley Cooper are together (and of course they have many scenes together), it is obvious who the actor in this duo really is. She has stage presence, which comes through in the film's concert scenes, but otherwise doesn't fit. One can tell that they have genuine chemistry, but that is not enough to fill in the relationship development that should have occurred during the first third of this film. I disagree with the reviewers who have stated that the film runs long. I found that I kept thinking, ""Oh, we're already to this part?"" The relationship is taken for granted with no development whatsoever. Scene 1: They meet. Scene 2: They are already madly in love and on their way. I'm oversimplifying, but the lack of development in this area really took a toll on this film given that the relationship is essentially what the entire story is about. Good directorial debut by Cooper, and he does an amazing job with the role. He makes it look as though he's been singing, songwriting, and rocking the guitar his entire life, not merely just the months before filming. (I want to hear him sing more, in fact, but only if it can be in that gravelly Arizona twang he pulled off so well.)
Still and all, the script is so thin it cannot be overlooked. Sam Elliott raises this to 6 stars."
"cardsrock","10","3","5","15 October 2018"," An emotionally affecting ride
","The on-screen chemistry between Cooper and Gaga carries this film into the upper echelon of 2018. You can feel a genuine connection between the two stars and it makes this raw story about fame and addiction all the more compelling. The songs are terrific and Cooper's soulful direction keeps you caught up in this dramatic tale. A star truly is born in Lady Gaga as she shows she has tremendous acting chops and a commanding screen presence. This story may have been told many times before, but it still has quite a lot to say."

","I was very excited to see the new A Star Is Born remake when I first heard that Lady Gaga was going to be in it. She and Bradley Cooper have amazing chemistry. This is a great story about the fall of one star and the rise of another. Her voice in the songs gave me chills and made me feel so emotional. Especially I'll Never Love Again. (the Oscar winner for best song this year in my opinion) She was a great choice for the role of Ally. It was almost like watching Gaga's own story on screen, rising to be a big star. Her acting is just as exceptional as her singing. Bradley is very good. Unlike anything he has ever done. You actually forget that it is him playing the part in the movie. It's as if his character Jackson Maine is a real person that we are watching on screen. And his direction was very good as well. Impressive. 
 I have seen some negative reviews by trolls on here who have no life. They just live on being negative jerks with no feelings who like to put things down. I guess it makes them happy to be the trolls they are. Pathetic. They were probably written by Marvel fans.
If this movie doesn't get multiple award nominations, I'll be very surprised. It is funny, touching, emotional and heartbreaking. Be sure to bring tissue with you when you go to see it. It will make you cry. Can't wait to see Bradley and Gaga on the red carpet."

"thebricks","1","19","58","7 October 2018"," Lady Gaga is the ugly duckling in a movie full of great performances
","Just an absolutely terrible movie. Only positive is just about everyone's acting other than Lady Gaga's. She was awful. She wasn't even convincing as a pop star, which I found to be totally crazy. I really have to admit, whoever her music producers were did a really great job of disguising the fact that she can't sing with the elaborate get-ups and wacky songs in real life. I think the movie would have been dramatically improved by casting someone else in her part., either an actress or another pop star. Her rough, trashy Jersey attitude just came through in every scene and it made the character incredibly unlikable. She lacked chemistry with Bradley Cooper. <br/><br/>Jackson Maine was a compelling character by himself. It's Bradley Cooper's best role yet. I just didn't like the story arc of the film and what happened at the end. It was dumb. The majority of the audience that is working class is not going to find the character sympathetic or believable. Here is this guy, a country legend who has to be worth hundreds of millions, and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? Not happening, sorry. His career may have been ending, but come on, he can quit tomorrow and sit on an estate in the islands for the rest of his life; the rest of us can't. Cry me a river.<br/><br/>Also, when did being a drunk ever ruin a country star's career? If anything, I've felt it makes them more popular!<br/><br/>This movie needed a lot of work, unfortunately. I think Taylor Swift or Katy Perry would have been a much better fit, and just more compatible with Cooper. This was just a mess and I can't recommend it. The last hour was totally unnecessary and dragged on. I felt this was a ""woe is me"" piece for entertainment stars, but the rest of us won't relate or care, and why should we?"

"rgkarim","9","10","27","5 October 2018"," A New Face For A New Age: Musical Remake Is Born!
","Robbie K with the latest review on another holiday remake, this one hoping to bring the emotional punch that drama lovers well... love. Tonight two acting/singing icons are ready to lead the way, with plenty of reviews already praising the two in making this movie come to life. Is it worth the hype, or have we been tricked by another Hollywood stunt? Robbie K here to help guide your viewing pleasures, so let's get started on my review of: <br/><br/>Movie: A Star Is Born (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
 Bradley Cooper
Writers:
 Eric Roth (screenplay by), Bradley Cooper (screenplay by) 
Stars:
 Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott <br/><br/><br/><br/>LIKES: <br/><br/>The Acting: Hands down, the two leading characters have amazing chemistry together. Gaga's mature optimism but realistic grounding craft a strong character ready to brave the storm of drama to come. She brings the joy and energy to the film to help you get through the dark components of this film. Bradley Cooper on the other reprises his role of the sultry, depressed like, hero, who is easy on the eyes of the females in my audience and brings a sort of romanticism charm as well. Together, the duo tango in an amazing, dynamic dance of emotion that so many will grip on to. <br/><br/>Decent Pace: Another prime example of a drama being heartfelt, but also not crawling like so many of these movies do. The first hour was over in an instant, and the second act, while not as fast, managed to keep a good run as they maneuvered through all the quirks. It led to my interest being kept for the movie and able to handle the predictable plot. <br/><br/>The Story: The tale from the original is mostly there in a modernized form, reskinning the tale to have much more sex appeal than the original. Although not quite the same setting, the story still comes out strong, crammed to bursting with plenty of life aspects and lessons to hopefully resonate with the audience's journey. It's got a realistic pulse to it, which should charm many of the intended group, and keeps you enraptured as you live their lives through the screen. <br/><br/>The Music: By far, the biggest and best component of this film for me was the music. Like all my fellow reviewers, the magic of this motion picture score is the heart and soul of the characters' feelings. These poetic displays of artistry fill much of the screen time, some in the concert fashion, others as the fuel for a montage, it brings the full-on bite and drives home the emotion of this film. As an additional bonus, you'll get a mixture of styles though it is limited to country or pop, but still a little variety is better than none right?<br/><br/>DISLIKES: <br/><br/>Same Country Song: While not too overplayed, Cooper's contributions to the music fest were not the most dynamic, choosing to play the same song four times and adding little with each replay. True, I'm not a big fan of country, but in regards to soundtracks, I might try to pull a mamma mia and sample the music to boost soundtrack sales. <br/><br/>A Few Slow Parts: Scraping the bottom of the barrel for dislikes, there are a few slow parts that made me tired just watching. These moments were often prelude to another montage to buy some time, certainly a good trick to get you prepped, but maybe not the best in terms of pacing. <br/><br/>The Few Unnecessary Shots: While much of the movie is spot on and necessary for the story, there are those moments that are merely for show to get things hot. A Star Is Born had a few scenes that were meant to add to the story, but were grazed by as sort of a footnote to not be forgotten. Sure it works with the new paint job this modernized version brought, and it had a few people hot under the collar, but for this guy, it just added fluff I didn't need for the story. <br/><br/>Predictable: There are a few surprises to be thrown in, but for the most part this movie isn't too surprising or twist filled like I like to see. Not much I can say here, but don't expect too much deviation from the tale. <br/><br/>The Okayish Character Development: I'm not saying that this is weak by any means, but I'm saying compared to the original, I feel the story/character component is not quite as strong as the classic. The new face of this story is all about the sex appeal and the music and while they did this fantastically, I feel that there was more potential to dive into these characters. Key tensions are there, and you have enough of the background story to get the gist, but I still think the art of storytelling holds the strongest in the ways of old. <br/><br/>
The VERDICT: <br/><br/> Did a Star is Born live up to the hype that reviewers and commercials built up? The answer is yes for the most part. The acting and music are perfect representations of this dynamic love story, capable of wooing you TGIT drama lovers and modern-day romanticists. Still, I think I like the original from what I remember and feel that the cool new look will appeal to the modern-day audiences more than anything else. Still, I had a good time with this movie and was very pleased at how much I liked the movie given my doubts from the trailers. So I would say this is the film for this weekend to check out, and have fun with the soundtrack if you so decide to do it. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Drama/Music/Romance: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0"

","A virtually unrecognisable remake of an old 1950s classic, A STAR IS BORN proves to be a vehicle for trendy modern-day singer Lady Gaga and director/actor Bradley Cooper. It's a typical rags-to-riches story about a talented young woman who rises to become a popular singer, but Gaga's role turns out to be something of a distraction as this turns out to be all about Cooper. Unfortunately he's playing one of the sleaziest and most unpleasant characters of his whole career, a possessive drunk whose presence alone makes for uncomfortable viewing. As such, the whole film was spoilt for me, despite regular energetic musical interludes."

","Such a good beginning, no I mean it- the first 1 hour was so cool. I was diving deep into the atmosphere. But then things started to get ugly. To begin with the characters, we have two people who doesn't seem to change or develop/or regres for that matter. The male character seems to have more layers but still lacks struggle. The female is so 2 dimensional that she even looks heartless. I'm using strong words here because we never actually see her actively caring about her relationship. All she does is singing.
Other problem is the conflict - by 1:30 I was wondering how they're going to end the movie. Nothing seemed to move into this direction. No problems were solved, nor characters changed. And then 2:00 Tolstoy threw his Anna under the train with no reason to do it other than a need of finale.
Good songs, but far too many far too often.
What I lacked most was connection with the characters, they seemed cold and distant and the only connective tissue were the songs.
Better next time Bradly"

","Watching a twenty-first century version of ""A Star is Born"" is a strange experience. On the one hand, the film is well-made, with star-director-screenwriter Bradley Cooper delivering a solid performance (even if it sometimes comes across as an impersonation of Kris Kristofferson's performance in the 1976 version), while the dialogue and camera work are consistently strong. In addition, Lady Gaga makes for an intriguing leading lady in her first major Hollywood role, and it's obvious that she's taking the role very seriously. However, by the time the movie's second half rolls around, things get choppy: There appears to be scenes missing from the narrative, resulting in a half-realized dynamic between Cooper and onscreen brother Sam Elliot that often feels jarring, while Gaga's progression from unknown performer to major pop star is glossed over. The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga seems to have dissipated by the second half as well, which nullifies the emotional impact required for the film to work as a cohesive whole. The music is good if unremarkable for the most part, although the onscreen duo's performance of ""Shallow"" could peel the paint off the walls, making you wish there were more numbers like it. Ultimately it's not that the movie is bad, it's that it could have - and should have been - much better than merely okay."
"NBates1","5","4","8","7 January 2019"," The most overrated movie in a long time
","Yes, Gaga is a good singer, yes her performance is fine, but the amount of hype surrounding this movie is unfathomable. It is the FOURTH adaptation of this movie, so nothing that special about it. I would have loved Bradley Cooper's performance if I could understand a single word he was saying; he mumbled his sentences in a very annoying and pretentious way.
Gaga is fine but looks plastic. Her performance is in no way deserving of any award wins, in my humble opinion. The way she sang 'La Vie en Rose' was downright embarrassing. The plot was also somewhat predictable. Cooper's suicide scene was not done very well and the shaky camera moments were distracting.
That being said, the overall acting was good, and Sam Elliot is a good actor often overlooked. The songs were quite enjoyable; that is the area where Gaga truly shines. Some of the scenes were touching, etc.
Overall, predictable, overrated movie with some good moments."

As someone who works in the music industry, I have to say, this movie really does capture a lot of what ""life on the road"" is. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job on this film. Both he and Lady Gaga did a superb job in portraying their characters and their story. This is also probably the first movie soundtrack that I intend to purchase, as every single song was excellently written and produced. I have to say, Bradley Cooper, I am a fan. I can't wait to see what he brings out next."
"DKosty123","8","4","8","7 November 2018"," An Excellent Remake With A Powerhouse Sound Track
","When I went to this, I had seen the Garland version and the Streisand Version. I pretty much knew the plot to expect, and with a few twists got what I expected. Jon Peters is only listed as a producer on this because he owned rights to certain parts of the concept from the Streisand version.
What surprised me is how the chemistry worked here. Now, I have a real life example of this chemistry that to me this film brought in.<br/><br/>Many years ago, I went to the longest live concert I ever attended. For over 3 hours I heard Kris Kristopherson and Rita Cooledge on that stage when the 2 of them were deeply emotionally involved with one another. As I recall, Kris did the first hour, Rita did the second hour, and then for over an hour the 2 of them worked together performing an amazing concert.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of that concert because it kind of presents the same kind of chemistry between Cooper as Jackson Main and Lady GaGa as Ally. It works well. I understand that Cooper did consider a different ending for this movie. I wish they had done it though Lady GaGa's finale is every bit as powerful as Garland, and more powerful than Streisand. Really it is not fair to compare these in this manner, but the point is this film is really Lady GaGa's tour deforce. She is fantastic in this musically based role. Her acting is fine too.<br/><br/>There is one relief on this one versus the Streisand version, this one concentrates on Ally's (GaGa's) nose. The Jon Peters/ Streisand focus was on Barbara's posterior. This shows more taste.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's first effort directing is good and does not detract from his acting role in front of the cameras. I am impressed with the cast and crew support. I hope when the DVD comes out for this one, that maybe they did film the alternate ending I have read about. The original story is powerful, but a look at the other idea for an ending is worth a look.<br/><br/>The ending of this one is really a tribute to Garland as it is very much the same as the 1950's version."

"brefane","5","4","8","26 October 2018"," So So Star!
","A reasonably entertaining, underwhelming and under-imaginative 4th version of the material with 2 decent, if one-note, lead performances, but little else to recommend. The film lacks atmosphere, supporting characters of consequence, and characters who you really care for. The songs are a mixed bag and we get no real sense of either stars relationship to the outside world and/or their audience; we don't really see what makes them a star. His inevitable decline and her meteoric rise are expected, but her acceptance of a ""cute"" marriage proposal just after she gave him an ultimatum is unpersuasive. The conflict is tiresome and repetitive and the end is not in the least bit moving. Though not repellent like the 1976 version with Barbra Strident, it's just as unmemorable. Cooper's direction is competent and a few scenes click, but it's overlong and over rated and the second half really drags."

I really didn't think much more than that. Needless to say, I never considered what would actually happen in the movie. I'll leave it there.

","For me, what makes an amazing movie is when its on your mind long after you've watched it. A Star is Born is an incredibly well written, directed, acted movie. It's clear to see that Cooper and Gaga have chemistry both on the stage and on set. What makes this movie a classic other than it's timeless story is it's soundtrack. The key ingredient which separates a good from a great movie is the soundtrack and A Star is Born's is one of the best I've ever experienced. Despite me liking Lady Gaga I never knew her voice was that good. But Bradley Cooper is the biggest surprise. His voice was so good I thought they must have edited it with someone else's. Amazing.<br/><br/>Gaga and Cooper were destined to make this movie. One of the best movies I've seen in years that's for sure and one that I will revisit many times in future."
"jg_1977","8","4","8","12 October 2018"," A touching and entertaining film
","After seeing A Star Is Born, one thing is for certain, the names ""Lady Gaga"" and ""Bradley Cooper"" will be mentioned a few times at the 2019 Academy Awards. Although it's still early in the awards season, it seems quite likely that Cooper will snag a nomination for best director and best actor, both of which are well deserved. Whereas Lady Gaga is almost guaranteed to win for best original song and is a front runner for best actress. Those three categories, acting, directing, and original song, are where this movie really shines. The chemistry between Gaga and Cooper is undeniable and they both clearly pulled out all the stops, as every word they say and emotion they convey seems genuine. The directing however is what truly stood out to me, and considering this is Cooper's directorial debut it's all the more impressive. In particular, the concert scenes blew me away with how authentic and visceral they felt. As for the songs of the film, I would be absolutely shocked if one of them doesn't win an Oscar. They are not only moving and beautiful to listen to, but actually add layers to the storytelling and enhance Gaga and Cooper's performances. From what I've read, Gaga wrote and produced most of the songs, in addition to performing many of them in the film. All of these elements blend together masterfully to create an experience that is somehow both heartbreaking and feel-good, making it a true crowd-pleaser. However, the one place that I felt this film lacked was in the writing. Since this is a retelling of a classic tale, I wasn't expecting anything surprising in terms of the story beats, but I was a bit disappointed in some of the dialogue and especially the pacing. The first half of the movie takes place over the span of a few days, which does wonders for the character work of Cooper and Gaga, but then forces the rest of the story to be crammed into its second half. Although this is by no means a deal breaker for the movie, its pacing is noticeably off. Additionally, some of the dialogue seemed a bit clunky to me. Whether it was forcing in exposition, or just resorting to somewhat sappy lines, a lot of what I heard just hit the ear wrong. Despite those few gripes, I quite enjoyed this movie and will most certainly be listening to the soundtrack over the next few months. If you can, absolutely go see A Star Is Born!"
"ambermbain","10","4","8","10 October 2018"," This will stick with me for a lifetime.
","I went into this movie ready to expect a ride. What I didn't expect (because I haven't seen the original/remakes) was the contrast to my own life. So my emotions were thrown for a loop. 
My husband is a recovering drug addict, and the way they portrayed addiction, it's incline and decline, was so true and honest. And I fully believe ONLY an addict could have made this movie as good as it was. 
I was soooo sad that it ended in Jack's suicide - I was really hoping for redemption. <br/><br/>Lady Gaga was impeccable and would've stolen the show, if the two weren't so unbelievably perfect as an onscreen couple. <br/><br/>The way that Cooper adopted Sam Elliot's talking voice should win him an Oscar, alone. <br/><br/>I'll be shocked if this film doesn't sweep award season."
"me-hoseini09","9","4","8","10 October 2018"," Stunning directing and acting from people you wouldn't think
","I went to see this film in Salt Lake City without knowing Lady Gaga plays a role in it, as I like to know nothing about what I'm about to see. When the movie started I noticed the resemblance but refused to believe it (Heck, we never see her without makeup). That was a professional critically prominent performance and could not be from a singer. I took that stance until the midst of the movie when I was doubtful enough to verify online it was indeed her. And WOW! she is brilliant, entitled to claim awards, able to compete experienced actresses, and obviously not just a pretty face but full of talents.
I have not seen the original Star is born, but I know the movie is very similar to Lady Gaga's life story, though not the same. I hate to spoil the details, I just mention that a romantic relation sparks when Jack, another famous signer (played by Bradley Cooper) saw Alley (Lady Gaga) in a trans bar and then push her to perform on the big stage. The movie, with a wonderful pace, shows how Alley grow and grasp opportunities on the way to become a star, while Jack hopelessly wreck all what he has and eventually destroy himself. However, they maintain their love throughout this and present a realistic touchable persuasive romantic relationship that does not bore you in this 140 minute marathon. It also ends in a romantic tragedy that brought tears to eyes of everyone (I deny crying).
Bradley Cooper presents one of his best performances, probably because he got to direct himself! He is calm and confident, and yet vulnerable and weak-kneed. And hats off to this directing and screen writing! Characters are patiently developed and well-defined. A challenging romance along with a sophisticated yet cruel relation between Jack and his father is masterfully illustrated. All of this in a coherent mixture of drama and music is presented to you and regardless of how demanding and stern audience you are, it will stun you, Guaranteed!
Don't miss this movie as it will definitely win many nominations in the coming festivals."

But as Ally's career starts to soar, Jackson's starts to plummet. <br/><br/>It is a heartbreaking, heartfelt, and deep story about love, fame, and how dangerous addiction can truly be. Bradley Cooper gives it 110% with his best performance I've seen, you can feel what his character is going through throughout the film. But I'm not done there, his directing ability is something to witness, I still can't believe he directed it. Lady Gaga will for sure be nominated for Best Actress come award season, and might even win. There is one scene in particular that should alone get her nominated, and had me snifflin'. <br/><br/>The Music is absolutely fantastic.

","""A star is born"" tells a story many of us already know. The movie it's a nice love story and Lady Gaga is good but Bradley Cooper is definitely the star of ""A star is born"". The film demonstrates that good stories never die. Bradley Cooper has borrowed from the 1976 Barbra Streisand version, its 1970's setting and the the rock 'n' roll feeling and it does it well. Despite its long history, Cooper manages to bring something authentic and new to this classic film story that feels fresh and vital. Undeniably, ""A Star is Born"" shines due to the realistic chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.

I can only highlight the performance of veteran Sam Elliot as the most believable character in the film, while Copper and Gaga recreated their own past. A bitter taste of confusing elements which tries to turn the blind eye to an outrageous fact which I cannot mention to avoid spoil alert. Dull, slow, confusing, depressing. The music is fine but at times lurid. Nothing new from its 4 previous remakes. Just recommended for Gaga´s fans and Cooper lovers.

Oh gee, the unforgettable swearing. There's basically swearing at every 2 lines, so if you're planning on coming with kids you might wanna rethink that.

","I heard about this movie and was remembering the old version that I saw with Barbara and Kris back when I seen it on cable. It was a sad movie and saw the ending which grabs you in the feels, especially the song Evergreen. So with this remake, I knew it was going to be tragic but just didn't know how it was going to be told in this version. I heard the soundtrack and downloaded some of the songs from the album before I seen the movie. I was married to an alcoholic husband and I could identify with the characters in both of the movies. 
I was surprised that Bradley Cooper was directing this movie and he did such an awesome job with the cast he put in this movie, especially Lady Gaga as his leading lady. It was a surprise to see Andrew Dice Clay as well and Dave Chapelle. But my favorite was Sam Elliot which I heard Bradley had to get.a voice coach just to mimic his voice to play his brother efficiently. Overall I was touched by this movie and I cried.

Soon the relationship between them grows stronger. In addition, her star begins to rise, while his sets.<br/><br/>I have watched the 1954 Judy Garland version of A Star Is Born and wasn't impressed with that. Was massively padded, largely by unnecessary musical numbers which ruined the momentum of the movie.<br/><br/>This, the 2018 version, fortunately keeps the musical interludes largely short and necessary. However, it's still not great.<br/><br/>After a fairly clumsy start the movie shows a large amount of potential: as a commentary on the superficiality of modern music, as an engaging passing-of-the-torch story or simply as a struggling-artist-claws-her-way-to-the-top story. Unfortunately, none of these themes are developed or go anywhere profound. In fact, instead of ridiculing the superficiality of modern music, the film ultimately glorifies it. The two main characters ultimately represent how rock 'n roll is a dying art form, being replaced by incredibly shallow pop music.<br/><br/>No, the movie is, unfortunately, just a romantic drama, and a fairly conventional one too. The music industry setting just provides the backdrop. Character engagement is fairly limited, as the way the story is told is more about plot than character development. The unrelatable (music industry / celebrity world) setting probably doesn't help either."

","I wanted to see this movie for so long, but circumstances kept me away. Well, I finally saw this movie. It moved me beyond words. Bradley Cooper was so heartbreaking in his performance. The Grammy scene was awful - not in performance, but it was so hard to watch. When Ally's producer tells a sober Jackson how harmful he has been to her career and life, it was painful to watch.
I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga. Her performance was so moving. She played Ally with such passion. It was one of my favorite female performances of the year. Sam Elliott's performance broke my heart. When he was talking to Jackson about selling the farm, it was one of the most moving parts of the film. He was a standout. Andrew Dice Clay was amazing also. I couldn't stand his stand up years ago, but I didn't even recognize him. He was great. The music was incredible....Shallow is one of the best songs I have ever heard in a movie.
I knew the basic plot of this movie, and I knew about the suicide, but this still didn't keep me from loving this movie. The film was set up perfectly. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga had a connection that was so real. I read some of the reviews on here, and the people that rated it 1 were biased. Either they hated Cooper or hated Lady Gaga. If you watched the movie with an open mind and open heart, it will be everything you hope for. Thank you for reading my first ever review."

","Yes Lady Gaga has a few good songs in this but the biggest fault of this film is the relationship between Ally and Jackson. Not enough time was spent on it and I just didn't buy them falling in love and getting married in such a short time. I mean Jack goes missing because he gets drunk and then in the next scene Ally is ready to marry him. She obviously was disapproving of his drinking but is ready to marry him even though he is no where near ready to give up the bottle. And the movie doesn't portray her is money hungry and going after him for fame. She wouldn't have married him. And when Jack gets drunk at the Grammy's that would not have happened. Directors or producers would not let an act go on stage completely hammered like that. Neither would have Jack's manager. And I don't buy Jack deciding to off himself when Ally was sticking by him. Just didn't buy the characters.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK , but over-hyped. If you like Gaga or Bradly Cooper, then definitely check it out."

Most Definitely not movie of the year, nowhere close. Just goes to show we end up watching what they tell us to. Least I didn't pay for this mediocre film. I understand it to be a re-hashed idea anyway, perhaps 5 times previously. When will Hollywood come up with original Idea's?

"tahltanmum","4","2","3","1 March 2019"," It had moments...
","I saw this originally in the theatre, and thought it was fabulous, but then watched it again when it came out on DVD; and ...meh...not as good as I remembered? Some songs were ok, but could Bradley GET any greasier???? Jeeze! Wash your face and hair! And what is with mumbleing? It was still an ok movie, but maybe I was tired the first time?"
"saffron19","6","2","3","23 February 2019"," 4 things that annoyed me about this version
","1. What's with Bradley Cooper's talking voice? I thought he was being dubbed by Jeff Bridges and was watching his lips to see if they matched. And then I thought he was mock-imitating Sam Elliott. Was that really necessary for character development?<br/><br/>2. Unnecessary back stories -- I'm tired of the young white hero having a black supportive buddy to indicate his coolness and goodness. Was that really necessary for character development? And the abandoned ranch? I wish more time and writing talent was spent on developing dialogue between the two leads.<br/><br/>3. I totally did not buy that Jackson's decent to depression would be spurred by her new business manager. Maine (the '54 version James Mason being my favorite), truly adores her and respects her talent, and in this version, he was well aware of the hype and shallowness on the commercial music world, so why would he take that to heart? It makes much more sense, as in the '54 version, that he is devastated when he overhears HER expressing her despondency about their situation. He can't bear to hurt her.<br/><br/>4. The hanging in the garage -- Maine would never do that, knowing the devastation it would cause her... that it would seem like a direct statement, an affront to her, rather than a desire of wanting to disappear from life in order to cause her no more pain, to no longer be a burden and an embarrassment. That's why in the '54 version, it made more sense that he would quietly just want to disappear into the ocean."

Firstly, I'm 34 so I don't give a hoot how many times this movie has been done, it was a first for me.<br/><br/>My family has struggled with alcoholism so this movie had a level of relatability that I wasn't prepared for.

"nagsaptarshi","9","2","3","26 January 2019"," Now I know How Lady Gaga Looks Like
","Well, seeing Gaga donning a character that's pretty terrestrial like us is something extra terrestrial. Yes, she has acted in most part of this film without her usual overdose of make-up. And she has stolen the show with panache. Its hard to believe that the singing sensation of the decade has been acting in just her first movie. An Oscar-worthy performance I believe. Bradley Cooper as the alcoholic and drug addict singer is brilliant as a director and his subdued performance adds value to this wonderfully crafted movie. The songs are superb and so are the lyrics. The movie centers around the couple and the rest of the cast has hardly anything to offer. Quite surprising to see Sam Elliott bagging an Oscar nomination for the supporting actor job with so little screen presence. He has done a terrific job, though. Overall a wonderful movie which has every potential to be a cult in the coming years. Lyrical and poignant- this musical drama is a must watch of this season."

","My wife and I watched A Star is Born together. I didn't know what to expect, as I has never seen any of the earlier movies of the same name. It had us both in tears repeatedly... and then the final act rolled on stage.<br/><br/>The plot had well established Maine's destructive behaviors by that point, and how those behaviors had finally affected his wife and not just himself. We see him return from rehab, teetering on the cliff's edge of recovery, and then... Ally's manager corners him alone and - knowing his vulnerabilities - ruthlessly, selfishly, says things to him cruelly calculated to drive him away from her at the least and drive him to suicide at the worst. And he succeeds in his selfish plot to protect ""his property"" (Ally), because minutes later Maine is dead, having finally been given the emotional push to succeed where he had failed at thirteen.<br/><br/>The sociopathic behavior of Ally's manager should be remembered as the moral of the story."

"taranpannu01","8","2","3","24 January 2019"," A Star is Born (2018)
","Whilst my review is very late to the party (almost three months since it's opening) I am nonetheless excited to say the hype and build up was worth it. A Star is Born is emotional, hefty, warming and ultimately triumphant.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper feels like an assured director and his snub from the Academy Awards is quite frankly a disgrace considering how expertly he directed himself and his co stars. I fell completely in love with Jackson Maine and this was all due to Cooper's gut wrenching and emotional performance.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was left feeling underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's performance, yes she was great and completely deserving of her accolades but I couldn't help feel (especially in the more grief stricken scenes) she could've perhaps produced more. Maybe that's me being picky but nonetheless she is still a star and worthy of the recognition she is getting for her surprisingly at times subdued performance.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot, Dave Chappelle and Anthony Ramos provide strong back up from the co leads with Elliot being considerably on top form worthy of an Oscar win, he brought gravitas and a steely heart to the picture.<br/><br/>The cinematography was just gorgeous, as was the editing. Both played with one another creating a documentary like feel whilst immersing you into the world of Jackson Maine.<br/><br/>The themes, references to the modern day music business and emotional beats were all brilliant, one particular scene had me genuinely gasping between Cooper and Gaga.<br/><br/>I don't really have much more to say which is odd considering how long some of my other reviews have been. This was a considerable effort by Cooper and he was heavily snubbed by the Academy, one gripe I might add is that I felt maybe the first twenty minutes didn't feel earned, the meeting of Ally and Jackson felt a little TOO Hollywood but this feeling soon went away.<br/><br/>Overall, an emotional, stunningly shot, impeccably performed remake that has something genuine to say, which is a rarity in modern day cinema."

Impressive remake of the several times remade classic tale of rags-to-riches showbiz story this time with alcoholic singer Cooper (who also makes his big-screen directorial debut in a big way) meeting an equally talented singer/songwriter (Gaga in her film debut equally in a big way) with fireworks and roller-coaster whirlwind romance in full bloom. Cooper has a natural effect helming his first big film with surprising ease - as well as an here-to-unknown knack for music (singing/guitar playing and writing the film's songs) and coaxes a strong turn for his leading lady and a memorable supporting role of Elliott as his older brother (and a shoo-in for an Oscar)."

"minhchau-dolphin","5","2","3","17 December 2018"," Cant understand the high rate here
","The first ever movie of Bradley Cooper that I found so boring and predictable. I like him and his acting, which always took me by surprise, but this time, ""A star is born"" is such a disappointment. Over-rated, by all means. Even the great music, lovely and deep songs, and Lady Gaga's performance cant save it. Yeah, sure, she is gorgeous and is an awesome singer, but I do not see any ""chemistry"" here between the two of them as everyone else said. The romance part is irritating to watch, the plot is too plain and simple, and I have to admit that I broke no tears in the end. It left no impression in me, and half through the film, I just wish it to end faster. Honestly, this film is too far to even become an Oscar material. It should not be just about the ""music"". A good film is never just about beautiful music and no incredible actings, or just something good enough to remember.
If you are a fan of Lady Gaga and want to see her in the movie, and not really care that much about the rest of it, I recommend this one. But for me, it's two hours of my life that I can never get back"

","Two movies about music in the span of a month and both amazing.<br/><br/>A star is born is a remake of a remake of a remake of a movie made in 1937 about an actress that rises to fame after meeting an established and out of fame actor who fights with alcoholism, the movies through the remakes that followed changed a bit from actors to singer and actor and eventually two singers which was the 1976 movie with Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson and this new movie is a remake of the 76 film.<br/><br/>Here we are introduced to Jackson Maine a famous rock icon that has a lot of demons that haunt him and Ally an amateur singer that Jackson discovers by pure luck.
They hit it off and Ally enters this world of destructive roller coaster that Jackson has while struggling with his addiction problems.<br/><br/>This time around too the movie has changed somewhat in comparison to the older movie to reflect the society and time period it is set in better.<br/><br/>The sound in this movie is rich and full of life which is good because it is a movie about music and musicians so it needed good sound.
The color pallet used in this movie is warm and vibrant which I loved, the images felt alive and I appreciated that since it is very easy to fall into that simple trap that is if you have a sad story have a blue tint and cold colors and grey etc and if it is a happy comedy make everything bright.
No this movie does not do that, that is not to say it is unrealistic, on the contrary, the colors are very life like not overdone.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has his directorial debut with this film and I am amazed by how good the work he has done was as a director but that all pales in comparison to his acting in this film.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to see amazing performances going in specially considering how old this story is and I already knew it well through the 3 other films and yet I was left speechless by Bradley Cooper!
It was very good to see that Lady GaGa can perform good but I certainly did not expect to see Bradley Cooper shine so bright.
His work was on par with Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody and that makes it interesting to see how the award season plays out this time around.
Bradley Cooper of A Star Is Born is unlike anything you have seen from him, his voice is deeper, his mannerism has changed and he can sing, oh my he can sing so very well I wish he was not an actor and was a singer.
It was crazy to see this actor that I knew so well and loved so much be so different all of a sudden.<br/><br/>I have to give props to the costumes department, a lot of a nods to Barbara Streisand's Ester Hoffman character from the 76 film in the clothes chosen for GaGa.
And the makeup did a great work too, I did not even recognise Bradley Cooper at first and I had not even read up on who is in the movie for the leading man so my surprise was even bigger when I realised it was Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>All in all I give this movie a 9 for an amazing well done film with really good acting and music.
Look out Rami, Bradley might end up stealing your thunder!"

","Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were fantastic in the film. Cooper showing the struggles of substance abuse while Gaga blesses us with her exquisite voice and performance shines of the girl with dreams of being a singer. Both Gaga and Cooper really outdid themselves and showed true raw emotion throughout the film. While their performances were indeed incredible, I felt the overall script was somewhat mediocre. The first half covering Ally's success was rushed and didn't show a clear insight of the the star (Ally) being born and rising to the top of stardom. The second half was extremely slow. Some scenes being extremely hard to follow and simply not necessary for the plot. In terms of cinematography, I felt there wasn't enough use of technique and could easily turn a simple scene into something more special. I feel because of Lady Gaga's name being attached to the film and it being her first big motion picture, the film was overhyped and praised more than it would have been have it had been a more commonly known actor portraying Ally instead. Overall, I would say I was pleased with the film. Not blown away but not completely disappointed. I would probably not watch it again as I don't really have a desire to, but would recommend to watch."

","I found it challenging to believe that Ally would have gone from writing performing heartfelt music, to do quickly descend into that terrible asses and texts songs and dance routines. I think this bit was a bit over the top, but understood it's purpose as part of the film and relative to the demands/pressures of a young female artist at this time.<br/><br/>I have to say for me, the relationship in the film that steals the show is Jack and Bobby. This for me supplied the most powerful moment of the film even if it was perfectly understated and internalised acting.<br/><br/>Overall it's a fantastic effort from Cooper in both his capacity as an actor and now a director. Talented chap."

The love these 2 characters have for each other is so strong and spellbinding it actually makes your heart ache. I went in with very high expectations, having watched the trailer several times and reading the great reviews, and I will still blown away. And the amount of beautiful original songs, sung with such heart and raw emotion, my god it was a sensory overload. I cried because of how beautiful everything was.<br/><br/>Now, about Lady Gaga. Wow. I had heard her acting was great, but it is literally unbelievable. She is so REAL, so relatable. And the pain that Bradley portrays, as he fights his demons, you just want to reach into the screen and give him a serious hug. I wanted to squeeze him and assure him that everything would be ok.<br/><br/>I've never seen my husband so affected by a movie. He is still wandering around, hand to heart and shaking his head with amazement.<br/><br/>I think it would be impossible for anyone not to be impressed by the acting and amazing original songs, but most importantly, not to be seriously affected by the ending. My god I couldn't bear it. The commitment and sacrifice they both make will break your heart, mark my words. I had goosebumps over my entire body more often than not, throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>I would bet my life savings that Bradley and Gaga will both get very well deserved Oscars for their roles next year.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour - see this movie.

One night she is singing in a drag bar and Jackson Maine played by Bradley Cooper comes in and sees her perform and thinks shes amazing. The connection between the two is immediate when they meet and he helps her along with her singing career. This film is popping with awesome music starting straight away with cooper performing on stage makes you feel like your at a rock concert. Gaga is so amazing in this role her vulnerability her eyes and stripped down no makeup and dark her and her voice is incredible. Cooper plays an ageing rocker alcoholic who falls for ally but struggles with his own demons. Ive seen many actors play drunks before but coopers performance is one of the best. This is also one of the great love stories ive seen. I also have to mention Sam Elliot who plays Jacksons brother who is also great.

","First of all as we read 1000 times music for this movie is amazing. Long story short.
I really believed the characters played by Bradley and Lady Gaga..
However what makes me angry is like in the movie - it was mentioned more times, that Jack had terrible childhood, bad father etc.- his childhood bruises made him depressed, anxious! So yeah he was an addict BUT that was not his disease, it was the outcome of depression etc.. i felt him, really felt what he has been through, thats why I cried as baby in the end coz I knew. And in that part Ally was too busy with her
new life, yeah she loved him, but she changed, she started to be somebody else..she knew he was an addict, but never helped him to solve the real issue - why he is an addict, sorry but it wasnt alcohol and drugs that took him down at first place..
Overall Bradley gave kinda good message with the movie to this music industry that we are missing = the real artist, 90% are just puppets lets say.."

That's a lot of things done right for Mr. Cooper!<br/><br/>I would never imagine I will ever see Lady Gaga with no excessive makeup or fashion but her acting in this movie is amazing. Her voice is simply otherworldly, her final song was so powerful tears streamed through my face (more like being emotional than sad, really) when she belted ""I'll Never Love Again"".<br/><br/>The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is so good it's hard to believe this is the first time ever Gaga has co-starring role in a blockbuster movie.

As for Lady Gaga, well, I really don't know what to say. I admit I'm a bit of a fan of her, but when she shocks me with a hell of a performance like that and delivers some of the best live vocals of her career ( I really consider her voice to be one of the most charming and powerful ) there's not much I can say except for ""WOW!"".

","There's nothing special about it but there's really nothing wrong with it either. Overall A Star Is Born is a great film and a very nice directorial debut from Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>I basically walked into the theater hoping for some good music and decent film. The music was fantastic and the movie itself was also surprisingly good. Cooper not only does a good job at directing but his singing was certainly a pleasant surprise and as far as acting goes, this could very well be one of his best performances ever. Lady Gaga, as one would expect, absolutely kills all the music performances she does but her acting was also fairly good. What I liked most about it, was how natural it felt.<br/><br/>Then I want to briefly touch on the structure of the film because there is a very significant shift in tone about midway. The first half is mostly fun and I couldn't help but smile on multiple occasions. It celebrates the story between the two main characters as well as the music. However, come the second half, the film becomes much more grim and serious. While this is quite clichÃ©, it works and sets the tone for the ending.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, there is nothing special about A Star Is Born. It is exactly how you would expect it to be but it manages to do everything well. Strong performances and the brilliant soundtrack are definitely the highlights. Whether or not this will win any Oscars, which is what it's trying to do, remains to be seen, but it is most certainly a great film."

","I'm beyond impressed that the man who starred in The Hangover over a decade ago is the same man who directed & starred in this fantastic film. Bradley Cooper did an amazing job directing this film, he & Lady Gaga both give Oscar worthy performances. The film is cliche in many respects but what keeps the film unique & engaging is their performances, Cooper's direction, and the stellar writing which Cooper also had a hand in doing. Watching this makes me excited to see more films directed by Bradley Cooper, he's going to have a great future as a director. The film is long but never to the point it feels like it drags, the film does a terrific job with the pacing and structure. The music is actually very impressive as well, apparently all the songs in the film were shot & recorded live which makes the experience all the more mesmerizing. Lady Gaga does a great job with this role, this is obviously a role catered to her abilities just like Eminem in 8 Mile but she does an astonishing job, to the point I forgot I was even watching Lady Gaga. I know the film will get nominated in several categories at the Oscars, everyone will remember this film for Lady Gaga's performance but for me this film will be remembered as the year a great director was born."

","Does loving someone mean wanting to be with them or wanting what's best for them? Does loving America mean wanting to hold on to the past or being ready to let go for the sake of a better future?<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper really doesn't play Jackson Maine as a burned out rock star. He plays him as the last cowboy in a dying frontier. He never seems to get sloppy, falling down drunk. Or incoherent. Or flabby and disgusting to look at. He just seems too lean and toned and fit through most of the movie to be believable as a guy who has been drinking to excess for years. This is what happens when a star directs himself. You get a drunk who looks like he's working out three hours a day and not lying around in a puddle of his own urine. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Lady Gaga as Ally was note perfect from beginning to end. I never heard her music before this movie and I can't believe how much I was missing! She's a wonderful actress, too, not just in the teary scenes but in some of the comedy moments and even when she's smashing a framed poster of Jackson's at the end of the movie. Her energy, ambition, passion and love are all real and her emotions crackle even when she's angry and upset. <br/><br/>The supporting cast was amazing too. I never thought I'd live to see Andrew Dice Clay give a better performance than Sam Elliott! But it's amazing how Ally's father is always poignant even when he's meant to be funny, while Jackson Maine's brother is fall-down laughing funny even when he's trying to be profound and meaningful. (""Daddy's grave . . . got washed away in a flash flood!"")<br/><br/>There were a few silly moments in this movie, but overall it was really a pleasant surprise."

","GRADE: B+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: The ups-and-downs of a well-known love story, told with style, emotion, and mega-talent. <br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: We all know the tale of Mrs. Norman Maine a.k.a. Esther Blodgett a.k.a. Vicki Lester, depending on your generation. Why you may even know Esther Hoffman and her drunken husband John Norman Howard, if you were a product of the 70's! Now meet Ally and Jackson Maine.<br/><br/>On stage, Jackson Maine is a still commanding presence with a loyal fanbase. Off stage, he is a mess. Alone, going deaf, reeling from too much drinking, the man is on the decline, not yet realizing his career is over. And then he meets his one true love, Ally, possibly his saving grace, in the fifth remake of this classic love story, namely A Star is Born. (That is, if you also count the original 1932 film, What Price Hollywood in the list of former remakes).<br/><br/>Directed and starring Bradley Cooper, this version delves into the music business with a honest and tell-all approach. He plays Jack, an country western big-time performer who is also an alcoholic losing his hearing and falling to pieces behind the scenes. One day he meets and becomes smitten with an unknown talent, Ally (Lady Gaga), who will become his love interest as she begins to achieve success. Unfortunately their trajectories to fame and fortune never quite match up. Hence, the conflicts of a love affair that ebbs and wanes. Moviegoers, get ready for some high class melodrama and bring your tissues!<br/><br/>What makes this version work so well is the teaming of the leads, a literate screenplay by Eric Roth, Will Fetters, and Mr. Cooper, a strong musical score that is mostly written by Lady Gaga, sensitive direction, and top notch production values. The film captures the initial stages of first love so effectively, that wondrous feeling of attraction when two people find their lasting soulmate. In the film's early scenes, watch Mr. Cooper's acting and Lady Gaga's reactions. Nothing is said, everything is understood. When they team together to sing, as in a lovely original song entitled Shallow, their give-and-take euphoria is undeniable. Their shared chemistry together is palpable and serves as the core of the film. They are simply superb and deserving of award recognition. <br/><br/>The screenplay keeps the central plot moving, even if some supporting characters are underwritten. Solid work comes from Andrew Dice Clay, unrecognizable as Ally's father, David Chappelle as Jack's friend, Rafi Gavron as Ally's calculating business manager, and an excellent Sam Elliott as Jack's frustrated older brother, Bobby.<br/><br/>Mr. Cooper undercuts some of the film's impact with some of his directorial touches (especially in the film's dramatic climax), but overall, he mostly avoids the schmaltz and sentimentality of this predictable story (not always, though) and focuses on the realism of the cut-throat music business and its formulaic marketing of a singing idol. He also powerfully stresses the problem of alcoholism as a viable issue that dooms their relationship. <br/><br/>Music plays an important part in the film and the musical score, a mix of original tunes and covers, is quite strong, especially the aforementioned tune and the film's closing number, I Will Never Love Again, beautifully performed. No, it is not an iconic cinematic musical moment, like Garland's The Man That Got Away scene in the 1953 version, but modern audience can wholeheartedly relate to this ballad and Lady Gaga's thrilling vocal histrionics in the film's fade-out.<br/><br/>The believability factor is needed to make a love story resonate and both Mr. Cooper and his Lady make the film so emotionally engaging an, without a doubt, moving. They are memorable and the chief reasons to see this fine remake of A Star is Born."
"alxxmann","8","2","3","16 October 2018"," Oh, the Irony in a Title
","I'm not a big fan of remakes when it comes to making something the exact same way as what came before. Even more so when I've seen the other version. In this case, only knowing the title and the stars of the last version makes this a fresh take for me. The story itself isn't so fresh as it is a standard troubled guy (usually some form of artist) meets younger female (also artist in shared field) that is low on confidence. Their story builds from there into some spectacle that pays off in some tragic way that opens the eyes of the other that life doesn't end simply because the other is not in theirs anymore.<br/><br/>In Bradley Cooper's version of A Star is Born, he portrays aging country-rock star Jackson Maine, an alcoholic and pill popper. Ally is the woman he meets one night after a performance under the influence. He's left awestruck by her and goes out of his way to convince her to come along with him to another concert. At first hesitant, she relents and even summons the courage to take the stage when a song she wrote is being performed. Their relationship gradually builds from there as she decides to accompany him on tour. She is soon approached by a manager that offers a contract, which she accepts. On the cusp of breaking out, the two marry after Jackson has an episode in which she goes out in search of him. As her celebrity rises, his begins to dwindle, prompting him to fall further into his addiction.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie goes on from there. Again, not such a fresh story, but it is how the story is told that makes this film so good. The chemistry between the leads is great with the supporting cast (especially Sam Elliot) bringing to life what could have been a ho-hum outing. Any award buzz you hear is earned and hopefully there are plenty as Bradley Cooper has done something special for his directorial debut where Lady Gaga shines in her first leading role<br/><br/>Not to be forgotten is the original music for the film, the majority written by Gaga. Cooper also has a few in there as well as he dedicated himself to not simply making a film with music, but wanted to be sure that the music was the film. He dedicated over a year to learning the guitar and taking singing lessons to be able to perform authentically. Throughout the film, the music is perhaps the most telling of the story than anything as most of the songs within are almost a synopsis of where the characters are at at that point in their lives. If all that weren't enough, as of writing this, the soundtrack album sits at number one on the billboard 200.<br/><br/>For me, this is the type of movie worth seeing on a big screen in regards to the lane it is in. The way in which the music was recorded plays especially well in big rooms and emerses you in the journey along the way further. It may not be the best film you see of this kind, but it is worth a watch.<br/><br/>Similar recommendations: Begin Again (2014), Once (2007), Dream Girls (2006)"
"shculshaw","9","2","3","16 October 2018"," Excellent film!
","If you enjoy romantic dramas, then this film is well worth your time and money. 
The negative reviews on here reflect trolls who don't like this genre...so why would those people watch then give a bad review??!!??<br/><br/>In honest reflection, this film is excellent! 
Gritty, funny and big hearted! 
Yes, there are a couple of 'cheesy' screens where Gaga bursts into song etc. However, in the main - Gaga's performance is great! She brings you into Ally's journey and you believe she is Ally! 
The music is good but plays safe...I guess to appeal to as many people as possible.<br/><br/>Now, Bradley Coopers acting and directing are outstanding! 
The film addresses zeitgeist subjects with heartfelt sensitivity. 
Coopers exploration into Jackson Mains mental state and how this is portrayed on screen is exceptional! 
There are screens where the camera looks into Jackson's eyes...and you know exactly what the character is thinking and feeling. This has the effect of immersing you into the film and emotional journey! These screens are an exceptional peice of film making and acting!!!
Now given the premise of the film, this could have gone horribly wrong - Gagas big screen debut - remake of a classic - unestablished flim crew...etc.
This team pull off an epic achievement as this is indeed, an excellent film!"
"brianjohnson-20043","6","2","3","16 October 2018"," Not my thing
","This film seemed to be a contrived story meant to also seem like a tale of the tough relaities of life. If it didn't hit you already, that is a contradiction. This film had a few of these.<br/><br/>For the record I have not seen any of other versions of th film. <br/><br/>For what the story was it was presented pretty well by the actors and crew. Solid acting from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. However the pacing was awfully slow, but for that I blame the writers and editors.<br/><br/>With the exception of musicals, I'm rather terrible in following song lyrics when facing unfamiliar songs within movies. I suspect most people are like this but few admit it. Musical songs seem successful because their single purpose is providing story narrative rather than provide story narrative and acting as a commercially written song for a movie character. This movie seems to try to make hybrid songs which lie somewhwere imbetween. I was mostly bored while a lot of the songs were playing. Particularly near the middle and end when it was getting old. <br/><br/>The manager character and his interactions with the Lady Gaga's character were too inconsistent from moment to moment for me to take them seriously in the end. His motivation came off as for the purpose of the story as oppose resembling the characteristics of a real human. <br/><br/>Lady Gaga's character also went through some inconsistencies from moment to moment which bothered me. I couldn't decide if she wanted to be a sellout singer or an authentic musician is the middle to later part of the film. Much of her act later on seemed awful to me. And seemed awful by her own established standards early on. It was all rather difficult to follow seriously even though they tried to play those inconsistencies as part of the story, they just didn't provide enough justification for her to take conflicting opinions so often for me to buy it. <br/><br/>There were a good number of chick flick romantic gimmicks which were annoying. Although I can hardly say I was surprised about those given that some of them were in the trailers. <br/><br/>I'm sure plenty of people will like this one anyone. And say that many of the things I noticed were strengths rather than weaknesses. Well to me they were weaknesses. <br/><br/>So 6/10"
"kjproulx","10","2","3","15 October 2018"," One of the Best Remakes Ever Made
","While I'm not particularly a fan of remakes, unless the original film was terrible to begin with, A Star is Born has been a film that's been remade numerous times since the original version from 1937. Upon hearing the announcement that this 2018 version would be coming along, I decided to revisit the previous three renditions of this tale, with the original 30s version being the standout version in my personal opinion. With that said, I was highly looking forward to this movie in particular, due to the fact that the cast behind this film has already proven themselves to be talented in the past and Bradley Cooper stepping in to write and direct only peaked my interest more. A Star is Born is one of the best films of 2018 and one of my favourite remakes of all time.<br/><br/>Following Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) as he stumbles across a struggling artist in Ally (Lady Gaga), they form an unlikely bond that very quickly gives her fame and fortune, if not in the best ways. Jack is a very detailed character here, being a drunk, having family issues, and struggling with his fame, while Alley is pretty much the exact opposite of that. This made for some terrific drama and the third act of this film brought me to tears. Between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, I think you'd be crazy to believe this movie isn't going to give them both many awards in the coming months, but I truly believe Sam Elliot may give the best performance in the film. The way he subtly displays emotion here was absolutely brilliant and I think he deserves the most recognition for that. His character is fresh and has never been seen in any of the previous versions of this story, which was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>When people reflect back on this film, they may remember it for the performances or where the story progresses from start to finish, but the music plays a very large role here. Although this isn't a musical, the original songs throughout this film are characters themselves. Throughout the film, you'll hear heavy Rock, Country, and even Hip-Hop, which caught me by surprise, but each song helps to deepen the characterization of either Ally or Jack and it was incredible to witness. Where I think some viewers may find issues, however, is in the fact that this film takes place over quite a long period of time.<br/><br/>After the second act of this film concludes, it does speed up the pace and slightly jumps through time on multiple occasions, asking the audience to follow along without giving any definitive answer as to how much time has really passed, but I personally didn't find it necessary and the natural progression was felt by me, personally. The way this film is stitched together in editing was terrific in my opinion and only elevated the concert sequences, as well as the calm moments between characters. Sound and music drive this story and the editing around it all was very much present here and very well done.<br/><br/>In the end, although the core story has remained the same through the years and the conclusion probably won't surprise those who have seen the previous versions of this story, there is enough of a fresh take here to please fans and newcomers. This 2018 version of A Star is Born takes the best elements from the past and injects new life that added many layers to these characters. Aside from a few jarring instances that come out of nowhere story-wise, I truly don't have many complaints. This movie worked for me on an entertainment level, as well as an emotional level and it's one of the best movies I've seen all year."

Unaware of her previous acting stints, I asked myself how she was chosen for this part but I honestly left the theater asking if it was her or Cooper who deserves a nomination more. She is as talented as the best of them and at parts this is one of those movies you catch yourself totally tuned into scenes and forget for a few moments youre in a theater watching actors (maybe sitting in row 2 played a factor too). <br/><br/>Overall, the writing, tempo, actors, songs(!), and ending is an easy A.

","Yes, we all know the story. Yes, it's been done many times before under many names. However, none are as expertly and emotionally performed and directed as this one. Bradley Cooper manages to pull everything the cast has to give out of each and every scene. The actors blend into the characters so seamlessly that you actually begin to wonder if they aren't just playing themselves. Obviously they are not, which is what makes the performances so astounding. It slows down a little in the final third, but I enjoy a movie that isn't afraid to let the story breathe a little. That doesn't feel the need to rush headlong into the inevitable conclusion. While far from a perfect movie, it is the touching an emotional performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga that make the film, and watching him doing an amazing Sam Elliot impression in scenes with Sam Elliot is just glorious. Good thing they play brothers in the film. Add in the excellent music and you have while not the best movie ever, certainly the best of this breed, and a movie that far surpasses any of its predecessors. Way to go Mr. Cooper."

Cause we all know a lot of movies where singers think they can act. But Lady Gaga has a natural talent for it. I can not relate to the bad reviews of others because this movie is really prize worthy. Maybe not the script, but those two had a special chemistry. So you get drawn in. Time passed so fast during the 2,5 hours. The songs are beautiful. Don't go if you think you are gonna get constant sensation or action or whatever, this is a showbizz lovestory. The build up is credible and i felt they had a connection in the whole movie. In the end of the movie, you know which way it is gonna turn out. But then again it is no film with a plot, so it would be obvious that you know how it ends, but you still are trying to figure out while watching what will happen. It was nice to see another actor as well Bradley Cooper had acted with before in Alias. Maybe some will find this similar in ways like the real start of her singing career. But still, what if it is?

"Cineanalyst","8","1","1","29 November 2019"," Same Story Told Over and Over Forever
","""A Star Is Born"" has proven itself to be a story with legs, to borrow from the phrasing of Bradley Cooper's Jack, and I think that's because it does, indeed, dig deep into the soul of Hollywood and the business of art and entertainment in general. Like the songs within this iteration of the familiar story about the characters who sing them, the movie is about itself, about the stars who play the characters within it, and it echoes the same stories that have been told afore.<br/><br/>The story is older than some people realize, too, as before it was ""A Star Is Born"" in 1937, 1954, 1976 and again in 2018, it was ""What Price Hollywood?"" (1932), which itself is said to be loosely based on real-life tales such as the marriage of silent-film flapper icon Colleen Moore. In 1937, the Academy's first Best Actress Oscar winner, Janet Gaynor, repeated the feat within and almost without (with another Oscar nomination) the first ""A Star Is Born"" by playing the same ingénue type that she'd already honed over the past decade in Hollywood. In 1954, the versatile Judy Garland brought the now-familiar backstage musical to the narrative, while her real life seemed to mirror that of her alcoholic on-screen husband more than the aspiring star she plays in the film. Then, Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson took the story from the Oscars to their more familiar territory of the Grammys, a formula that is reused here for the talents of Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>This latest ""A Star Is Born"" has its faults. Bradley Cooper seems to spend most of the picture admiring himself as the handsomest drunk and drug addict to ever appear on screen--sometimes to the point of marginalizing the more pivotal role played by Lady Gaga, and her launch to stardom seems shallow with all of the business of her nose and her confidence being built up by a man calling her ""pretty."" And, of course, it's a vanity project: it's a movie about show business, it's about money and awards made to garner money and awards. While seeming to turn a critical eye on the pop music business, the movie itself often plays as an extended music video, cutting from the same overly-emotional outbursts to the next that's a staple of the success of popular music--that the stars feel things so powerfully that they have no control and must punch people or things or drink and drug themselves into oblivion. Even the fun stuff is a whirlwind of losing control to one's primal urges. Inevitably, at some point, it's going to get hokey. On the other hand, the acting, cinematography and editing are far above anything in a music video, and the music led by ""Shallow"" being also outstanding.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I've fallen for the self-reflexivity of the story. I like how Sam Elliott's Bobby mentions how every song and story is the same and that the artist offers the world how they see that same story, as that essentially is the point of remaking ""A Star Is Born"" for the fourth, fifth or umpteenth time. There's also the business of Cooper adopting Elliott's voice, which recalls for me, at least, all the other great voices to be broadcast in prior versions of the story. For the male lead, the memorable voice of James Mason most often comes to my mind. The insertion of drag queens, and its similarities to the pageantry of rock concerts and music videos, also seems to play into this meta notation--besides also reflecting Gaga's, like Garland before, status as a queer icon. Most interesting of all, however, is how much this ""A Star Is Born"" seems to be a critique of the career of its own star-in-the-making. She came to fame within and without the movie by being what Cooper's Jack calls ""ugly."" Indeed, the dance routines, hairstyling and costumes she adorns in ""A Star is Born"" are far less outrageous than the Lady Gaga persona she has performed in the real pop-music world. The story's traditional end is especially unfortunate for leaving this critique a bit shallow. It's, nonetheless, an interesting self-reflexive aspect to this addition--more so I suppose for those who've been bigger fans of Lady Gaga than me. At the least, this ""A Star Is Born"" has surely borne more fans, myself included, for this star."

","I expected something more given the many positive comments he received. The actors are extraordinary even though the thickness of BC far exceeds that of LG. Which on the other hand, in the scenes on stage, is really in its element. Wonderful the songs, especially the ones that in the film sings BC (the pure melodic accompanied by the piano I find it a bit ""whining"" even if the text is remarkable, I need the guitar and the drums !!) and I was really impressed by the fact that the songs, in addition to being written and performed by the protagonists (but LG could expect nothing less, his talent is unquestionable and names like Mark Ronson appear among others), were recorded live. What I strongly lack in this film is the script. It is true that it is a remake but with today's eyes, it knows everything already seen, predictably, sincerely missing pathos. Even the final drama seems almost false and not the natural evolution of the path of a well-defined character: do events precipitate but do they serve the characters or the film? Sin."

"harrylosborne","8","1","1","19 August 2019"," Bradley Cooper's bravest work
","A Star Is Born is more than your simple musical romance: it is a nuanced, real and truly heartfelt piece of cinema, one that Bradley Cooper obviously invested some serious time into (having directed and led the cast). Following country star Jack's (Cooper) chance meeting with Ally (Lady Gaga) and their succeeding relationship, the abusive powers of drugs, alcohol and fame are all laid bare. There are more than a few personal touches to each scene. Cooper's addictive personality, something he's battled with in his own life, has a haunting reality to it - something only possible from someone who has suffered such hell themselves.<br/><br/>Further to this, Lady Gaga is a revelation; a lifetime in show-business has helped her develop both an appreciation and a contempt for the public, but it's more her awareness of Jack's struggles that make Ally such a believable character. Sam Elliott (the original Stranger from the Big Lebowski) is also a transformed man, showing more emotion than he is usually allowed to display. The authenticity of this film is furthered by the devotion to the image of country music. Filming at venues such as Coachella (where Gaga had headlined that year) gave authentic atmospheres to scenes, and smaller gigs towards the beginning of the film look believable.<br/><br/>Gaga convinced Cooper that singing live would be preferable for the film's image, so neither lip-synced, and both comfortably hold their own on stage. The most powerful scene (an argument between Ally and Jack in the bathroom) felt beyond genuine, making a serious case for my favourite scene this year. Hopefully Cooper gives directing some attention - more work like this could make him a serious cinema powerhouse in the near future."

","Seeing as this film became a worldwide hit and has won several Oscars and other awards, knowing there was much hype but wasn't too interested in the film initially. After watching A star is Born, can see as to why this is as praised. The acting between both leads Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper carry the film along with their chemistry. As it felt authentic and genuine.<br/><br/>The songs were decent enough to make a lasting impression (specially Shallows which won an Oscar and was a Billboard hit).<br/><br/>Though the first acts were really good and captivating, the film somewhat went downhill around the point the manager was introduced and around Jackson and Ally got married.<br/><br/>Knowing that this was a rename of previous versions (though haven't seen any of them) but knew about the tragic ending. Think it was well shot and was a good job at not making the suicide too tragic looking. Was a solid finale ending. In the end, A star is born was as expected (if not slightly better) but did not completely love the film."
"shirle-36608","8","1","1","4 August 2019"," A Star is Born is a film based on love, acceptance, alcohol and drug addiction, and fame.
","The two major stars in this film are Bradley Cooper as Jackson Maine and Lady Gaga as Ally, all while Cooper also directs the film. The film finds Jackson Maine, an alcohol and drug addicted, seasoned and famous singer, songwriter, and musician in the bar where Ally performs for a small audience. Jackson falls almost instantly in love with Ally and her talent as a singer, songwriter, and musician such as himself. Their connection is tangible throughout the film as they write, perform, and she rises to fame by his side.
There are two major themes that need stated for this film as each character struggles in their different way. The first lies with Jackson and his inability to remain sober. He fights his sobriety throughout the film in what seems like a losing battle. Ally, on the other hand, is fighting a winning battle against her rise to fame and stardom. Will the two be able to remain in love and happy while they both fight their personal battles?
Cooper does a fantastic job of displaying his character on the issues of drug and alcohol addiction. The movie, Flight, with Denzel Washington comes to mind as booth characters struggled with loving someone while being addicted to a substance.
There is one scene in the film, A Star is Born, that uses slow motion to give the audience an emotional connection to the love the Ally and Jack shared. The first scene is in the beginning of the film when Ally is discussing the fact that her looks have kept her from being in the music industry, especially her nose. Jack explains that he loves her nose and asks to touch it, in a slow motion close up, Jack runs his finger down her nose and ends up telling her that he loves her nose. This becomes one of the ways they say ""I love you"" for the rest of the film. The directing and editing of this portion of the film do a perfect job of tying the audience into their love story and how Jackson loves her for who she is.
The film also uses a beautiful soundtrack to guide the audience through the love story of Ally and Jackson. From the songs that they right together to the songs that they write for each other, the soundtrack helps tell the story of who they are together and transitions the audience through the entire film.
To tie these two themes together, both Ally and Jackson are struggling through their own personal battles. Will love conquer all?"
"matt_hew","6","1","1","29 July 2019"," From Deep to 'Shallow'
","This remake of a remake of a remake starts off at the deep end - gritty, slightly dark and manipulative (it knows what it needs to do to pull at your heart strings). And for the first half of the movie it does - when the 'Shal-la-la-low' bit happens you feel it.<br/><br/>But that's also when the movie starts to move back into the 'Shal-hal-lo-lows' with odd (unnecessary) camera work, a disjointed narrative and the usual cheesy clichés are ramped up like a checklist through to the end.<br/><br/>The relationship at the core although vital, seems somewhat rushed. This seems partly due to the movie spending too much time on elements that aren't important or relevant at the expense of things that are: the unnecessary 'transformation' of Ally's character into something she isn't serves no purpose. It also misses out chunks of narrative and hope you won't care - how did Ally automatically know the structure of the song from just the handful of lyrics she sang in the car park or why was Jackson dropped from singing at the Grammy's - and while we're at it your brother is suddenly back on the scene to tell you this news?!<br/><br/>The lack of conviction after a while starts to grate, Cooper's Lebowski accent literally does start to be a parody of 'stealing the voice' of Sam Elliott and shoehorning a few lines about 'the belt' to set up the emotional climax feels clumsy and rushed.<br/><br/>There is such a disconnect in this conclusion that even when Lady Gaga has her clichéd Whitney Song moment at the end (cue dodgy see-saw camera work) you just don't feel it like you did when she first got on stage for the 'Shal-hal-la-low' moment."

"Mike_Devine","8","1","1","20 July 2019"," Cooper's 'Star' burns bright
","No film released in the past year has had the cultural impact that Bradley Cooper's remake of 'A Star is Born' has. The gritty musical love story has brought home plenty of hardware and accolades since its release, and was a hit with audiences, largely due to the chemistry between the two leads - Cooper and Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>'Star' does a lot of things right, from focusing almost exclusively on the bond between Cooper's washed up rocker Jack and Gaga's insta-success Ally. By not losing sight on the passion, tension and everything in between on the emotional spectrum in the music power couple's relationship, we avoid unnecessary distractions that often find their way into these kinds of films. Sure, there are odd scenes like the one at Noodles' house (Dave Chappelle in the most un-Dave Chappelle role) and Cooper's gravelly voice gets grating, but things by and large feel ""real."" The role music plays in 'Star' is a key one, and it really can be considered a third lead in the cast. Nothing feels forced or overdramatized - another win considering the subject matter presents a stage that could be littered with these moments.<br/><br/>Some believe 'Star' is primarily a vehicle for the soundtrack. While this may be true, the film could still stand on its own without the music. The acting performances, pacing and cinematography (despite shaky-cam syndrome) are all really strong, and Cooper deserves all the credit he gets for this product. Gaga especially delivers the performance of her career, and proves she is a serious actress instead of being an example of stunt casting.<br/><br/>'A Star is Born' will long be regarded as a top quality entry in this genre, and gives hope that musical dramas will continue to evolve and find audiences."

She is a very talented woman, actress, and singer. I really enjoyed her acting and the idea that this movie was her first movie ever, makes me like the movie even more. About Cooper, I was very much surprised to see him sing because I know that he did not sing until the movie.

I'd never seen the original version, but within the first ten minutes, I could literally predict the entire plot. I don't really mind predictable storylines, but for a movie that received as much hype as this one, I was hoping for something a little more.<br/><br/>Everything about A Star is Born is pretty much done by the book. Cooper is solid in his role as an actor and a director, though I found his Sam Elliot impersonation to be a little odd. The music is really good, and I really wish we could have heard more songs from Jackson Maine. There are plenty of celebrity cameos which make fans go berserk.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is much better than the last half. I wish this film would have included time stamps, because there are a few things that are incredibly rushed between the two main characters.<br/><br/>I don't really have too much more to add about this one. Sam Elliot is probably the best character. Gaga is impressive, Cooper is too. I just wish the movie didn't seem so formulamatic. This doesn't really seem to be the career-marking film that this was hyped to be for anyone involved. It's good, but I've definitely seen better. I have no desire to see it again."

The film also focuses on the ups and downs of a relationship due to diverging careers and particularly alcoholism.

","Here's the good...Sam Elliott. LOVE THAT MAN! He can do no wrong. I'm so glad to see that he got nominated for awards and actually won some as they were well deserved. Ok sorry that was it for the good.<br/><br/>I went into this thinking I would not be able to handle how amazing it was gonna be and then when it ended all I could think was...it lacked something. It reached high but fell way short.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is no Barbra Streisand. She wasn't terrible but she lacked that quality of ""I can't look away from this person."" I didn't feel the heat or intensity between Ally & Jackson.<br/><br/>Joke and throw shade all you want but bottom line-Andrew Dice Clay is a good actor and I hope he gets good roles to work with in the future.<br/><br/>Finally-Bradley Cooper's desperate need for validation was his undoing with this movie and in his personal life. I'm being very genuine when I relay that it truly makes me sad that he and Irina broke up over this because they have a daughter together and these are real people in that situation. And let's face it - this movie IS the reason they broke up and no one can convince me otherwise. How could it not be? If he had been my partner I would've bounced a long time ago. He didn't keep his personal life separate and now he's paying the price. Brad bet the house on this and he failed miserably. The fact that he didn't win the Oscar proves that. He was good in this but he took a huge gamble and it just didn't pay off. Don't feel too bad for him though he likes 'em young so no doubt he'll find solace in another one's arms soon.<br/><br/>This isn't the worst movie but it felt very teenager-y and it lacked depth. It's hard to feel something for stars or singers who (pardon the pun) are ""Shallow Shallow"". Don't expect us to cry you a river if you have been given the keys to the castle and then turn around and blow it all on stupidness. Jackson kills himself in this version because he can't handle Ally moving on without him and he let some young music executive punk dictate to him what his wife feels-which may not have been the case. He (much like the actor
who played him) was so desperate for validation that it was his undoing in the end.<br/><br/>I just couldn't get behind this one."

","I saw all the ""A Star Is Born"" before this one, and so if you saw any one of them, you know how it's gonna turn out. This one is no exception. What I liked about this one was seeing actors I haven't seen in film for a while. And I liked seeing Sam Elliot in a role that was a more emotional role that he carried very well. I am sure Lady Gaga fans went gaga over her performance, and well they should as this was for them. For me, not a Gaga fan, it was not moving me so much.<br/><br/>For all the Star is Born films, this one was slower than molasses to get to wherever it was they were headed. I was trying to see the 'chemistry' between Cooper and Gaga's characters and ... there was more 'chemistry' between Cooper and Andrew Dice Clay than those two. This one seemed more about family - Cooper and Elliot's brother characters, than a love story which became quite secondary in this.<br/><br/>The songs that were part of the focus - eh. But I was not a fan of the songs in A Star is Born from the 1970s either. This film - tries but it is for this generation, and got this generation's star and that is the point. But for my review it was an okay film where it's heart was not in the love story, but the love of family and the 'you know it's coming"" end like in all the Star is Born films that preceded it."
"libbyorman","8","1","1","3 June 2019"," A Star Is Born (2018): The Best Remake Yet
","A Star Is Born originally came out in the year of 1937 and has been remade three times. The 2018 version was the 4th adaptation to come out which made people skeptical if it would as good or if not better than the older versions. This movie headlined an actress that has never had any acting experience (Lady Gaga) and a man who directed the film as well as never having any singing experience ever (Bradley Cooper). Most people didn't know what to expect from this situation and if the remake would be worth watching, but man did Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, and the rest of the crew pull off this amazing movie.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born is a touching love story about the two main characters named Jackson Maine, who is a famous country-rock singer who has an addiction problem to drugs and alcohol and Ally, who is a waitress that sings at drag bars on the side. These two ended up meeting when Jackson showed up to the drag bar after performing a show. The two had an immediate connection when Ally was singing La Vie En Rose and made eye contact with Jackson.<br/><br/>The two spent most of the night talking and Jackson got to hear Ally's amazing voice and her composing capability. He was beyond amazed and wondered why she was stalling a career she could potentially have. Ally believed she had many flaws like her nose shape which was one reason why she didn't pursue a career. Jackson Maine ended up bringing Ally on stage to sing her beautiful song that she wrote called, The Shallows and that is when her fame started. Their intimate, rocky love story was just about to take off.<br/><br/>This movie takes you through the best and worst moments of a true love story that is touching but very heartbreaking. Jackson Maine's addiction problem and fame kept getting worse while Ally was becoming one of the biggest stars in pop culture. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's chemistry together is so immaculate that you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>This version of A Star Is Born was clearly the best remake that has been made for this movie. From the acting and the soundtrack to the cinematography, just about everything was outstanding. They actually decided to film all of the concert scenes with actual crowds from famous events like Coachella and other big events. People watching the movie could understand just how big Jackson Maine really was in Hollywood as a rock-country star. These scenes made you feel like you were on stage with these stars rocking out to an amazing country-rock concert.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's chemistry was just on fire. They were so into each other and respected one another to make this film the very best it could be. Also, their voices together matched so well which made the soundtrack awesome and still has me listening to it to this day.
This version blew past all of the other A Star Is Born movies for its take on it for many reasons. The movie was made better on every aspect from the previous versions since there is far more technology to help create amazing movies like the 2018 version. They did just about everything right in this movie to create a sensational hit in the box offices.<br/><br/>The one thing is that during the last half of the movie, the editing became somewhat choppy and easy to tell that maybe they were rushed. Viewers could feel a disconnect from the amazing, strong first half to the end since these scenes were somewhat rushed and not as real. This was really only one problem that Bradley Cooper had during this whole entire movie which is truly impressive.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born 2018 is one of the hottest love stories captured on film to this day. This remake was just remarkable and needs to be seen by everyone in the theater nearest to you. You will feel an immediate connection to the story line and never be able to stop watching. Make sure to bring your tissues!"
"brianbaek","4","1","1","8 April 2019"," A daydream of a film
","I had heard from many people that A Star Is Born was one of the best films of 2018. People ate it up. They couldn't get enough of Bradley Cooper's killer move where he calls Lady Gaga's character's name just so he could ""get another look at ya."" How smooth is that.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born is nothing but a standard feel good story. It tells of a musician, Jackson Mayne, past his prime, finding some glimmer of inspiration in an up and comer, Ally, who is the quintessential dreamer. It is clear that Jackson desires more than just to mentor Ally, and in the process, he brings Ally on tour with him, and Ally becomes the all too romanticized ""over-night success."" Long-story short, Ally rises to stardom, while Jackson struggles with jealousy, addiction, and a hidden battle with tinnitus, ultimately leading to his professional downfall and not unexpected suicide.<br/><br/>The fact that I'm able to use the phrase ""long-story short"" to describe the entire gist of a movie should be telling of its lack of depth. In reality, there is no moment or character that is very compelling, groundbreaking, or even thought provoking. While it is certainly interesting to see Ally and Jackson going in different trajectories with their lives, the direction of the plot is quite predictable and underwhelming. While the stakes are perceived to be high for Ally who is finally getting to achieve her dreams, there is a lack of a true emotional or existential struggle that I know exists for many creative individuals. In a sense, the entire movie feels like a daydream; the perceived story of how one's career might go, given the right circumstances. And while Jackson's personal turmoil is an emotional low point in the movie, there was no true sense of tragedy in his death, simply due to the lack of a real emotional connection developed with Jackson. We get a vague sense of his troubled childhood, but the issue of suicide and what drives people to that point is an incredibly complex subject with nuance in every direction. The film expects us to accept Jackson's suicide as tragic simply because suicide is so shocking in real life, and this does not do the topic of mental health and depression, justice."

","Prior to watching this movie I didn't watch any of the previous versions - to be honest I didn't even realize it was yet another remake. I went in a bit sceptical about Lady Gaga as a lead role, and I wouldn't call myself a great Bradley Cooper fan either.
The opening fifteen minutes are cringy. There is a lot of weird dialogue and scenes that don't make much sense. Then the movie gains some momentum, but can't keep it up for more than twenty minutes, because everytime something starts developing the movie hits you with some boring stuff. Lady Gaga turns out to be OK for the role, Bradley Cooper tries a bit too hard and the movie itself goes for all the easy tricks to make your eyes wet, but falls a bit short of doing so."

"roel-willemsen","9","1","1","20 October 2018"," Hauntingly beautiful
","An absolute masterpiece by Bradley Cooper, who shines as both the lead and the director. Everything, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, was absolutely perfect to make one of the more darker and realistic musical films of the decade.
Cooper nails it as a successful artist struggling with both a hearing issue and alcohol and drug addiction, successfully brought to the screen in some eerily beautiful scenes. Gaga steals the show however, with both her acting and singing talent brought to the front. She ditches her larger-than-life real-life persona and becomes someone vulnerable who is still amazingly talented. Another actor to surely be put in the spotlight is Sam Elliott, who plays Cooper's older brother. Seriously, who better than Elliott can be the voice of reason and give some heart warming speeches when everything seems lost.
The soundtrack is pure gold. The concert scenes are perfect and intense and if Shallows does not at least get nominated for best original song, the academy will have some explaining to do.
The story unfolds gorgeously as we follow these two people with very different lives come together to form a beautiful romance. The moment Gaga first joined Cooper on stage to perform Shallows is the definition of goosebumps. Their story then unravels, with Cooper descending into a gritty world of drugs and alcohol and Gaga getting sucked up by a slight exaggaration of today's oversaturated pop world. We as an audience can't help but grimace when she changes her beautifully ordinary look with disgusting orange hair, multiple layers of make-up and some gruesome outfits which are not to different from what current pop princesses tend to wear. We feel for both these characters as Cooper watches Gaga's manager develop her 'image', when all Cooper has done the entire film is try to convince her she doesn't need to change anything to be amazing. Every hope for a happy ending we have when Cooper successfully beats his addiction is squashed in the end with his tragic suicide, after which Gaga once again manages to blow everyone away with I Will Never Love Again, truely amazing."

","Note that I never seen any of the past A Star Is Born movies, so I wrote this review based on my personal point of view of the film.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I didn't set up any expectation for this movie. I watched the trailer and thought that this will probably turn out to be another romance movie whatsoever. I decided to see it myself in the cinema when I saw critics' reviews on Rotten Tomatoes which convinced me to go see it myself at the cinema. The opening scene was superb, when Ally met Jack and fell in love and so on; it was kind of corny at times, I find that it happens to be sort of draggy for the first half of the film but overall still acceptable. Bradley Cooper has successfully lured me into seeing him as Jack the whole time.<br/><br/>I am in love with the soundtracks. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's performances were truly impressive to begin with except that I think it was unnecessary to include full songs in the film as there are some unnecessary musical scenes that may drag the time.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I think I have no complaints. I got totally lost in Bradley's character, and as for Lady Gaga, she was superb especially when she starts playing with her facial expressions and genuine gestures throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Jack is overall my favorite character. His ""too kind"" attitude creates empathy from the audience especially during the part in which he got into his depressive episode and was trying to battle his depression. It did remind me of Kurt Cobain's story and I loved the fact that (as stated in the Trivia) the writer was actually inspired by his story.<br/><br/>As for Ally, I love how she never thought of giving up on Jack. She was sincere the whole time although sometimes she got caught up with her career. I definitely think she didn't deserve Jack's death. I bawled my eyes out during the ending.<br/><br/>I feel like I have went in too deep but frankly speaking, this film has emotionally affected me. This is not something that I could watch for the sake of entertainment, it really means something to me. No one deserves to be taken for granted, especially that each character is fighting their own battles (Ally with insecurities and Jack with alcohol and drugs abused)<br/><br/>Last but not least, I would pay to see this film again."

","Everything about this film is brilliant and goes together perfectly. Both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's singing and acting are absolutely on point. Gaga's vocal talent has never been in doubt, and it obviously comes through here, but her performance as Ally is sensational; all the emotions her character experiences are portrayed so authentically, she really knocked it out of the park. This is also arguably Bradley Cooper's greatest performance of his career (yes, even greater than Silver Linings Playbook and American Sniper!!) as the way he presents Jack Maine, a once-great musician on the decline due to alcoholism and drug abuse, is compelling and similarly authentic. His singing is amazing as well!! It's hard to believe his lack of a musical background when you hear his voice. The chemistry between the two in their onscreen romance is about as real as it gets, setting the tone for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The way Cooper directed this movie was also immaculate. Utilizing a timeless story that had been shown onscreen three times prior to this, he draws out the emotional power contained within the storyline so beautifully. At its core, this film is a deeply affecting one, and it's presented to the audience in such a real way, without seeming fake or manipulative- as you see this the two fall in love, Ally's rise to stardom, Jack's struggles catching up with him and how it affects the dynamics between them and the rest of the characters- it all unfolds in such a gripping manner. Truly a magnificent movie musical with great songs, great acting (including from all the supporting actors, especially Sam Elliott playing Jack's brother), a deeply touching story, directed superbly and totally worthwhile seeing!!"

"VintageSoul56","8","1","1","19 October 2018"," Top Notch Acting All Around - Especially Lady Gaga
","The acting could not be beat. I've seen all 4 versions now. The chemistry between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper has all other versions beat and we are talking Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, Judy Garland and James Mason and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. All of them are mighty big shoes to fill, but the difference is Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper had the intimacy that the others lacked. Plain and simple. They were so real. I really liked how they met in this version. OMG! I won't totally spoil it, but Lady Gaga sings La Vie En Rose just as well as Edith Piaf. I was blown away. When singing this song, both sing from the heart (that goes for Cyndi Lauper too). I hope to see Lady Gaga in more movies.<br/><br/>The only problem that I had was with the timeline and pace of the script. It appeared that she was with him on his touring for maybe three concerts and then all of a sudden, she meets an agent that wants to represent her and viola! She's all of a sudden a huge up and coming star. Of course, she has to change her image in order to do this, which is unfortunate because her soul was alive when she was singing with him and solo on tour. Yeah, this is the story, I realize that, but I don't recall such a major overhaul of the lead actress in the other versions. Basically, the character becomes what Lady Gaga is today. I like Gaga when she sings ballads, old standards (awesome with Tony Bennett), that is where her talent and souls lies. Her character in the movie did tell her agent (jerk) that she didn't want to do something that her talent would be lost. That line shows a lot of integrity, so I wonder if Gaga went through that same situation when she started. Bradley Cooper was excellent as a burnt out rocker who just doesn't know why he's doing it anymore. He reminds me of both Kristofferson and Jeff Bridges in ""Crazy Heart"". He's lost his way, but still connects with the audiences, but not without a little help from booze and drugs. How old is that story? The supporting cast, Sam Elliott, Andrew Dice Clay (big surprise), Anthony Ramos and Ron Rifkin round up a good supporting cast. I have to give a shout out to the ladies that were in the beginning of the movie. All of the ladies were beautiful and the actors playing them were so talented.<br/><br/>If I were and academy award voter, I really don't know who I would start to nominate this year in the best actress category, let alone vote for the winner of the Oscar. There is going to be some stiff competition this year. I may even watch the Oscars, which I haven't done for the last few years."

As her rise to stardom , riches and fame ,ascends quicker than a rocket, her partner, who discovered her, sinks into and gets destroyed by alcoholism and drug addiction.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's performance is somewhat annoying because his scruffy, ugly facial hair never changes (he is actually a handsome man dressed up to look like Kris Kristofferson in this movie...ewww ;/), and he often mumbles through his lines. But hey, that's the way substance abusers are.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga's timing and expressions, singing are freaking amazing.<br/><br/>The motto of this movie is: There is nothing cool about alcohol/ drug addiction. Apparently, many in real life refuse to get the memo.<br/><br/>Before Lady Gaga appeared in any movies, I already knew she could act based on her appearance in one of her music videos with Beyonce a long time ago. What may be a pleasant surprise for some is the display of her musical singing versatility here. She is quite the skilled entertainer who has the whole package, similar to Madonna. Here she sings country ballads, country rock, pop and French cabaret showtunes with such conviction it might surprise some people."

","I knew going into the cinema that this was going to be a good film, but when I left I considered it an amazing film. The events and music transpiring on the screen were so engaging and emotionally raw. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both delivered from the bottom of their hearts. Cooper portrayed a broken man so powerfully and in the Director's chair he masterfully connected ideas of alcoholism and family trauma with jealousy, love and depression. Lady Gaga impressively came out of her shell and presented a beautfiul natural version of herself. Her acting was on par with Cooper and it was amazing to see her transform throughout the movie to a pop icon. Their chemistry was so well suited and never failed ro be convincing. The ending certainly gave me butterflies when she went back to her natural look and sung Cooper's song to her with vehement pain and sadness. The delivery of this ending scene clung to me when leaving the cinema. In terms of music, it was delightful to see the two actors thrive on their own and then blow the crowds (within and without the movie) away with their dual performance of ""Shallow"". The cinematography was excellent too, with the camera not shying away from close up shots that got right in the thick of the singing. As much as this film was gut wrenching, it was also nice to have some natural humour- nothing felt forced. ""A Star is Born"" was an intriguing look into fame and addiction in the music industry whilst also serving as a beautfiul and convicing love story. I cannot wait to purchase the blu ray and add it to my collection!"

"esiefring","8","1","1","15 October 2018"," A Star is Born Remake - Gaga & Cooper were phenomenal
","First, I'd like to say that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are both phenomenal in this movie. They both deserve Oscar nominations. I'd recommend the movie to everyone. <br/><br/>I watched the 1976 remake with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the week before the new movie. This was good and bad because I did compare the two versions, with the understanding that the newest remake is being made 42 years later. <br/><br/>Contains Spoilers:
My biggest complaint/critique of the new film is that they did not show Ally's character's initial reaction to finding out that Jack has died. This is THE biggest missing element of the movie. That reaction is one that brings the audience in and is the most relatable emotional scene for any movie. I'm not sure why they didn't include this, but it was a big missed opportunity for acting and for the audience. I thought I'd be bawling at the end of the movie but that scene to connect me with the characters fell short. The 1976 version shows Streisand finding him after his death and how she reacts, which brings a lot of emotion into that scene. They also show her breaking down more after the day of his death in more depth. I get very involved in movies and needed that scene. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's character of Jack was much better in this version. Since Cooper directed, produced, and acted it makes sense that he would make that character more dynamic and relatable. Kristoffersons character in the previous film behaved horribly more often, without much detail about his past. Cooper brought the role to an understanding level by giving the audience a look into his troubled past, rather than only blaming fame for his substance abuse. <br/><br/>Another opinion of my own is that I personally didn't love that they made Ally's character into a pop star. To me, it felt too much like ""Lady Gaga"" since she is a pop star. I do understand that the music industry is like that in today's world so I feel that is why it went in that direction.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was great. It was a modern version of the original story. The chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is undeniable. I've seen Gaga in AHS, but was very impressed with her acting in this movie. Not to mention the singing, both actors wowed in their singing capabilities. I hope to see this movie and the actors win some Oscars."
"jamaica_sands","10","1","1","14 October 2018"," More than I hoped for
","First I must say I REALLY dislike love/romance movies. Second, Ive never seen the previous versions of this movie.
I was really on the fence about spending $50 to go see this movie (admission/snacks). 
On the one hand I adore Lady Gaga. I had no doubt in her acting ability after seeing her in AHS season 5. Everything she touches turns to gold. On the other hand I like Cooper depending on the role he plays and the look for that role. So its very hit and miss for me as far as he is concerned.
This was a spectacular movie! 
Coopers character was scruffy, rough around the edges, relatable. (The hottest Ive ever seen him look in my opinion because I prefer the more ""everyday Joe"" look over polished perfection. His hair was longer, which I also prefer) 
Gaga's character was played perfectly. She had me in tears the first time she took the stage. Her ability to bring you into what her character is feeling was superb. 
While both did a great job playing their characters Gaga seemed to bring more depth to her character than Cooper. Or perhaps it was simply written to be that way.
Cooper did an amazing job directing. 
I was sobbing at the end (ladies, skip the mascara and eye liner, seriously). I dont know how the previous versions of the movie ended, the final seconds, but the last few seconds could not have been chosen any better. When the screen went black we all just sat there. Normally when a movie ends people immediately get up, grab their stuff and start for the exit. Not this movie. About 50 of us there. We all just sat there. We sat there so long I wished I had timed it because it was so unusual. I want to say it was 2-3 min before the first person even stirred. I know that doesnt sound long but next time you go to a movie watch how fast people leave.
Definitely a movie to see! I look forward to seeing Gaga on screen more and hope Cooper makes great directing and acting choices moving forward."
"graveyardhang","Null","1","1","12 October 2018"," Initial Reaction as a Gaga Fan
","I'm a big fan of Lady Gaga, and with this movie there is no doubt that she is not only a technically incredible musician, but a human being who puts so much emotion and soul into song that it's impossible not to break your heart. My favorite parts of ""A Star Is Born"" are the performances where she absolutely gives it her all and bares her soul. The scene where she and Cooper sing ""Shallow"" is so well done and has so much momentum- it has the great set up of him surprising her with a love arrangement of a song she wrote and sang him. Bradley Cooper did a great job handling this scene, too, it's all a little haphazard and dazed, the lights of the show changing colors on Ally's awestruck face. It had a great effect of putting you in the moment and making it feel alive, which is the same effect it has for Jackson, Cooper's character, it makes him feel alive for the first time in a long time. Then there is the final song ""I'll Never Love Again"", sung by Ally after Jackson's suicide but written by Jackson shortly before he died. This is another beautiful sequence as Gaga absolutely bares every emotion she has left in her body, then the scene switches to the delicate moment when Jackson first played the song for Ally. The whole ending of this movie will bring you to tears regardless of your thoughts on the rest of it. The acting here is impeccable and at the very least Oscar-nomination worthy. When Jennifer Hudson won for ""Dreamgirls"" in 2006, some criticized the win saying that it was just good singing. But when the singing is truly that good, how can you not reward it? I feel like we may have a similar case here with Gaga, she's great and convincing in the dramatic dialogue scenes, but it's the songs that sell her performance. She's not just singing, she's acting with the entirety of her being.<br/><br/>Whew. Despite all that, I found the storytelling to ring false in some key places for me.<br/><br/>I couldn't quite buy the love story. I had a hard time believing that Ally would have no reservations about being with and eventually marrying someone who she knows is a major alcoholic, especially when we're introduced to her as a rational, no-nonsense kind of girl who lays down the line in her home, cleaning up after her wacky father and even telling him that she doesn't want to get involved with Jackson because ""he's a drunk"". This is disregarded as they fall deeply in love with each other. I would think Jackson's alcoholism would be a hesitation or at least a struggle for Ally in falling for him, but it's all a big romance in the beginning. I could also understand how Ally might fall so hard that rationality goes out the window for this man, but we didn't really see any disregarding of her reservations, it was just like all of a sudden there were none.<br/><br/>The other major oversight on the character of Ally I felt was the course of her rise to fame. First of all, in the world of this film, which seems to be present day, I didn't believe that the world would suddenly want to see a girl who initially got recognition for singing her heart out at a concert with Jackson Maine as a generic pop star. I would think people would want to see more of the brown-haired girl who bares her soul at a piano. But more importantly, on a character level, I couldn't figure out what Ally thought of this re-invention herself. At one point, when her manager has her train to do a cheesy dance routine, she tells him that she doesn't want to lose the part of herself that has real talent. But then we're told that the ridiculous orange hair was Ally's idea, and she even tells Jackson that she thought a performance she did with it, to a dance-y disposable song, ""rocked""- and of course she vehemently defends her lyric ""why you come around me with an ass like that"" in the bathtub confrontation scene. I felt this abrupt a shift in Ally's image and music warranted more of a closer look at why Ally herself was allowing this or wanted this. During the scene where Jackson confronts Ally about her ridiculous music while she's in the bathtub, before calling her ugly, he says something like ""you thought you were ugly and you're not ugly and now you want everyone's approval."" This was a great, telling line. That would be a reason why Ally might want to be a sexy pop star, her insecurities. But we never quite know if that's the case from Ally herself and she is shown to have both reservations about her career and comfort in it. Ally strikes you in the beginning as all-natural in her music and someone who would fight against anyone trying to make her disingenuine. So is she being pushed around and preyed on by label execs and succumbing under the pressure? Is she herself determined to be this sex symbol with dorky, albeit hit songs to defy her insecurities once and for all? These songs are clearly meant to be shallow and near-parody of bad modern pop compared to the soul-baring ballads of the film. Why wouldn't she fight against that? Or if she likes it, and wants it, then why? I felt her perspective here was crucial and missing!<br/><br/>The last part of the film I had a problem with was Jackson's suicide. We saw that Jackson was an alcoholic, but his reveal at one point in the movie when he's in rehab that he tried to kill himself at age 12 came as a shock to me. It didn't immediately make sense to me why he had been suicidal all his life. I didn't think his character or backstory was fleshed out enough for him abruptly committing suicide after being newly sober and reuniting happily with his wife to make sense, so it struck me as overly melodramatic. It would have probably made more sense to me if he'd simply turned back to drinking or drugs after Ally's manager's triggering berating of him. But his apparent lifelong suicidal ideation was introduced late in the movie and to me, felt too fuzzy and not delved-into-enough for his death by his own hand to make sense other than for melodramatic effect, which is cheap, even if it's followed by a knockout Gaga performance.<br/><br/>I am in the minority here and I am disappointed that I am. I do believe there are some great elements to this movie, namely a few songs and Gaga's emotional singing and acting. I ultimately just couldn't believe the story."

","Post edited: ok so I originally wasn't super impressed by this film, but i haven't stopped thinking about it for a week. I gave it a low score because the end messed me up so bad and I was angry about it. Am I still messed up? Yes. Am I still angry? Yes. But the end is not worth taking four point off. Only 2.<br/><br/>Original review: 
Is this the best film of 2018? So far yes. Is that saying something? Not really. I haven't seen much that has impressed me this year. Now, that being said, was this film phenomenal and worth the hype? No. I have seen 'the greatest showman' about 30 times! THAT is a phenomenal film. This is another cliche film (that has been done 3 times, mind you) about a popular boy falling for the 'ugly' girl. In this case, the popular boy happens to be a very famous musician who sees potential in someone no one else does. The first 2/3 of the film are sweet, (albeit creepy as cooper's character pursues Gaga in a stalker like fashion that would get the police called on him if he wasn't famous) the love story is beautiful and the cooper and Gaga do have chemistry. That being said, the film is FAR too long and there's a tragic event that happens at the end of the film (I won't spoil it but again, this movie has been done 3 times. It's not hard to figure out) and a character says it's nobody's fault. I disagree. As someone who suffers from mental health and depression, it was EVERYBODY'S FAULT. Not enough care was taken of this character. His problems were trivilized and he was treated like a burden. I just want to remind everyone alcoholism and drug addiction is no joke, it's an actual illness and to make someone feel less for it is wrong. If I sound angry and like I took the film personally, I am and I did. I hope this film opens up the conversation of mental health more, but the way it's being buzzed, all that's being talked about is Lady Gaga (who was noting special by the way. A singer plays a singer. Big stretch.) i hope Bradley cooper wins all
The awards for his wonderfully sensitive but complicated performance of Jackson, but I won't hold my breathe. I also would say if you struggle with mental issues like I do, I DO NOT recommend this film."

","A Star is Born is a love story that's both beautiful and heartwrenching. It's also a film where all of the stars and planets aligned... truly exquisite! About as close to perfection that I've seen. I can say I've seen 3 perfect films... this is EXTREMELY CLOSE. Gaga was otherworldly as she was stunning stripped down to her natural talent. She's going to win an Oscar. She's already a past nominee. As for Cooper this is the best I've EVER seen him! He embodied Maine... everything was so fluid. This is the sexiest I've ever seen him as well. Stating LOUD and CLEAR that he is the best Hollywood has to offer... he's been nominated for acting 3 times now! This is his year. His vision and eye for the film was in laser focus... making me wonder why he hasn't directed till now. The supporting cast were not simply used to carry to the next scene they added depth and story. The music was phenomenal... can't wait to see Shallow performanced at The Oscars since it will most definitely be nominated for Best Song. This is a movie that isn't just for Gaga fans... I forgot it was even her. It's a film for those who have been in love, those with inner demons, those who have had heartbreak. I don't want to have spoilers but if you see a film this Fall this is it... and Bohemian Rhapsody as well. The best films this year so far... A Star is Born, Blackkklansman, A Quiet Place, and OF COURSE Black Panther. Not many get to experience the kind of love Jack and Ally do... I envy them... and pity them all in the same."
"sonicheze8","7","1","1","6 October 2018"," Well-made directial debut from Bradley Cooper
","Firstly, the score is something that I'll need to get out of the way before I can talk about the rest of the movie. As someone who came into the movie without knowing much about the movie other than the actors and basic synopsis, the music is something of a artistic piece on its own. The amount of original music provided in this movie is astounding and remarkable. The music each sounded different and had its own identity. The only downside to the audience is that without listening to the music before watching the movie you might not dive straight into the emotional pieces of each music; what I'm trying to say is that music on it's own has to be digested, most movies do this by replaying the same then music over and over again until the final culmination, so that the audience will learn the songs acute notes and melodies. This movie I found didn't do this, it played each music like it's own scene and that is something I can respect although it might not have the same emotional weight to people who hear it for the first time. I'm not saying the music is bad, I'm just saying that it's good but I could not fully experience each piece fully.<br/><br/>Second, the acting: I think Bradley Cooper played his role phenomenally well, and the same goes for Lady Gaga considering this is her first full transition to acting. Everybody acted well, the characters were believable, there weren't any breaks due to poor character decisions. So not much to add here.<br/><br/>I think the directing is excellent, Bradley Cooper has a vision for each scene and directs some of them extraordinarily well, although there were some atypical scenes, due to the large time scope of the movie. The narrative is tightly woven and has a clear beginning to end. <br/><br/>So the movie is quite polished and has a few scenes that really stood out to me, so what sets it apart from perfection? Well, my biggest gripe other than my first point about the music is that, it's quite un-entertaining, there wasn't a real plot line that hooks, the ending had already been hinted at in the title, the scenes cut from song to song to the romance. I didn't really feel much for the movie although I could respect the material itself. Another point is that it didn't really end much of its sub plot points which I expect is because they wanted to raise these questions like, is there a different in meaningful expression between pop and country/rock, issue with fame or a bad childhood. None of these were seen to be settled in the film. Which is both a good and bad thing. <br/><br/>To conclude, it's a good movie, just not quite unique in exploring new ideas, having its own style, and very fun to watch, thus not perfect. But don't let me stop you from watching, this is just my opinion."

Lady Gaga's performance blew me away. Her voice is a gift from the Gods that she makes seem so effortless. Their chemistry feels real and raw and sucks you in, rooting for them the whole time.

"Gresh854","7","1","1","5 October 2018"," An Impressive Directorial Debut From Bradley Cooper
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, A Star is Born, is, well, a beyond impressive directorial debut. This is another one of those amiable films, that has that charisma, that emits rare, unworldly sensations of comfort, welfare, and empathy. Heart and soul, it's solely touching. <br/><br/>By far, the most memorable aspect of this film that heaps of cinephilia's will be commending for years and years from now, is the on-screen junction between Bradley Cooper and Stefani Germanotta's-AKA Lady Gaga's-characters. It's unreal how real their love felt as unreal as that may realistically suggest. Cooper's devotion to storytelling and character absorption is not only laudable, but also, genuinely authentic. <br/><br/>Hats off to you once again Cooper. You are an acting master. Getmanotta you are also an acting master, which I was shocked to find to be true, in the case that you are indeed an acting master of the mastery of acting and whatnot-I don't look into the proper terminologies I just ""say""... Oh, and Sam Elliot-no surprise; the man is a legend-killed it. The man is turbulent in his role as an old but dismayed friend. <br/><br/>The dialogue is ""spot-on."" This is like, Silver Linings Playbook dialogue leveled ""spot-on."" We can assume that Mr.Cooper and his writing team have learned a lot of calligraphy skills from David O. Russell. I appreciated the accessible amount of F-bombs as well. Don't judge me.<br/><br/>And that climax. There's a very very particular sequence towards the finale that was perfectly edited, perfectly lit, and just wow, for sure, perfectly executed. Without question a cinematic highlight of 2018.<br/><br/>And yessir, the music is absolutely chic-minus the song, ""Why Did You Do That?"" which I assumed was initiated in order to mock our typical ""Pop Music"" standards of today (if it's not, forget what I just said or don't @ me). It's inviting, electrifying, and notably appealing even to a rock-and-roll finatic like myself.<br/><br/>This is not sponsored, but I felt as if this service is vastly relevant to one of the major, presented topics in A Star is Born, so I'll self-sponsor it. If you're currently dealing with substance abuse issues or disorders or you know of somebody close to you that is, I highly recommend visiting atoncenter. They are a profoundly sufficient drug and alcohol recovery program that is on duty 24 hours a day. You can't start helping others until you begin learning to help yourself. <br/><br/>Is A Star is Born a bit predictable at times? Yes. But despite this, being able to witness an early-screening crowd of theater members who were verbally locked-on, inflexiably engaged, warmly reactive, and sentimentally invested in this angelic story, was such a feast-especially when you know what one film can do to one's life. It's always pleasing to behold the reaction of numerous of viewers experiencing an out-of-the world ordeal. Cooper, you did a damn good job. You devious man, you almost made me tear and I hate you so much for it. (Verdict: A-)"

"Horst_In_Translation","4","7","19","16 October 2018"," ""The easy way out"" or ""How Lady Gaga was born""
","""A Star Is Born"" is a new American 2018 movie and the most recent take on the ""zero to hero"" story line involving a young female up-and-comer and a struggling older male musician. The most known of these is probably the one starring Judy Garland. These over2 hours we got here give a modern overhaul to the story. Let me start this review by saying that this is the first version of the story I have seen so far. And sadly, I was not impressed at all. I know this movie had been in the making for a long time and I remember reading years ago about it already. For example, Clint Eastwood was attached as director at some point. Eastwood worked with Bradley Cooper not too long ago, which became quite a success for both of them and I am sure Cooper took something with him from seeing Eastwood direct American Sniper. Eventually, this film here became the very first directorial effort for Bradley Cooper himself and he also plays the male protagonist. I have seen people advertize him as supporting, but it's not true. There is no breakthrough for Lady Gaga's character here without Cooper's and in terms of screentime he is also clearly at the very center of the film. But sadly, I do not have too much to say about Cooper here. Or lets say not too much positive. I think the character offered a whole lot more than he put on display here. Eventually, he is nothing more than a forgettable poor man's version of Jeff Bridges in his pretty impressive Oscar-winning portrayal of a musician struggling with addiction, love and his profession. So this film we have here could have been much better with another male lead, maybe an older one although I understand given the romance element they had to keep him relatively close to Lady Gaga to make it work. Now as for Gaga, yes it may be her big breakthrough role on the big screen, but we should not say she is a complete newcomer to acting. She actually is a Golden Globe winner on the small screen already. Therefore I would say what she did with the character here was good and her character is probably the more memorable from the two at the center of the story, but she is far from great either. Certainly not on Emma Stone's level in La La Land for example if we compare recent female-centered stardom movies. She is fun to watch early on thanks to the transformation compared to who she is as a music artist and honestly I am not a fan of her (recent) music really and also not of all the styles she has been promoting over the years. But she does look really good early on in this film before she basically makes it big and becomes the icon she is in real life. So good performance from her, but not great. I like Sam Elliott and he is a nice addition here too and a scene stealer in most of his scenes (which is not too difficult given Cooper's mediocrity), but it's not really bigger or better than anything else he has done in his long career. Should not be a contender for Best Supporting Actor this year, the nomination could be a bit much already. And the exact same comment fits Lady Gaga too.<br/><br/>The writing isn't great either. Gaga's introduction scene in the bathroom was cringeworthy and there was nothing to it except a cheap attempt to show us how high-profile lawyers want her, but she is too wild and free-spirited for them and of course the wedding reference that she immediately accepts Cooper's character's proposal later on. As for Cooper, his career collapsed way too fast to seem realistic I must say. As for the music, there are one or two good songs in here I would say and Lady Gaga's performances aren't bad. A bit of a pity, the best music moment of the movie was used in the trailer already and after you've seen it so many times before other films, then it's just not cutting the cake anymore. Shame. It could have been special. The reference I made in the title of this review, the first 4 words, means that I personally felt that they really took a safe route in making this film. There is not too much wrong, but there is also no greatness and it feels like they were never even going for said greatness. Yes they could have failed and people could have laughed about this becoming a cheap joke, a parody of a classic, and while it is probably no such thing, it feels as nothing remotely inspirational or anything near that despite a story that really could have delivered in that department. The scenes that stay in the mind the most are the ones that are in your face like of course the Grammy stage escalation or the bathroom argument and 2 or 3 others, maybe also the first meeting when Gaga performs and sings in French. This is also one scene when I recognized there was some weak editing in here, some very bizarre shots at Cooper's face that came out of nowhere and did look fairly amateurish. As for the ending, you could say it was brave they pulled through with it, but then again, it was probably only because that's what happened in the original. It had almost zero emotional impact on me I must say and it was not half as touching as they intended it to be. This also had to do with the chandelier hanging suicide reference earlier that felt really rushed in and made no sense at all just as preparation for the final scene involving Cooper's character. I have my own background with alcohol abuse in the family and still the scenes on this difficult subject about Cooper's character and his father felt so weak and forgettable to me and it all was for the sake of it and there was never the true emotional meaning to it and this includes the words of Cooper's character to Elliott's character too. Truly disappointing outcome I must say. I see this film is the frontrunner for Best Picture now and I am really surprised by that. I have seen many many clearly superior movies this year already. There is nothing particularly awards worthy about it and every Oscar nomination it scores (and it certainly will score several) is one too many. I give ""A Star Is Born"" a thumbs-down, definitely a missed opportunity on giving modern quality to an old story. Do not watch."

"LloydBayer","9","4","9","11 October 2018"," A Star is born isn't just a great remake, it's really about Cooper and Gaga's unseen talents that makes this one of the best films of the year
","Remakes can be risky. While films have been remade within short proximity of preceding films, there have been iterations that once stood out but faded away with time. This is one such film where the story is well known but it's popularity rose and fell generations ago. Which is where debut director Bradley Cooper finds himself up against his first challenge - did we really need a fourth remake of A Star is Born?<br/><br/>The answer is resoundingly affirmative and all you need is the first ten minutes to be reeled in hook, line and sinker. But as much as this film is an absorbing crowd-pleaser, this is also an incredibly moving obituary to the fallen heroes in show business. Anyone who has seen the previous films should be aware how this will end and although Cooper respects the original story, his approach is fresh and captivating. Even so, Cooper's greatest triumph is the spell this film casts on its audience. There is magic and chemistry, which together brews a huge bowl of soul. <br/><br/>The first half of A Star is Born is absolutely charming in the boy-meets-girl department. Playing an alternative country music rock star, this is Cooper faced with his second challenge - as the lead character he had to also learn to sing convincingly well. But as the story goes, Cooper's Jackson Maine is past his prime. There is little joy left in electrifying a sold-out concert. There is nothing more to pursue but addiction and self abuse. Ironically, and throughout the film, the chorus to Jackson's main song plays out ""It takes a lot to change a man and it takes a lot to try; maybe it's time to let the old ways die"". It doesn't happen. Not until Jackson is smitten the moment he sees Ally (Lady Gaga), an unknown singer performing at a drag bar. What follows is a new and fresh take on a timeless love story of two souls on opposite trajectories but whose paths are destined to intersect. <br/><br/>There's a perfect blend of magnetic pull and charm between two characters, and then between said characters and the audience. This is known as screen chemistry but it isn't always convincing. We thought Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were dynamite together in Silver Linings Playbook. Then came Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's widely appreciated chemistry in the (almost) Academy Award winning Best Picture La La Land. In A Star is Born, Cooper and Gaga are not only incredibly convincing, their character bonding happens like street magic - right before our eyes but never really sure when it happens. And if this isn't convincing for the hardest of cynics, wait till you see them sing together. There can't be anything more real than the goosebumps that follow. Music as the essence of this film rings true but the story looses some traction in the second half once focus turns to Ally as the new supernova in showbiz. It's a stall for time until the inevitable happens and why A Star is Born is a heartfelt reach-out to the oft unseen and undesirable effects of being an adored entertainer. But as films like The Artist and Birdman have taught us, every star has a cycle from birth to death. Fundamentally, this film serves as a austere reminder of just that. 
 
Although Cooper has starred in some big films before, he has never performed as a singer (let alone film director). And although Lady Gaga has won multiple Grammy awards as a singer, she has never performed theatrically. This could have been the most disastrous pairing in cinema history but it's another challenge that Cooper has pulled off, albeit with near-exceptional results. There have been many before, even music divas like Madonna and Whitney Houston who attempted crossing over into cinema. Not many have succeeded. For Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, or Lady Gaga the pop star, this is the first and we certainly hope not the last. Insecure yet audacious, vulnerable yet spirited, Gaga's Ally is the literal and figurative definition of an underdog making it big in show business. Together, they make it worth every penny you pay to watch this film and it's a film you never want to end. But be warned. As the co-writer and co-producer of this film, Cooper doesn't stray far from the original story. If anything, the conclusion is far more overwhelming than expected. But backed by a strong supporting cast and a terrific list of songs, this version is not only the best compared to the previous films but also one of the best films of the year."

A Star is Born owned this, making me feel empty, fiery, uncomfortable, and even hopeful, all in its 2 hour run time. It tells a gripping story that is relatable to every person in one way or another.

"Lejink","6","3","6","13 January 2019"," Fourth Time Around
","I've recently watched both the 1937 non-musical version of this well-worn riches-to-rags / rags to riches story which starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March and the first musical version with Judy Garland and James Mason from 1954 while the most recent Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristoffersson vehicle is also fairly strong in my memory. This version, directed by and starring Bradley Cooper as the ageing country-rock star whose career is about to hit the skids but who introduces current pop star Lady Gaga as the rising talent he accidentally runs into seems to very much be a remake of that Streisand showcase rather than the other two.<br/><br/>Like Kristoffersson, he is a bearded, grizzled rocker, with a more rock-oriented name of Jackson rather than Norman Maine and more drunken, drug-addled episodes it seems than sober ones, who when we first see him is out of his face at an arena gig but just about holding it together. After the gig he crashes in a bar where it's of all things, drag night, but the one true female singer is part time barmaid Ally, played by Gaga who naturally wows the crowd and in particular Maine with her solo spot. So they hook up afterwards, he finds she writes her own songs and invites her to sing one of them as an encore at his next gig. As you'd expect, she goes over big, they become a couple afterwards and the whole cycle of her inexorable rise crossing with his inevitable fall drives the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In all this and more, like the lovers' bath scene, it strongly resembles the 1976 version and obviously can't fail to include the bathetic scene where he drunkenly ruins her Grammy Award presentation night but makes a big mistake I feel in not ending on one of cinema's best ever finishing lines which served its three predecessors well enough, as here Gaga sings a heartfelt piano ballad he was working on before he died. I also missed the ""Mr Ally"" jibe from the earlier films which helped fuel Maine's self-destruction, not that I was expecting a scene by scene remake but in omitting it don't feel it was replaced by anything substantial, certainly not the hackneyed relationship between Maine and his brother.<br/><br/>Both leads are strong in their parts with Cooper displaying suitable rock star credentials and Gaga proving a natural, when speaking as well as singing her words. However, a fair bit of the dialogue fell on my ears as cliched and the songs themselves, though serviceable, don't scream out classic to me, certainly nothing to rival ""The Man That Got Away"" or even ""Evergreen"".<br/><br/>I know I keep returning to the three preceding versions but can't help myself and perhaps it would have been better if I hadn't seen them so recently. Anyway, to me it was about on a par with Streisand's version which ranks it below the first two versions. Wonder when the next remake will take place as it inevitably will?"

Then it premiered and I have to say, wow... I can't believe the hype, it makes no sense.<br/><br/>Bradley's performance is solid... Yes, but I didn't buy his role, he looked like an imitation of whatever he thought a country musician is in real life and didn't nail it.
His addiction is poorly developed during the whole movie, he just portraits the character like a spoiled brat who barely struggles with his addictions.<br/><br/>Gaga's, on the other hand... I understand it's her first movie and she's not an actress, but we can't pretend she's great at it.
Her expressions are stiff, her face is so rigid in many scenes...
We have to separate our feelings for Gaga and her music from her career as an actress. She has a great voice, but don't ask her to show emotions in her expressions, this movie shows she can't do it.<br/><br/>It's entertaining, but definitely not Oscar material."

Lady Gaga is an uninspiring actress who fails to convince that she is in love with anything. Her dreary performance is of an actress who looks like she is trying to remember her lines and indeed that fact she should be showing emotion when delivering them. Cooper tries to carry the film with a method approach to his acting but you often find yourself trying to decipher what his mumbled words actually were.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good and the music is of high quality, but I guess that's what you expect of someone with Gaga's vocal ability. Cooper has a great rock country voice and will no doubt will be releasing album after album following this.<br/><br/>This is not a classic and is not even a film worthy of a second watch.

One night after finishing one of his gigs, he demands his driver takes him to a bar where he continues to get drunk and enjoy the night. Here he finds a young female singer named Ally who impresses him with her outstanding performance. Jack decides to help the young female singer to find fame.<br/><br/>From this moment on, our two leads will deal with multiple challenges. Jack is a man struggling with alcoholism and on the flip side Ally will soon discover what life is like when the spotlight of fame shines brightly on her. No matter the challenges, the two seem to have so much in common, particularly in regards to the romance they share for one another.<br/><br/>For those who are not aware, this film is in fact a remake, making this the fourth time A Star Is Born has been made. I personally have not seen the previous films nor was I aware of the film's storyline prior to seeing this film in cinemas. I deliberately went into my screening as blind to the details of the story as possible to gain the most from the film.<br/><br/>To put down it simply, A Star is Born is brilliant, powerful, dramatic and yet incredible touching.<br/><br/>My favourite element of the film is the on screen relationship between actors Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga. Both of these actors are 100% believable in the characters they play, as is the relationship the two share.<br/><br/>Another element is the film's music and soundtrack which I found to be rather delightful. During the screening of this film, I found myself tapping my foot to many tracks performed by both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. I would imagine many people will be purchasing (or streaming) the motion picture soundtrack after viewing.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that not only is Actor Bradley Cooper taking a lead role, but he is also sitting behind the camera as director. Being a drama film, there are so many moments that are truly hard hitting and powerful to see. Without giving film spoilers, this is all I can I really say. I will state that his directional work here is truly on point and impressed me.<br/><br/>I would also love to give a special mention to actor Sam Elliot who surprised me with an applaud worthy performance as supporting actor.<br/><br/>Overall, A Star Is Born is a film that hits many chords including outstanding acting performances, musical numbers and jaw dropping dramatic (and tense) moments on screen. The less you know about the film in advance the better. Sure, some of the film's themes can be hard hitting, but rest assured there is nothing to regret here.<br/><br/>9.3/10

","This is not a movie I would have picked to watch but saw it with family. It was INCREDIBLE. There are some predictable plot points but also some unpredictable ones. The acting and soundtrack are outstanding. Bradley Cooper trained for 18 months so he could sing all his parts in this movie. The only reason this isn't a 10/10 is because the middle is a little slow moving."
"Gordon-11","Null","3","6","11 November 2018"," A really powerful experience
","I heard good things about this film, but I dismissed them as I thought it was just because Lady Gaga was in it.<br/><br/>After watching it, I have to say it's even better than what people say it is. The story is very engaging and powerful. The songs are beautiful, and the visual presentation of every scene is great. The story flows naturally, and draws you in. Very very good story telling.<br/><br/>There is a scene when Bradley is waiting for Lady Gaga to finish rehearsal, the foreground is the background while the foreground is the background. It's clever and intriguing. I find this film a powerful experience."
"Marko454","8","3","6","31 October 2018"," A Review From A Guy
","This was a pretty good movie. It was a real tearjerker toward the end. If I was capable of emotion, I might have cried. But seriously, this should have been the Lady Gaga story, and they should of gotten rid of that annoying dude (AKA Bradley Cooper). He was just not likable. He was kind of ugly, dirty, hairy, and a real nuisance. When he pissed himself, that was it for me. Just kill him off already! Sorry About the spoiler."
"smirnoff103","5","3","6","29 October 2018"," Just OK.
","The movie was OK for me, without Lady Gaga the movie would even be ""average"" and wouldn't have so many media attention / visitors I guess.
Her performance is definitely outstanding and her voice can be quite powerful as could have been heard previously on her Tony Bennett collaboration. Probably the story should have been a little bit more elaborated, then I could have been a ""movie of the year"" candidate.
The shots are nicely done, even the ""long"" shots seem not boring. I liked the ""on stage"" feeling you have with the sound that was nicely done. But I didn't like all these thousands lens flare during the movie.
I'm glad I've seen the movie but it wasn't a memorable one."
"gmjerrymack8","5","3","6","18 October 2018"," Story Gets Lost in Midstream
","I give this a five only because Lady Gaga turns in a heartwarming performance. Her singing and acting are beautiful to watch. On the other hand Bradley Cooper has the onerous job of playing a self-absorbed, deeply troubled old rock star. Not that he fails to do it well, but that it drags the movie into a painfully drug out tale of a loser. A good half hour could have been cut out of this part. And then the chemistry just isn't there. Gaga, a vivacious, smart, talented young woman, falls for a guy so stuck on himself he can hardly talk in full sentences. The music was great, but the story line grew more and more painful to watch."
"renoneal38","8","3","6","13 October 2018"," A Great romance
","This was a great movie and a great romance. Lady's GaGa was in her element in her role as Ally, and Bradley Cooper in his directing debut was equally as good. One thing I would say is they could have pieced together their relationship a little better. Added a little more depth to it, while building on the music too. I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it be seen, I am just a drama junkie and like to see things pieces together."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>In a world filled with disappointing reboots, sequels and prequels, A Star Is Born is a franchise built on critically-acclaimed remakes. The 1937 original film was a phenomenal success, and it received tons of awards and nominations, as the next two remakes (1954 and 1976) also did. So, Bradley Cooper had a tremendously tough job, especially since he is both the director, co-writer and male protagonist.<br/><br/>He proves that not only he is an outstanding actor but also a pretty good director. He definitely has a bright future regarding this role, and he knows it. However, he undoubtedly shines as Jackson Maine, probably delivering his career-best performance. The range and emotion that he is able to bring to his character are Oscar-worthy. In fact, everyone deserves massive credit for what they have accomplished.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga has shown in the past that she can be a very compelling actress, but I can't remember the last one to receive such a perfect character like Ally is for Gaga. I mean, it's not like Ally is Gaga, but it's undeniable the ease and comfort that the latter has in dealing with her character's personality. Despite this, she still surprises me and delivers such a beautiful and genuine display. I can also see her getting some nominations, but so far no one can beat Toni Collette on Hereditary.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a lot of people are going to overlook what might be the clearest award to give this year: Sam Elliot (Bobby) as Supporting Actor. When one of the most heartfelt and touching moments of the film comes from a no-dialogue scene with Elliot merely backing up his car, you know he's got the award in his pocket. Brilliant performance, filled with seamless acting. The biggest praise I can give to a movie's acting is that everything feels authentic and honest. It never crossed my mind that I was watching fictional characters because both the actors and the script depict life in such a ... lifelike way.<br/><br/>Cooper and Gaga's chemistry is palpable, and that alone carries the entire story. As expected, since this isn't an original story (this sort of screenplay has been tackled hundreds of times), it gets a bit too long during the second act, becoming repetitive in its events and predictable. Nonetheless, the protagonists are so remarkably written and represented by such astonishing actors, that it is impossible to become bored. Every dialogue has meaning, every character moment is essential, and I couldn't get tired of watching Jackson and Ally going through their relationship.<br/><br/>As I wrote above, Cooper's direction is pretty great. After reading some of his interviews and understanding how he filmed some scenes with such a low budget, I can't help but get genuinely proud of his work. From the chill-inducing stages with huge audiences to the uncut spectacles, he is a man who understands the craft. Everything is real. The stages, the spectators, the live concert ... Even if it wasn't live and they were lip-syncing, it's still jaw-droppingly impressive.<br/><br/>My only issue regarding those on-stage scenes is the excessive use of shaky-cam. I understand that it might be necessary maybe to hide Cooper's inevitable mistakes playing the guitar or even his singing, but it reached a point where it was really giving me a headache. Despite this, I can't recall the last film that had so many original songs exclusively written for itself.<br/><br/>As a music lover, I can't help but praise the marvellous songs and their passionate lyrics. Lady Gaga is one of the best voices of this generation, and she delivers some beautiful vocals. If Bradley Cooper's voice really sounds like that (apparently he went through years of training), then he's not human. If he was just lip-syncing, well ... He's a brilliant actor, then. Either way, the emotions and chills that the songs are able to generate are quite real, and I can't wait to listen to the whole soundtrack again.<br/><br/>This movie has a beautiful message, and nowadays it feels that films no longer focus on that. Cooper and his team of writers achieved a fantastic screenplay which tells such a meaningful narrative. It has everything, from romantic, happy and musically amazing moments to more dramatically profound, sad and tragic scenes. Admittedly, it will leave a lot of people crying, and I love the ending, even if it is predictable.<br/><br/>All in all, A Star Is Born's fourth remake continues the successful tendency at reincarnating the original's essence. Bradley Cooper is a gifted actor, soon to be an Oscar-nominated one, as well as a director with a bright future. Lady Gaga proves that she can also be an actress as amazing as she is a singer and Sam Elliot is a shoe-in for Best Supporting Actor. A wonderful retelling of a tremendously emotional and dramatic story, filled with tears-inducing original songs and incredible chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who carry the whole show. Go see it, bring some tissues and prepare to become addicted to its soundtrack."

"darkreignn","8","3","6","12 October 2018"," At this point I'm jealous of Bradley Cooper
","As a self-proclaimed critic with years of experience writing movie reviews on the very prestigious website known as IMDB, I make it my personal mission to be the voice of the people. What I mean by that is, I don't like my reviews to be pretentious or filled with unnecessary commentary. When I watch a movie, I put myself into the shoes of an average moviegoer and I ask myself, ""If I wasn't a critic, would I enjoy this?"" And as I was watching ""A Star Is Born,"" I began to realize that if I was an average moviegoer, I would really love this film. The acting is practically perfect from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, who portrays a drug addicted alcoholic to perfection. The directing is immaculate, filled with gorgeous, beautiful, personal, intimate moments that allow the romance to practically burst from the screen. And the soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard in a film; Bradley Cooper not only can act, not only looks like an angel from Heaven, but the man can sing like nobody's business. However, even though I can recognize all of these things, on a personal level, I haven't left a film feeling so empty since I saw ""Split,"" and if you've read my review for ""Split"" then you'll remember me saying how I didn't want to, nor enjoy, the feeling of being emotionally gutted after the film; similarly, I didn't enjoy that feeling after this movie, either.<br/><br/>I can recognize that this movie is good. The story is compelling, the music is lovely, the acting is top-notch, and the directing by Bradley Cooper is immaculate. There were so many moments that also sent chills through me because of how beautiful they were, in particular the first scene where Lady Gaga's character joins Bradley Cooper on stage to sing. There is a lot to love about this movie, and it's a movie not just about music and romance, but about heartache and depression, grief and loss. The movie deals with very real subjects that all of us have experienced in one way or the other. I know life isn't necessarily pretty, I recognize that life, for a lot of people, contains hardships and suffering. And I know that diseases like alcoholism and drug addiction are not glamorous. But seeing these things in this film portrayed in such an unflinching, realistic way, honestly, just bummed me out.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with my mom and my grandmother because who else would I go see a movie with, and I was very excited. In fact, my mother started to get annoyed because I felt the need to constantly remind her how excited I was to watch this movie. After the movie I didn't say a word. I felt like Bradley Cooper himself had personally reached into my soul and took out all the love and light. I felt genuinely empty. And I didn't enjoy that. <br/><br/>So, on one hand, I recognize that this movie is good, legitimately it is one of the finer movies released this year, and if you go see it you will most definitely enjoy it. However, even though I recognize that this movie is good, I cannot personally say that I enjoyed it because of the way it made me feel. For better or for worse, I felt more depressed coming out of this movie then I did going in. Regardless, I am giving this film an 8 out of 10 because I legitimately think it is a great movie, just one that will tug at your heartstrings along the way.<br/><br/>8/10"

","To have a phenomenal singer such as lady gaga manifest her acting powers in her debut and one of the best films this year is truly extraordinary! Bradley Cooper sure did his directing and more than enough even though at times I felt like the movie is just a bit too long for its sake, it still kept it momentum till the end.

"ryanbartlett-870-746486","8","3","6","12 October 2018"," Slow start, great end
","A movie that took some time to build up, but ended with a bang. Many times the movie tried to either jump right into the film or slowly try to build up background. But after about halfway the movie found its groove and ended with a great performance. 
 First time director Bradley Cooper brought an elegant take to the film. With artistic angles, and some beautifully shot shots of camera blurs and drunken guitar rifts. He made the movie feel like it wasn't his first time. He was given a great script that has obviously worked well enough in the past to use once again. And he gathered talented actors around him to succeed. Not just choosing himself, but the super talented singer Lady Gaga who in herself is not having her acting debut. Multi-talented she brought a beauty of realism as not just a singer but a relatable character to an instance that not many can relate to personally. Cooper played strong as usual. Becoming a drunken, high, talent washing his life and career away, he was right in his groove. The two of them also had great chemistry between them, showing moments together that real couples would share. 
 Overall, great detail was put into the film and into the final product. It is definitely not your average movie, but at the same time it wasn't the Oscar winner that it was close to being. It still was missing that extra something we were looking for. Whether it be the pacing at the front of the film, or some misplaced scenes or moments. It was good but not great."
"kburvant","10","3","6","12 October 2018"," Wow, just wow.

I laughed and even cried but I didn't expect it to make me reflect on so many other things. I was not a huge Lady Gaga fan before seeing this movie. I knew she was talented but her singing and acting blew me away. She was the perfect choice for this role. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that I loved this much. Bradley Cooper gave an incredible performance and outstanding directorial debut. The rest of the cast was sensational as well. I haven't seen a movie twice at a theater since I was a kid, but am planning to go back with friends next week."

Although it maybe slow to some the music and the building of the depth of each character keeps you entertained, capture my attention at a constant. Truly a masterpiece and I promise that the ending scene won't let you leave the theatre without a tear or many and will keep you thinking about it the rest of the day or night. PLEASE go and see this amazing movie, you will not regret it!"
"ShelbyTMItchell","10","3","6","12 October 2018"," Bradley Can Do It All, Lady Gaga Will Succeed on the Big Screen
","Bradley Cooper can do it all as he not just acts but sings, directs, co-wrote the screenplay, and produce as he stars as successful but troubled singer Jackson aka Jack Mane and that his inner demons to drugs and alcohol are holding his career back<br/><br/>Lady Gaga if you are not a fan of hers, is great nonetheless as she has some acting experience and does indeed sing. As Ally a struggling singer and songwriter living with her limo driver father Andrew Dice Clay in a rare dramatic performance. <br/><br/>As she quits her job, she has her friend Ramon join her and indeed, her career blossoms and that she and Jack have a romantic interest. But it can be both of their undoings both professionally and personally there.<br/><br/>It will be up there with the Oscar nods. Come February 2019. Great job and great singing.

","What often happens in the movie industry is a particular cinema is overhyped to excess. While walking into to the theater, popcorn in hand, I must admit I had my doubts. Questions began to flutter through my mind.. <br/><br/>""Could this really be as good as the critics claimed?"" <br/><br/>""What if it's just another overblown recycled project that Hollywood lazily pulled from its pile of scripts in order to make another buck?"" <br/><br/>These were just a couple of the questions that flurried through my mind while sifting through the commercials. But then it happened - the movie began to play and all of my doubt and worries proved to have been for nothing. <br/><br/>Looking through the comment thread, it seems the vast majority of people agree with my assertion that this movie far exceeded even the highest of expectations. Therefore, I do not have to do any convincing; Cooper's masterpiece has already accomplished this feat. This is indeed one of those movies that sticks in your mind, even when the last of the tissues is out and the credits are long gone. <br/><br/>*A few things that really stuck out*** <br/><br/>1). Bradley Cooper has a gift in not only acting but in creating a story that was both believable and relatable to the casual eye. His directorial debut certainly deserves much praise and hardware. <br/><br/>2). In case you forgot, Stefani (not Lady Gaga) is extremely talented. <br/><br/>3). Sam Elliot might possibly be the unsung hero in this movie. I've always been an Elliot fan, but up until now I had no idea he had this high of ceiling when it comes to the presentation of emotions he goes through in each individual scene. He doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but in the time he's given, he puts on a masterful performance. See his last encounter with Cooper for proof."

Job well done to the whole cast and crew for being able to add their own spin on such a classic tale."
"orlando-somera","8","3","6","11 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper makes an unusually impressive addition to his resume
","The story, an old one, is mostly a love story, not my usual cup of tea, but it wasn't very hard to sit through mostly because it tried for honesty and a real sense of what the music industry is like close up, and because of some great performances, particularly, Bradley's. The thing is he does a great job portraying a type we seldom see on screen, the charismatic cowboy-like man with a lot going for him, who has serious shortcomings in his ability to deal with rather ordinary troubles. It's an oddly southern sort of combination though in this film the character's from Arizona.<br/><br/>Bradley's performance is so vivid, it's easy to see how it's Oscar worthy. Lady GaGa's performance is also strong though not as iconic, in my opinion. I was surprised to be as entertained by her singing and acting as I was. She's able to draw you in very close which was needed by the story and it pays off in having us care about her character.<br/><br/>All in all a good time at the movies. Cooper's directing shows some real promise to the point that I wonder whether he'll ever act again. That would be a shame because he's quite good."

"eparazak","9","3","6","11 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper's directorial debut is a shining star.
","A Star is Born stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, who also directed it. This is the third remake of the original 1930s movie of the same name. It's about an alcoholic country singer who meets a young singer at a bar and eventually helps her find fame. As they fall in love, he has to deal with his alcoholism and his inner conflicts.<br/><br/>I was interested in this movie because of the TIFF buzz, but I was also very skeptical since Lady Gaga was one of the stars and I was especially afraid her performance would be awful. In the end, I was surprised by how well-done this movie is. For his directorial debut, Cooper did a fantastic job. The characters are very believable and I had myself sympathizing with Cooper's character. His character is basically an alcoholic who needs to learn to deal with the responsibilities of being one, and he has layers that gives us a reason to sympathize with him. Lady Gaga's character is a rising star who is skeptical of him, yet finds joy being around him.<br/><br/>I find the strongest aspect of the movie to be the acting and the chemistry.
Lady Gaga really floored me with her acting on display. I thought she would be awful in this since this is her first movie, but she did a fantastic job with both her acting and singing. She is more than just convincing as an actress here, she feels like she's living and breathing her role. Bradley Cooper is also incredible as his character and it's probably my favorite performance of his. He especially gets emotional during one scene in the third act and by that point, I really immersed myself in his character for that reason. Cooper and Gaga's chemistry was also fantastic. I can't think of anything wrong with it, I really felt their connection.<br/><br/>I do have a small issue with the pacing of the story in how it feels like it's too fast paced at times where things come and go too quickly sometimes. Either way, I found this movie really good and I really hope to see more directorial films from Bradley Cooper. To go from an actor to a director is a tough transition and I think he made a smashing debut.<br/><br/>9/10"
"RadReviews","8","3","6","10 October 2018"," Brilliant!
","First of all Lady Gaga is amazing! Her great singing ability was expected however combined with her impressive and clear natural talent for acting made her perfect for the role as she made the work seem so effortless. Her and Bradley Coopers chemistry is magical, they really complement each other and convey a truly heartbreaking and convincing relationship that evokes such emotion from the audience. The film is continuously entertaining and doesn't seem to drag on as it explores the world of fame regarding rise and downfall. Sam Elliot is fantastic throughout his bittersweet supporting role. Himself and Bradley convey such a raw and intense relationship between two brothers which can be evidenced by the scene in which they have a conversation with one another in the driveway in which I found difficult to hold back tears. Overall the film is gritty and at times hard to watch as Bradley so powerfully demonstrates the struggles and tragedy associated with addiction. The soundtrack is written and performed beautifully as is the cinematography which makes use of saturated tones and conveys such raw intimacy between characters."

The music, albeit unmemorable, reverberated in its beat, tone, and tear-jerking lyrics. Lady Gaga can indeed act and her voice was fantastic. Gaga was the reluctant rising star but Bradley Cooper IS the show as actor, writer, director, and producer. A sad story told well. You could not escape the raw emotions that permeated Cooper's falling star. Sam Elliot was superb as the perfectly cast as older brother - voice, looks, and all. There will be Oscar nominations in EVERY catagory. This film pushes the envelope for a musical - modern ROCK plus heartfelt country ballads. Perhaps more live concerts and then judicious editing might have benefited the film by loosing 10- 20 minutes of stagnant bathtub scenes. A must see."

It's too bad death is such a glorified end in romance. I would far rather see Jack do the boring day to day work of being alive and getting his head on straight than ending it all in dramatic fashion. That is the way of the romeo and juliette storyline.

This movie is seemlessly innocent and raw, wanting nothing more than to tell its story.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, the lead actor and sole director, tells this story in the most raw way possible. This movie feels so real. The conversations stumble, yet flow with ease. The romance shows that you don't always know why you love someone. This is Bradley Cooper's first directing role and my god did he deliver. From the cinematic moments that you will remember forever, to the small moments that pulled us in, this movie has it all.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga, the queen of everything, is what caught my attention when I first saw the trailer for this movie. I'm a huge fan of hers. I had literally no clue what this movie was about. None. All I saw was the trailer of her singing ""Shallow"" and I was hooked. Normally I research movies before I see them, sometimes even spoiling them for myself because im stupid, but this one I had no idea.<br/><br/>This was Lady Gaga's first lead role but you'd think it was her thousandth. She tells a story with her voice and captivates the audience with her outstanding acting in between. It does not feel like Bradley and Gaga are acting, it feels like we're just watching their story. That's how movies should be.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has to be this the best movie I have ever seen. Just a warning though, the ending could be very upsetting to many people."

","Even after seeing all the talk show circuit hype, there was no lunch bag down. This is a great movie. Touching, dramatic, beautifully shot, brilliantly written and very well directed. Cooper puts it out of the park at any experience level. This is a truly well crafted film. Flawless. Gaga and Sam and Andrew Dice Clay, all flawless."
"MichBas","9","3","6","6 October 2018"," I totally fell in love with the film
","I am all but a Lady Gaga fan, honestly, because of that gaga thingy. But after watching the trailer I knew she would be different, and she was, and she actually was stunning. The film may have a few deficiencies, but I find Lady Gaga and Bradly Cooper as well as the enchanting soundtrack do more than compensate for them. <br/><br/>The two give a wonderful couple and obviously were on the same wavelength. Both make their characters totally convincing and must have thrown in much of their own experience. While Jack tries to escape from the vicious circle of alcohol and drugs, Ally takes her chance to get ahead herself. This latter certainly would make her independent of Jack, so it's heartbreaking to see Ally still being in love with him even after he nearly ruined her career. <br/><br/>The score is just great. Lady Gaga with her powerful voice excels in her part, but Cooper, who I learned is not a professional singer, is convincing with his rough voice as well. ""Shallow"" certainly has a potential to become a hit. I think the stage shots are among the best of the whole film.<br/><br/>The first third is plainly overwhelming and totally drags you in, the finale is great again. In-between there are a few subplots which - maybe caused by too many screenwriters - might have benefited from streamlining to achieve a 2 h runtime. Still, I never even thought about a glance at my watch.<br/><br/>I admit, I totally fell in love with the film and gave it 9 stars, and in my tally Lady Gaga, Brad Cooper, together with the wonderful score, would well deserve an Oscar nomination."

"a-katerina-nekrylova","1","8","24","11 October 2018"," Venom looks like Gaga but has more to say
","It's the worst movie I've ever seen. This odd Beethoven-inspired arc of Bradley's character is enough to ruin any script. But, I guess, critics had a soft spot for director's debut. That's the only logical explanation for rave reviews. Because Lady Gaga promotes herself as talented and ugly with zero self-irony. And it's politically correct to promote the idea of ugly girl with a talent being ""better"" than beautiful girl with a talent. Barbra Streisand had charm and charisma which made her imperfect beauty look attractive. She had amazing bright voice. But Lady Gaga in this movie just uses public ignorance telling ""how great she is as a songwriter"" without really displaying at least ONE hit song. There're no hits in this movie.<br/><br/>For sure, the idea of treating women for their talent first is progressive and feminist - which is cool and ""a right thing to do"". But you can't just say ""I'm talented"" in a movie and make people believe it. It's called propaganda and manipulation. Moreover, this movie promotes traditional (patriarchal) views about girls not being able to make a career not through bed. That's why it was approved by critics, too. This is dangerous movie degrading to women. And it's hard to watch Gaga on screen because she resembles Venom."

A good film invokes strong emotion...this one didn't for me. It ended up playing out like a lifetime movie rather than a blockbuster for the big screen. I don't quite understand the exceptional reviews of this movie but I for one was not moved in the least. The tragic end did not feel tragic at all. It felt more like someone moved away.

Same with all Pop-culture...it becomes tribal...people want to belong. Gaga is like The Beatles...everyone is afraid to say they were c**ap for fear of being social ridicule but let's face it...they were little more than an engineered boy band.

","Dreadfully dull; I thought I would like it, as I'm a lover of musicals and romantics movies; but this one dragged on and on. Bradley Cooper looked horribly sunburned throughout the whole film, and I could have gotten past that, but the story line dragged (although I was familiar with it from previous versions). Lady Gaga sang wonderfully but neither the music nor the lyrics reached the depths of my soul at all. I think the more interesting story would have been his problem drinking instead of her rise to stardom. He had whispered to her to be genuine above all else, but she still goes with all the gooey overdone make up and chorus line girls, grinding dancing that today's female pop stars like to use. There was nothing genuine about her. The whole thing was quite lame; and long and boring. How could so many critics have praised this? I'll never understand that."

","The chemistry seemed very forced and not believable.. and every part of the movie was 100% predictable like I always knew what was coming next despite knowing nothing about the movie before hand. It felt more like a brief documentary of fictional singers. I do think Lady Gaga did a good job acting considering she isn't an actor.. Cooper did pretty well too but nothing special. The relationship never really developed and the characters were very shallow.. I felt almost nothing for them emotionally. The best thing about the movie was the audio recording there were some good performances.. but again didn't blow me away. The story was cliche and uninteresting. I don't know who it appeals to but I strongly feel that the movie has been drastically over-rated in terms of overall quality."
"pennyelenabooks","3","4","10","12 January 2019"," Not Good Enough
","I can't say that Lady Gaga was bad and therefor I didn't like the movie. On the contrary, she was dicent and I was surprised. Now, for Cooper, I was expecting more from him. The thing is that the movie was kind of boring. It lacked the intensity that the love story needed to be perfect. Also, it was just too long! The characters were easy to read and so it was easy to predict what was going to happen next. So, because it felt more like a documentory than a love story, 3 out of 10."

Jack goes to rehab after pissing himself in the Grammy. At rehab, Ally asked Jack a stupid discouraging question. After coming out of rehab, Ally's manager tells Jack a bunch of further discouraging crap and Jack was stupid enough to buy it and kill himself.

","My wife and I bought this on Blu-ray to watch on Valentine's day, as we'd both heard great reviews. What a waste of an evening! I wasn't expecting frothy romance, and I enjoy a good drama, but this really, really dragged.<br/><br/>While it was really well acted, everything about the movie screamed (or rather mumbled) downbeat. Possibly it was to show how mundane even stardom can be, it's obviously artistic intent, but wow it was a slog.<br/><br/>The whole film just felt empty, with two hopeless empty people mumbling their way through a dreary world, on their slow descent into unfulfilled sadness. If the movie resonates with you I feel really sorry for you.<br/><br/>If your evenings are filled with drinking and self-loathing, futilely trying to fill the void that you perceive life to be, this film is for you. If you, like me, live in a world of colour, beauty and joy - with meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose and fulfilment, none of those qualities were represented on the screen here.<br/><br/>

I mean, we have been hearing a lot of this movie and watching the interviews and the publicity and the expectation was really high!! But, after watching it, it came like a sensation of disappointment. Lady Gaga seems Lady Gaga in a Bradley Cooper's film... that's it. And, even thought she persists saying that the character of Ally doesn't seem anything on her, it really does!! And, I also agree with those that say that these actors just kept their performance in the surface! These characters had too much to give and they just didn't explore their different facets! I feel like if this movie just owe me!!! It owe me a good story, a good performance, a good and deeper connection with my emotions!! It's very disappointing!! At the end, I totally agree with those who say that for some moments it is very boring!!"

","Do you want 2 hours of Cooper drinking, and Lady Gaga being herself with really cheesy pop music as soundtrack ? This is your movie. The drunkard musician lending fame to fresh face with talent is an overused theme and this version brings nothing new to it. At a certain point you just get so sick of watching Bradley Cooper consume drink after drink. What is moving the plot? Why is every shot a close up? Are we supposed to believe these people have talent despite the awful lyrics they write?<br/><br/>I have not seen the previous version of this movie -just found out there even is one- and I could accurately guess what will happen throughout the movie. Thats how stale it is.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot stress enough how much I regret the 2 hours I can never get back. I'm only writing this on the hopes of saving some people from the same pain."
"coasterdude44","8","3","7","31 October 2018"," Everyone Matters
","From watching this film it has become very obvious to me what it was trying trying to say, no one is any more special than anyone else and that we are all born with the ability to achieve whatever we want, whenever we wan't and there is nothing getting in the way from whatever you want to achieve except for your own excuses and insecurities. ""I can't perform, my nose is too big!""<br/><br/>It's always been that way and it always continue to be that way where the only thing that's stopping you from achieving your own dreams, goals, ambitions, fame, fortune or whatever it is has always been yourself, and if your wan't to get out there no matter who you are, you have to look past your own faults and do the work. This is what I thought the message of the film was. Fame the way society sees it is an illusion and is only earned by the people who equally put the same amount of passion and work in . Becoming a celebrity is nothing more than a test of passion and the will to achieve. The film also had a lot to say about how the world really works and how people's problems are unavoidable and come from everywhere, but how it favours the people who still go ahead anyway. You CAN do it is the movie in four words. Can natural born talent be lost, who knows? maybe it can. But the film is also trying to say that it's still better to get out there and give it a shot that give up and stay feeling like nobody, you have nothing to lose.<br/><br/>
The film itself at a lot of times almost felt like it was trying to emotionally parody itself, there were some dramatic scenes with Ally that you almost couldn't take seriously. In a way it almost felt like an emotional joke, but it was a good joke because it completely supported the message of the film and what it was trying to say. Just see it, it's a very rare kind of film that speaks the truth of how the world works and how people see fame which I think Bohemian Rhapsody is going to share a lot of the same themes in one way or another. Just see it, there won't be another film like this for a very long time"

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","6","3","7","8 October 2018"," Great performances - not necessarily great story
","I liked most of this film but I just couldnt fall in love with it. One notable problem for me was that Jackson wasn't likable to me. Right off the bat, he comes across as very pushy when he meets Ally. Not only was I uncomfortable, but even Ally looked uncomfortable. He's very clearly shown to be a messy alcoholic at the beginning too. And Ally also acknowledges this early on. Its made clear that she doesnt care about the whole celebrity culture so its not like shes attracted to him because of that, and he treats his brother like garbage and so it just felt hard to understand why she so quickly fell for him. There was a disconnect there for me. There was only one moment towards the end where I felt a shroud of compassion for his character. Another movie I saw this year was Beautiful Boy (which featured an addict) and I thought it did a better job of humanizing someone with addiction. I dont know I just think it might have worked better if we as an audience had a chance to see him in rose tinted glasses as someone might when they're starting out in relationship and you're in that honeymoon phase. Or if we had more instances where he knew was effing up. <br/><br/>It was also a little cliched at times and I thought the end song was very cheesy. And while I liked the characterization of Ally better, there were times where I felt she was making decisions that didnt make sense. Like one minute she would be very no nonsense not taking any of your crap and the next a walking doormat. <br/><br/>Despite this, I cant say I hated the film. I thought the acting was great. The only person in the cast who I wasnt impressed by was Sam Elliot. He was doing the usual thing he does. I thought Bradley did a good job at his directorial debut. The song ""The Shallows"" really stood out to me and is my guess of what will be nominated at the Oscars. I also think its the most pivotal song. Lady Gaga has a killer voice and so it was great getting to hear her sing. I thought her and Bradley worked well off each other. It was moving (more towards the end though). There were parts and things I liked, and Im sure there will be some nominations for it. But, not my personal fave this year.<br/><br/>I rated it a 6, but I think in actuality it would be more a 6.5"

Practically Gaga acting as Gaga, it is not fair to give merit to her when many other actresses deserved to be finalists making a hard perfom.<br/><br/>Gaga did well, but only that, it is not a role to be praised as it has been until now.<br/><br/>Cooper on the contrary, he did a role that does not correspond to his life. Excellent performance, however incredible that the film has been nominated for Oscar since the film is lost in concerts and the rapid fame of a new singer, leaving aside the true development it should have: dive into the drug and alcoholic problem of Cooper and a real relationship with problems.<br/><br/>Cooper as director lost the oportunity to make a better remake telling a better and different story behind the great music."

","If you thing the last 1/3rd is drawn out or say that their is not enough character arc or Mr. Cooper displaying addiction correctly watch it again and play close attention, as an addict, it couldn't have been shown or portrayed better, pure brilliance. There was key lines from Ally, ""it's not your fault it's the disease"" says it all because truthfully that doesn't make us feel less blamable nor does it help with what the manager tells him, add that with the depression, realizing his career was over, that he couldn't beat addiction or play with her without getting high on stage, you get exactly what happens. How would that take away from her triumph? Her husband was sick with a disease and dies from it, no it's not cancer, but like diabetes more (if you have it and it kills you from obesity, heart/health problems, etc, because of poor diet) but it's still basically personal decisions then how is that any different than addiction? So that's a triumph living and losing anyone with the disease of addiction, so if you rated it low, you obviously have no idea how addiction really is or how it works, this movie was done perfect, didn't know there was another one but I doubt it can hold a candle to this one!!"

First and the foremost i am lost for words about the song choices. My favourite is shallow but the final song can not be negligble. Furthermore, the directors(Bradley Cooper) perspective was literaly amazing. I wasnt expect the final. Moreover, the costumes are well organized and the places that the events take place was nice too.
On the other hand the lighting was such a disappointment. The angles of the camera annoyed me so much. Also, the duration of the movie was quite long so i bored a bit in the middle but the final composed it.

"TheVictoriousV","6","2","4","22 February 2019"," Not altogether ""shallow""; an impressive debut
","When a film is as thoroughly worshipped as A Star is Born, I tend to see two possibilities. One is that it's that kind of rare, well-made film that hits the spot for almost everyone and so will evolve into a classic. The other is that it's a bland, stupid ordeal that nevertheless ticks all the right boxes to be marketable, accessible and relatable to mainstream consumers on a shallow (no pun intended) level. A Star is Born has some of both.<br/><br/>Directed by Bradley Cooper (a stupendously impressive debut but not as indicative of great taste as Gosling's Lost River), this is actually the fourth iteration of A Star is Born. It is also the only one that I've seen but I don't think it matters. I doubt the Judy Garland film featured music (or clothing) that was this approachable to Gen Z and Lady Gaga fans.<br/><br/>Cooper and Gaga star in the film and they are both nominated for Leading Role Oscars this year. Obviously I think the latter can wait until Olivia Colman has gotten her due for shining (more than any ""star"", born or unborn) in The Favourite, but both leads do well here. Cooper is a drunkard rock musician; Gaga is the nightclub performer who impresses him with her singing talents and beautiful nose. He falls for her through music; one scene later she does the same for him.<br/><br/>He invites her to go on tour with him, after letting her perform one of her own creations at a concert of his. Other faces emerge. Emotions evolve. You know how it is.<br/><br/>Dave Chappelle, Andrew Dice Clay and the rightfully Oscar-nominated Sam Elliott make for engaging supporting roles, and the likes of Alec Baldwin, Halsey and an assortment of chattering drag queens perform as themselves. The actors are all well-directed by Cooper, and the chemistry of the central couple is sweet and believable. The humorous moments work (I chuckled at a scene where some older gents muse over the YouTube view counter) and the music is mostly good, my only real gripes being with the not-always-cohesive editing and oft predictable romance beats. The camera work is pretty generic but Cooper will get there.<br/><br/>The most ""notorious"" issue with A Star is Born is the ending, which, without revealing too much, is allegedly a glorification of something that ought not be glorified. For my part, I've seen the abyss; the abyss being 13 Reasons Why. This isn't quite so dark.<br/><br/>We'll see how the film does at the ceremony this Sunday but my confident estimation is that it will take multiple statues home (I've come to accept the reality that it will most surely win Original Song over The Ballad of Buster Scruggs). Hollywood doesn't seem to gush over THIS musical romance quite so much as they did 2017's La La Land, but it's a clear favorite all the same. It may be funny if it is falsely announced as Best Picture, only for the real winner to be Black Panther."

","Yeah, you saw my grading, and it's probably thinking ""wtf, dude?"". I don't know how so many people like this movie (it's apparently almost a consensus, I think, but we'll, I didn't, and I'll try explain why).<br/><br/>The main problem, for me, it's that the movie is confusing, not in the sense that it is too complicated for you to understand, but actually in the sense of there are some many things happening at the same time, that you get lost. For example, the beginning of the it. I was impressed with how many things happen in the first 20/25 minutes of movie. She is in a pilot suit (?). Then she apparently works in a kitchen...? (They never explain that). Then she is singing in a drag bar. They come out. She punches a cop. They go to the market to buy freeze food (why don't you buy ice...? Since you are in the supermarket...). They SING in the parking lot. All of that in 20 minutes.<br/><br/>But this is just an example. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the songs (c'mon, Gaga is amazingly talented, she is awesome), the acting is good. The cinematography is... ok?. But the story its self, I mean, she didn't have nothing to overcome thought the movie, they talk about her nose (?) but this is never an issue. She also says at some point that she doesn't want to be change by fame, but its ok with painting her hair orange...? And again, they never come back to this point again, she just changes and that's it. Even the dancers scene, after that show, she starts to use the dancers, and... that's it. Zero conflict.<br/><br/>Also at the end. The producers it's kinda of responsible for her husband's death, but... Yeah, apparently nobody will ever now that, and confronts him about it.<br/><br/>I love Sam Elliot, he is amazing, a legend, but I don't get all the buss here. Really, he does those type of things in The Ranch. Literally, his character in The Ranch, has some emotional scenes, that are as emotional as his scenes here are. What again, don't get me wrong, they ARE good, but it's not something he hasn't done before.<br/><br/>Another scene, that to me sums up a lot of what is wrong with the movie: Their ""fight"" in the bathroom. I mean. Wtf was going on there...? WHY do they fight?! There is literally no reason, and leads to nowhere. Cause in the next scene they are fine again.<br/><br/>Anyways, to wrap up, A Star is Born, for me, it's a movie with a great cast and soundtrack, but that brings a story without depth, that at the end, just seems like a bunch of scenes cut together with much of a narrative objective. Definitely not worthy of the best picture nomination."

Although I've never classed myself as a big fan, I think Lady Gaga's performance was amazing also, and the soundtrack is sublime.
The story never once lagged and by the end of this film I was uncontrollably sobbing as I felt I had become somewhat attached to the character Jackson and his ongoing struggles.

Bradley Cooper's character reminds me almost of Eddie Vedder (obviously with due differences) and the songs played by Lady Gaga's character were a huge commercial success<br/><br/>But more importantly, the acting.

"david_w_gibson","9","2","4","23 January 2019"," I watched all 4 and this one is best
","After watching all 4 version of the title, I found myself liking this one best and the 1973 version least , as it's lead male's waning career wasn't believable, just self sabotaging and the songs in the 3 musicals weren't nearly as moving or as on target of the movie's main subject as in this one. This version showed the male lead not as emotionally flawed, but as truly fighting not only addiction, but age and failing body as well. whereas in the 37,54, & 73 versions addiction & self sabotage seemed his only problem as they were all shown as very healthy minnus the drinking. The addition of the failing body due to age, environment, and possibly birth defect made Bradley cooper's character more human, believable as it gave him more reason for his failings and fear driving his worsening behavior. His performance was flawless and the chemistry & love between him and Lady Gaga believable. I think for this story that part is essential. The 54 and 37 versions caught that also, not so much in the 73 version. I also found the accidental embarrassment at the awards show more believable than the previous versions deliberate embarrassment, as I felt that destroyed the believability that the male lead truly loved the female lead.
Anyway, I was moved throughout, as much by the acting and dialogue, as the songs as a continuation of the dialogue"

"DVR_Brale","5","2","4","30 November 2018"," A Star is Dying
","I've gotta admit to you: I was expecting a lot from this movie since so many people had been saying it was really good. I'll say: it was really boring.<br/><br/>Most of the movie you see Jack drinking and taking drugs and Alice going to the top and being around Jack. His drinking problem is a very important side of the movie, no doubt, but it shouldn't have become central and, sadly, only side of the movie. 'A Star is Dying' would have been a far more realistic name for this story.<br/><br/>Music is fun and cool until around half of the movie; then it becomes boring since you see whole songs being played. So you listen to them and wait for the story to continue in the same fashion as before: Jack drinking and Ally singing. So don't expect anything you've seen in e.g. La La Land.<br/><br/>In conclusion, A Star is Born had a potential to be really touching musical drama with music much better intertwined with the film. Unfortunately, to much drinking ruined it."

","Something simple and sweet, and very smart choosing such a storyline that touches almost everybody's dream. Finding someone out of nowhere to believe in you more than you believe in yourself and all you ever wanted just happen like a dream. And within that storyline there were cases that have been overviewed differently, went into different direction than expected or than like any other modern movie.<br/><br/>Commitment, when literally most of movies, books, TV shows, songs ... has become about breaking up relationships not only partners even family from the very first thing that happen or from just nothing. That "" i wanna be free find myself "" circle. I love how they presented love in such a real way where you cant see each other's flaws and you support each other .. love stories are just about perfection and fantasies but in real life love is a commitment and it needs more than emotions and attraction to last.<br/><br/>I have always wondered why in talent shows, a person would audition with this big song and steals everyone's heart with his/her voice and personality and everything .. and months later, another hit song come and catches your ears and you listen to repeatedly for until another catchy song sticks in your head and your are like ya here is another pop star i wonder how long they will last before all that Hollywood drama gets them ... like where is that real original person/soul i heard in that talent show audition ? this movie has showed how cruel this music industry world is, how they shaped Ally not her outlook only but even her music .. the difference or the deep distance between a real song like Shallow and the other catchy hit song "" why did you do that "" is exactly what music industry does to all those talented souls.<br/><br/>When Ally told Jack ""its not your fault, its a disease"" after he embarrassed her in the most important moment of her life in front of the whole world. if it happens in real life nobody in million years will forget that, think about the media, the public... oh my God it will kill them. watching that scene I just thought ya this is it like i was waiting for the moment that will break them..<br/><br/>Alcoholism and addiction being addressed as diseases not just problems has a meaning. like any other mental or physical disease that affect human behaviour and living with a sick person is just .. requires a lot of patience. And she didn't do that out of gratefulness or blinding love she actually understood he's sick.<br/><br/>its the little things that made this movie real and touching.<br/><br/>Leaving the movie i felt like .. you know when there is thing that is almost perfect but this "" almost "" part annoys you because .. you don't know, there were just too good to be true but they weren't or was that to made a certain point in life. These movies that strip certain characters, show you all their colours not only black and white, not only what you watch in an interview or read in tabloids you see the real person not the person that media shaped are just .. they change you.<br/><br/>out of ten I might give it a seven, because of that annoying ""almost perfect"" part. but what's pretty about it after reading many reviews in different platforms the ""almost"" thing was completely different every time I read a review unlike many other movies where the flaws are too obvious."

"jahnnwendy","10","2","4","28 October 2018"," A Bright & Shining Star
","A STAR IS BORN (spoiler free)<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper stars as Jackson Maine, a world weary, veteran musician, struggling with alcoholism and substance abuse, who, stumbles upon Lady Gaga's, Ally, a gifted songstress who is yet to find her own voice. The two fall in love, embarking on a turbulent and impassioned journey, forming a creative partnership that propels Ally onto the world stage.<br/><br/>Dating back to the 1930's, ""A Star Is Born"" has had several incarnations, including the 1954 version with Judy Garland & James Mason, but perhaps most famously in 1976 with Barbra Streisand & Kris Kristofferson in the leads.
Indeed, from the outside, one may be forgiven for cynically dismissing this new entry as an unnecessary remake. But rest assured, the time is ripe for this relevant and shattering directorial debut from the formidably talented Bradley Cooper. A film that successfully transcends and possibly eclipses all of its predecessors.<br/><br/>This unforgettable, deeply emotional love story is a romantic musical drama like no other. Bradley Cooper, who continues to display a seemingly never ending array of flair, not only sings, but cowrites the film's screenplay, imbuing the characters with such vulnerability, honesty and heart that's so rarely afforded in a major Hollywood production these days.
Perhaps the film's vital ingredient though, is in the casting of Lady Gaga.
( again, Cooper was instrumental in convincing Gaga to come onboard )
Like Cooper's surprising vocal ability as an actor, it is Gaga's phenomenal acting ability as a singer that will truly redefine her already amazing career. The on screen chemistry between Cooper and Gaga is a cinematic marriage made in heaven.<br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" thrusts the viewer into a world rarely witnessed from this perspective. The remarkable sound design encompasses the audience, providing an intimate and immersive experience. Whether it's on stage in front of a crowd of thousands or the quiet tender moments shared between two creative souls.<br/><br/>To further write this review without honouring the craftsmanship and genius of the film's music and songwriting would be a disservice. ""A Star Is Born"" is magically punctuated by original songs that resonate and soar in a dazzling spectrum of emotion, songs that ring true, complimenting its characters and their human frailties.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""A Star Is Born"" is a resounding soul searching experience. A triumphant achievement that addresses in equal measure, the joy and heartache of love.
Deserving of the highest accolades, this spiritual cinematic encounter left this reviewer breathless and reeling.<br/><br/>10/10"

"yris2002","8","2","4","27 October 2018"," Authentic humanity and stunning performances.
","The love story between the seasoned artist who helps the unknown talented girl to find her path as a singer may sound as something already seen and heard about, but this has no relevance: the movie has a deep humanity of its own and can be appreciated for this, being references to other classics barely useless.
I did not suffer the long running time, the first half of the movie being however more energetic than the second, but it couldn't be otherwise, since it gradually digs deeper and deeper in the most secretive folds of a love story, inside which the egocentrism of every person, especially of two artists, makes it impossible to find a common way to grow together. However, an involving movie from beginning till the end.
I do not agree with some criticism about its being too melodramatic, I did not perceive drama as excessive and above all I found it authentically rendered, thanks to the stunning photography, which does not make any concessions to the real faces of the protagonists.
As far to them, I was impressed by lady Gaga's stunning acting skills, and appreciated her chemistry with Bradley Cooper, who captures your good disposition towards the movie from the very first shot, and has remarkable skills as a singer, and as a passionate director, as well.
I loved the soundtrack, and the quality of the live performances always add something more to the intimate atmosphere of a movie that leaves you with healthy tears on your face."

","Seen this when originally wanting to see Bad Times at the El Royale, but seen this instead. To say the least, it was pretty good!

And so Jack, gives her that boost she needs until a record company recognises her & signs her on. The boos is named Rez who although really likes the artistic talents of Ally dislikes the drunken, druggy attitude of her now hubby & then boyfriend, Jack. The second half of the film deals with the struggles of being a recording artist while touring & producing singles & albums!<br/><br/>I found the film to be quite interesting. It really got you & dragged you till the end. Though long, it still done well in telling the story of Ally trying to get recognition. As well as the story of Jack, an older musician with a drink & drug problem dealing with his wife getting fame in an instant while he's getting slammed.<br/><br/>The film was overall pretty good, sad & unexpected at the end but it was a good watch! 7/10 is what the film deserves it was above average at best!"

"tm-sheehan","7","2","4","23 October 2018"," Great performances but nothing new to add -
","I wish this had been the same stars Bradley Cooper and Lady GaGa in a different movie because they both are incredibly talented and are great together and yes the chemistry is there but this fourth remake (two to many) of a Star Is Born as far as I'm concerned has nothing more to add to the story of successful star meets and falls for struggling singer who's career eventually eclipses his and his addiction extinguishers his star forever.
I don't usually give spoilers but this scenario has been done before and better. Saying that ,if this is your first Star is Born you'll love it I'm sure.
I didn't like Streisand's and Kristofferson's version much either in 1976 and I'm still of the opinion that Judy Garland's 1954 A Star is Born is the best .
I can understand why new generations of movie stars are attracted to the story and want to put their own stamp on it but it's not Shakespeare and it has become a little cliched to say the least when you know the entire plot in advance and nothing new except new faces foul language and pop music are added to the same story written in 1936.
I noticed Barbra Streisand's one time boyfriend and producer of her version of this story , the very controversial Jon Peters ( they call him the Trump of Hollywood) is a producer of this latest version and remember some critics cruelly said his and Streisand's version should have been retitled A Star is Still Born .
In my humble opinion this 2018 version is as good as the 1976 version and it didn't come alive for me either and Streisand is one of my favourite stars.
Some good songs lifted it for me , especially Lady Ga Ga who is a true superstar and wrote some of her songs ( so did Streisand and won an Academy Award for Evergreen )
Ga Ga has a great voice range , like Barbra Streisand and they admire each other's talent.
Lady Ga Ga's little tribute to Judy Garland early in the film singing the introduction to Somewhere Over the Rainbow,which Judy never sang herself wasn't lost on me .
Bradley Cooper has a very good voice plus gives a great performance but I just wish that I had seen them in a new original story , I'd love to see Ga Ga in a film with a terrific new script telling the amazing story of Amy Winehouse , almost a reverse role for her to this film. Amy Winehouse was another incredible talent lost to the world in her prime due to addiction.
A Star is Born 2018 is getting great reviews and has Oscar nomination written all over it but I wouldn't like to see Lady Ga Ga win when Judy Garland didn't and truly delivered the ultimate portrayal of this character in her version."

It's been 18 years since our step-father committed suicide and it took a movie like this to bring it all back fresh. I couldn't even make it to my car before I broke down and wept in the parking lot. I was on edge for most of the day and cried myself to sleep.<br/><br/>This is also not a good movie if you're dealing with depression or have suicidal thoughts.

","My Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>A genius debut from Cooper as Director and Lady Gaga as an actress. Some of the best chemistry on-screen in recent times. Give it a whirl. One of the best films of the year easily."
"eden-rabatsch","8","2","4","21 October 2018"," Cooper and Gaga both make stunning debuts
","Lets add up the challenges - film has been done three times before, when you are born the plot is downloaded into your brain, Brad Cooper has never directed, Lady Gaga never been the lead in a film, lets mix melodrama with a concert film so not only does the music have to be great so does anything to do with the relationship and any misstep, the whole illusion will collapse.
I state this because the film has issues but it a goddamned miracle this was made let alone that it is great. Finally, when people complain about Hollywood not making films for ""everyone"" (yep, I have no idea either) you just point them to this film (and soon after First Man)
Both the leads are outstanding - believable, charming, as good at acting as they are singing, does Cooper play that guitar, y'know what I don't want to know. The whole film rests on a precipice: the audience must buy the love and the chemistry..both Gaga and Cooper deliver in spades.
The ensemble is very good. Elliott steals nearly every scene especially the one in the truck cabin and Andrew Dice Clay is so good he does the opposite, I forgot who he used to be.
The film certainly has first time directing issues. Cooper is so in love with his material he can't cut anything which leads to a real loss of momentum in the second act after an almost flawless first 40 minutes.
The camera sits in close a bit much and Cooper does not like going wide which can get claustrophobic.
The ultimate trick is changing the screenplay from being about jealousy to one about artistic authenticity and getting your idiosyncratic message to the world by making the same film for the fourth time...yet it works."
"essential-23126","8","2","4","19 October 2018"," Good casting enhances a believable storyline.
","A very very good remake of this love story/musical. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga excellent as the lovestruck couple. Great music too. Well edited with the storyline moving along at a sensible pace but keeping the viewer's interest in the main characters' journey together. Recommended."
"leahkirkness","10","2","4","18 October 2018"," Bloody brilliant!
","Such a captivating movie! This movie highlights the sad realities of the music industry. The storyline was perfectly paced and the acting spot on. I love Lady Gaga but I was most surprised by Bradley Cooper. I have never seen him act so well and who knew he could sing! Highly recommend seeing this movie, particularly if you liked Walk the Line. Possibly the best tmovie I have seen in the last few years."
"cberg-40397","Null","2","4","17 October 2018"," My wife left me for Bradley Cooper but he doesn't know it.
","So my superhot wife and I had a date night on Saturday.<br/><br/>Nice little night, used some gift cards to The Outback then went to the theatre to watch ""A Star is Born"".<br/><br/>I didn't know a whole lot about this movie. I knew that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were in it and it had music.<br/><br/>This is exactly the type of movie formula that I do not want to go to...<br/><br/>As we sat in our seats we got about 3 minutes in and I saw why Amy was so excited to see this....Bradley Cooper, a beard, and he sings rock music real real well.<br/><br/>So what's in it for me? More than I thought.<br/><br/>I barely knew anything about Lady Gaga. I knew that she was kind of a popstar and wore a dress made out of tacos or meat or something. That was about it.<br/><br/>So 10 more minutes into the movie and Bradley has sang another song, is wearing a cowboy hat, and playing the guitar.<br/><br/>I look over at Amy and her pants are all the way off.<br/><br/>Then Lady Gaga starts singing. I did not really find her attractive until then. My goodness what a voice.<br/><br/>20 minutes after that Bradley McCowboyPants and Lady Gaga sing about the most impressive duet you will ever hear. Amy is smoking a cigarette and has lit candles in the theatre.<br/><br/>Next thing I know both The Bradley and Sam Freakin Elliot are in the same scene. That's right. Sam Elliot from Roadhouse. All I can think of now is Patrick Swayze in his boys size medium sweats and lions mane head and no shirt karate kicking his way into my 17 year old heart.<br/><br/>Now my pants are off.<br/><br/>Anyway...I laughed, I cried, and I had confusing feelings.<br/><br/>This was one hell of a movie. Probably the best I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Now if I could only grow a beard..."

","This movie is actually so far away from the 8.4/10 average rating it gets on IMDb. The story could be told in 20 minutes. This film is way too long for what it has to offer in that time. Bradley Cooper should probably stick to acting."
"kate-harvie","5","2","4","15 October 2018"," 5 stars for soundtrack, 2 stars for movie
","Full disclosure: I have seen every version of ""A Star is Born,"" and that includes the original 1937 with Janet Gaynor and Frederic March. I grew up on and with Streisand and have that soundtrack on cassette somewhere. <br/><br/>I'm a legit fan, though not a Monster, of Lady Gaga and I think Bradley Cooper is a better actor than the majority of his roles evince.<br/><br/>So my expectations for this film were high. Really high. And I have only myself to blame for being woefully disappointed.<br/><br/>Like most studio pictures these days, this one is too long by half. Unlike most studio pictures, you can see, hear, and feel what was probably intended by its creators (which, in this case, was Bradley Cooper as director, co-writer, producer, and responsible for the musicians who were involved).<br/><br/>So it is with real disappointment that I advise people to arrive at this film with low expectations, the suggestion that they watch the movie for what it is (a high budget studio picture starring marquee names and superb supporting actors and when Lady Gaga is singing, a terrific soundtrack), and to see it before 12pm so the ticket costs half its full retail.<br/><br/>This film begins and flows beautifully, authentically, and emotionally until almost midway. I won't reveal where it turns, and anyone who is paying attention will observe it. A real head scratch here: we were going one way and all of a sudden we're in a movie produced by the people who make the nonsense that airs on E!, today's MTV, Lifetime, and WE. Such a bummer.<br/><br/>Initially it seems that this movie is happening 20 years ago, before social media and the resulting opportunity for everyone to be famous, if only in their own minds. When it becomes a commercial mess, one can only wonder if the studio got its hands on it and decided to turn it into a ""blockbuster.""<br/><br/>That's a shame. Happily, you can enjoy the soundtrack."

"luizguttz","10","2","4","12 October 2018"," A Star was born!
","Simply touching and magnificent! It is a beautiful story of overcoming, which shows us that we can yes, conquer our dreams. The film addresses social issues as addictions, which makes us reflect how sad it is when we make the wrong choices in our lives. Lady Gaga is a revelation, we already know that she has always been a sensational and talented artist, but what she did in this film was really good and proved to everyone that she came to stay. Bradley Cooper knows how to sing and no one knew it, I thought it was spectacular. His scratched voice is a delight to hear. Not to mention the way he directed the film, photography, sound and plot make us fixed your eyes on the screen without blinks. The vocals of both artists are wonderful, they shivered at me the whole movie. The soundtrack in my opinion is flawless. ""Shallow"", ""Maybe It's Time"", ""Always Remember Us This Way"", ""Look What I Found"", ""Heal Me"", ""Why Did You Do That?"", ""It's That Alright?"" and ""I'll Never Love Again"" are my favorite, that is, almost the entire soundtrack (laughs). Without further ado, the film was incredible and I'm still shocked by the ending, it was hard to hold back the tears. Congratulations to all those involved in this work of art. A star was born without doubts and will still give much to speak. Waiting for the indications ""movie of the year"", ""best actress"", ""best direction"" and ""best soundtrack"" ... is it too much to ask? Thank you!"

The theme repetition gets very tiering. There is also nothing that really happens. Some of the stories are woven in but not taken to a point where they land in a meaningful way. I love Bradley Cooper as an actor. I think that whilst this a good directing debut, there is more to come."

"markgorman","10","2","4","9 October 2018"," A profoundly moving and beautiful love story.
","That Lady Gaga can come out of the blocks like this, on her movie acting debut, is nothing short of remarkable. She gives the currently almost peerless Bradley Cooper (four Oscar nominations, soon to be six I'd suggest) a close run in who is the stand out talent in this epic and beautiful movie (encompassing, as it does, both Coachela and Glastonbury on its flightpath).<br/><br/>This is a great movie, a classic Hollywood blockbuster with no pretentious of arthouse glory, just great storytelling, great acting, great directing (Cooper), great cinematography and great music (cooper again, and Gaga).<br/><br/>Frankly, what is there not to love in that list?<br/><br/>I won't bore you with the plot, we all know it, but the thing that counts in this is the relationship between the two leads - virtually no-one else really matters other than to propel the storyline along. This is ALL about Gaga and Cooper who are electrifying from the second they meet.<br/><br/>If they are not both Oscar nominated I will be astounded because this is an uncanny love affair between two actors that seem, in love.<br/><br/>Gaga's willingness to loudly declare her physical kinks, specifically her considerable nose only makes her more believable, more loveable and, in fact, more beautiful. Few would call Gaga a poster girl, her looks are unorthodox in the beauty stakes, but the endless intense close ups of her warts and all features make her tremendously endearing.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, by contrast, is as handsome as it is possible to imagine with his piercing blue eyes, interesting new facial hair and a torso to kill for.<br/><br/>He directs this simple story with simplicity. At all times less is more and he manages, brilliantly, in the second act, to downplay Gaga's fame with superbly unloveable material. The fact is, her success is gained by bypassing her natural talent and fabricating a stage persona that is so underwhelming as to make you gasp (well done Rafi Gavin on odiously achieving that feat on her behalf).<br/><br/>Cooper's jealousy is never melodramatic and his portrayal of drug and drink induced stupor is profoundly believable. <br/><br/>I was constantly on the edge of tears during this movie, because it's achingly endearing and a true work of art.<br/><br/>100% and unreservedly recommended."

I know this is a remake, but I purposely didn't read any spoilers beforehand. I'm so glad I didn't, but I don't know if I could watch it again because it was absolutely heart-breaking. My mom, who NEVER cries at movies, had tears pouring down her face throughout the last 10 minutes of the film. Both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were absolutely brilliant, and the rest of the cast was great too. For anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, please disregard any negative spoilers you're seeing and go and see this film for yourself!"
"cashmere-12","6","2","4","7 October 2018"," A Star Is Born
","It took awhile to get into this movie. Kind of boring at beginning. Picked up when Andrew Dice Clay appeared. The concert scenes were really good. Lady Gaga was actually good and looked a lot better with the natural look. Some very funny scenes especially at the Grammys. Bradley Cooper was very good playing the drunk. He could have easily been entertaining the audiences at the Concert."
"Equalizer16","9","2","4","7 October 2018"," ""Electrifying""
","Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's music romance is a rip-roaring journey back stage of love and fame. A star is truly born in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.<br/><br/>When returning from a gig, country music singer: Jackson Maine (Cooper) walks into a drag bar to find a phenomenal voice in waitress Ally (Gaga) moonlighting as a club singer. Enchanted, Jackson and Ally share an evening professing their passion for music, leading Jackson inviting her to join him on stage during a concert to reveal her voice to the world. The couple's romance quickly blossoms as Ally's musical career begins, but Jackson's alcohol and drug addiction begins to disrupt their dreams.<br/><br/>42 years following Frank Pearson version with Barbra Streisand, Cooper launches his directing career with a 21st century re-envisioning of the Hollywood classic. Following the legacy of Janet Ganor, Judy Garland, and Streisand, Gaga is an apt idol of modern pop, and her transference of her musical talent to the screen is magnetic. With rumours of Clint Eastwood directing the project in 2011 with Beyoncé, I can honestly say I'm glad Eastwood's project never lifted the ground. <br/><br/>It's incredible to think that the man who stared in three Hangover movies, and voiced a space racoon, can produce a stunning piece of cinema. As demonstrated from A Star is Born, Cooper understands the art and craft of filmmaking, and its a joy to see him put his skill to work. <br/><br/>As the alcoholic Jackson Maine, Cooper depicts a likeness to Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line (2005), but at his centre is a heart passionate to share Ally to the world, but troubled by his tinnitus, pulling him to the bottle. Donning a deep Arizona accent Cooper loses himself deeply into the role. A character on the edge but spirited to heighten Ally's gift. Then we have Lady Gaga as the Ally who's nervous and hidden soul majestically blossoms in her romance with Jackson and her rise to fame opposite Jackson's decent. Gaga has complete investment in the film and we completely buy into her. Moments on and off stage Gaga crushes it as the heartfelt Ally. Gaga and Cooper's chemistry on screen is sublime, the very heart beat of the film itself, producing several powerhouse ballads.<br/><br/>Opening in the middle of a concert with the roaring crowds, howling guitars tuning and high frequency amps, met with the smooth camera motion, Cooper literally invites us to join him on stage to be in the moment. This no more true than during the climax of the first act, when we witness the captivating ""Shallow"" already picked for award attention for Best Original Song. At this point I have never found a better moment to use the world ""electrifying"". Matthew Libatique's cinematography engulfs the audience into the music scene, decorating each shot in exquisite lighting and composition producing beautiful imagery throughout the film. Any one of these shots could be seen on an album cover.<br/><br/>Cooper remarkably presents the joys and troubles of showbusiness with the central couple's imbalanced relationship, one rising to fame, the other declining. With a realistic feel to the drama behind the stage, alike to the ups and downs of La La Land (2016). But know that this is in no way like the Hollywood musical, but an honest romance occurring in the music industry. There is much excitement to be had in the music but also much sorrow.<br/><br/>With already early awards buzz, A Star is Born will no doubt be a hit for the audiences and critics and will do well when awards season arrives. I am hoping that viewers who love The Greatest Showman (2017) will see this and forget all about that nonsense and appreciate a real piece of cinema."

","The first thing to say about 'A Star Is Born' is that it is a very good film. Despite whether you like it or dislike it, you would be lying if you said it wasn't very good. Of course, it is a remake of the classic story, and primarily the 1976 Streisand and Kristofferson version, which shows through its cinematography, lighting and overall tone.<br/><br/>Compared to the earlier versions of ASIB, this remake is much less melodramatic, and instead of using a loud and tone-shifting score, it relies on the performances of Cooper and Gaga and their chemistry to do all the talking.<br/><br/>It starts off fairly slow, but then gets faster and faster as it goes on, which really helps the films pacing and reserved style of storytelling.<br/><br/>What I thought this film did best, and what I related most with, was how we saw both points of view from the lead characters, and how the film let us make our own decision about them. While on one hand, we feel sorry for Ally (played by Lady Gaga) because of how her husband, Jack (played by Cooper, who also directs) acts, we also understand how he feels, which as a viewer puts us in a uncomfortable position.<br/><br/>When this film ended, I thought to myself ""it was good, but I don't love it"", but the more I've thought about it, and listened to the songs soundtrack, the more I like it, and the more I want to re-watch it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, the film has its flaws, but you can put them all aside with the brilliant, Oscar-worthy leading performances, good first-time direction, brilliant writing, and overall a well put-together movie, that will leave you longing to watch again, the minute you leave the cinema."

","I was lucky enough to go see this movie at the AMC Fan event and this movie was just incredible. The story just flows beautifully and you feel like you are a part of it. Let me just say that the cast was phenomenal. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job directing and I expect him to win the major categories at the Oscars. Lady Gaga was the perfect choice for this film. Her acting was so natural and it felt like you were watching her documentary. Her voice was fantastic and each emotion was delivered beautifully. Each song in the movie is sung live and each lyric fits perfectly fit the scene. This is the love story of our generation."

"eileen-guthrie555","6","0","0","18 May 2020"," Bitterly disappointing and doesn't live up to it's hype
","A fairly good movie, but not great and the hype it received from its original release just doesn't match what I saw on the screen. I'm not a fan or familiar with Lady Gaga's work, because I find her too commercial and gimmicky for my personal taste in music. But I was surprised that she has such a good voice and vocal range and if it is true these were live performances and not recorded in a studio setting and them lip syncing then I was impressed. I was not impressed with Bradley Coopers guitar skills and singing voice. When you compare the previous incarnation of this same movies this one pales in comparison. Why make another movie when the original was so much better and has received 5 stars, this is mediocre at best. I don't see enough of a struggle or the downward spiral in Bradley Cooper's performance.<br/><br/>His addictions issues are glossed over and to me it felt like Bradley was holding back in his performance, he's a much better actor but wasn't committed to this performance as an entertainer on his way down and out or being a fall down drunk. I've watched this movie three times hoping I would see something different that I might have missed in my original viewing of this movie, but each time I got the same results. His character was to have spent too many years of concerts, managers, self-indulgent behavior, just very tired of being on the road for decades and life on the road was to have made him very cynical and the monotony was to have taken its toll on him vocally and physically. Jackson was supposed to resent his wife success and become very bitter and an embarrassment. I didn't see a character in self destruct mode.<br/><br/>I just didn't see him struggling with his alcoholism and drug abuse addictions issues, his character is supposed to be an alcoholic and eventually succumb to his addictions in the end. He just seems to be a self-indulgent and very narcissistic man. I have no sympathy for his character as I did in the Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand versions of the same film. Isn't the audience supposed to have empathy and compassion for the male lead? I did love Sam Elliott's performance and he was committed to his character and he was the sole reason I kept watching. Some of the songs and soundtrack were good but only two of the song stood out. Shallow and Always Remember Us This Way are the standouts.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, but I was greatly disappointed in it because of all the hype the media gave this movie, I was expecting to be blown away by their performances and I wasn't. Maybe for Bradley he was dealing with too many balls in the air. Producer, director, screenwriter, writing songs, singing, learning to play the guitar and lead actor, something fell between the cracks and sadly it was his performance and lack of commitment to his character. It's a promising start to a new directing career. Why was Bradley's face so red? It was a distraction to me and he sounded too much like Sam Elliott. Overall, I will give this movie a 6 out of 10."
"stephcollider","9","0","0","16 May 2020"," One of the better remakes
","Having seen the many remakes of this film, I must say this film did the storyline and emotion justice. It goes without says, even though Im saying it, the acting and music are amazing, it makes the film alone. But where the film really shines is the emotional connection between the cast and more so, the leads.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film, real drama, real emotion."
"Landon1620251","9","0","0","13 May 2020"," Great film. But you already know that.
","There's nothing that I will say here that hasn't been said yet. This film will deserve every Oscar award that it got. ""Shallow"" is powerfully and catchy. There is not a weak performance here (probably my favorite work from Sam Elliott, fight me). Blah blah blah. You've heard it all before.
The two weak points, though, come in the cinematography and the pacing. The second act of the movie, where Ally's fame is on the rise, is very messy.
These are not large gripes compare to the other pieces to a wonderful puzzle. This is a crowd pleaser I can get behind."
"flicklover","9","0","0","10 May 2020"," The best versión of this story.
","A Star Is Born had been made 3 times before this version directed by Bradley Cooper Cameron out. I went into the theater with cautious optimism on liking thus movie. Though I like the 1976 Barbara Streisand it is very much just a showcase for her singing. The movie seemed very much an ego trip for it's star.<br/><br/>This updated version makes the focus of the story Jackson Maine played by Cooper. He is a talented but alcoholic, drug addicted country- rock star that falls in love with Ally, played by Lady Gaga. He sees her singing in a drag bar and is instantly smitten by her beauty and talent. This is all of course familiar but Bradley Cooper's performance is so good that you buy him in the role. He is on the way down in his stardom, and the drugs and alcohol are taking their toll in his life, but he comes off as a troubled but sensitive guy with alot of inner demons. Ally is played by Lady Gaga. When Jackson and Ally are together there is instant chemistry. Jackson is so impressed by her talent that he invites her ti sing at one of his concerts. The concerts scenes between Cooper and Lady Gaga are really good. Obviously, she being the performer she is looks very comfortable in those scenes. I have to say that I wasn't really into.her in the movie at first. I an not a huge fan of her music. But her performance is really good. Her performance though very good, is not completely up to par with Bradley Cooper but she holds her own. Like the other movies dealing with this story Ally becomes a huge star a little to quickly. But hey, it's a movie. She gets approached by a manager/record producer Rez that wants to work with her. She is very excited about the opportunity but Rez wants to completely change her image and music style. He wants to make her into a pop star. Jackson doesn't like thus but supports Ally. The film does take a shot at the cookie cutter, corporate pop music that is very much what Lady Gaga performs in real life. Jackson is at once happy for his love for her newfound success but is also a little jealous because he knows his star is fading. His addiction starts to dominate and he begins to be a negative influence in Ally's career. Jackson has a half brother named Bobby played by Sam Elliott that manages his career. Bobby is tired of Jacksons antics but stays with him because he takes care of his younger brother. There is alot of tension between Bobby and Jackson, especially regarding Jackson's idolatry of their seemingly bad father. The whole story is of course predictable, but the performances, the music, the supporting characters are so good that the movie is very involving. It all wouldn't work without the romantic chemistry between Cooper and Lady Gaga. It it really does. It is very much a Hollywood screen love story, but it works. What's impressive is Bradley Cooper's sure handed direction. He doesn't try to wow us with any fancy directorial flourishes. He focuses on the performances. Especially his. Alot of times, actors that also direct a movie have their performances suffer because they are involved more in the making of the movie. It doesn't happen here. Cooper's performance as Jackson is great. Tender, angry and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>A terrific directorial debut.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"phnix-981-724555","1","0","0","6 May 2020"," Overrated and disappointing
","I don't understand all these reviews. I have just watched the film with high expectations based on all I've heard since it's release back in 2018. Haven't seen the older versions so I had no idea what the plot was about, besides the obvious; a star is born. I have to say, Bradly is awesome and his singing is great but the storyline is so basic, predictable and boring that I couldn't help feeling disappointed thought the film. Cooper made it worth the time but that's about it. Gaga was not bad but I could not see past her real life persona, which is highly referenced in the film, make it harder for me to identify with Ally when all I could see was Gaga. Overall, a highly overrated and disappointing film."

"Dandido","7","0","0","1 May 2020"," Well Made Hollywood Movie With An Interesting Insight Into The Lives of Successful Musicians
","I finally got around to seeing this movie and I am happy that I did. All the actors do an amazing job; I am especially impressed by Lady Gaga as she is first and foremost a singer. Bradley Cooper also make a stellar performance as always.<br/><br/>One of the things that I like the most about the movie is that I feel like it depicts the life as a successful musician in an honest way. It shows both the good parts (thrill of performing in front of people, wealth) as well as the bad parts (people bothering you and taking pictures of you, risk of substance abuse, managers pushing you to become someone you're not and not having your best interest in mind).<br/><br/>The thing I like the least about the movie is that it is such a typical American, Hollywood movie. That's just not my taste, and it made me pretty bored at times, even wishing that it would end. During the final scene I even looked at how much of the movie was left, which is not a good sign.<br/><br/>I got a bit bored by the singing all the time. The songs were good, for sure, I just don't find it that entertaining to watch a musician perform on a stage without anything else happening.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was when Jack brought Ally up on stage for the first time. It was really well done and powerful and actually brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>I will most likely never see this movie again, but I understand that people like it and I am happy to have seen it."
"sauravjoshi85","7","0","0","30 April 2020"," A good movie with nice music
","A Star is Born is a romantic musical drama movie directed by Bradley Cooper and stars Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliott and Rafi Gavron in the leads.<br/><br/>The movie is directorial debut for Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>The movie has it's own strong and weak points. The acting by Bradley Cooper is amazing, Lady Gaga was also ok. Sam Elliott was good. Music is beautiful and mesmerising but to some extent slow screenplay and halfhearted attempt from the co characters are the weak points of the movie. Slow Screenplay might bore certain viewers. The movie is not for everyone. The climax is touching and emotional.<br/><br/>Cinematography is another strong aspect of the movie. A must watch for all romantic musical movie lovers."

","This is the first version of this movie I've seen out of the four options available currently (1937, 1954, 1976, 2018). I'm not sure why this movie keeps getting remade, because the story is fairly basic. I did enjoy the music, though, and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga give good (though mumbly) performances. At the end of it all, however, I was left wondering, ""what was the point?"" I think this movie may have been overhyped."

","I am so disappointed, I really wanted to enjoy this film, perhaps I was expecting too much, but people had said such great things.
It can't be denied that Gaga is amazing and has a fantastic voice, but I don't think it was showcased enough in this film. Bradley has a good voice too, however you will need the subtitles to understand what he is saying.
I will give the Judy and Barbara versions a go some time and hope I enjoy them more.
This one is a bit dark for me, very angry and full of negative emotions. Maybe I just needed it to be more of a pick me up than it was.
It's definitely a slow burner."

Due to jealousy he tries to destroy it. But by her love, she helps him. The decision he finally makes to make her success without any setbacks is a greater sacrifice.

","I was captivated by the wonderful performances of both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, their chemistry was very convincing and their voices absolutely superb. The songs were wonderful and the story was beautifully constructed around the music. My only criticism would have to be that the ending feels a little rushed: Jackson Maine's suicide seemed more to be attributed to hearing harsh words from Ally's manager, rather than due to his painful addiction, and there is little resolution for Ally in terms of her returning to her talent and realising that she doesn't need to change anything about herself."

","It's taken me a long time to write a review because I truly wasnt ready. I am a huge fan of both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Specifically, I have loved her from the start and to see her in an 'organic' role is so incredibly satisfying. Now for why this was hard to write....the first time I saw this movie, (I had no idea it was a remake), I could barely sleep. It left such an impression on me. This movie haunted my dreams. I have a degree in music. Singing has been a part of my life since as long as I can remember. So if course that was wonderful. What got me the most was the realistic tendencies of the character. I am married to an alcoholic. A for thw most part functioning alcoholic...until he cant function anymore. I'm not sure what Bradley Cooper did to play the part, but every single characteristic/ideosyncracy that he characterized was so spot on it was uncomfortable to watch. And Gaga's portrayal or a loving/yet exhausted wife is spot on too. Teying to hide your significant others problems is exhausting. Ive just now been able to watxh it again because after the 4th attempt at hospitalization my husband is becoming himself again. This movie touched my heart. The story is tragic and beautiful all at the same time."
"Jini-B","8","0","0","21 March 2020"," Deeply Emotional and Personal
","I have been avoiding this movie since I thought this would be too sappy. Well, after watching the movie, I have to say, I was not quite accurate in my thought. I have to mention, I knew the story and I had watched remakes of the original story, so I was well aware of what was to come. What this movie did, though, was make it so deeply personal that I couldn't help but root for the characters to have a happy ending.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga exhibit scintillating chemistry and they really looked like they were completely invested in the story. I enjoyed the concert scenes, but the conversation scenes where they get to know each other were what really drew me in. Bradley Cooper has done a wonderful job in his debut directorial venture, and he sure exhibits a natural flair for storytelling. I am eager to see more from him in the Director's chair.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was the cast. The lead characters were great, but the supporting characters were no less. Billy Elliot was so good in his role as Cooper's brother in the film. The songs were emotional and beautiful, and both the leads did a great job on their vocal performances. I was surprised by Cooper; Gaga, as usual, does a great job. There's a real pathos in her voice which draws out emotions from the audience as well.<br/><br/>The other elements, including the cinematography, sound design, and editing were all very well done, and works to further benefit the movie. This was a great adaptation of the well-known and well-loved tale."

","The film is interesting an explores a lot of intriguing themes such as fame, love, addiction and psychological issues. I thought the music and acting were top notch, although not perfect. Overall, I consider it a must have on my movie collection shelf/list.<br/><br/>I believe the film fell short in some areas and I admit I will overlook it. Some moments the film drags and overplays the point. Some scenes felt overacted or not perfect chemistry wise. Finally, there is an ""it"" (attention) factor that keeps me from awarding the film a 10/10-I wanted to know what happened, but I could take a break mid movie unlike a 10/10 where I'd struggle leave before completion.<br/><br/>Time will be a good test for this film, but I think it's a must have for musicians, actors and artists who can really appreciate the dynamics explored here.

","Coopers version of ASIB, works on the chemistry between he and Ladt Gaga, who is wonderful.
The issue may be a budgetary one. Has anyone noticed the film is shot almost entirely in close-ups?
Even the opening concert scene, filmed at Coachella 2017, is fleeting and besides any name for the venue being given, where the heck does this film take place? Bradley??!
I do appreciate the many little touches Bradley incorporated (the eyebrows scene to name one).
But, the film largely works on the marvellous chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who shines in this dramatic leading role, and she is the worthy modern version of Esther Hoffman (the daughter of the '76 couple??) tho, as terrific as Lady Gaga is, and who has a beautiful, powerful voice, nothing touches the razor sharp glorious voice of Streisand
A worthy remake hampered by stylistic constraints
and the fact no one can touch Streisand's vocal range and clarity."

","Have seen all versions but I think I like this one the best. Why? The music is magical, endearing and catchy. I am still singing the Shallow song today and will for awhile. The singers, esp. Gaga, are strong and virile with great performance vibes. I doubt there would be that much canoodling in front of a massive live audience but the camera leads you to believe it's just us. The pacing never drags and it was delightful to see Sam Elliott, Dave Chapelle and others in minor roles. Watching on a small screen, had some issues with the garage scene, but overall good direction and smooth transitions between scenes. Watching a second time enjoyed the music even more but it does lose a bit of luster given the attraction of Lady GaGa dims. Recommend to complete the series."

I think the movie did a pretty good job depicting these aspects."

"johnnyreevesbass","6","0","0","10 September 2019"," Interesting film
","The cast was incredible for A Star Is Born. But I feel it was too much of a love story and regardless of how the Gaga character is portrayed she used the Cooper character. I guess it hit close to home as a guy being used from an entertainer. You can see it in most of the scenes she could not sit back and ride the boat she keep pushing to gain popularity. If she wasn't using he Cooper character she would have stayed a back up singer instead of riding his boat to fame. Beyond my feeling on this subject the film was shot incredible. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper put on a very impressive performance and the songs that came form the sound track are incredible. The story does it job and watching this at the theater closet to a year ago every lady in the theater left crying. Which leads me to my last feeling of the film which is the writers had a great base line and did beyond that keeping the story going. Going into the film it was a revised film from an older story with the same name which I haven't seen since I was a kid but I assume the plots and story are very similar."

","Totally engaging movie with great performances from Cooper and Gaga but sadly let down by the award ceremony. Just doesn't make sense that Cooper would behave that way on stage...made no sense for the fact he wouldn't actually get to the stage and two what spouse would turn a blind eye to a loved one behaving like that? Also what individual would insert themselves into a relationship knowing one member is unwell and purposely seek to cause distress like the manager did. Guess I don't do Hollywood because this just seems - well a shortcut to crop the story. That and Gaga clearly pulled into an entertainment path that clearly wasn't her passion. Could have just been better but saying that the talent of both Cooper and Gaga holds the attention and uses the tissues."

"truemythmedia","9","0","0","19 August 2019"," The Best Version
","I saw the trailer for this movie and I was in. I had never seen the previous versions but Gaga's voice had me. I don't always care for the subject matter of her songs but her voice always captures my attention. I knew that the trailer is always cut to give me that excitement for the film so I fully expected the movie to not land quite as well but I thought, as the buzz machine started, that this might be a solid 3-4 star film for me.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is a decent actor. Gaga is a phenomenal singer. This movie already had me more interested than its predecessors.<br/><br/>Then I start hearing that even though this is Cooper's first outing a director, it's super well done. Not only that, I hear Gaga is quite the talented actress. Hmmm. Is this the Hollywood hype machine trying to sell a big movie or is this real buzz?<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, I was feeling excited as I headed to theater on Monday night.<br/><br/>When I think back on the film there are a few things that jump off the screen at me. However, there is one thing that didn't jump off the screen at me. The direction.<br/><br/>In some ways, as I look back, this may impress me just as much as the things that did stick out as great. There are directors whose work is in your face. Tarantino is that kind of guy. You know when you are watching a Tarantino movie because of the way his camera moves and the way the violence splashes around the frame.<br/><br/>In ""A Star Is Born,' Cooper shows a restraint that I imagine is very difficult for a first timer. He doesn't lean on a lot of in your face movement or overly indulgent 'artsy' shots to make armchair film critics feel like the cinematography is good because they noticed it. Instead, he lets his scenes play out patiently and doesn't let the camera be a distraction from the portrayals of emotion the actors are giving.<br/><br/>As a result, you barely notice the camera at all and you get to feel caught up in the moments that are being shown to you. Snappy and unreal dialogue can be fun in the right setting but here we get conversations full of the moments where people mumble a little, have to think of their next word, or choke up in all of the nuanced ways we do as humans.<br/><br/>Because of this focus on the performance, Cooper goes further with the subject of love and self destruction than most other movies with such a broad appeal. Far from a Romantic Comedy, this film treats love as a serious matter. It understand that the waves that catch us up also draw us out to sea where we can't seem to fight the current. That is nothing to crack jokes about.<br/><br/>Serious couples know this and will see it echoed on screen not, perhaps, in the specific circumstances of the film but in the dynamics of the films main characters. Just as there are no 'and then they lived happily ever afters' in real life, this film doesn't mess around with happiness untinged with fear or doubt.<br/><br/>It doesn't pretend that mental illness is easy to live with for either person or that a twelve step program is a magic cure all. It rests solidly in the knowledge that issues like that are lifetime issues that need lifetime commitments and lifetime love to match.<br/><br/>It revels in those sorts of complexities and rather than alienating people with a story of hard love it draws them in because we all long to love and be loved like that.<br/><br/>Luckily for Cooper, every actor in this cast is batting a thousand. Sam Elliot as the older brother is frustrating and heartbreaking in his normal salt of the earth wisdom and stubbornness. Bradley is a fine actor and with something real to play, rather than the less emotional and pretty boy characters, he really shines.<br/><br/>The real stand out though is Lady Gaga. What a powerhouse performance. Obviously, drawing on her own life and career helps but people who have never acted or been around actors don't realize that the vulnerability she gives into in this film is not easy. It means drudging up your worst experiences and dearest moments and holding them in heart; not in secret, but right out there in the open to be documented and analyzed by a world of people they do not know or have any reason to trust. This performance is power.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is more than acting. None of this works if the music isn't good. I knew I would like Gaga. I usually do. What I didn't expect was Bradley Cooper standing right next to her and not being outclassed.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is so wonderful because they aren't merely musical performances you are watching. They are acting moments where you can see their thoughts behind their eyes and the ways that the music reinforces those emotions and rise up from them. They are songs that don't feel like they are being sung by a grammy winner and a movie star. They end up feeling more like duets between the characters they are portraying and that is a huge accomplishment in a film."

"samantarik","8","0","0","8 August 2019"," A timeless tale retold brilliantly
","A seasoned musician discovers and falls in love with a struggling artist, and coaxes her into the spotlight. Even as she finds fame, his own career begins to spiral downward owing to his alcoholism, jeopardizing the personal side of their relationship.
Achingly intense, immersive and finely tuned, this film is an exploration of love against the backdrop of fame and stardom. Seamlessly integrating terrific original songs into the script, debutante director Bradley Cooper's defiantly fresh approach makes his gut-level commitment to the story shine through. 'A Star Is Born' lives up to its name, thanks to the supreme Lady Gaga. The undeniable chemistry between the leads makes watching them fall in love on screen a joy.

"emx-89592","6","0","0","5 August 2019"," Ok, but not great
","Overall it is a fairly ok middle-of-the-road drama, it is trying to be really emotional and it does have its good moments but feels a bit rushed at times making it a bit, well, like it's title song: shallow."
"richarddillomes","7","0","0","1 August 2019"," A star is born...not the brightest though
","A Star Is Born is the fourth remake of the film, which stars Bradley Cooper (Alias, American Sniper) and Lady Gaga (American Horror Story) and it follows how the former, a very successful musician stumbles upon the latter, a struggling singer and how he takes her from performing at a drag show to singing in front of a massive crowd as a featured guest on his concerts which opens the door to her own successful singing career.<br/><br/>This is an unpopular opinion so I'll just rip off the band aid quickly: I do not get the numerous acclaim the film is getting. Maybe it's because I've heard so much praise about it but after seeing 6 of the 8 Best Picture nominees side by side the discrepancy is apparent but if I've seen it on it's own I might have a different opinion about it.<br/><br/>Aside from Best Picture, both actors are nominated for their respective roles of which for Cooper I get because he was acting every second and he's a disaster when he's drunk, but is the sweetest when sober. His voice had a lower tone, he plays the guitar and sings. I won't even attempt to figure out who will win Best Actor between him, Christian Bale and Viggo Mortensen because they all deserve to up there. As for Lady Gaga, I'm not entirely convinced why she's nominated. Don't get me wrong, she turned in a decent performance, her chemistry with Cooper was there and she had her moments, most notably their bath tub scene. On the other hand, I felt her acting was lacking, like Cooper as Director didn't push her hard enough and for some reason I kept on thinking Katharine McPhee would've done a better job. Maybe that's where the disparity comes from, Cooper was giving 110% while Gaga to which no fault of her own could barely manage to come up with 90%.<br/><br/>I also don't get the hype over the soundtrack (Shallow has surpassed Michael Jackson's 'Thriller for the most number of awards won,) with most of the lyrics I found basic and trite. I'm sure it will grow on me with multiple listening, same as the movie, which brings me back to my statement that I expect more from a Best Picture, Actress and Song nominees. So a star may have been born, but they aren't that far from the shallow now."

"wineguy856","7","0","0","26 July 2019"," Good movie, great music, bad editing
","I just got done watching this and I don't recall the plot for the other versions but this was interesting and odd. The soundtrack is great but I'm confused as to why they changed her persona when she goes solo. She had the talent to be a country musician then went and changed everything to be a pop star. That was disappointing. I know Gaga is a pop star but her character wasn't. And the manager she signed with was a colossal douche. Bradley Cooper did a great job as a musician and a drunk. But why kill himself? How did that have anything to add to the story??? That was horrible, would've liked to see them sing the final song as a duet.<br/><br/>Technically the movie was very jarring and cut to another scene too quickly too many times. I'm still surprised it's been praised as a Best Picture Nominee with such poor editing.<br/><br/>All in all it was very entertaining and I enjoyed seeing Gaga sing ""real music"" before they changed her persona. But of course they marketed this movie to millennials and not 50-somethings like me."

"rachelbowerman-64924","9","0","0","22 July 2019"," Anything but dull, if you understand empathy and true love.
","This film touches on some very under appreciated facts about alcohilism and mental illness, such as recognition that alcoholism is a disease. So many people through lack of empathy and understanding have a negative attitude towards issues, such as alcoholism and mental illness and that is gently but definitely touched upon here. The way Ally loves Jack is real, true acceptance if who he is and loves him anyway, it was regeshing in a climate where if you so much as cough at another human being you are severely reprimanded for being a terrible person, well the trutb is people are not perfect, not robots and I found it refreshing to watch a film that highlights the fact that people are not infallible and that says that is ok, it says that Love is worth more than fame and fortune and success and it is true. the references to Ally not looking appropriate based on individual appraisal points out lacking in society's attitudes to people in general rather than wanting to take raw talent as it is, there is always someone wanting to mould someone else into their own vision for their own ends. it does have a bit of a commercial feel, but at the end of the day the creators need to make their money, so they want it to appeal to the masses. I have not cried at a film like I cried to this literally in years. It really touched me. I disagree that it was entirely predictable. I think had it been predictable drivel like a lot of romantic films are, you would not have had the highs and the lows of the relationship. The story itself is slightly cheesy in places, and I can understand some of the criticism with regards to it being airy fairy and overtly fairytalesque. None of that however took away from the overall message, moral undertow and heartfelt intentions for me. What really resonated for me was the depth of the love between Ally and Jack. It was a wonderful reminder of the importance of true love in what is now a fairly materialistic and emotionally controlled time to be living in, it veered away from all the traditional views of how we should all behave like robots and concentrated on the beauty and uniqueness of being human and accepting flaws as being wonderful beautiful. Hats off to bradley, I can see what you were trying to achieve. Breathtaking."

","Here's my review of ' A star is born ' . The movie is directed by Bradley Cooper starring Cooper and Lady Gaga. Both of them were brilliant in this movie esp Lady Gaga considering how this is her debut from what I heard. The story is about this celeb singer with alcohol issues who then meets another singer at a bar and takes her to stardom while getting romantically involved with her. This movie felt like a fusion of '8 mile' and 'Begin again'. After 8 mile this is probably one of the best songs made for a movie. The music is just amazing , like go back and download right away sort of amazing. It has a lot of dark themes such as identity crisis , ego , jealousy and some good morales so either you're a person who gets them or you can just have fun with the songs . Either way it's pretty entertaining. However there are some scenes where the dialogue is too long and you're waiting for those convos to get over but it's only in a few scenes.In the end I felt Bradley Cooper's a great director especially with dramas and a ' star is born ' comes with great characters , an amazing list of songs , morales and everything a good drama requires."

","This is a very sweet and sad movie. It has great songs, great performances. A love story that is founded on some truly great chemistry between our two leads. It is a good story of success. Troughout the film we see these two grow apart and grow back together, Lady Gagas character becomes increasingly more famous, leaving Bradley Cooper in the back, who is a character who I was curious about, as we know little about him but are let in on the fact that he is a very sintmental person and a highly tragic one with a backstory of depression and drunkenness. You did feel sorry for him. You feel sorry for him as you feel good for her as she gets that success. When they are together, signing or simply hanging about, things get to a rather tender sate, to a rather sweet time. It is a movie of moments like that. It has a classic quality to it to from that.<br/><br/>Also being expertly directed, Cooper also serves as the man behind the camera here, and he frames and puts all the passion and vsison right in front. At the end it proves a sad tale, a tale of making something special, having something to say, never getting lost in an image. It is far to charming and enduring in its message and in its execution for me to not it to much for a bit of predictability now and then. Everything that works works much to well. The songs also, are truly beufiul, original, and real. Cooper set out to gives us this story, and it proved well."

But all in all quite a standard story, that is definitely well executed but lacking in deeper substance.<br/><br/>I do struggle with determining whether that great execution and the coherent storytelling can in fact allow me to look past its lack of a deeper meaning and originality; but, unfortunately I don't really think so in this case.

Their connection forms the basis of this film as they go through the inevitable ups and downs of show business, and the difficulties of maintaining a healthy relationship. Although it's easy to figure out the trajectory of this picture, it's still deeply moving thanks to the work of Cooper who gives a magnetic performance, is a credible vocalist, and provides sure-handed direction, as well as Lady Gaga who's captivating in the dual role of actor and singer.

","There is something magnetic about this movie. I don't know if it's the amazing musical performances, the love story between Ally and Jack or the incredible chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both on screen and outside which makes me feel that way. Probably the combination of both 3.<br/><br/>Let's start with the musical score first. It's needless to say that each time Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper start performing, you're entering in another world. Of course I already knew that Gaga is a very talented performer but in this movie, she blew me away. She trades her eccentric costumes and make-up for a natural look making her almost unrecognizable and much more attractive. All we have left of the Gaga we all know is her incredible voice. And that's all we need.<br/><br/>Bradley, on his end, blew me away as well. I know he's a talented actor but I never imagined how a lovely voice he has or how great of a guitar player he is. I know he took lessons to become Jackson but you need to have already something within yourself to be able to reach that level. That huge load of work paid off!<br/><br/>But what makes this film so amazing is the amazing chemistry between each other. Some may say that's just acting but no. Each time we see them together, you're feeling a connection which cannot be faked. And this relationship gives so much strength to the love story between Jack and Ally. It feels authentic and raw, never fading away. When you see the interviews, you can feel there is a huge amount of respect and care for each other. No doubt a beautiful friendship has been born out of it and who knows how it could turn in the near future? ;)"

","I just watched 'A Star Is Born' & I loved it. I don't know how much of Ally was based off of Stefani when she's not ladygaga if she was at all. But if Lady gaga the character wasn't a thing & Stefani was just herself I believe she would be a bigger Star than she is as lady gaga<br/><br/>I dont know anything about the Woman behind @ladygaga but watching A Star is Born made me wish that a new star would be born. A star named Stefani... Let the world see the real you. I mean no disrespect I just I love the idea of Ally when she was first sang with Jackson on stage<br/><br/>I love seeing artists before their managers 'res' , producers and other puppet masters take over and turn the artists into who they want them to be. Dye their hair, change their wardrobe, make them dance. Why can't artists just be themselves?<br/><br/>I would go see Ally and Jackson sing together like they did before Ally got her own record deal 1,000 times before I would go see the polished, and molded version of 'Ally' perform.<br/><br/>Again no disrespect to Stefani but you don't need that over the top character (Ladygaga) for people to listen to what you have to say."

","I went into this movie not knowing what the storyline was... only that the reviews were great and that it would be a love story. What I saw was terrific acting and good music/singing... but an emotionally agonizing story. I thought I'd be rooting for a new star being born but, instead watched the two main characters suffer through a train wreck of a relationship. I realize that not all stories are uplifting, nor do they all have happy endings... but I left the theater feeling sad and a little depressed. That a movie can have such an affect speaks volumes about how well it was done, but I personally don't go to movies to leave without any positive takeaways, nor am I entertained by watching characters' emotional suffering for over two hours. Many folks enjoy any type of well portrayed story, even sad ones, and most will ""enjoy"" this movie.

","The often recreated and now 4th version of this film hit theaters on October 5th and I have to say, I was completely blown away by this movie. Bradley Cooper (also his directorial debut) and Stefani Germanoti (better known as Lady Gaga in her movie debut) play the star crossed lovers of a troubled rock star's descent and her meteoric rise in this modernized version of the film. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, an aging and burned out rock star who tours with his band, and drinks heavily. He is emotionally void and his life just takes him further into the bottle every day. After one of his concerts he hastily rushes off in his limo and stops at a bar to further his drinking. Unbeknownst to him it is a drag bar. The door man at the bar recognizes him and sets him up for further libation, telling him to stay for the show as his friend Ally will be performing. We are introduced to Ally in a previous scene. She is a frustrated limo driver with the musical talent and voice to rival anyone. When she performs The French song En Vive en Rose in full glam makeup and fake eyebrows, Jackson Maine is taken by her performance and realness as well as her amazing voice. You can see he is truly smitten with her even though she feels completely flawed by her looks and points this out to him as a defense mechanism especially her nose. ""I think you're beautiful"" is his honest response. They continue the evening by going to another bar, getting in a bar fight shopping for an ice pack and sitting on the ground of an empty parking lot, where Ally makes up a song on the spot and belts out a few lyrics. Their quasi date ends and she is taken home to a where she lives with her loving father (brilliantly played by Andrew Dice Clay) But before she goes in Jackson asks her to come to his show later that night. After some coaxing and the fact that she hates her job she is then whisked away on a private jet to his show. It is there he tells the audience that he met a girl and she wrote a song that he wants to perform for the crowd. This is one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. The ballad ""Shallow"" which I predict will be sung in every Karaoke bar from now to eternity is the best song in the movie. Cooper can really sing too.<br/><br/>Seeing Lady Gaga stripped down from the glamour, make up and glitz of the red carpet that I am so used to seeing is what sells the movie. It's as raw as we get to see her and she completely runs with it, her talent on full display. To his credit, Cooper directs the movie with a steady cam and close ups showing the realism of their budding relationship. Their chemistry is real. The constant strain and mistakes he shows as the flawed Maine makes him damaged yet empathetic. You really root for him to gain control of his life after every tumble. <br/><br/>The second half of the movie delves further into their relationship as they get married. Ally's career takes off like a rocket as her talent is too much to be just Jackson's sidekick at his concerts. She puts out her own album with her new Manager Rez who to me, was a caricature of every British English pompous music producer (think Simon Cowell) Ally does everything she can to support Jackson as her star continues to burn bright, but his reckless ways, continual drinking, drugging and gradual hearing loss makes the downward spiral even sadder to watch.<br/><br/>This culminates in the most cringe inducing moment as she wins the Grammy for best new artist and he drunkenly stumbles on the stage as she is giving her speech and....well. Let's just say, the audience I saw it with let out an audible gasp at what transpired. He has finally hit rock bottom. He checks into a rehab facility. He is full of remorse and after completing the program returns home to the support and love that Ally has for him. But it is still marred by his uncertainty. He feels he is not good enough for her. Ally's manager tells him as much and is just waiting for him to wreck her again in the future. I won't go into the details of the end of the movie. Jackson does what he thinks is the best thing for Ally. But, the ending left me gutted. I looked around the theater and could see wet glistening eyes and heard soft and muffled sobbing all around me. I can't remember the last time a movie pulled me in emotionally the way this one did. I predict Oscars for best picture, best director, Best Actor and Actress and best song at next year's awards. Deservedly so. This movie has stuck with me for the past few days and I have been listening to all the songs on Spotify. That's as great a compliment I can give this wonderful film."

","I was ignorant to the storyline of A Star Is Born and the previous renditions of it when I went to see this last night. I went to watch it mainly because I was curious to see how Lady Gaga would perform in a full-length film, having enjoyed her performance in American Horror Story. 2.5 hours later, I emerged from the depths of the silent cinema, tears still rolling down my face. This was such a powerful film and a triumph for Bradley Cooper. He can act, direct, sing, play guitar - what a talent. As for Gaga - she is a revelation. I'm sure this is the first in a long line of main acting roles for her, and it's not hyperbole to say her performance could be Oscar-worthy. Cinematically it was also a delight - close camera angles put you into the intimacy of the scenes, whilst the final fifteen minutes had the entire audience holding their breath (and crying). When the credits rolled, everyone in the packed cinema just sat motionless, stunned into silence. I drove home with tears still rolling down my face!<br/><br/>This is the best film I've seen this year by a hundred miles, and possibly the best film I've seen in the past five. It's stuck with me in a way films rarely do and my husband and I were still discussing all the details this morning. A probable and worthy contender for the awards season.

"maxstansell","8","0","0","7 October 2018"," A Star is Born
","Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's breathtaking performances throughout this movie truly capture and put on display how having fame and the spotlight on you are not as glorious as it may seem. A Star is Born tells the story of the fall of musician Jackson Maine, played by Bradley Cooper, and the rise of Ally, played by Lady Gaga, by following both of them through their progressing careers.
 This film is quick to introduce Jackson Maine as a very successful and well-known musician, who has an extremely serious problem with substance abuse. After his show, Maine runs out of liquor. While searching for more he happens to make his way to a cross dressing bar that features live musical performances. This is where Maine first comes in contact with Ally, where he witnesses her performing a French song. Amazed by her performance, Jackson Maine asks Ally to join him for a drink. This leads to our main characters ending up in a cop bar, where Ally introduces a drunk officer to her fist. A relatively intoxicated Jackson Maine then prepares her an ice pack comprised of frozen peas and gauze. This incident is where the two characters chemistry really starts to come to life.
 While Ally and Jackson's relationship had its highpoints, it brought a lot of complexity to both of their lives. Ally starts to find success and fame around the same time that Jackson's own career starts to burn out and spiral downwards. While his own career is fading, Jackson just cannot escape his own inner demons. His struggle with drugs and alcohol continues to grow worse and worse. At one of his lowest points, Jackson finds himself passed out on stage, while Ally is supposed to be accepting an award. This incident is one of the many factors that lands Jackson in rehab. When it appears that Jackson's life had made somewhat of a U turn, he has a tense discussion with Ally's manager. Her manager is very firm on the idea that Jackson is nothing, but dead weight for Ally and her career. This is what appears to be the final nail in Jackson Maine's coffin. While Ally is away at the final concert of her tour, Jackson commits suicide by hanging himself in his garage with a belt, which is something he alludes to earlier in the film.
 This movie truly does a great job of telling a love story full of pain, addiction, tragedy, and fame. The movie has great music, but the on-screen chemistry of Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is what truly makes this film special. While there are so many great things about this film, there are a couple not so great things also. This film was pretty long, over two hours, and it seemed like there could have been a couple scenes that the movie could have gone without. 
 While this movie was full of key events to the plot, the timeline was somewhat hard to follow. This film seems like it could have stretched six months or six years. Ally's fame appeared to come very quickly. At one point she was just a guest singing on stage with Jackson, but next thing you know she is performing on Saturday Night Live, which is hosted by Alec Baldwin, and planning on going on tour across Europe.
 Overall, this is a great film that reels the viewer in and keeps their attention for a strong majority of the film. The casting is phenomenal. The sound track is full of songs that I would not hesitate to throw into the rotation of music that I listen to on a regular basis. This is certainly a film that you should keep your eyes out for during the awards season this upcoming Winter."

","IMDB Movie Review 
Skylar Molen 
English 100-002 
 
Over the weekend, my best friend and I went to the movie theatre to see ""A Star Is Born"", directed and co-written by main character Bradley Cooper, co-starred by Lady Gaga. The film is a story about a successful rock star/musician, Bradley Cooper's character Jack, who discovers a young and talented singer, Lady Gaga's character Ally, and helps her find fame and success. At first, it seems like a beautiful love story, two musicians meet, make music together, and fall in love. Though throughout the movie Ally and Jack's story proves to be much more complicated after all. Jack is a heavy drinker/drug user who's hearing is declining. In the movie he deals with family issues, and personal pain. The viewers see him struggle and fight throughout the movie with himself and his career as him and Ally struggle in their marriage. He lets himself go as Ally changes herself to become more successful in the industry. Jack gets help with his addictions and you feel a happy ending coming for Ally and Jack, but then the movie ends tragically. It's a plot twist and definitely effected the viewers. There wasn't a dry eye leaving the theatre. 
Now that you know the background and the story line, lets discuss the good and bad things about the actual film. This film has amazing acting and writing in my opinion. No actress could have played Ally's character as well as Lady G. If you are a fan of Lady Gaga, you know she is a talented singer and it shows in this movie, but what also shows and came as a surprise was her acting skills. The on-screen chemistry between Jack and Ally was awe-inspiring, and it made the film feel real. Bradley Cooper was amazing as usual, and played the part of an addiction ridden alcoholic very well. His struggle intrigued viewers and brought them into the film on a personal level. I think the film did a great job of that, making the movie personal to anyone who watched it. Jack was an alcoholic drug addict with family issues, and Ally wanted her dreams but had to change her appearance and music to reach them. If you couldn't relate to either character personally, you probably know someone who can, and that's where it hits home and draws in a crowd. Now for the not-so-great things I found about the film... first off, the running time for the movie was two hours and fifteen minutes. Along with many other reviews, I felt it could be shortened. The later part of the film seemed to drag on and focus on Jack's struggles when it didn't need to any longer, leading to the tragic ending. To sum up my feelings on that-the first part of the movie drew me in, and had me on the edge of my seat for Jack and Ally's relationship-while the later part bored me into the ending. I think if it was shortened it would have a more dramatic effect in the end. Another disappointing factor was when Ally lost who she was while trying to find fame, she never found herself while Jack was still living. He just wanted to show her the raw talent he first saw in her, but she loses sight of that when her manager prompts change. That drew me away from the story a little because I wanted Ally to find her true talent again, for Jack. Overall though, I still left the movie heart wrenched and thought it was a beautiful film."

"olivia_barringer","6","0","0","7 October 2018"," Oddly Paced Beginning, Painfully Slow Paced Second Act
","A Star Is Born is a beautifully shot romantic drama film that works in messages and themes about drug and alcohol abuse, working in the entertainment industry, fame, becoming washed up as an artist, and loving an addict. While the movie's ideas were powerful, I had a very hard time feeling anything for the characters in the film until the very end. We are introduced to them very abruptly and their relationship begins very strangely, with a somewhat uncomfortable feeling of pushiness and obsession. None of it felt genuine to me and the characters seemed to love only the idea of each other. 
The pacing felt off the entire movie. It was fast paced in the beginning parts of the movie but towards the end things dropped off and fell apart to the point where I was unmoved by the movie's ending. 
Bradley Cooper is a surprisingly good singer, and Lady Gaga is incredible as always. Cooper talked with a very forced accent oftentimes and would take very long pauses while speaking, however, and it took away from the movie a little. 
All in all, it's a decent movie, competently shot and well composed, but I personally had a hard time finding the story believable, connecting with characters I hardly knew, and being comfortable with the strange pacing."

","JUDGEment: A Star is Born - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517451/<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Drama and movies with emotions don't usually get to me. I am normally disconnected with movies which is just how I view movies. This is one of the first movies in a long time that has naturally evoked the emotions of happy, sad, and excited by just watching the movie. Not knowing about the source material I came into this just know what the trailers were about. The movie is very well paced, edited well, and the story is top notch.Cooper and Gaga were amazing together and the whole cast played their parts very well. The story is quite predictable but that doesn't hurt the story at all. It is so well acted that it is worth it. I saw this in Dolby Digital Premium Format and it was the right decision. The concert sounds and the musical moments are accentuated greatly in the premium format. This movie has a feeling that it will be a classic, one that we will look back on like we do movies of the past and say this was a classic.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Saw this in Dolby Premium Format, SEE IT THIS WAY. (If you can that is) The movie is much better with the large sound format. The story was amazing, it hit all the right notes, story was great but a bit predictable, but it is one of the few movies I've seen that made me feel the emotions of the movie and that doesn't happen often.

But to be fair after the song had finished, he publicly ate his words and said ""How wrong I was - that was fantastic!"". <br/><br/>That's pretty much how I think a lot of people might react to this film. Anyone who's followed Lady Gaga's career will know she's massively talented and fearless. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend viewing the youtube clip of her singing ""Gimme Shelter"" live onstage with the Rolling Stones a few years ago, quite amazing. So I fully expected her to belt out the show-stopping musical numbers in this film and knock it out of the park (which she does). The surprise is the depth and subtlety that she brings to her acting performance. Her transformation from waitress and part time club performer to Grammy winning superstar is eminently believable. The scenes I enjoyed most were the earlier ones where Jackson Maine (Cooper) gets her to believe in herself and her talent. The scene where he gets her onstage to duet with him for the first time was wonderful. Their early relationship is beautiful to watch and even the sex scene (I think there's only one?) is cut commendably short. My only criticism is the scene where Gaga is in the bath and as Cooper storms out of the bathroom she is seen briefly standing up naked - was that really necessary? <br/><br/>The music and singing from both leads throughout is outstanding. The rest of the supporting cast put in great performances too. There is nothing to fault in this film, so 10/10."
"a-hu","7","0","0","6 October 2018"," Not what I expected
","The movie might be called ""a star is born"" but it is much more of a love story than a story about fame. Gaga and Cooper both shine and sound brilliantly, the Music is incredible and delivers instant classics and ballads that resemble the greatest ballads of the 90s. This truly is Gaga's Bodyguard moment and she proves once more to be one of the most talented singer and songwriters of our decade. I absolutely loved the first part of the movie. However, things start to change in the middle of the film and I was missing some depths to understand how the characters, especially Ally, feel about it or how this change came to happen. Some scenes seemed to repeat itself and in the last part the movie was kinda slow. The end however blew me away. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a lot different than I expected but it was still a good movie that will cement Gaga's legacy as one of the greats."

","This is by far the best movie of the year so far. Lady Gaga blew me away with her performance and Bradly Cooper definitely made his mark as a great director. Not to mention he can really sing. The actors did live singing in this movie and it sounded so good and real. 
This movie is packed with mesmerizing and emotional songs. They drew the audience in and kept their attention. The song at the climax of the movie will most likely leave you speechless and in tears. 
This is a must see more all music fans and movie lovers.

","I went and saw ""A Star Is Born"" yesterday when the movie came out. Right out the gate we see Bradley Cooper on stage doing a fantastic impersonation of a Country Artist. The story is gripping, and believable and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through, It's been a while since that's happened. Who knew Bradley Cooper could sing? Lady Gaga was the biggest surprise, her acting was flawless and so believable that at times I forgot that I was in a theater. It seemed more listening to a conversation in my living room. I hope to see more of her on the big screen soon. Bradley Cooper's performance was absolutely ,positively Oscar worthy and hope to see him accepting an Academy award as lead actor in 2019! The hard work that was put out in 'A Star Is Born"" shows in every frame of the this picture. Congrats Bradley and Lady Gaga!!"

","I can tell you this; I have a lot more respect for Lady Gaga now then ever. I knew she could sing, but I was not so familiar with her being an actress. In this film she totally proves that she has that potential. That might even be thanks to Bradley Cooper, who's not only an amazing actor in this film, but also a great director. His directorial debut was absolutely flawless. Hell, he can even sing flawlessly.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that ""A Star Is Born"" has been done before earlier, and this film does it very best to not copy anything from them, but only mimicking instead. It's still the same story, but the elements and the nature of the previous iterations is not the same here. And that's how you remake a film. Only mimicking, not copying.<br/><br/>The main characters portrayed by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga has some of the best chemistry I've ever seen. I don't see two actors pretending that they're are in love, I see two human beings who genuinely love each other. These two sweethearts just shines together, and I love seeing them being together. Their chemistry is beyond precious. Even Sam Elliott has his bright moments in this film.<br/><br/>I also love the songs they sing in this film. I was surprised to see Cooper being able to perform, and he's a very good singer. Gaga I knew could sing, but this time it's very refreshing to see her performing not only as an singer, but also an actress. Every emotion I see in her is just perfect. I don't care if she always had that talent or if it was thanks to Cooper's direction, she's just amazing in this film. Cooper proves once again that he can act as a champ, and considering that he's directing himself for the first time in a motion picture and handless it without a single problem makes me appreciate him as an real artist. There is no difficulty to understand why some of the viewers next to me were sobbing while Gaga was performing. It was literally nothing but pure beauty.<br/><br/>An absolute outstanding musical romantic drama! 8/10"
"jordangreenwood010","9","0","0","5 October 2018"," Lust, loss, and languish all rolled into this gem of a film.
","I waa dubious at first about the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga pairing at first, but I left the cinema looking when I can next come to see it. Lady Gaga embodied her character unbelievably well, but I think she could have had a greater transformation from start to finish. Bradley Cooper, what a performance as the drunken star everyone loves to hate! From start to finish, Cooper's character develops and you gradually see his downfall caused by alcoholism and drug addiction. For me this film touches on important issues such as the silent killer of men that is rarely discussed, suicide. I look forward to seeing another film directed by Cooper and hopefully we'll see Lady Gaga in more musicals, she certainly has a voice that far exceeds her pop songs."

This film from the beginning has you enticed and brought straight into the storyline. Jack (Bradley Cooper) plays the part of the troubled individual with a heart of gold so very well! You instantly feel the connection when Jack and Ally (Lady Gaga) meet and it's magic from there. The emotions that you feel from that film all the way through is real and you take it away with you even after watching. For me the situations were relatable! It was an incredible film and I cried lots throughout and even leaving the cinema. The music is just out of this world! Some strong ballads there! Both Bradley and Lady should be so proud!

However,the real star is Bradley Cooper,both onscreen and behind the cameras. Firstly, it was beautifully directed,but I was even more captivated by his acting (btw,I saw some Eddie Vedder in Jackson).

"christianekins","9","0","0","5 October 2018"," An Emotional Rollercoaster
","This movie might not be the best directed or best scripted film of the year, but it is the best acted and most powerful of the year. I could feel the instant connection between Jack and Ally, and I felt the tension in Jack's heart as he tried to not mess life up.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of pre-release intrigue because it was Coopers's director debut or maybe people liked the idea of seeing Lady Gaga act for two hours without makeup or flamboyant antics. A Star is Born totally delivers on the hype. It is funny, chill-inducing, powerful, and heartbreaking. Bradley Cooper shows his diversity as an actor when you compare this role to his roles in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, or American Sniper. He really makes you believe he's a rockstar with an addiction that eats at him. Jack's happy, carefree personality is instantly contagious, and by the end of the movie, I felt like Jack was my best friend. He is a good singer for being an actor and Lady Gaga is a phenomenal actress for being a singer.<br/><br/>A couple nitpicks. The dialogue sometimes feels a little cliche and the story lacks complexity beyond Jack and Ally's relationship. Jack's relationships with other people and Ally's booming career both receive significant screen time but aren't all that interesting.<br/><br/>This is a movie worth seeing and one that you will feel for several days after."

"julby71","7","0","0","4 October 2018"," Wanted to love it, but fell short
","The acting is nuanced and believable; Bradley as the aging, alcoholic musician and Gaga as the up-and-comer. The singing by them both was great! But, that's where the appeal ended for me. The story lacked telling parts, and I felt like they tried to force it a bit at the end; as if that one final conversation between Ally's manager and Jackson was the turning point. I didn't buy it. Also, Bradley and Gaga's chemistry, while believable as friends, didn't look at all to me like romantic chemistry. They did seem very comfortable with each other, which came across on screen. I went prepared to bawl my brains out, and didn't find it all that sad. The best scenes in the movie were between Bradley and Sam Elliott. Sam should get a best supporting actor nomination at the Oscars, for sure, as should Bradley Cooper for best actor. The dramatic scenes seemed chopped off too soon and I was left wanting more. Even the concert scenes were short, barely showing a whole song (except for the first scene where she sings the now iconic song from the film). Jackson and Ally's one fight in the film seemed to come out of nowhere. The 70s version, although a bit long, played the relationship out and I felt I understood them better. Norman Howard was the man who knew he was never good enough for Ester and was self-sabotaging, trying to push her away. I didn't feel that same struggle within Jackson Maine's character. It fell short for me, and I just couldn't give it an A."

I think we'll be seeing some awards on this one."

Even if it is a remake, to my mind, it can be regarded as the best one among all of them, and even of all time remakes.<br/><br/>Acting here is another story. It is believed that oscars for a lead actor and actress would be given to this film, as Cooper and Gaga definitely portrayed magnificently their characters. You are really fall to their problems, and feel their emotions. Also, the main reason of their astonishing performance lies on the delivery of remarkable songs. So deep, affective, even will make you cry.<br/><br/>Film lighting, cinematography and editing, including sound is another perfect aspect in this movie.

","Bradley Cooper takes you on a ride throughout the whole movie with his outstanding skills for Directing and Libetique executed a perfect masterpiece of photography with this film. Concepts behind the lighting in this movie is just surreal, brilliant and perfectly well-done. I could never leave behind the amazing cast of wonderful and talented actors: Sam Elliot plays the outstanding and rebellious brother of Jackson Maine (Cooper's character). Bradley Cooper as an actor is something out of this world, he just performs a brilliant country/rock star trying to find his way through addictions and the downfalls of fame; this is surely one of his best roles that he's played in the last couple years. Speaking about best roles, I surely couldn't finish my review without expressing the amazing and mind-blowing megastar that Lady Gaga is. Her performance as Ally-a rising star that falls in love with Jackson and has to deal with his demons-is just magnificent and impacable. She delivered a unique role and shines out on this massive group of fellow actresses for this movie season. Anytime Gaga opens her mouth to sing at least a two-words lyric, the whole world stops. Her incredible, outstanding, unique and magnificent vocals will surely have all theaters around the world in tears; she composed and sings one of the best soundtracks ever created for a movie. Oh and the last scene of the film? Heh, I'd recommend for you all to get 3 tissue boxes; she will have you crying like a baby as soon as she starts playing the 'hopefully' soon-to-be Oscar winner song ""I'll Never Love Again."" Surely a must-see and surely a front runner when speaking Oscars terms."

"joshbarton15","10","7","26","29 September 2018"," Cooper and Gaga light up the screen together.
","Another year, another remake from Hollywood, this time in the shape of Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born. The third remake of the Frederic March and Janet Gaynor starring 1937 original, following the James Mason and Judy Garland 1954 and Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand 1976 starring remakes, sees Bradley Cooper and pop sensation Lady Gaga take on the iconic story. Having not seen any of the previous iterations, going in blind made the experience that little bit more special.<br/><br/>When Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper), a seasoned musician with a major drinking problem, stumbles upon the talented Ally (Lady Gaga), an unknown singe-songwriter singing in a drag bar, the pair develop a professional and personal relationship which will change their lives forever.<br/><br/>For a directorial debut, A Star Is Born is a simply stunning effort from Bradley Cooper. Having both produced and co-written the film too, the sense of pride and passion runs throughout in the meticulousness of just about everything this film has to offer. Cooper had me captivated for every single second of film and, for your first attempt at directing a film, that's quite something. Judging from the total silence from the audience as the credits rolled, I'm pretty sure he had us all captivated.<br/><br/>The film is driven by two incredibly different but equally fascinating performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga. As the older and wiser musician battling with his inner alcoholic demons, Cooper is superb and delivers the best performance of his career. Lady Gaga proves any of her doubters wrong with an incredible performance that is sure to see her amongst the major contenders come awards season. As a pair, their chemistry is undeniably strong, making for such a genuine on-screen romance.<br/><br/>The staging of the concert sequences and the songs that accompany them also play a major part in this film's success. Matthew Libatique captures the sense of playing to a huge crowd with some kinetic cinematography, much like he did in Straight Outta Compton. Pair that with Gaga's performance in the sequence where they sing ""Shallow"", a song you won't be able to get out of your head, and you'll get goosebumps. It could be a moment where Ally owns the stage with full confidence but she's overcome with emotion and totally overwhelmed by the occasion, Gaga selling it beautifully.<br/><br/>If I was a betting man, I'd say expect to hear a lot about A Star Is Born over the coming months, and deservedly so. This is a truly powerful film from Bradley Cooper that makes me want to see Lady Gaga take on more acting roles, which is something I never thought I'd be saying a few years ago."

If you want to be part of a trend, by all means see the movie. But if you prefer to spend your time seeing something captivating or enjoyable, skip this one."
"bairjohn","5","3","8","16 November 2018"," Very disappointed...
","Lady Gaga showed that glam is not what makes talent, beyond that this film was a complete bust. I would have rated it lower if it were not for her efforts.<br/><br/>The ending was calculable from the beginning, writing very corny, and the pace was slow, and uneventful. The dramatic parts were lacking sincerity, and the concert setups were lack luster. In all direction, and editing were almost non-existent things just jumped around from scene to scene with no continuity.<br/><br/>I had some trouble with the story line at first but if the writing, would have been better I think this could have been a very good film. If it get's any Academy nominations for any part of it would be out of hype."
"Alexander_Blanchett","10","3","8","8 October 2018"," Yes, Bradley Cooper is ALL that
","They should just throw every Oscar at it and call it a day. A really fantastic film, emotionally haunting and absolutely stunning acted. The songs were perfectly performed and put in scene. Its natural without the typical Hollywood kitsch or cliche. Its honest and makes you think. All in all a big winner. 
Bradley Cooper is absolutely STUNNING in the lead role. I am not sure what else will come out to beat that performance. Yes, he is all that. A fine actor generally but this is his role of his life, this is what will in the future define him. Such a troubled character, that easily could have been overdone, but he found literarily every right note to portray it. 
Lady Gaga is also great, and one of the better examples of singer-turned-actor. She wonderfully developed Ally and becomes her from the first to the last second even if her character changes so much that its totally different in the end. Yes, it somehow shows the parallels to her own personality and life, how she developed in becoming the pop icon she is . When she sang ""Shallows"" the first time, it was one of those cinematic moments that will always be remembered. A great performance, I had my doubts, but they were shredded. Oh and if that is not enough, there is Sam Elliott who puts a lot of heart and soul to the film. Finally a performance this great actor deserves and that surely will leave some mark this award season. All his scenes are brilliantly performed and its such a deep and natural performance. The songs are wonderful, the look and editing is just great. The screenplay is very good. There were little lengths in the second third of the film but it never dragged thanks to the fantastic direction by Bradley Cooper. A film that wowed me... drove me emotionally crazy and will have a spot in my heart for a long time. 
Dear Mr. Cooper, this was just your first directional effort, I simply cannot wait for your next. You know how to portray a film naturally without any fake melodramatic nonsense. Excellent."

"lee85208","6","3","8","7 October 2018"," A bit disappointed
","There are touches of greatness in the film, specifically the way Bradley Cooper shot every concert scene, those scenes really take you into a different world and see a concert from a different perspective. Like most people, I also applaud the acting of Cooper, Gaga, and Elliott.
But, the movie really started off on the wrong foot with me. I understand that Cooper wanted the relationship between Jackson and Ally to extend as long as possible for the payoff of his death to be as emotional as possible. To me, Jackson's approach to Ally in the first act to me is more creepy than lovely. So it's fine for a someone to weirdly slide his finger down your nose and have someone wait outside your door till you agree to be on his show, as long as you are a good looking and famous person? Also, I would appreciate if the movie would spend more time on showing the downfall of Jackson and the uprising of Ally, instead of focusing so much on their intimacy. Throughout the film, other than Ally having a great voice and songwriting ability, I really fail see the basis of their relationship. Lastly, as much as I adore Dave Chapelle, I really don't get the point of his cameo in the film, feels very out of place to me. 
I would like to end the review on a good note because I really do love both Cooper and Gaga. I was surprised at how well Cooper could sing, and how well Gaga's acting was in the film (no need to comment on her already awesome signing ability). I just really hope the movie could've be paced better, and remove some of the unnecessary scenes."

Anyway to make a long story short, I would've much preferred lady gaga's character hang herself and Bradley Cooper have done the final number or even better both hang themselves so the audience can be spared their terrible acting and terrible characters.

"aggestella","2","3","9","5 October 2019"," Why is this so popular?
","This movie sucks, and here is why:<br/><br/>1. The dialouge sucks:
When the characters talk to each other it is difficult to hear what they are both saying. Is it an attempt to make it more realistic? Maybe, but if so it failed because people do not have full conversations on top of each other without stopping to let the other person finish.<br/><br/>2. Random nude scenes
Lady Gaga is naked twice in this movie, fo no appearent reason. There is a full body shot of her naked body. Why? This isnt game of thrones, no one needed or expected nudity, its very out of place for a movie like this.<br/><br/>3. Plot is inconsistent
It is hard to explain, but the movie makes no sense. When does this all take place? How many years, months or even weeks have passed?
And the storyline about Bradley Coopers family is just barely explored. I would have felt much more compassion if I copletely knew the relationship between his brother, father and him. But they just barely talk about it, so it makes no sense and adds less than it is supposed to to the story.<br/><br/>4. The ending is weird and out of place
The ending is a ""plot twist"" of some sorts, but it just happens. With no build up, no real reason and no explanation. What the hell?<br/><br/>5. Cringe moments
Dont like romantic cringe moments, dont watch this movie"

What about the impact his suicide had on her career. Also what would be so terrible if she took off some time for her career for him. Plus she could find another producer who would put him in the show with her. She loves him and he gave her her start. Also there is little depth shown in regard to their histories and his past. It's fairly superficial in that regard. The best parts were Lady Gaga's Voice and The Shallows song. Three stars for those. But this story is very dated for modern times."

"foxhound-37781","6","2","5","13 March 2019"," I enjoyed it basically because I like Bradley Cooper
","Ok i'll be honest. at first I didn't know this movie was a remake for about the hundredth time.... This in itself definitely costs it brownie points.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Bradley Cooper for a number of years now and I really liked the idea of him directing his own movie as well as starring in it especially with someone as notable as Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>But what did I think of this film? well... i'll be honest... i thought it was ok overall but that's it... it's just ok..... the only thing i truly found oscar worthy of this movie was Lady Gaga, she was nothing short of exceptional as she always is when it comes to her singing especially the final song she sings ""i'll never love again"" or whatever its called... it's a pretty emotional singing scene but all the other characters i found were just flat and one dimensional, especially Coopers character who is just drawn up as a very generic style of rock musician and a typical drug user with a serious drinking problem.... it's nothing we haven't seen before so therefore it's nothing unique or memorable....<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with Coopers character is he is sometimes very hard to understand over all the background noise in alot of his scenes and it may be plausible being so drug and alcohol induced as his character was portrayed but trying to watch him on screen was at times just frustrating trying to work out what he was saying.<br/><br/>As a guitarist myself and the owner of a Gibson Les Paul I couldn't help but notice the abundance of Gibson product placement on display here.... almost EVERY guitar you see in this movie is a Gibson of some kind.... I don't know what kind of deal this film company had with Gibson but you can't tell me there WASN'T a deal made between the two.... that many Gibson guitars appearing in one movie is no co-incidence...<br/><br/>Overall I didn't mind this movie but it's not one I would probably watch again, it's basically just a remake dulled up as a modern day chick flick. if you're a fan of Brad Cooper or Gaga you will enjoy it and probably have tears in your eyes by the end but if neither of these two stars interest you, you are going to be pretty bored with this one.... Not a bad movie but definitely not Bradley Coopers best film by a long shot...."

","I'm a massive fan of Bradley Cooper, so when it was announced he would make his director debut with A Star is Born, I was immediately hooked. It's a tough job to undertake, as the original is so iconic and requires more than just acting skills. Both him and Lady Gaga were phenomenal and the onscreen chemistry was evident from the first time you see them both on screen together. Honestly, I'd be shocked if we don't see them onscreen together again. It takes a lot to make me feel connected to the characters, something Bradley done from the off. I felt like I could relate to Jackson, from the tinnitus, right up to the end. (Don't want to spoil anything, but if you've watched it, you'll know what I mean). Even if this sort of film isn't something you usually watch, I urge you to reconsider."

I loved the music, I can just close my eyes and listen to the songs over and over again. Lastly, I'm not one of those people that react emotionally to romantic movies/tear jerkers. But this one got me. It's hard for me to get this movie out of my head. These characters seem so real to me and I feel so much empathy for them."
"jmariano99","4","2","5","12 February 2019"," Inconsistent movie in characters, storyline and drama
","Let me start by apologizing, because I know I'm going against a big lot of people in this my opinion, but I really don't understand such I reviews to this movie and I have to point out why.
Now, first, the characters: I can't understand neither of them, they seem contradictory in themselves, they are not very congruent, they are not at all real. Ally looks like an 20 something, almost 30, year old, who we see singing on stage of that bar in the beginning, acting quite maturely, but in the next 10 minutes we see her in her house, having fights with her dad, typical of 15 years old, she punches someone out of the blue and almost punches a second person, like a disturbed teenage girl. On the other side, Bradley Cooper can't help but give a bit of an introvert vibe to Jack, which really doesn't go with the character, an alcoholic and drug addict rock singer who signs girls' breasts.
Second place, and one of the worst things, their romance: what is that? They meet one day, have sex the next day, and the morning after they are having serious talks about each of them and behaving with an absurding care and intimacy, like they have known each other for two or three years! Then they get married after what, 3 or 4 months, when we at least have never seen them together with both of them sober and not hungover... And, of course, the first time they go together on stage and sing ""shallow"", and they have a perfect sintony: how???! She only sang half of it, he said he changed some stuff, they didn't practice, but somehow both of them know the whole final song perfectly, and are in perfect sync? That might look good in a musical, but not in a drama movie... To finish this topic of their ""romance"": after one day meeting him, she just watches him have an absurd fight with his brother, she just stands there like she was used to that? And also, when she says later that a guy wants her to go solo, he smashes a cake in her face and she says: ""you jealous ****"": where does that come from?
Well, next: the drama. It is very badly made... Partially dued to Lady Gaga, who is overdramatic. But there is at least a handful of cases where we just find out about something and it instantly becomes a matter of drama (she in her tub nervous about the album; the fight between Jack and his brother; their fight in the rehab center): there is no continuing storyline, we can't follow the movie properly, it's drama after drama, coming out of the blue.
The suicide now: he comes from rehab, starts getting his life together, is in an amazing phase of his marriage (they even wrote a song together), he is also better with his brother, and he suicides because of that talk with her manager? What was that? We saw earlier that he didn't care enough about her career to suicide because of it, so there is only that talk left, and it's absurd!!
Now his brother: he appears like 7 or 8 times on screen, and after the 3rd he does not appear nor is thought of for like an hour. Their relationship is very badly explored. Plus, let's be honest, that actor can't ever get rid of that fierce countryside look, and that is not a very good look for the character (not so much as the actor makes it look at least): his nomination for bet supporting actor is ridiculous...
Next to last: there is a scene in the rehab center where Ally and Jack are both crying their eyes out, but the camera focuses more on Jack, who is rubbing his eyes and hiccuping, but then he shows his face and he does not have a tear in his eye, they are not even red... That was an embarecement for both actor and director (both Bradley)
Lastly, the music: one of the few good things. But still, not that good: shallow is a nice little song, but it's a common pop song, and it really doesn't have the minor meaning in the storyline: it's just something she wrote. It might win best song but it would stand any kind of chance against the songs of last year like ""this is me"" or ""remember me"".
All in all, and inconsistent movie with bad characters, a bad storyline, a bad drama, not so good actors, not so good directing and reasonable music. A 3 out of 10, and I'm being nice. If you ignore the fact that the great Lady Gaga is in it, I'm sure you will agree."

"harrypettigrew","9","2","5","9 January 2019"," Great Remake
","A Star is Born is a film about a country singer who helps a young new artist rise to fame, while he fights his struggle with alcoholism.
The film is set in modern-day America as it reflects on the current state of the music industry through a fictional story.
It follows the Hollywood trend of recent years where studios release high budget musicals like The Greatest Showman and La La Land. It also features a star-studded cast consisting of Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle.
The film reinvents this trend by casting Lady Gaga in the lead of the film. This allows the songs featured to be more impactful as the raw talent of her vocals demands the audience's attention. Director Bradley Cooper must have studied the previous versions of the film as A Star is Born 1976 featured Barbara Streisand who is known for her singing ability. Casting Lady Gaga shows that he respects the source material and understands what made the original film so great. This is impressive as this is his directorial debut.
Bradley Cooper does a tremendous job in the role of director while acting in the film as well. His singing voice embodies the character of Jackson Maine in a way that many films that have come out in recent years haven't quite managed to achieve. For example, in La La Land Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling played characters that were very similar to their real-life personalities, so it was hard to distinguish them from their characters. This portrayal is far more believable as it resembles the stories of many musical legends of the past such as Kurt Cobain, Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen.
The run time for the film clocks in at 2hr 16 minutes which does hinder the films pace as it slows down significantly towards the middle of the film. This is needed though as the climax of the film is more impactful because of this. It is also easy to follow as the story is told in a linear structure.
The film received an age rating of 15 in the United Kingdom, so it is targeting a mature audience and will be inappropriate for younger viewers. This is due to the film including swearing and disturbing images."
"nnom35","10","2","5","9 January 2019"," I'm late to the game here
","No one will read my review...and I'm okay with that. As much as the focus has been on Gaga being able to not only sing but act, and act well (which she definitely does), I have to throw credit to a few others. Bradley Cooper--I knew he was gonna be good, I just didn't know how good. Sam Elliot had easily two of the most moving scenes in the movie. Whoever that blonde was in the drag bar...vivacious and the best looking guy I've ever seen in my life. Last but not least...Andrew Dice Clay can act? Am I in a parallel universe?"

"Jade333","4","2","5","6 January 2019"," I Really Wanted To Like It......
","The first 35 minutes was great but it all went downhill from there. Cooper didn't display the proper way to do time jumps and the pacing, dialog and entire storyline had some major issues. Their relationship felt forced and didn't allow enough development for the viewer to buy in with these two in their marriage. The only thing they ever talk about is music. I'd expect some actual real life conversations to come up once in a while but they didn't.<br/><br/>Gaga does a nice job acting but her Botox screwed up any emotion she was sincerely trying to portray to the audience. It was truly painful to watch her try. The music scenes and concerts were done in A+ fashion but the rest of it gets a D+/C-.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film but the second act really lost adequate pacing, dialog, and character development. It was just depressing to watch."

","We seen the movie recently and thought it was like one of those movies, once seen is pretty much enough.
Everything about it look nice and okay and professionally produced.
But the storyline is not original for sure and has many cliches to the point of boredom.
Bradley Cooper is capable of fine acting but certainly not Lady Gaga who is ordinary looking at best even with professional makeup. It did not really bother me at first but her acting was mediocre compared to the original actors.
Not only me, but the whole lot of us felt pretty much the same in fact that the movie was the most over hyped in 2018."

Better go see this with the lowest possible expectations or none at all, or better yet, just don't. If you're a Gaga fan, you'll like it. If your panties get wet when you see Bradley Cooper, you'll like it. If you dismiss the fan-factor, you're left with nothing but a sub-par, mediocre film. I rate it 4/10, because Gaga does have a good voice, and the acting is not terrible. But that's all I'll give it. Spend 2 hours and 16 minutes at your own risk."

"cruise01","8","2","5","30 October 2018"," Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper delivers with a powerful performance and a sharp direction.
","A Star is Born (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>A Star is Born is a romantic drama that delivers with great performances from Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. And a sharp direction being Cooper's first film. I enjoyed it more than I thought I was. A plot about a famous rock star Jackson (Bradley Cooper) who struggles with alcohol and drug addiction. Which he falls for a waitress/singer-songwriter Ally (Lady Gaga) at a drag bar. Unhappy with the way she was living. Jackson invites her to his concert only to have her be part of it. From there, they go on tours and they partake on duo performances. Ally falls for Jackson. And sees that he is battling an addiction that is affecting his way of life.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was great playing Jackson Maine. His performance of his mumbling voice and when he is singing. He sounds great as a rock star. Lady Gaga being in a big feature movie was great too. I only seen her in American Horror Story Hotel as a creepy character. But her playing Ally was great. She did a good job with a character that wanted more for her in life than being a waitress. The emotions she portrays when she see Jackson battling his addiction was powerful. Especially, the final song she sings in the movie. And she is also a fantastic singer.<br/><br/>The music in the film was all great. It delivers a great soundtrack with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga singing. Sure, there are some songs that are played multiple times at concerts in the movie. But the songs never get old or boring. It does have a great love story. Not really a sappy or annoying romantic kind of movie. Jackson falling for Ally when she fights off a drunk guy at a bar. And there moment sitting in the parking lot in front of a store with Jackson telling Ally she is beautiful and her stubborn attitude of denying it was beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, A Star is Born is a good romantic drama film. I never seen the original movies. But Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are fantastic in the movie when it comes to their performances and them singing. The songs are great. The direction is powerful with its romantic story and the downfall of addiction."

"kaptenvideo-89875","8","2","5","27 October 2018"," It's as good as they say it is!
","A musician helps a young singer find fame, even as alcoholism and being miserable about life have sent his own career into a downward spiral.<br/><br/>The ""it"" movie of the season that everyone's been talking out has arrived. Yes, it is as good as you have heard. Yes, it is sad but also uplifting. Now, the quick questions out of the way, let's see what the fuss is all about.<br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" is a musical love story starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, directed and co-written by Cooper. It's actually a remake: the sixth screen version of the story, the most famous renditons of which were released in 1937 and 1976, respectively.<br/><br/>But make no mistake - the result feels like a true labor of love from all involved, starting from very committed performances by the leads.<br/><br/>The commitment is evident in both by their preparations for the movie (Cooper taking extensive performing, singing, and guitar training, Gaga helping to write many songs heard here) and good chemistry between them playing lovers. The tenderness between them feels very real.<br/><br/>But even more important is Cooper's courage to lay it all out in the most difficult ""format"" for any dramatic story - let's not forget that it's his first directorial effort.<br/><br/>First, its a ""state of the mind"" type of movie which favors examining the central characters' inner psychological conditions to just displaying as much ""interesting"" events as possible - thus taking the risk that the audience might not stay on the same wavelength and get bored. Especially as the movie is decidedly slow and lasts for 135 minutes.<br/><br/>Secondly, the camerawork relies a lot on close-up scenes, which places an extra toll on actors who have to be ready to carry the intended mood or sentiment for longer time, and able to really feel it in themselves also, so the result will seem more honest on screen.<br/><br/>Cooper, of course, is an experienced (dramatic) actor himself, but he must have had a lot of faith in Gaga also, for whom this is the first major movie role.<br/><br/>Additionally, he wrestled the studio to get the leading lady he wanted, so he had to have double the conviction that Gaga is the best choice for the project.<br/><br/>And I am glad to say that all Cooper's gambles have paid off. The resulting movie feels triumphant. The story and the many songs are not original or unique in themselves but the overall big-ness and psychological immediacy of the movie are noticeable from the very first scene, with Cooper on the stage, handling it like a born rock god.<br/><br/>Visually, ""bigness"" of the movie can be most clearly perceived in concert scenes where the world seems to stretch out to forever - is this how the musicians feel playing to big crowds?<br/><br/>But it also supports the storytelling. There's always enough time and space for everything to evolve naturally. The characters, their relationships or what they say never feel rushed or one-dimensional, you can sense the living breathing beings behind them.<br/><br/>Gaga fills the central position of the movie, and she's surprisingly good and natural at acting - it is not an easy job, demanding a lot of spoken text and willingness to open up to a range of feelings, not to mention carry them in close-ups. It must be one of the most successful first big roles from a singer I've ever seen. Yup, it's that good.<br/><br/>But Cooper as the rock star slowly burning out is just phenomenal. Not only are the concert scenes powerful, but the pain he lives seems is so pure that you just have to symphatize for the guy.<br/><br/>The tears of ""rich and famous"" are probably hard to relate to the most of us but he's able to relate to the audience on this human level where everybody is equal. There's no glamorizing the life style that the character has chosen, Cooper takes us straight to the shadow side.<br/><br/>Speaking of the other actors, I especially like the decision of using legendary stand-up comedians such as Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chappelle in important supporting roles.<br/><br/>It's funny how, in general, comedians are always great in supporting roles, especially serious ones, but rarely offer something interesting as leads.<br/><br/>Also, there's a great supporting role by Sam Elliott as the rock star's equally-worn brother/manager. If this doesn't get the screen veteran his third and finally winning Oscar nom, then it's difficult to guess what will.<br/><br/>Elliott's character gets to directly display the mental exhaustion and desperation his brother the rock star hides inside, which gives their shared scenes always some extra suspense.<br/><br/>So... despite the relative lack of originality, this is a fresh and confident film-making at its best. The authors have something to say, know how to say it, and do it well.<br/><br/>I've only seen 45 movies released in 2018 so far, but this is the most compelling and heartfelt of all. A great directing debut from a continuously interesting and relevant actor as well. Go see it."
"maindraaritomo","9","2","5","26 October 2018"," Almost perfect
","Thumbs up for Bradley Cooper, being somebody totally new and very well done directing. And Lady Gaga is having another amazing performance, keep on altering herself from pop star, jazz singer with Tony Bennet, moved audience for standing ovation on the Sound of Music, now an actor. I say big wow for them.<br/><br/>Anyway, for me the peak scene to end the whole drama is not enough. Lady Gaga should have been singing in bit of trembling and more tears to show her sadness but still posing high in showing how she's done with her misery. I would compare her to Rebecca Ferguson in her lipsync of Never Enough, and Ferguson nailed it, whilst Gaga could have been much better since she really sings."

It genuinely takes you behind the stage and exposes what it's like to be a musician and cope with so many struggles. Not to mention the music my God the music is absolutely amazing! I never really knew lady Gaga could act until I saw this movie and she blew me away and took me to a whole another level when she sang! The chemistry between her and Bradley Cooper was perfect. I always been a huge fan of Cooper and his work as a director and actor in this movie tops anything he's done and proves he is deserving of an Oscar this year. The only thing I struggled with was hearing what Bradley coopers character was saying sometimes because of his accent. One of best movies of the year. I highly recommend and suggest listening to the music after watching the movie first. It has much more of an affect hearing it in the film first. I would be surprised and disappointed if this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar!"

Honestly, one of the saddest movies I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>Just a little forewarning: there is a lot of drinking, drug use, and cussing. Every other word was the f bomb.

"CubsandCulture","10","2","5","21 October 2018"," A beautiful cover of a classic...
","I just got back from this movie and all I can say is WOW. It is just about a perfect execution on updating and reworking the 1954 (and other versions) classic. Cooper fills his film with wonderfully alive and vivid imagery. The musical sequences pop and sizzle over the screen. The most striking scene is the moment a star is born when Ally first sings with Jack the song ""Shallow."" Absolutely hair raising and memorizing. That is the central moment in the film and quite appropriately nothing after that point is quite as striking. But, of course, as a doomed romance that moment should be the most alive.<br/><br/>The two central performance are perfect. I realize that a lot of people will be impressed with Lady Gaga being able to act. And she does turn in a very solid performance. But I was more shocked that Cooper could sing. He has a soulful authentic voice that makes it understandable why Jack is a fading star. The shock of each turning in a fully realized performance makes the emotion of the story all the more raw and powerful. Add in that Sam Elliot gives one hell of a nuanced understated performance as well and this film just breaks your heart.<br/><br/>The story has been largely retained, multiple lines from other versions are present, but it has been updated and made now in very specific ways. I also rather enjoyed the meta moment in the film when Bobby is talking about Jack's view that each musician only ever puts his own spin on the same 12 notes. It works in the movie but it is also clearly meant to reflect that Cooper (as director) is putting his own spin on this classic tail.<br/><br/>This is among the best of the year so far. Great cover."

","Was Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper great actors? YES.
Was the music fantastic? YES.
Could they both sign? Omg YES.<br/><br/>So what's not to like? Well mainly the script. The title being ""A star is born"" one might think that there would be fokus on Ally's/Gaga's storyline and development. Quite the contrary, the film is about Cooper's character and everything happening is just to allow his character development. Even in the scenes where Ally's present and he's not, there's neither any development of her as a character nor even any storyline explaining her actions. She is just reacting to him and it's so extremely annoying.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie does start off great. We get to know and understand so much about Jackson, but the choices behind Ally's actions are left completely unexplained and unexplored. And what about the extremely unbelievable makeover? Orange hair, crazy makeup.... Why are you trying to make me question everything? It feels like this movie is trying to pull all my strings/play with my feeling in a very non-subtle way. <br/><br/>When Jack opens a beer at Ally's SNL performance, after a few white weeks, my interpretation is that he's doing so in disappointment that she's doing it as a pop princess rather than ""being true to herself and all the things she has to tell and which he's told her she needs to do yada yada"". My movie company did not read the scene that way but agreed that it could well have been intended that way, and if intentional, really diminished (again) Ally's choices.<br/><br/>And to round this off. The ending. Seriously? Yeah sure it connected to what we got to know about his past at rehab but there were so many other ways they could have made it. The first thing that came to mind was: cut the manager scene. Have Jack planning to go to the concert, but take smt to calm the nerves cuz it's been a while.. And bam! An accidental car crash. <br/><br/>I also wish this movie would have explored the relationship between Ally and Jack as she's progressively becoming more famous and his star is dying. Is there any jealousy? How are the handling it?<br/><br/>Need to stop rambling now before I start questioning why I even give this a score 6. Buuut the acting and singing is amazing and I'd easily listen to the soundtrack over and over."

","The 4th rendition of the classic 'A Star is Born' story is perhaps the best and most realistic take on celebrity, addiction, relationships, and what it means to be a star in world of Hollywood. Essentially what became Bradley Cooper's baby, working on it for years, the 2018 version of A Star is Born is nothing short of magnificent. Written, produced, directed, and starring Cooper (who may very well get an Oscar nomination for all 4 of those), this is the sort of movie that defines you and I think it will with Cooper. It's a great script and it's well produced, but the real accomplishment here is with his directing and acting, and specifically his acting. I've never seen Cooper give a better performance than he does here, and as of now, he should win the Oscar. I have yet to see several movies up for the race this year, but I was blown away by the depths of his performance as Jackson Maine, the alcoholic and aging singer who discovers Ally's (Gaga's) talent in singing. The strength of the movie (as in the original 1937 version) lies with the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper. They are perfect together in this movie. Whether it's having a drink at a bar where Cooper touches Gaga's nose (yes, that happens and it's completely normal), walking around in a supermarket, or just sitting and talking, their relationship feels real with emotional weight and gravitas. These aren't characters, they are real people. Watching that unfold and unravel at times is where the magic in this movie is felt the most. Oh and the songs are great. Just catchy enough where I want to replay them, but not catchy enough to be annoying and overplayed on the radio. This was a true cinematic feat from Cooper and I sure hope it makes some serious noise come Oscar season.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","So this is yet another version of the ever-popular story of a showbiz star helping a newcomer in business and then becoming the has-been.
Compared with the earlier adaptations, this one by Bradley Cooper is kinder and gentler in tone (there's even a dog!), though i find the one by Frank Pierson more gripping and enjoyable.
Cooper's Jackson is definitely more charming than Kristofferson's John Norman, but Lady Gaga's Ally doesn't blow you away like how Streisand's Esther did. Still, one finds these characters actually likable while the ones in previous versions were far less sympathetic.
The songs in this new version are just okay, while the ones sung by Streisand and Kristofferson in 1976 were more catchy and I remember how i just couldn't stop listening to that soundtrack then. Maybe ""Shallow"" sticks a little better, because of the hook."

What's even more huge is that I heard all the soundtracks were recorded alive.

"i_ianchev","9","2","5","7 October 2018"," A star is born in love
","You can't hide anything from love. And you can nurture talent with love.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's directorial debut just hit theaters and I couldn't resist to see it ASAP.<br/><br/>It really stands up to its name and already amassed glowing reviews. It's a very emotional tale of a singer in his twilight years finding and helping the love of his life become a star singer, but also his better side.
I was struck about how this motion picture dug deep into viewers hearts and how iconic the characters were made to look and sound like. And I think that phrase from Cooper ""When you have a question, you gotta ask it."" is really emoting from this movie. This script is already shot 3 times during 3 different eras of American cinema and I gotta say, this one is without doubt the truest.
Lady Gaga is over performing herself, expressing all her character on the screen. Bradley Cooper has created and brought to screen a very ""burnt"" depiction of a man in fame. And it struck my heart in so many chords that I have to say this is one of the best movies of the year.
It has a very original soundtrack, which involves you even deeper. Wonderfully shot characters which evolve and yet stay true to their nature. A film about music, life, relationships, but above all - love.
I had two very eclectic moments in the movie. The first one was when Bradley Cooper's Jack apologizes to Bobby for his insult. The reaction from Sam Elliott's character was so empowering and so proudly emotional that I will remember it for a long time. A person can really relate to such a conversation and intuitional moment.
The second, of course, is the last scene song transition from the concert to the piano. A very general and yet intimate moment of affection and compassion. The production quality is indeed present and I believe that we're seeing a very good director coming forward.
At the end of this review, I'd like to say that it's for movies like this that we have a passion for cinema and music. These two interconnect very intensely and the past decade has proven that we can do much better in life, in relationships and in knowing ourselves, if we just allow these art forms of expression flow through us and let us just be out there in the space between us."

","After the 2018 remake of ""A Star is Born"", I heard a bazillion different people talk on and on and on about how amazing this film was. However, after seeing it, I realize that none of these folks saw the earlier (and much better) versions of the film...such as ""What Price Hollywood?"" or the 1930s and 50s version of ""A Star is Born"". All three* are vastly superior and I think most of it is because they come off as more a fairy tale--a nice tale about success and failure. In the newest version, however, the story seems more real...and more pathetic and difficult to watch as a result.<br/><br/>Overall, I challenge you to watch an earlier version and then you'll realize that aside from hearing Lady Gaga sing a few nice tunes, there really isn't any improvement on the original story in this remake.<br/><br/>*There also was a version with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson--which I have not seen, so I cannot compare it to the others."
"maryelizabethbarnes","1","3","10","12 February 2019"," Why?!? I do not understand the hype.
","I heard the hype for this movie and heard the songs all over, which I enjoyed a lot of them on YouTube, so I decided to try this movie to see if it was any good. I really love musical/biopic-type movies normally but wow... This movie sucks.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was how all over the place the story and editing were, I had no idea what was going on in most scenes, trying to understand Bradley Cooper's horrendously mumbling dialogue and what was going on through the poorly cut scenes was nearly impossible. I had no idea what was going on! The flashbacks were strangely irrelevant and confusing to the story most of the time as were moments where things occurred that seemed comically out of place. At the beginning of the movie, a drunk cop approaches Jackson in a bar, Ally steps back like she's awkward and just wants to get away, then she punches the guy awkwardly, then laughs as she is ushered out of there. It didn't make any sense, she punches a cop and nothing happenes? The writing is very bad.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is an amazing singer but her acting is awkward and weird, and the writing in the story made her bad acting stand out even more. I liked her on American Horror Story, I thought she was a passable actor. I honestly think it's the worst thing I've ever seen Bradley Cooper ever do. Why is Jackson a drunk? They never talk much about his history to feel anything for the characters, they are not relatable or likeable like another review mentioned... But it also seems like the writer does not have an idea how real people interact with each other and it shows in interaction after interaction between the characters. Their emotional reactions are definitely scripted and not realistic to how most human beings interact with each other in real life.<br/><br/>I'm actually still watching the movie and got so bored and annoyed I had to write a review while the movie was still playing.<br/><br/>I love Dave Chapelle so that's awesome his part didn't suck too much.<br/><br/>I swear when I was younger, if a movie got Oscar nominated, it was usually pretty amazing. Now, any rich actor a-hole can make a movie to flatter their ginormous ego and win or are nominated for awards they don't deserve.<br/><br/>This was hands down the most unnatural feeling movie I've ever seen in my life so far. Such a disappointment."
"Turfseer","3","3","10","6 November 2018"," Unworkable tale, chronicling downfall of alcoholic country rock star and enabling singer he takes under his wing, fails like all its predecessors
","Why in the world did Bradley Cooper decide to remake A Star is Born? Beats me. It's a dog of an idea for a film but you can probably guess why Hollywood players are attracted to such a project. I recommend that you check out my review of the 1954 version of A Star is Born starring Judy Garland. Despite the updated accouterments, there's little difference between what I had to say about that old chestnut and Cooper's new flashy project starring Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>
Cooper plays the protagonist, Jackson Maine, a country rock music star with a wicked drinking problem (James Mason was ""Norman Maine"" in the '54 version; instead of a musician, he played an alcoholic movie star). The plot is quite simple: Maine goes bar hopping after one of his big concerts and happens upon Ally, an aspiring singer (Lady Gaga) at a bar populated chiefly by drag queens. Maine takes Ally under his wing, sponsors her, and as he goes downhill due to his drinking, she eventually becomes a big star.<br/><br/>
The problem with all this is that just like in all the earlier incarnations (1937, 1954 and 1977), Maine's character is simply boring and unlikable. Sad sacks never make for good drama especially when their machinations are so one-note. It's as if we're supposed to have some kind of catharsis reveling in Maine's sad decline. It's all so predictable and I have no guilt feelings in revealing that our main character commits suicide in the end. Cooper and his fellow scenarists can do nothing in fleshing out their country rock star-he's wholly generic with a sketchy back story about a cruel father and a suicide attempt when the boy was 12.<br/><br/>
Lady Gaga isn't much better as Ally, who plays the part of an enabler. Yes she's got a great voice and tremendous stage presence, but she has little to do except attempt to prop up her alcoholic spouse and then cry at the end when he does himself in. None of the original songs here (some written by Gaga) are hardly memorable and you'll be hard pressed to find anything resembling the hits (such as ""Bad Romance""), she's known for.<br/><br/>
The dark moment in the second act is similar to the '54 version-there Mason (as Norman Maine) makes a fool of himself at the Oscars while in a drunken stupor. Here it's Cooper as Maine falling flat on his face at the Grammy's. No matter-it's all part of similar histrionics designed to manipulate the audience to spill crocodile tears for stereotyped losers.<br/><br/>
Cooper impressively learned how to play guitar for the film but his voice (while decent), is simply ordinary. And like Gaga, he's imprisoned in a strait jacket of this particular acting role. The only bright note is Sam Elliott as Bobby, Maine's half-brother and manager who walks out on him as he can no longer tolerate his half-brother's unrelenting drunken act. And what about Ally's father and his limousine driver buddies? They seem more like they're from New Jersey then somewhere out in the Midwest where this is supposed to be taking place.<br/><br/>
Instead of drunken losers, how about a story about entertainment people with egos, chronicling their rise to the top along with those left behind in their wake? No instead we must endure this phony little tale hailed as a virtual masterpiece by a majority of fawning, sycophantic film critics."

"sunchick116-872-583383","9","2","6","27 February 2019"," Did you people even understand this film?
","I've been going through the reviews And I'm just appalled at how many people missed the point about this film. Maybe I shouldn't be. If there's one thing this movie bangs into your head, it's how shallow people are and that is certainly proven by the reviews here. Anyway, I have a complicated relationship with this film. I saw it for the first time back in October and was so shook up by the end, I couldn't see it again until January when I took my mother. You see, I suffer depression, and if this film had an alternate title, it would called 'what NOT TO SAY AND DO TO A MENTALLY ILL PERSON'. This film is a must see for anyone who has a friend or family member suffering mental illness. It gives you insight into how depression messes with our brains and distorts things said to us, negatively. It's very easy to dismiss this film as a 'boy meet meets girl, boy makes girl famous' type movie but that would be a huge insult. I'm a filmmmaker so I have been watching interviews with cooper about this film and there's a couple things about this film that need to be cleared up 1) Jackson is NOT a fading performer. He can play concerts the rest of his life and be fine. 2) jackson was NOT jealous of ally's success. He was disappointed she became a sell out, but those were his own insecurities. There's a scene in the film where he finally figures this out but I won't spoil it for you. 3) I have been seeing A LOT of comments about how 'that's not an alcoholic behaves'. First of all, Bradley cooper is a former (But never really goes Away) alcoholic. Alcoholism does not look like one size fits all. I'm a disabled screenwriter and I HATE when i get feedback like 'character is too outgoing to be disabled. It's unrealistic'. EXCUSE ME?! Do I have to sit in a closet with a bag over my head to fit your stereotype? So those comments need to stop. If anything I think this film taught us the importance of needing each other and treating each other well. Some people may disagree with me but the only person who treated Jackson well was ally. Not even his brother was nice to him. Yes I know what you're going to say, but if there's one thing I appreciated about this film, it's how it treated alcoholism as a DISEASE, because it is. Sorry for the rant but there's so much misinformation and misinterpretation of this film it makes me angry. Near perfect film in my opinion. Only took one point off for the end because like I said, traumatized. I STILL can't listen to 'shallow' without crying. Super disappointed in how this film was treated in Award season, awarding far inferior films like 'roma' And 'green book'. If you want a movie that makes you feel and changed your life (and maybe the life of someone else too) this is it. And for those of you wondering if the end was necessary, of course not, but depression isn't rational and it was something jackson had struggled with SINCE HE WAS A CHILD. It's like everybody missed that part. In his messed up brain, it was a self sacrifice. Until you know what it's like to suffer depression and have your mind play tricks on you and warp things people say and do, you'll never understand."

Watch just ONE SEASON of The Voice,and you REALIZE how many enormously talented,normal,working class people there are in real life.And for that matter,how easily replaced megastars are.

Theirs is a beautiful relationship and it endures a lot of trials. Their love stands rock solid even when Jack loses himself to his addiction.

","I've seen all four versions of A Star is Born - 1937, 1954, 1976, and now 2018. This version was a disappointment. It lacked in story and conflict (there wasn't either), and all the good acting could not bring its lackluster script to life. The only significant conflict was the brotherly conflict of Sam Elliott and Bradley Cooper. Elliott dropping out of sight for half the movie removed the real grit and conflict in the story. While he was gone, the story became stale.<br/><br/>That said, it isn't the supporting role characters who should carry the conflict. Cooper and Gaga didn't have the spark as lovers, or the conflict, to move the story along.<br/><br/>Gaga's role has her boldly draping herself across a bar at the beginning of the story, showing a too-early version of her self-confidence. She then plays shy when she's on stage with Cooper, but morphs into a solid singer, then morphs again as the bold Gaga herself.<br/><br/>Versions of ""you have something to say,"" replayed over and over. We got it the first time.<br/><br/>Even the ""homage"" elements from the 1976 version are underplayed. And the way Cooper's story ends didn't mesh with his then current state of mind."
"ablack90","5","2","6","5 February 2019"," Very Over-Rated Film
","This film should not win any awards and is really over-rated. It's no where near as good as the original with Streisand (who can actually act).<br/><br/>Chemistry between two leads is non existent. Singing is sub par. Storyline is old and tired. This is a renter at best."
"bholland2014","4","2","6","4 February 2019"," A Bad Romance
","A Star is Born sweeps us off our feet in a manner so rapturous that it requires a purposeful look back at the tale to realize its trick and its truths. After a second viewing, much reading and some deep reflection, the answer to why this picture unsettled me so turned out to be quite simple.<br/><br/>Jack's addicted to alcohol. Ally's addicted to Jack. The film tells the story of their sick, codependent and tragic yearning for authenticity and/or validation.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born itself is a kind of drug-a hostage taker. Its doting audience, the addict-its hostage. The movie seduces with its alluring leads, killer tunes, outstanding production values and then robs the viewer blind creating an inherent yearning for the better times. Ally sings, ""I'll always remember us this way"". I wish I didn't want to but its hooks were in me.<br/><br/>The filmmakers create an urgent and euphoric whirlwind-an emotional rollercoaster-that thrusts us into Jack and Ally's world so fast and so hard that the film's magical ability to disguise obsession as romance becomes unrecognizable. This is the film's trick-making a hostage situation look like true love.<br/><br/>""So, are you telling me that A Star Is Born isn't simply a romantic drama?"" Yah, friends, keep up. ""So then what is it about?"" Great question. I've been wondering that myself. In Ally's first on-stage experience with Jack, she endearingly covers her face in awe of what she's been coerced into. Maybe the movie is about facing fears. Later, Jack insists that Ally ""dig into (her) soul (or else she) won't have legs."" Maybe it's about staying true to oneself. The story doesn't sit in these (and other) profound moments long enough to allude to these as possible takeaways. Instead, it merely acts as a window into Jack and Ally's toxic relationship with nothing to say about it.<br/><br/>So, why did A Star Is Born disturb me so? Because it is about nothing and teaches nothing. It has no opinion on abusive/co-dependent relationships and represents addiction treatment carelessly.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie deserves all it's Academy nominations except for one-the most critical one. Like The Wolf of Wall Street before it, which glorifies wealth, drugs and their resulting debauchery without criticism, A Star Is Born has no right being honored in the Best Picture category. Dear Academy, what is it that I'm missing? I'd sincerely like to know; Why did you do that?<br/><br/>
*Perhaps I'll change my tune down the line if it becomes a catalyst for would be Al Anons and their addict partners to get proper treatment. Without an explicit roadmap for viewers, however, I don't see that happening."

","Lady Gaga can sing - this we know. She has penned some memorable hits - this we also know.
Unfortunately this film lacks enough evidence of this. I didn't leave with any tune stuck in my head and neither was enough time given to showing her character to be a real talent who could wow audiences.
I didn't buy that her character and Bradley Cooper's were really head over heels besotted and in love. It just did not emotionally engage me and for the last half hour (remember we know how this is going to end) I just wanted the credits to roll."
"lpatterson83","9","2","6","26 October 2018"," Oscar....Oscar....Oscar!
","If Bradley Cooper doesn't get an Oscar for his sensational performance in this movie I am never watching the Oscars shows again, because they will be worthless. I have never seen a man look at a woman the way he did in this movie that showed such love and pride .
I thought to myself that I had to see this movie because a third remake is a classic "" give me a break, you couldn't come up with a new idea ??""
He was a fabulous, his acting his singing he was spot on perfect. Lady Gaga's first acting performance, was very good. The role was a natural for her as a singer and a performer and as she was very good in it.<br/><br/>The storyline was updated and more credible, Sam Eliot is always wonderful as a great character actor, and who could ever tire of his low rumbling growl of a voice. It melts my butter for sure, And for some reason, Bradley Cooper as his brother, had that same beautiful tonal quality of Sam Elliot's.
This movie pretty much had it all; the acting, the casting, the directing, the music, the storyline, the cinematography, but I have to say the movie really was Bradley Cooper, and to outshine Lady Gaga's belting it out from the bottom of her sultry boots, well , that's saying something"
"fudgesinger","5","2","6","21 October 2018"," the last two minutes are touching
","This is the fourth version - with each remake more years further from the previous version - Gaynor version 1937, Garland version 1954 ( 11 years apart), Streisand version 1974 (20 years apart) and now Lady Gaga 40 years apart<br/><br/>The start of the story is touching. I enjoyed the first twenty minutes.
Then when little 'miss nobody' suddenly graduates from singing a Piaf song indifferently in a bar - to performing in a huge auditorium. without any nerves disappointments or hardship and no nerves either..!!!! beggers belief
And so the film starts to unravel<br/><br/>Life ain't like that... Careers do not happen over night - certainly not to this magnitude- without a huge learning curve and hard work.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the early Gaga looking 'normal'. But once she was discovered it became unreal<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper role is fine but I did not care about him. We know nothing about his background. Was he married divorced gay straight??? Never let an actor director himself. It rarely works<br/><br/>The scenes between him and Lady Gaga were fair - especially the very touching last minutes in the film which nails it in one<br/><br/>The choice of songs Too many ballads Not showing her versatility<br/><br/>The audience at the screening were under thirty years old and enjoyed it. The story was 'new'to them and were unaware of the previous versions.<br/><br/>It goes to show the story still works for each new generation.<br/><br/>By the way: What ever happened to the frozen peas that wrapped her swolen hand which miraculously disappeared.in teh next scene?? And the home made engagement ring that suddenly disappeared and became a diamond ring???/"
"totalpcamazon","4","2","6","20 October 2018"," Don't agree with the critics
","#1. there was NO chemistry between the two characters. NONE. I've seen more chemistry in 10th Grade, and I got a D. The movie was a series of 2 or 3 minutes scenes haphazardly cut together. There was no continuity, no buildup, no story building. It seemed like they took all the First Takes and just pieced them together. The acting was mostly flat. I felt nothing for the characters. I didn't buy his drunk. There was no reason he ended up at her club in the beginning, and no reason he was attracted to her, or her to him. Nothing. No build up, no story, just a bunch of dialogue pieced together. The songs were forgettable, and most just silly cliche'd crap. His relationship with his brother had no real emotion. I don't know WHAT Dave Chapelle was doing there, and the scene between them on the lawn was useless. I don't know WHAT the hell Dice was doing there, except maybe he's buddies with Cooper, and Cooper wanted to give him a part. The Rehab scene was useless. I felt nothing at the end when she sang her song, and that was HUGE in the Streisand one. The love scenes between them, I think even they didn't feel them, and that's why they were cut so short. I thought the idea of turning Gaga's character into Gaga was a poor choice. She had said earlier, when she was advised to dye her hair platinum, that she wouldn't do that, it wasn't true to her. Then she colors her hair. Why? So Gaga fans would be happy? I felt NOTHING of her rise and his fall. It was just flat. He was the same throughout the movie, and so was she, only she colored and styled her hair. But the thing that REALLY pissed me off, was his suicide at the end. Forgetting the fact that we didn't feel with him that it was his justifiable end, it RUINED the Streisand film. In the Streisand version, John Norman leaves in his sports car, listening to her music, drunk, and under the influence, and he is seen driving recklessly, and speeding, and then it cuts to after the accident. It is left to the viewers' imagination, Did he kill himself on purpose, or was it an accident caused by his state? In this one, Boom, he hangs himself. Thanks, Brad. Thanks for just killing everything. And lastly, Gaga is NO Streisand. She wants to be, and tried real hard to be, but she is not. She's the American Idol version. I didn't get any authenticity from her songs, or or acting. She wasn't bad, in the acting department, and maybe under a better director, she could've risen to a very good performance. She has a good voice, but she just didn't move me at all. As for Cooper's directing of himself. This was his worst performance, imo. Even in stinker movies, of which he's done a couple, I've always believed him, and liked his performances. Here, I didn't buy a second of it. He needs a good director, and a better editor to guide him."

"asda-man","9","2","6","8 October 2018"," A miracle birth
","A Star is Born
A miracle birth<br/><br/>Stars: Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliot<br/><br/>Cooper's A Star Is Born had everything going against it when it was announced. Hollywood is renowned for its lack of originality but remaking a film for a third time is garishly lazy, even for them! It began with Janet Gaynor in 1937, then Judy Garland had a go in 1954 before passing the song-and-dance baton onto Barbra Streisand in 1976. I mean, how many times can a star really be born? Well, apparently the answer is at least four times as our Lady Gaga is now having a go playing the reluctant starlet rising to fame. Gaga wouldn't have been an obvious choice for a leading lady after her horrendously wooden stint in American Horror Story which bizarrely earned her a Golden Globe. Type-cast pretty-boy, Bradley Cooper also wouldn't spring to mind as the perfect leading man, let alone as writer and director. The whole project sounded doomed from the beginning.<br/><br/>However, ladies and gents, take those cynical hats off because by some miracle turn, Bradley Cooper's version of A Star is Born isn't just good, it's pretty much great on all levels. Following in the footsteps of the 70's Barbra Streisand version, Cooper unsurprisingly decides to focus on the music industry rather than the movies. This means that both leads find themselves outside of their comfort zones as Cooper must pretend to be a world-class singer and Gaga has to do a Cher and become both a phenomenal singer and actress at the same time. Somehow, they both manage to pull it off. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is more known for his comedy roles in The Hangover and the films of Academy favourite, David O Russell (The Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle etc.) and has given no indication of just how far he can stretch his acting abilities. Here, he completely transforms himself into Jack, the raging alcoholic with a troubled past and a penchant for popstars. I'd certainly be very surprised if he doesn't earn an Oscar nomination for his performance which at times feels painfully all too real. Gaga also impresses as Ally, although this is a role which doesn't particularly stretch her as an actress. A popstar playing a popstar rising to fame wasn't exactly going to be difficult for her, at one point she mentions being signed with Interscope Records (her actual record label) and you wonder if she's really acting at all. She really does mesmerise in the singing department, however, and the scenes involving heated arguments feel frighteningly genuine.<br/><br/>The plot itself sticks quite faithfully to all the other Star is Born's. Alcoholic superstar falls for talented nobody and transforms her into a superstar whilst he spirals into a deadly hole of addiction, whilst almost derailing her career. It's a very simple story and the film does feel quite overlong. The first half is the strongest and paciest section. After about and hour or so, the film does start to feel a little repetitive and I was left wondering where else it was going to go. What packs a real punch though is the ending. Of course, it won't come as any surprise for those who have seen any of the other versions of the story, but here it's no less powerful and executed pretty much to perfection.<br/><br/>Cooper's directing is also very arresting. There's a very raw and real feel to whole film which grounds the film in a reality rarely seen in Hollywood blockbusters. The camerawork is often handheld and intimate so that we always feel close to the characters and their lives. Whilst I wouldn't quite say that the film is an instant classic like some critics, A Star is Born is well worth your time. If not least for the powerful ending which sees both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga at the very top of their respective games."

","I have never taken the time to review a movie, good or bad, but this movie has moved me in so many ways I just had to share some thoughts. <br/><br/>Not only is the acting, cinematography, writing, and directing utterly flawless, it is brave and beautiful. Mental health, alcoholism, co-dependency, and suicide are topics that are so very hard to talk about and to comprehend and those who suffer are viewed as weak, selfish, mean, or a joke. This movie dug deeply into the human condition with the most elegant of touches, and Bradley Cooper is to be commended for his utter genius with this film. All of the actors, musicians, etc were perfection. Thank you all for sharing your art and talent."

","I'm honestly very sceptical and cynical about romance films, as most of the time, they're cheesy, predictable and mawkish. <br/><br/>And I really think this would have gone the same way had it not been for the amazing chemistry between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. You totally believe in their characters and the story is a heartbreaking, yet heartwarming serenade. <br/><br/>I do believe the earlier scenes with Jackson discovering Ally and the way her success and their romance blooms are the strongest. <br/><br/>Gaga was utterly phenomenal and she really stole the show for me. <br/><br/>Cooper on the other hand has that thing that all directors who get in front of the camera have: an imbalance of talent. While he does a great job at directing the film, he's not as fully focused on screen. Not to say that his performance wasn't great, but I have yet to see an actor getting behind the camera and at the same time deliver a performance of a lifetime. Doing two things at once is a difficult task all around. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"

A Star is Born 2018 version is perhaps the most popular of them all, because it represents our current times, while still respecting previous versions. It doesn't mean it's better, but it is still a fine effort. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's chemistry is undeniable, so much that it even trascended the screen. Their musical performances are quite good, although nothing really spectacular, but I must say I was truly impressed with 'Shallow' and 'I'll Never Love Again', two great songs that will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, break yourself free from all you read about this film and just experience it for yourself.

","And for its fourth incarnation unless you count What Price Hollywood, the story
of A Star Is Born is getting its fourth remake. Back in the 70s when it was made
for a third time by Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the setting was changed from the motion picture industry to the music industry.<br/><br/>It remains so in this film which stars Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Cooper is
a country/western singer who is starting the downside of his career and he
meets a young aspiring performer Lady Gaga who works in a hotel restaurant
and has just about given up her aspirations for a singing career. But when
Cooper and his entourage hear her she becomes a project for him.<br/><br/>If you've seen any or all of the other A Star Is Borns than you'll know some of
the key scenes already. The plot follows the same path it did with the other
three versions.<br/><br/>The beauty of this and the other films is that the story and the performances
in all of them are so good that even if you have seen the other versions the
film still grabs you. If you haven't seen other versions so much the better.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga was hired as a singer primarily, but she does show enough acting
chops to warrant a nomination for Best Actress, matched by Cooper for Best
Actor and Sam Elliott as Cooper's manager for Best Supporting Actor. A Star
Is Born also was nominated for Best Picture and a flock of other nominations
as well. It won for the original song Shallow.<br/><br/>I doubt this will be the last remake, but it will do well until another in the

The character development really lacked .. it was hard to believe in a once in a lifetime love that I couldn't see ... I mean the chemistry of these stars is off the hook. ( everyone tapping foot waiting for Bradly to get divorced and hook up with Gaga)
But the script didn't back up what we saw. The plot also didn't back up what we saw.
We are supposed to believe so many things - and it just was not there in the writing or the scenes.
As far as acting goes- I was stunned by Bradly. I mean, he steals this show in every way possible. He outshines Gaga in every single scene. He is just brimming with charisma and talent.
His direction! The direction of this film is Oscar Worthy. There are some stunning moments as far as direction is concerned.
The script is beyond terrible and so is the music.
The 70s version had like four #1s ... the music is played on the radio still today!
It would have been cool to say the same about this film.
Gaga didn't have the same kind of depth.... as Bradley here. Their characters are mismatched and in that way- the love isn't believable. For this film we needed to see a really remarkable and unique female lead with real depth, not just vanity and immaturity. We needed to believe she was worth his chasing and we don't.
Bradley got my attention so hard here though... I never thought of him as really talented or having that depth as an actor and he really changed my mind.
I wish they could have worked on other aspects of this film to make it one of the greats.
This film in ten years will be forgotten and everyone will think its sucks. It had a shine for a second - they could have made it last forever and really seized on some great opportunities to tell us something ( no pun intended)"

","Yes I do understand that there have been at least 5 different movies with the same title, however, Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper did a PHENOMENAL JOB at singing. The both definitely put the icing on the cake for my taste."
"Barry0169","6","1","2","21 June 2019"," Why?
","Why does this movie keep getting remade? It was a flimsy story with zero surprises (even if you haven't seen the previous versions) and like many reviewers, I found it extremely boring."
"oddery","9","1","2","18 June 2019"," Incredibly Moving
","For the first five minutes after the movie ended, I literally could not speak. My throat had closed due to the emotion I was feeling, and if I'd tried to say anything, only nonsense would come out.<br/><br/>I was hesitant to see this movie in theaters because it was yet another story about the music industry--and those stories are almost always the same: the humble beginnings, the discovery of amazing talent, the quick rising to the top with the help of an eagle-eyed manager, then someone gets a solo deal, there's excessive drug use (that usually ends with someone going into rehab), fighting, the greedy manager takes away what was once special about the artist, and then it all ends with a tragedy that may or may not be the ultimate end for the artist.<br/><br/>A Star is Born has all of these elements, but despite all that, it manages to tell a story so impactful with characters that were so deeply connected with its actors that I can forgive all the tropes and say that, without a doubt, this movie is the best example of its predecessors. Not just because of the quality of the storytelling, but from the original music written and performed live throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's amazing to me that this is Bradley Cooper's first time directing, and Gaga's first time acting. I hope they are both immensely proud of what they accomplished with this powerful film.<br/><br/>If there's any critiques I have, it's that Jackson doesn't get his chance to properly spell out to Ally that her manager was stripping away what made her special, turning her into a soulless popstar; and that the evil manager doesn't get his due for pushing vulnerable Jackson over the edge.<br/><br/>In my mind I like to think Ally somehow found out what he said, and she teamed up with her drag queens to go beat up that S.O.B.<br/><br/>One can only hope."

","I am not a Brad Cooper fan. But I do admire his courage here in playing a musician - and singing - and also directing this movie. And I also admire Lady Gaga, who is best known as a musician, for this major foray into acting. She does well. That said, this is not a great movie. For a big Hollywood production, it wasn't as bad as La La Land. It did have more of a story, and fewer gimmicky set up scenes. I like the idea that Ally (Gaga) is discovered in a completely random way when rock star Cooper stumbles into a gay bar she's performing in. I'm not convinced that, being such a bold cabaret performer, Ally would be terrified when Cooper invites her to perform her song with him on stage at a rock festival. She'd love it! Gaga's song, Shallow, is excellent and deserved the Oscar for best song. Cooper sings it well with her. The rest of the movie is pretty average. I wasn't emotionally engaged with it. It was more a melodrama."

The acting was good, the story was nice, but it was just very flat. I was expecting a roller coaster.... I feel a lot more could have been done here. There was no real drama, just a bit of a pity party. There were only two parts of the film where I felt any real emotion, and it was nothing to shout home about.
Shame really. It could have been a great film."

","I was always keen to watch this movie. I unashamedly like Gaga, I have enjoyed Cooper in previous films and was interested to see his directional skills. I was also drawn in by the country rock element and the booze/drug rock star side. But I went into the movie thinking it would be Cooper finding Gaga and basically promoting her. Luckily nothing is further from the truth, this movie is superb in acting, direction and musical accompaniment. There is a much deeper story with Bradly Coopers character as well as Gaga's. It's administration, love, jealousy, hurt, struggle, pride and much more. The chemistry on set is brilliant and Cooper especially shines in taking on his character. But I am not saying Gaga does not shine because she does, she still pulls out all the stops acting and singing. The story is a lot deeper than I expected and I am glad for it. The style of the movie is great and feels authentic. I really felt I was along for the ride. I do wonder did Cooper take lessons from Elliot to perfect that drawl ?<br/><br/>Anyway loved it and will listen to soundtrack"

","I quite fondly recall the Barbra Streisand Chris Kristofferson version of this story from the late 1970s and so was interested to see how Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper fared. Sadly, I just didn't find it captivating or particularly enlightening, particularly Bradley Cooper as the ageing and falling from grace and favour Jack Maine.<br/><br/>The story is well known and predictable, and so I suppose the challenge is to find something new to show or say, or some musical performances that blow you away. I couldn't find either of these to enliven its slow feeling 2¼ hours."

It was never clear that everyone felt Ally was losing her soul (which is what i felt) and it was also not clear what journey jackson was on. His hearing, his relationship and addictions were kinda jumbled.. i felt the award ceremony scene was also overdone.<br/><br/>I like bitter endings in movies but this one jarred especially. I was confused to what the message is. Is Jackson on some type of noble suicide which quite frankly is nonsense. The suicide should have been either removed or driven by addiction not some type of stepping aside message.<br/><br/>We were robbed of a redemptive crescendo for the relationship (how hood would that have been?) Instead we had what i assume was an artisitc redemption for Ally right at the end. I felt this was kinda had no build up and was just dropped in.<br/><br/>Great movie but really frustrating......."

The story is not too unique or too deep. It doesn't showcase how fame and glory changes environment and new people around new star and how this changes everything. As a musician, i notice that last song in the movie was written to be performed probably for Beoyonce (way too high notes for Gaga) with the lyrics probably written by some teenager from mediocre collage (imho even English is not my first language)."

"ethanarmstrong79","4","1","2","21 February 2019"," Escalator of Euphoria: Out of Order
","""A Star Is Born"" follows the love story of Jackson and Ally and her meteoric rise to pop music stardom. Lady Gaga is at home in this role, having claimed to have made celebrity into in art form in and of itself. Jackson, an established professional musician, comes across Ally's lounge act by chance as he stumbles into a bar she's performing in one evening. The two have a rapport, and Ally shares a heartfelt song she wrote for him in the parking lot of a convenience store. In what seems like the blink of an eye, she's on stage with Jackson in front of thousands - performing one of her original songs as a duet. The crowds rave, the critics adore, limitless success piles onto itself, a pristine courtship builds to marriage -- it seems nothing can stop this train of happiness from chugging along to infinity. Though is Jackson really there throughout it all in his drug-addled stupor? The non-stop escalator of euphoria can't go on forever. And it indeed it doesn't, crashing in a fiery blaze of suicidal trauma at the end. Jackson's suicide - like all suicides - leaves a multitude of questions. For example, where were his demons leading up to the event? Is he a haunted Chris Cornell? An overwhelmed, depressive, confused Kurt Cobain? A Jim Morrison or Jimi Hendrix with too much guilt on his modest psychological plate? It's a fantastical, sweet love story divorced from the day-to-day reality of its viewers, but I prefer to see it as a statement on the emptiness of fame."

Lady Gaga is simply phenomenal and it is a good, solid directorial debut for Bradley Cooper. This is the 5th time that this story has been told on film (if you count What Price Hollywood). It is just as good as the 1954 version starring Judy Garland and James Mason. Cooper has reimagined the story, but, and to his credit, he hasn't played around with the winning formula too much.

"AnishMisra","9","1","2","26 January 2019"," A Star Is Born Review
","A Star is Born is a film co-written and directed by Bradley Cooper. This film has been on my radar from the day it was announced. The trailers came and I kind of loved the vibe and knew that this film was going to be one of the best. After watching it last night, I knew that my movie senses were in the right direction.<br/><br/>Plot: Jackson Maine, an alcoholic and drug addict musician falls in love with a much younger singer, Ally.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film has been shown before in India in the form of Aashiqui 2. All of the people loved the music but I was one of the few people who did like the film too. So for me while I was starting the film, I kind of knew the story and the territory I was stepping into. What I did like about the film was its approach. This particular story has been shown three times before and its natural for people to think as to what else can be done. But Bradley has done a fantastic job in making the film his own and marking himself as a fantastic director. In each and every scene you do feel what the characters are going through and what is their mind-set. For most of the run-time, I was invested in the film. The film also very beautifully highlights both the negatives and positives of being a celebrity and how it affects your lives. The cinematography of the film is just awesome. Each and every frame of the film is just fascinating to look at. The concert scenes are very well directed. But the film does have places where the pace kind of goes down and you feel not very invested in that particular scene.<br/><br/>Performances: Bradley Cooper does a great job both kin terms of physicality and acting. He delivers a phenomenal performance. But the main star of the film is obviously Lady Gaga. I have heard few of her songs which proves her mettle as a singer but she is a wonderful actress too. She gives her best performance and it's difficult to digest that this is her first film. Sam Elliot also gives a standout performance. He sometimes does make you emotional and you understand the plight of his character. Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chapelle also give some good performances.<br/><br/>Music: The film has some great songs thanks to Lady Gaga, Luke Nelson and a whole lot of others. I decided not to hear any one of the songs before watching the movie. And that turned out to be great. ""Shallow"" obviously is awesome and is getting a lot of accolades. Another one that caught my ear was ""Always remember Us This Way"".<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Jack proposes to Ally. The reason as to why this particular scene caught my eye was because I wasn't expecting that and also the proposal was done in the most creative way possible.<br/><br/>Verdict: A STAR IS BORN is definitely a film that I loved and would recommend all romance and music lovers to watch. This film has a quite unique approach which might not sit right with many, so I do understand if you will not like the film. But anyways, I did love the film.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

","A Star Is Born is, first of all, acting. There are very good performances : Cooper is very great, Lady Gaga... for first time I see her play a character in a movie of that caliber... he really surprises me. Both of them make you believe of their relationship. And that's very good. Sam Elliott... damn... he can be responsible of bringing some tears in your eyes actually.<br/><br/>Second, the directing. This is the first time that Bradley Cooper directs a movie, and for his first time, it was a very good first time. Cooper knows exactly how filming scenes, particularly throughout the gig parts. He puts the camera just in front of the faces to vehiculate emotions. The lighting and colors are very vivid and it's pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>Third, the film editing. There are very smart editings in this movie. He cuts right at good moment between scenes. There is one scene at the end, a penultimate cut, that just blown me away. And those who watch the movie knows what I am talking about.<br/><br/>And fourth, the soundtrack. The majority of the songs feel authentic, and that's the core force of A Star Is Born, thanks to Gaga and... Cooper. Again. This guy have a beautiful voice. ""Shallows"" is the favorite for the best original song in the Academy Awards. Easily.<br/><br/>The minor flaw I can see is that the second part can be a bit predictable. And I wanted to see more of Sam Elliott in this movie.<br/><br/>At the end, this movie can be a classic. Just watch it.<br/><br/>Final note: 82/100"

I tried to watch the previous remake first with Barbara Streisand but could not get into it. It may have something to do with the music and soundtrack. The soundtrack in this movie is awesome! The last song ""II never love again"" Is magic and so fitting it moved me. I already like Bradley Cooper and this movie gave him a chance to prove that he is a really good actor as it is a drama. Not to mention he directed it which made him more versatile. Out of all the singers that have done movies from Madonna, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey etc I was a bit worried that Lady Gaga might not do the role justice but I was wrong. She acted natural and worked the character effectively. The Chemistry is great too. What can I say I already watched it twice in 2 weeks. A must see!"

Completely engulfed in the movie so much so I almost peed myself because I didn't want to miss anything. Gaga is amazing. Bradley is amazing. I had no knowledge it was a remake of any sort, and glad of that because I despise when people compare. It is what it is and it's amazing.<br/><br/>My only frustration is that the scumbag of a manager didn't get what he deserved, but I guess that's realism for you. There's a whole industry of scum out there taking talented artists and turning them into pop trash. Creating 'stars' that don't sing but perform. Making money without heart. Flashing their bodies and hiding their souls. Its a shame but thats how it is.<br/><br/>The performances were fantastic even so, the movie definitely deserves multiple awards, and I can't see how anyone with a heart couldn't agree."

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","30 November 2018"," About creativity, staying honest and learning to trust
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut marks the third remake of this particular story. Fourth, if you count the 2013 Bollywood musical. The story is about an aging country rock singer, whose career is at its final stretch. Then he runs into a girl with an amazing voice and becomes instantly fascinated, if not outright smitten.<br/><br/>The film stars Cooper in the leading role and Lady Gaga as Ally, the girl with the voice. And these two are magnificent. The role of Ally is of course practically tailor-made for Gaga, but I'm still blown away by her acting talent. The same with Cooper, except that with him I'm blown away by the fact that he can actually sing really well. These two approach the same point from different directions and this build some amazing chemistry between them.<br/><br/>And it's good that these two work as well as they do, because the movie would absolutely fall apart if they did not. Mind you, the story itself has some depth to it. I especially like its point of view on talent and what you should do with it. Does an artist have a responsibility to use their talent to say something meaningful or is it simply enough to make people enjoy themselves? But in the end it's the love story, the evolving relationship between these two that keeps the movie going.<br/><br/>Now, I have to admit that I did not enjoy the ending. It's the same as in the previous movies, but it still didn't feel honest to me. The movie was not building towards such an ending. I felt cheated.<br/><br/>Still, a very good movie. Borderline great. Fantastic performances, really good storytelling, good music, some poignancy and pleasing on the technical side of things as well. Recommended."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","29 November 2018"," There is strength in vulnerability
","The above summary line is a quote from a recent ""Actress Roundtable"" during which Lady Gaga shared her feelings about portraying the character ""Ally"" in ""A star is born"".<br/><br/>I have not seen any of the four previous renditions of that familiar story: a mentor and a protÃ©gÃ© fall in love as they head towards opposite direction in their respective careers. She skyrockets bottom to top; he plummets top to bottom. In her case it is general recognition of her talents. In his case it is substance abuse. I don't know how each of the preceding versions end. This one is ""three-hankie' vintage, at least according to one critic. Is it? Each individual's soft spot is different.<br/><br/>Although the plotline is familiar, the focus of each viewer can be different. Take the element of alcoholism. Two widely read critics have completely opposite view on its treatment and importance in the current movie. No one can argue, however, that ""A star is born"" is first and foremost a love story. One can also see this movie as an illustration of how a superstar is packaged and marketed. My own focus is the music. More specifically, you see how two talented artists click, recognizing each other as a kindred spirit, interacting at a level that is exclusively their own.<br/><br/>To most, the ""hankie point"" has to be the final scene. Jack (Bradley Cooper), coming back from rehab, after a brief blissful interlude when he believes that there is still a future for him an Ally (Lady Gaga) together, finally realizes that he is only an obstacle, and the only obstacle, to her super-stardom. He hangs himself. In his memorial service, she sings ""I'll never love again"" a song Jack had written but never got a chance to perform. Intercutting with Lady Gaga's heart-breaking rendition are montages of the happy times Jack and Ally had together. At the very end of the song, it cuts to Jack at the piano, singing the last bar to Ally. Under Cooper's tasteful direction, this scene is sublimely moving. But this is not my ""hankie"" scene.<br/><br/>Before I come to that scene, I need to describe another one first. They met in a cop bar where he happens to catch her casual guest performance of ""La Vie en Rose"", which right away serves notice that for Ally, only the sky is the limit. Next comes a mesmerizing scene where they sit on a bench at a spacious sidewalk, in the middle of the night, chatting, laughing, flirting. She quietly sings a few phrases of the song ""Shallow"" she wrote. He loves it. Encouraged, she stands up, faces him and belts it out as if at the climax of a concert. He loves that too.<br/><br/>Now, this is my ""hankie"" scene. Still a big draw (although declining), he invites her to his concert, at back stage. After one of his own numbers, he starts a few chords of ""Shallow"" on his guitar, and gently sings the first few bars, beckoning. At the edge of the stage, surrounded by friends, every fiber in Ally is vibrating. She comes out on stage, a little cautiously but definitely not timidly. Positioning herself at a side mic, she takes over the lyrics. That eye-contact between them says everything, and he is all smiles. For the next verse, she strides over to center stage and truly takes over (Jack stepping aside a bit), with gusto radiating confidence. Jack approaches, they harmonize, just a few bars. It's electrifying!<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper as an actor has been solidly proven, elsewhere as well as in this movie. In addition, for this movie, he took 18 months of vocal training. Reportedly, what we heard in the movie is entirely him as recorded, without further audio engineering.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga surprised a lot of people when she, with total success, sheds her familiar flamboyant persona and becomes the character Ally on screen. Coming back to my summary line, her portrayal of the ordinary, nnocent, vulnerable pre-stardom Ally is totally convincing, a quality that is sustained throughout the entire duration of the movie. Both vocally and visually, there cannot be a better choice. Vocally, nothing needs to be said. Visually, Ally cannot be too pretty but has to be good enough to be appealing on a larger-than-life poster. Incidentally, Ally told Jack, when they first met, that people say she cannot make it because her nose is too big. Makes me really want to see Barbara Streisand's version of this movie!"

(Deep breath...)
A movie can only be as good as it's story. I don't buy their initial flirtation. I don't feel that they learn anything or grow as people. There are a few logic issues as well.
Furthermore, I find that the film leans too heavily on music for manipulating audiences emotions. Put a powerful Lady Gaga song at the end of any film and people will be moved to tears, regardless of genre."

While there were some nods and some similarities, this became its own in a magnificent fashion. Bradley Cooper is the best of the male leads, and Lady Gaga is just as amazing as Janet Gaynor.

","There were some issues with this movie. The love story struggled slightly but that's because Jack was always an alcoholic so it couldn't go from being 'magical' to 'tragic' because in most people's eyes, it already is tragic if he can't see the day through without a drink. For Lady Gaga's first big film, she did a really great job but I had no doubts as I think she is amazing in American Horror Story anyway. I really liked the idea of this film and I think it could have been a really great if there was more of a downward spiral from a happy marriage. It never seemed to be special and desirable because Jack was always drunk.<br/><br/>In terms of the acting itself and how believable the movie was, it was solid. I believed the actors were their characters and I was always routing for Ally."

"info-650-994633","8","1","2","24 November 2018"," A movie bigger than Gaga's singing career
","However Bradley Cooper's masterful performance and Gaga's equally surprising acting, this movie seems to have been created by Gaga's concert promotor Live Nation to boost ticket sales. A sort of ""Bodyguard"" if you will.<br/><br/>However, where the Bodyguard delivered JUST the right amound of tongue-in-cheek lightness that matched Whitney's poppy songs perfectly, Bradley Cooper created a sort of arthouse drama that would have shot into the stratosphere with a soundtrack that would have done the movie right.<br/><br/>Of course we buy into Cooper's character, who performs rather flat country mockup songs to make him look legit, which works. But the fact that Gaga, despite her amazing singing abilitie,s fails to deliver that one ""I Will Always Love You"" which made The Bodyguard, is a letdown: Whitney clearly picked her cover song to reach number 1 before the movie came out, making everyone curious to see it. But Gaga came up with a rather bland soundtrack which doesn't do the quality of the movie any justice. Ask anyone who's seen the movie to recite the first line of a featured song and they'll fail. A missed oppertunity for an otherwise briljant movie."

Being a musician myself, the dancing and nonsense around her (both in the movie in in real life) for me is just annoying and a distraction to her real talent. I kind of thought in the movie when she went in that direction, it was a sign that SHE was going off the rails and losing her focus. Kind of like in La La Land when he was playing all the glitzy piano stuff rather than the great music. But apparently that was the movie's definition of success.

","A Star is Born Review:<br/><br/>A Star is Born stars Bradley Cooper as Jack, a famous music celebrity struggling with drug and alcohol abuse, who discovers a young woman, Lady Gaga, named Ally and the two fall in love while struggling with fame and Jacks addictions. I saw this movie last Saturday and I haven't had time to write a review because I've been so busy. A Star is Born has been getting a lot of Oscar buzz, so naturally I was excited. I was also excited to see Bradley Cooper staring and directing it. I was also excited for Lady Gaga. She was a good actress on American Horror Story and even won a golden Globe for one of her roles for it. The only things that didn't make me excited was the trailer made it look just ok and this is the the 7th time this movie has been done (only 4 including this one were actually popular movies in theaters). This movie was really good. I liked it a lot more than I thought. The story was modernized but some scenes to me felt like it was an older movie, for me the title sequence just made it seem like an older movie. I loved Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Bradley has always been a good actor and this might be one of his best performances. He captured the alcohol and drug addiction so well while making him a likable character. He can also sing pretty well. Lady Gaga was outstanding! Her performance was so strong. You could tell she put a lot of hard work and effort into it. Her singing was amazing! Honestly this was probably the best female performance in a film that I've seen all year. I think she might get an Oscar. Sam Elliot also did a good job in his supporting role as Bobby. I liked the score for the movie. I really liked some of the songs, so probably some best original song academy award there. The cinematography was good. It really made you feel like we were in the movie. The only issue I had was because it was modernized they tried to incorporate something everybody knows, SNL. There was a scene where they got a gig there and I felt that it felt a little bit off. I would highly suggest this movie. This movie will be nominated for awards and definitely win some. I hope you enjoyed this review and go see this film!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

Exploring the downs of the relationships and lifting up the mood by showing some of the ups. This definitely a great first directing credit for Bradley Cooper and I have a feeling its not the last time we will be seing him in the director's chair.

The soundtrack is mesmerizing ('Shallow' gave me goosebumps) and Bradley Cooper is a brilliant singer. Also the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper was extraordinary as their relationship develops over time with lots of long silences for effect and some tense scenes where you literally hold your breath. Their performances are both so captivating and Gaga does a tremendous job and immerses herself in the character of Ally (you wouldn't think this is her first big-screen starring role), especially when she has to pretend to be nervous on stage! It did drag slightly in the third act which was slightly exhausting but the acting is solid throughout. I also feel the longer the film was, the greater impact it will have on audiences as boy does this film pack an emotional punch that hits you right in the feels. I did shed a tear or two!"

","A Star Is Born is without a doubt one of the best films of 2018.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given to Bradley Cooper for not only directing, but putting in a wickedly understated but fantastic performance. Lady Gaga I also give supreme credit to for bringing a very stripped back and raw take on her character to life on the screen. They really just clicked on screen together, and I think credit has to be given to them both for being able to create that and pull me in.<br/><br/>Directing, acting, music, pacing I give a 10/10. What I will say however is that while I loved the story, it was clunky in some places, and also used a few cheap tricks to try and move you through the story in places. Was not distracting to the point of detracting from the overall high quality of the film, but was noticeable in places.<br/><br/>End went full bodyguard vibes, and was a bit glaringly obvious, but totally still worked.

","Let me start by saying that I'm a huge GAGA fan, so when I saw this coming, I was excited ... let me also start by adding that I have never been on the Bradley train, but figured if GaGa was in it, it was worth a watch. I decided to download the soundtrack prior to seeing the movie, just by seeing the commercials and loving the snipets of somgs they showed...great idea, because I already had an emotional connection to it. All of my friends were going and telling us how wonderful it was, including my mother in law, who basically turned my hubby to my side, and decided to take me.
Let me say, by the time we were done, we both were in tears, of course I was holding in my sobbing, due to the quiet of the theater (because everyone was crying) and still today, after 3 days have gone by, I can immediately start balling again just thinoof it!
Bradley was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING... GaGa was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING...the cast couldn't have been better, the music was perfect, raw and pulled at your heart. I also read all the info prior, as to how it was made, the prep involved and etc. and Bradley truly amazed me, not to mention that he was sexy and best and broken and human... GaGa was stunning without makeup and dark hair... their chemistry and emotion just made you feel like you weren't watching a movie, but watching their lives and relationship...in fact, I was so upset they didn't end up dating in reality lol!!!!!
It doesn't matter if you love her or him, if you like musicals or not, if you have a beating heart, you will love this film! His first directorial debut couldn't have been better!!!! I only hope the grab EVERY award for this film...

"robertslw","8","1","2","23 October 2018"," Bradley Cooper's ""A Star is Born"" shines bright
","""Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It's the same story, told over and over, forever. All any artist can offer the world is how they see those 12 notes. That's it.""<br/><br/>These are words said late in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut ""A Star Is Born."" Ultimately, this statement is the mindset of Cooper's take on the fourth remake of this classic and it works wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>The film centers on Cooper's washed-up, alcoholic musician Jack falling in love with Lady Gaga's Ally, trying to rocket her to stardom after realizing her insane musical talent.<br/><br/>The performances by Cooper and Gaga are absolutely mesmerizing. This is Gaga's first attempt at acting in a feature film and she succeeds in almost every aspect. She executes all of her dialogue with a sincerity that many other musicians-turned-actors fail to bring to their film debuts. Cooper also uses many close-ups of Gaga in the film and her facial acting is enthralling. All the emotions Ally experiences throughout the film - from anxiety to astoundment - can be felt through every eye twitch and expression.<br/><br/>Cooper portrays the washed-up Jack to a T. His gruff voice and demeanor are incredibly believable, the acting is also completely subtle with all the little ticks Cooper adds. He builds his character's disease of tinnitus - specifically by constantly leaning into conversations to hear better - and the audience gets completely lost in the performance.<br/><br/>His work behind the camera is mind-blowing, especially as his first time directing a feature film. The framing of certain scenes and moments cause chills to run down the viewer's spine - sparking emotions from absolute heartbreak to joyous celebration.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also breathtaking. Every scene has some sort of color combination that creates shots that leaves jaws on the floor. A scene of Ally walking out of a bathroom stall enraged after a call with an ex-lover could have been very by-the-books, but Cooper's use of lighting, costume and set design leads to a shot of Gaga screaming, perfectly-centered, surrounded by a black-and-white tiled bathroom that's been ingrained in my mind since I left the theater.<br/><br/>All of these aspects are perfectly executed in the visceral concert scenes scattered throughout the film. Everything from the excellent framing to the stellar performances is on display for everyone to take in. You can feel every ounce of soul the actors put into their singing and it's mostly because all the performances were shot on location with no autotune, creating a genuine concert experience.<br/><br/>The only place where the film falters is its pacing near the final act. The film switches focus to certain characters near the end because of specific plot developments, which slows the pace, but doesn't bring it to a grinding stop.<br/><br/>This pacing switch is made up for in the third act when everything built up in the film pays off in a heartbreaking way that feels completely earned.<br/><br/>This story might have have been told multiple times, but Cooper's unique eye behind and in front of the camera along with Gaga's realistic, poignant performance created a fresh and emotional take on a classic. ""A Star Is Born"" is a must-see and definitely worth the price of admission."

and bradley cooper character song i will never love again with alley really pulls at the emotion of the scene this film is well for up there for oscar night this film reminds me of country strong with gweneth palhrow a couple of years ago but this film is well worth at just over 2hrs its a 9/10 and brings the tissues"
"LaraMorgana","Null","1","2","23 October 2018"," Too long
","I liked the movie but I didn't love it for one reason: it was way too long. The second half of the movie reminded me of a drawn-out soap opera with too many scenes that were just plain boring. Bradley Cooper is amazing and Lady Gaga lived up to all the hype around her performance - but the screenplay was the downfall of the movie."

",". . . to a tiny black cinder, as it ""Goes out with a bang,"" the always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America with A STAR IS BORN. More so than the earlier three versions of this story, the ""D.B. Cooper"" take on A STAR IS BORN is primarily about A Star Dying. His ""Jackson Mayne"" character already is on his last legs, with at least one foot in the grave, before he ever sets eyes upon ""Lady Maggot."" Though it may seem that the worm turns then on a superficial level as Jackson wraps frozen peas around Maggot's bruised hand, perceptive viewers will note that he's actually beginning his Super Nova-like expansion phase, bathing all around him with the fire of a funeral pyre. Maggot feeds off the doomed Jackson until she's drained the last succulent drop of his tender bone marrow, and then kicks off into her own new orbit without a second thought. As the movie closes with a close-up of her eyes, it's clear that she senses that her time to shine will end soon."

","Really phenomenal acting, directing and cinematography. The music blew me away. The costumes needed a little work. Loved the Judy Garland (which for those not in the know did the first remake) easter egg as well as some of the reference to the styling of Cabaret (1972). A little melodramatic and though I did shed a few tears, this is not a movie that I think will go down in history as something that changed the course of cinema. I do think though that it once again proves what a phenomenal artist Lady Gaga is and will be remembered as one of her career highlights. Admittedly an absolutely incredible directing debut for Bradley Cooper. If this is where he starts from, there is a lot of amazing potential for us to see amazing future projects. It was a little lighter in its presentation than what I expected, but definitely worth the time, money and effort to go see on the big screen."
"charmadu","9","1","2","21 October 2018"," Wonderful Film - with a few Hollywood flaws....
","First off, let me say I loved this film - actually thought Bradley Cooper was better -
and have been telling everyone I know to see it. This despite the fact that I saw it surrounded by people who were talking throughout it as though they were watching a tv show in their living rooms, cell phones going off, two men getting up to go the bathroom at key emotional points AND major soundbleed from the action picture next to us. That's a lot of crap to still have me say I loved this film!
I haven't seen everything that Bradley Cooper has done but I wonder if this might be his best film yet. HOWEVER....I have a few quibbles. One is almost ironic b/c I thought Cooper did such an excellent job of choosing which things to borrow from the Garland version. One thing however, that the latter did dare to show (in 1954 no less) was that the lead male character (James Mason/Norman Maine) was a drunk who quickly got abusive. At the key moment that he comes on stage as the Garland character receives her Oscar and tries to lovingly corral him, he smacks her in the face in front of the world. It's truly an electrifying moment. In contrast, Cooper's character never becomes physically abusive towards Ally no matter how out of it he is, and when he ruins her Grammy acceptance, he pisses on himself. This scene felt flat to me. I'm not arguing that he should have completely copied the 1954 version here - but it's not believable that his character would not have pent up rage that combined with his poly-addictions would combust - and combust around the person he loved most. It's too much Mr. Nice Guy to swallow. The most painful part of being in a relationship with an addict is that they force you to hate them. But that is a far more complex relationship and Hollywood is really not too into that.
The other quibble has to do w/ Gaga's physicality. We're supposed to believe that she's been told how ugly she is, in particular her nose. I found this about as believable as her saying she's been told she's too old or fat. Also,I found it quite a stretch to think that this kitchen worker with an occasional gig singing in a drag bar, would have flawless skin, a killer toned bod with a six-pack and perfect dance video moves, at the ready. Yeah, sure, uh-huh, if you say so.... I think maybe we could have seen her working out at least to show some progression to the model look she has at the end, or getting skin treatments, whatever!
Despite this, I still loved the movie!"
"sini-200","7","1","2","21 October 2018"," we're far from the shallow
","A pretty good movie, with amazing music. Musically very good but nothing else special. The plot was easy to follow and cliché, but I wondered since the name of the movie was 'star is born', yet after Ally was discovered a star, there wasn't much about her story ?
I wished to know more about her POV to become famous and how she dealt with it, how her family and friends reacted and so on, how it was to her personally etc. Lady Gaga's songs were the best part of the film, even Bradley had a great voice she has rawness and soulfulness in her voice like no other. Especially the last song 'I'll never love again'. I love Gaga as a singer more, but she has proven to be a hell of a talented actress. I am looking forward more of her in the future!"

","A musical that tells a tragedy in an almost masterly way. Touching deep issues such as the vice that comes from depression, and suffering as a result of the disease.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper surprises us with a captivating performance and an amazing staging. Without underestimating the excellent work of Stefani Germanotta, aka: Lady Gaga as Ally in this work based on another film of the same name from 1954.<br/><br/>What delights of this tape, besides the protagonists, is the very best way to handle the secondary characters. Like Lorenzo and Bobby Maine who were the most important part in the development of our protagonists. I really loved the scenes of Anthony Ramos (Ramón) because he gave life to a specific type of character that was generally created to be forgotten or to give him potential and then to waste it.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott (Bobby Maine) has the shortest and sad scene of the whole movie.<br/><br/>I have to give my congratulations to the makeup team, but it was right in several points I want to enhance the excellent work with Cooper's face, which really makes the alcoholism notice, if you see a real life photo and another interpreting Jackson Maine, it surprises the difference of details on the face.<br/><br/>Not only the music and the soundtrack (which by the way is great) but how they sound. To express myself better I would say that what matters here is the setting, if you see this movie in the cinema, in the scenes where you play songs you will feel that you are in a real concert.<br/><br/>But the big prize, the prize for the best of the film is left by the cinematographer Matthew Libatique, only to appreciate a frame, a frame of a scene was admired with the ideal of lighting, the exactness of the focus, the detain the camera and what killed me, the color palette, an image of this tape makes you fall in love with it!<br/><br/>Although, this movie has a lot of feeling where you see it, there is a small detail that disturbed me, so to speak, in a moment; and is that, the first time Ally sings on stage, is an emotional and inspiring scene, she had just fulfilled her dream, was very nervous and that is transmitted to the viewer. But the next time you go on stage is a similar moment of nervousness but now this is not represented with the same magnitude but the scene cuts when it enters, begins, and then when they have finished, as if it were already professional.<br/><br/>That was my only personal conflict with the film.<br/><br/>I do not need him to win, but if Bradley Cooper is not nominated for a better director at the Academy Awards, I'm going to complain about the entire awards season.<br/><br/>Actually I never applaud in the movies, and this time it was not totally different. But I must admit, I loved the movie, and the end made me give 3 well-deserved pats.<br/><br/>Two hours and sixteen minutes that start looking inspiring but end with a high note, although depressing.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies from 2018 until now, with one of my favorite actors (in my previous blog I explained that I do not have a favorite one) presenting myself this time as a protagonist, director, writer and even producer."

","It's some form of career trajectory, from love interest in Alias, bit player in Wedding Crashers, lead in The Hangover, to multi-Oscar nominated actor turned likely to be nominated director of a critical and box-office darling, all-round talent Bradley Cooper has officially announced himself as a powerful Hollywood player with his energetic, engaging and emotionally strong remake A Star is Born.<br/><br/>The fourth time this story has been told on the big screen, A Star is Born unquestionably walks a familiar beat of star-crossed lovers and underdogs aiming to reach the stars, but thanks to Cooper's impressively driven direction and warts and all performance as alcoholic country music rock star Jackson Maine, that combines wonderfully with a star making turn from Lady Gaga, this stylishly produced feature film becomes something more than its seemingly simplistic set-up would suggest.<br/><br/>At one time this remake was almost a Clint Eastwood directed, Beyoncé starring affair and while the results of that collaboration would've been intriguing to say the least, thanks to Cooper and Gaga's undeniable chemistry, the eye catching working of D.O.P Matthew Libatique and the quick firing editing of editor Jay Cassidy, Star draws the audience into Maine's whirlwind world that is upturned by his chance encounter with Gaga's down on her luck waitress and wannabe singer Ally and never lets us go.<br/><br/>The film allows for Cooper and Gaga to both deliver awards worthy turns, with both performers shining in a love story that's far more dark and confronting than many will be expecting, with the films initial pizazz and wonder giving way to more of a drawn back and emotionally raw heavy-hitting scenes, as the nature of Maine's condition begins to take its brutal toll.<br/><br/>It many ways this is Cooper's film but its Gaga that will be remembered most here.<br/><br/>Her role as Ally no doubt allowed the talented and often misunderstood superstar to tap into her own experience's in the music industry and her turn feels like one constructed around a real understanding of what it means to break into the celebrity scene whilst remaining true to oneself.<br/><br/>It's a vulnerable and often unglamorous turn, yet one that allows for a number of show stopping scenes where you'll be blown away by the power of Gaga's stage presence, an early duet with Cooper is one of the year's most spine tingling, while a later showstopper with Gaga front and centre is memorising stuff.<br/><br/>Star will likely go down as one of the year's most memorable double acts with the two leads as good as they are, made all the better by solid support from Hollywood veteran Sam Elliot as Jackson's much older brother Bobby and memorable side plays by comedian Dave Chappelle as Jackson's long-term friend George and Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's loving father Lorenzo.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Telling a familiar story in a freshly polished way, this likely Oscar heavyweight is a drama with heart that also happens to feature a number of show stopping songs and two performers at the top of their game, with Lady Gaga announcing herself as a powerful new player of the Hollywood landscape.<br/><br/>4 bags off frozen peas out of 5"

","This isn't really my kind of movie, but the wife really wanted to see it and it has good reviews so I thought why not?<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable, very good at the start then dips towards the end but certainly worth a watch. I'm surprised with the amount of praise Gaga is getting though, her acting was pretty ""meh"" for the most part, she absolutely shines and was very emotive when singing, but as a singer you expect that, the rest of her performance was pretty average although not enough to take you out of the story. I was really impressed with Bradley Cooper though, he plays his role very well and I wasn't expecting it at all.<br/><br/>The story is a fairly standard ""rags to riches"" tale for Gaga and fairly standard ""aging rocker addicted to everything"" tale for Cooper and while they do it well enough, the pacing seemed off, it seemed to drag out certain moments and rush past others, leaving the ending a little disjointed<br/><br/>Without giving too many spoilers, the scene at the end with the dog was just classic tear baiting and really dulled any emotional impact for me, completely unnecessary and rather than being engrossed in the film I could only think ""classic Hollywood""<br/><br/>In summary a good film, certainly worth a watch but not quite worthy of the glowing praise it seems to be getting"
"TwittingOnTrender","7","1","2","18 October 2018"," A Star is Implausible
","A good movie that does not justify the hype, but one I would not seek out again - mainly due to its excessive length. Man, this is one baggy movie! Scenes go on, well past their expiry date, and some scenes could just have been dispensed with altogether.
I admit I've become lazy and always have closed captions on at home - without them, I lost huge chunks of dialogue between Cooper and Sam Elliott. I mean, there's gravelly and then there's subterranean. 
There's a lot to like about it - good performances from Cooper and GaGa (can we not call her something else?), good music, authentically performed, and a nice look to the thing. However, the plot...
Imagine Eddie Vedder dragging some girl you've never seen before up on stage, duetting with her then giving her a showcase for her own songs in the middle of a Pearl Jam gig. You'd love her, and make her into a superstar, right? Wrong! Ever heard of Linda McCartney? She may be the Queen of Hearts now but she was loathed when Paul first started propping her up onstage.
Second, Ally (GaGa) turns from Fiona Apple to Madonna overnight - and happily goes along with it. She morphs from an introspective singer songwriter to a scantily clad, gyrating, auto-tuned puppet in the space of a couple of frames. Her integrity is hammered home to us from the first time we see her, yet she thinks nothing of tossing the country tinged, brow-furrowing ballads aside in favour of retreads of I Want Your Sex. Are we supposed to admire her for this?
All in all, I found her character not to be likeable at all. When she (literally) first meets Jackson (Cooper) she gets all territorial with a drunken, off-duty cop who hassles him (mildly). She warns him off (""This is MY celebrity! Keep away!"") then punches his lights out (""Hooray! She punched out a cop! You go girl!"" - what kind of cop are they recruiting in the US these days?)
Afterwards, they go to a supermarket where she tells a cashier it's ""not alright"" for her to take a picture of Jackson - what business is it of hers? If this was supposed to show her in a caring, protective light, it didn't - she came across as jealous and possessive of someone she had just met.
Coupled with her later career U-turn, I thought this painted Ally in a very negative light. For that reason I didn't really buy her devastation at the (loooong, drawn out) end.
Worth seeing...just the once."

","There are stories that over time have been told and rewritten for different periods, one of these stories is ""a star is born"" a film that is re-adapted 4 times and that in turn is inspired by a George Cukor movie 1932 called ""What Price Hollywood?"" You could even say the movie The artist film of 2011 has a lot of this plot, the first of a young talent ascend, while a veteran talent falls into decadence is not very new, but if you have talent to direct, write, act and sing Something good comes out of that, and this is where Bradley Cooper comes in. He makes his debut as a director and does it in an exceptional way. Without doubt, he knows what he wants to do, he knows how to add essence to every scene that he acts and generates with Lady Gaga. his performance is also brilliant, Sam Elliott also acts and the little or much of his scenes steal every minute of the film, the picture of Matthew Libatiquees superb and not to mention the soundtrack of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper is impressive and to applaud a combination Between Country, Pop and Rock, which is really the highlight of the film, the melodrama is quite fluid but if perhaps it is a bit slow, Bradley Cooper goes so far into the world of his adaptation that forgets to prioritize some things, in conclusion is a captivating film, impressive and quite entertaining, a film shows us a promising talent as a director who takes the palms throughout the film, no doubt if you enjoy the good music of the Country , pop and rock and the dramas with good plot is definitely a movie that you can not miss."
"shayzoom","9","1","2","17 October 2018"," A Star is Born 5th time!
","A Star is Born My review<br/><br/>A Star is Born was made 5 times in Hollywood (1932 by George Cukor, 1937 by Selznick & starring Janet Gaynor, 1954 and BEST one with Judy Garland drawing parallels to her own life 1976 one with Barbara Streisand and then once in Bollywood in 2013 with relatively newcomers and which was copied frame by frame with songs in Tollywood in 2014.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born keeps getting remade for a reason: It's a story of romance and mortality, with a swooning arc that borders on the epic. and mostly because it describes the American celebrity-making machine. No wonder it's proven so attractive to the filmmakers and actors who keep retelling the story, retooling it for another generation. A Star is Born follows an essential arc that has, thus far, stayed the same: An aging male celebrity, hamstrung by his addictions, meets a talented, younger woman with whom he is instantly smitten. He connects her to the platform and contacts she needed, and she becomes a sensation almost overnight; meanwhile, his career is bottoming out. The two fall in love and marry, and her success then becomes a problem for him. Some of the above mentioned remakes have switched the careers of the lead artists as singers, rock music players, actresses, directors but the essence of the film remains the same. This one resembles more closely to the 1976 and 1954 one.<br/><br/>As far as the production values and performances go I will have to start with the dynamite screen chemistry that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga share. I vividly remember how gratuitously Gaga thanked Cooper on the Graham Norton Show for giving her this role after talks with Beyonce fell out. This is a tailor-made role for her and like Judy Garland, it mirrors parts of her career waning away. Since the story is set in the country music industry, its her home ground and hence eats the role like that slab of meat she wore a decade ago. I would not be surprised if she nabs a Oscar nomination and wins the Globes in the Best Actress- Musical or Comedy category. Bradley Cooper's best of all he has done, he seeps into his role as an actor, director, performing, cowriting. You can see the manifestation in every scene, he has put his heart and soul into everything he touched. Sam Elliott makes a sterling presence, despite towering performances by the leads.<br/><br/>Like all the other movies the music by Lukas Neeson (who is the son of country singer Willie Neeson) is electrifying and seamless and the leading pair perform with full gusto and required depth and zeal. The cinematography and A rate and so is the direction which is ace for a 1st time movie director. Bradley Copper knew what he wanted to make and put the paper on celluloid with utmost exemplariness. I did think the editing department cut a few corners though!<br/><br/>Will this be the final A Star Is Born? It seems unlikely. As long as there is Hollywood, there will probably be more versions of the same old story. The shape they take and the details will morph with the times, but the core story - a love story, a melodrama, and a tragedy all wrapped into one - seems to hold unending appeal.<br/><br/>My Rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐"

","Bradley Cooper can sing! Over the years he's proven his acting ability very well but hearing him sing makes me believe he can also have a music career. We all know LG can sing but surprisingly she can definitely act with only a couple of times when she seemed forced. The chemistry between these two was solid, although Cooper tends to have good chemistry with his co-stars, imo. This movie has the things that make for an entertaining movie...good acting, good music and good drama. And I appreciated that it wasn't so music-centered that the drama was lacking. The character development was good and the storyline kept my interest throughout the movie. Good directing by Cooper caused it to flow well with only a couple of times where it seemed to skip a beat. You won't be sorry you saw this movie on the big screen."

","Actually, I am not a big fan of dramatic movies, but this 'A Star Is Born' is awesome. The director has done a ton of homeworks, perfectly. The story telling was not too slow and not too fast, which made audiences understand easily and caught them not to lose their theater seats, popcorns and mugs of pop-soda. <br/><br/>The director knew that who must be the two lead characters in order to increase value to the film. Consequently, right decision is made. It was the crying-trigger at the end of the movie. This is not state-of-the-art in this day, but I assume that it consumed a river of audiences' tear and tissue papers. I heard rapid long sobbing.<br/><br/>However, I could give only 9 stars to this film. I am feeling that an important thing was missing. Just one thing! It is about the star manager. The audiences perceived that he was rude to the two lead actors. Ultimately, He responded to the tragedy. After the tragedy, the movie is ended. I think the manager has to show some sorry feeling to what he done. If the movie show this part, it will be perfect."

"valen060","8","1","2","16 October 2018"," A Retelling That Has A Story Worth Telling
","This has got to be a definitely intriguing flick. Actor Bradley Cooper taking on the mantle as both director and star right alongside singer Lady Gaga, this was pretty deep and versatile for the former. Since the film is its own version by not following too closely to the 1976 movie starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson the performances were phenomenal and touching when putting yourself into the characters' shoes.<br/><br/>Brad Cooper's character Jackson Maine is a successful musician. Yet plagued by drug and alcohol addiction which causes problems on himself and those around him. And upon meeting aspiring singer Ally (Lady Gaga), things begin to take a new turn for him.<br/><br/>It's like when the most dramatic and troubling moments occur amongst the main two, it feels relatable as though you know them and their personal troubles too well. And know how it may affect you on an emotional level when things turn bitter and put-offish. I've met a couple during my college days in the past with relationship troubles almost similar to this and I have to say it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly. I noticed at my local theater that the majority of the audience were mostly composed of women and not many guys, so it would make sense on how this movie affects them through both triumph and tragedy from a woman's perspective.<br/><br/>This looks to be a great movie that provides a sense of escapism for those willing to explore the music side of Brad Cooper and Lady Gaga's acting side (which I noticed is a role-reversal in their professions). True, it felt kind of slow in a few parts, but I see potential in what more Lady Gaga can do from here and glad Streisand herself gave her blessing. Not bad neither on Cooper's directorial debut. No doubt this movie will make awards season. It takes the spotlight and owns it with singing prowess done impressively by Cooper and Gaga."

","This movie awakens deep emotions through the songs. Would definitely watch it again"
"FabledGentleman","8","1","2","15 October 2018"," Emotional rollercoaster driven by strong performances
","One of the things i was thinking after seeing this film is: How often does a singer/popstar try to become a movie star? Quite a few times. And how often does that work out great? Not that often.<br/><br/>And how often do you see a movie star try to become a singer/popstar? And how often does that go really well? You probably see where I'm going with this.<br/><br/>This is what's mesmerizing about this movie, in this movie, both those scenarios came through. And not just by a margin of luck or just barely there, no, this is a movie that might have the highest wow factor of the year, and i suspect quite a bit of people are voting on this wow factor alone, because then i would give it a 10/10 without hesitation.<br/><br/>Like, who knew Cooper could sing like this? He has gone from an actor to have almost 10 million listeners on spotify in a week. He is so authentic in his role, it's almost scary. And who on earth could ever have guessed Lady Gaga was such a great actress? I mean, wow. Seriously i could really go on and on and on about these two and how authentic and real they are in this film, the chemistry is absolutely remarkable, and they show real emotions that makes you shiver all over. And add to that one of the best performances Sam Elliot has ever done, and you have solid emotional core that keeps you locked in for almost the entire ride.<br/><br/>For about the first 2/3 of this film, this was a 9/10 movie for me, i just loved watching it, but the third act was a bit disappointing, not only did i start to realize exactly how this would end, but i also felt that we spent too much time away from what made the movie so great in the first place, the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. I don't think Cooper handled this last act all too well, but it's not terrible, but he should have kept that knot tightened, so that when what happens, happens, the emotional impact would have been far greater.<br/><br/>This is however a fantastic directional debut from Cooper and a phenomenal major acting debut from Lady Gaga, it's a movie about true love, love so pure it almost feels like you just want to be in there with them and never leave, experience all their ups and downs. It does not matter if there is suffering, the love is real, and that's what matters.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga has told in several interviews that she felt that the only one believing in her was Cooper, even on the set people where skeptical towards her. Well they are not skeptical now, because Gaga might actually be nominated for an Oscar for this role, I'm almost certain she will. And the song from the film, Shallow, is the front runner to win the Oscar for best original song. Almost all the music in this film is great, these songs could easily have been hits on their own, and well, now they are.<br/><br/>The verdict. Well you know what, the first 2/3 of this movie is absolutely fantastic. for real, I'm going to see those parts over and over and over, and the scene where Gaga first goes on stage, oh wow, wow wow wow. That is an emotional scene that will stick with me for a very long time. It's just the ending i have problems with, and i need to see the entire movie as a whole. It has brilliant parts in it, it has tons of great acting, great music, great emotions, and to top it all, it feels totally authentic.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 8/10 - A really good movie which i recommend"

","This is the fourth version of the classic movie that tells the story about a big music star, and a woman that he helps to become a superstar.
This is the first time actor Bradley Cooper directs, and he is a surprisingly great director.The concert scenes especially, but he also has an eye for the small scenes.Bradley also stars as Jackson Maine and he gives a great performance as this broken rockstar. Lady Gaga who has here his first big movie role plays Ally, and she´s really talented too.The two actors have a credible chemistry who is important to the story, as an audience you believe.
In terms of story, the script although it may feel a little predictable, it is, still a great story, and very well told.It´s also worth mention the supporting cast which is all great especially Sam Elliot who plays Jackson older brother.
The soundtrack is fantastic, the songs are well written and performed, the main theme ""Shallow"" is an award nominee and winner for sure.
If i had to talk about some negative aspects, the movie is a bit too long, and there is one scene that comes from nowhere, that it could have been improved if it was better prepared.
Conclusion:A Star is Born has a profound story, great direction and performances, it´s a movie that is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>8.4/10"
"nanturn-931-301358","7","1","2","14 October 2018"," Great performances, thin script
","I was beyond impressed with Cooper's performance, who learned to sing and play guitar for this role, as with Lady Gaga, who showed a strong and genuine talent for movie acting. Cooper's direction illuminated the great chemistry between the two leads. However, in my opinion the plot was thinly developed and implausible, and much of the dialogue was weak. The film's opening scenes were exciting, well-paced, and colorful, and for the first 1/2 hour I was exhilerated and engaged. But from there the story was simply another melodrama. That thing that happened at the Academy awards - no, just no! Jack cleans up but then Ally's agent tells him he might ultimately wreck her career, so he commits suicide. Really? Needless to say, I was not one of those viewers who was weeping at the end. The bottom line is that I accept that this film is a vehicle for the performers and the music."
"Savvinos","7","1","2","14 October 2018"," The truth
","A movie worth seeing at least once. Great acting with lady Gaga at one of her best performances. The only negative is that the first hour feels like two when you still have one ahead of you. The movie could be much shorter and my rating much higher. At times you get bored."
"masonfisk","6","1","2","14 October 2018"," NOT BAD FOR WHAT IT IS...!
","An okay remake (the fourth by count) of the perennial favorite starring Bradley Cooper (in his directing debut) & Lady Gaga. Working better as 2 lost souls coming together to make music than a love affair (ultimately I didn't buy it since she had ample examples around her growing up for her to not fall for this loser), the musical sequences win out just barely. I still hold the original from the 30's starring Fredric March/Janet Gaynor as the best version but this one has enough to satisfy audiences who will probably only know this copy. Once the mechanics of the story kick in, there's not much we, as the audience, can do but strap ourselves in for the inevitable."

"eagandersongil","8","1","2","13 October 2018"," The grateful surprise of the year
","""A star is born,"" perhaps the great Oscar-facing film of this year, a film that talks about the quest for the essence and truth of things, with fantastic scenes and a style of filming itself, the first feature directed by Bladley Cooper is a welcome surprise. First of all, speaking in terms of script, the film does not reinvent the wheel at all, it's even a remake of a remake of a remake, even though it's a clichÃ©, the movie has many subtleties, our protagonist is ---- SPOILER --- a man desperate to seek truth in things, especially in life and in art. We are placed in the vision of Jack, a famous singer and consecrated who begins to lose the inspiration due to the art being in a moment pop, where everything is made to be presented to the public, thus losing its essence, thus our protagonist finds Ally, in a corner drag bar, while taking his whiskey Jack topa with the purest essence of music and falls in love first with the music and then, for the singer, when he realizes that it is also pure in its essence, the novel happens and with the Ally begins to succumb to pop, begins to lose its essence, leading Jack to despair, who tries to resume, tries, tries, until in the end, the same realizes that his own essence is no longer accepted and commits suicide. This search gives essence can be seen as an attempt to seek the roots of art, a criticism of the world today that picks up a singer, places dancers, changes his look, paints his hair and gives it a name, thus stifling his talent and natural essence , because as it is exposed in the own film, it is not enough to have only the talent, it is necessary to have something to say. Curiously, the film serves with a critic even Lady Gaga, who is a talented actress but who succumbed to the pop world thus killing its pure essence. ------ SPOILER END ----. Speaking of acting, Lady Caga and Cooper are well in the film, both doing their best performance - Although Lady Caga does not have a career as extensive as an actress - But even so, it is not quite an absolute perfection, but are great performances, especially in the sings, which is sure to give Oscar a nod to the two, deservedly, an indication that Sam Elliot, Jack's brother, will also win, all his appearances are accurate, visceral and sweeping, the actor plays little of the drama, but when it appears, completely steals the scene. Copper adopts a style of filming that almost mixes Lars Von Trier and Yorgos Lanthimos, it gives a lot of freedom to the improvisation of the actors - This even makes a parallel with the meaning of the film, which is the quest for the naturalness of art - this freedom is very good in some scenes, but it generates a problem, in some scenes some actors do not have the proper reaction to their screen mate's improvisation, that leaves the scene strange, but Cooper redeems himself by using closed angles and perfect hand cameras in many scenes, especially in musicals, the director stops using sequences in scenes that call for this technique, but ends up using the sequential plan in other simpler scenes, Cooper rules the first act of the film because it is extremely shortened, which causes a lack of introduction to the universe of the two protagonists. In addition, technically, another highlight of the film is the editing and mixing of sound, are high, accurate, high quality, if you see in a quality cinema will realize that all singing and solos of guitars, does not even bump for a second , which consequently makes me speak of the soundtrack, which is original and is perfect, beautiful, natural, it truly reflects the purity and essence of the long and for sure will be the great favorite category of the best original song of the oscar. Finally, Cooper's first film is not perfect, but it's a punch, he's strong, precise, with a powerful, dramatic, romantic, funny message, a film that stands out in everything and deserves to be seen and reviewed."

"hunter-friesen","9","1","2","12 October 2018"," ""A Star Is Born"" Hits Every Note
","""A Star Is Born"" is one of those classic Hollywood films that has stayed close to each generation that has experienced it. Whether it be the original from 1937 or the remakes in 1954 and 1976, people have adored the timeless story that preaches the value of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity. Now in 2018, the film is being remade for the third time, this time with director, writer, and star Bradley Cooper teaming up with Lady Gaga to tell the classic tale to a modern audience. <br/><br/>The film follows the relationship between music superstar Jackson Maine (Cooper) and aspiring singer Ally (Gaga). They quickly fall for each other after meeting and set out to share their love and music with the world. Because of this, Ally's career starts to take off, while Jackson's begins to crumble beneath his feet as he battles alcoholism and addiction. From this point their lives begin to irreversibly change. They try to hold onto each other, but it becomes more and more difficult as they go down their own separate paths. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is a natural director and it is astonishing that is his debut feature. It probably helps that over the past decade he's had the opportunity to learn from veteran directors like Clint Eastwood and David O. Russell. <br/><br/>Cooper possesses a ton of confidence and a queen eye for great visuals. The concert scenes are the highlight of the film as they bloom with bright colors and original music. It feels like we're right there on stage with the main characters as they profess their love to each other while pouring all their emotions into the songs. <br/><br/>Cooper uses a high amount of close-ups of the character's faces in order to tell the story. He also does well at letting scenes play out in a natural order rather than cutting them up. This creates a feeling of authenticity and rawness as the characters are allowed to feel like real people rather than the fictional stars that have been seen so many times before. <br/><br/>It's well known that Cooper is the director and star, but what's most surprising is that he also contributed to the script along with Eric Roth and Will Fetters.<br/><br/>The dialogue between Cooper and Gaga is some of the most authentic speech you'll find today. Every emotion possible is put on display as their contrasting journeys play out. They always feel like a real couple as they try to manage their relationship and the strain that fame has put on it. <br/><br/>In addition to the main plot, there is also a subplot between Maine and his older brother Bobby, who has acted as Jackson's caretaker all his life. The brothers share a strong bond as they look back on their rough childhoods and re-examine how their relationship has changed over the years. <br/><br/>While the subplot provides a good break from the main story and packs an emotional punch, there just needed to be more of it. The interactions between the brothers are few and far between, and by the end it feels like a lot more could have been explored.<br/><br/>The legacy of ""A Star Is Born"" has been built on great acting from the leads. Cooper and Gaga more than live up to expectations and will surely be compared to the greats that have come before. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper probably gives his career-best performance as the country star fighting his own personal demons. With his lowered voice and grizzled face, Cooper's character is a sad spectacle that exudes sympathy as his journey takes him lower and lower. He also lends his voice to some great music as he and Gaga light up the stage together. <br/><br/>While Cooper is terrific, the show belongs to Lady Gaga as Ally. Even though she's a superstar singer in the real world, Gaga hides all of that behind her transcendental performance as an every girl trying to get ahead. She's the heart of the film as she delivers each line with perfection. Her chemistry with Cooper is second to none as they simultaneously explore the effects that fame has on a person. <br/><br/>Lastly, Sam Elliott also gives a career-best as Bobby. He doesn't get much screen time, but he makes every second count as he plays a character battling his past and the effects it has had on his life. <br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" has everything going for it; great directing, a powerful story, amazing original songs, and two leads who couldn't be closer. It's the best film of the year (so far) and will become an instant classic, one that will be played and remembered by this generation for years to come."

Just because I think maybe I'll never produce something that beautiful. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm looking at it from a very personal point of view, which skews my thoughts on it, but whatever way I look at it, this is a rare movie that only comes around every so often (and yes I know that this is a re-telling of a re-telling etc), but it was so carefully put together that you can see that care and love in every frame and every line of dialogue. <br/><br/>It may not be for everyone, although everyone who I know who's seen it feel as I do, but for the most part, this will be a movie that goes down in celluloid history."

The movie has a good pace and is so well shot including the scenes during the gigs. The story is told in an excellent way, with a dramatic end. The duration is over 2 hours, but could have been more as the movie never fades and keeps you interested the whole time. If you like movies, it's a must see.

","Touching, haunting and disturbing. I guess the filmmakers are pleased when you can't stop thinking about their movie. In the middle of the movie, I was shocked when I realized there is no background music..you know the kind you're not even aware of, to pull you in with the emotion? Just raw dialogue, which I guess that's what they intended, but for me, it would have totally wrapped you deeper into the emotion of the movie, as well as totally connecting more with Ally...if there would have been dramatic music or ?? I don't know how to explain but I think you get it.
Needless to say Bradley Cooper was beyond incredible and Lady Gaga just perfect.
The last scene was brilliantly done and haunted me all night long. Jackson's dog waiting for him was brilliant ....and broke my heart...Walking out of the movie, we kept saying, it's not real it's just a movie they're all ok...."

","Why do we enjoy watching anyone - an athlete, a musician, an actor, a dancer, a circus performer - do something difficult, but yet make it look so easy and joyful? It invigorates us, gives us a jolt and makes us feel euphoric. Perhaps, it tells us that that person has perfected his/her craft through sheer endeavour and cathartically we, and in turn human kind, have scored a victory.<br/><br/>The talent on display in A Star is Born, from the refreshing crafting of a familiar story to every stellar performance, was electrifying. There have been three iterations of this story, starting with the Pygmalion tale in 1937, but somehow first-time director Bradley Cooper has given the laboured story a fresh coat of paint and it is a movie for that informs these times.<br/><br/>The Oscar season is months away, but I will bet my bottom dollar that this gets a slew of nominations, including Best Picture. I had goosebumps rising while watching the plot unfold and this is the first time it happened this year.<br/><br/>One of the movie's pleasures is that it's really about something and of course romance takes centrestage. It also has something to say about the price of fame, the propensity to cultivate talent and how contagious it is. The story of a doomed romance you can see from a mile away, but Cooper and Eric Roth (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump, 1994) somehow managed to retell an old story in a fresh way.<br/><br/>The first thing they did right is in the casting of Lady Gaga. On paper, I didn't think she makes for a wise choice for a streetsmart Ally because of her larger-than-life much malingered persona. I can't remember the last time I actually saw her face with no enhancements and make-up on. In terms of her music, I could only get into her infectious debut The Fame, and none of her subsequent albums registered in my consciousness. Wouldn't a guarded Ally be the anti-thesis of Lady Gaga's rock star persona? But all my misgivings evaporated the moment she hits those power notes. She is the mother lode, she is the real deal. All the singing in the movie was done live, to the camera and scoring Lady Gaga is the first major coup.<br/><br/>The story of how one star gradually goes supernova, while another fades into oblivion is a story as old as romance. The way to make the dots and lines disappear is to make the characters relatable and believable. Bradley Cooper, going the way of Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart, turns in an outstanding performance. His voice is a couple of octaves lower than his usual roles and seeing him in a constant inebriated state and yet having the acumen to see talent is quite something to behold. You can almost pinpoint the moment he begins to love Ally, and of course their onscreen chemistry is electrifying. And when I say ""love"", I don't mean Hollywood's version of wanting to get into each other's pants as fast as possible. His journey from admiration to love for Ally is immensely moving.<br/><br/>Cooper's choice of close-up shots and handheld cinematography gives the story a sense of realism. How the camera weaves around the actors on a rock concert stage gives me an adrenaline-charged view of what actually happens on stage while the audience is cheering.<br/><br/>Above all else, what actually did it for me is how the devastating love story never becomes manipulative. Although the music and songs direct and reflect the feelings of the characters, it never cheapens the narrative by being overly sentimental.<br/><br/>A sad sense of inevitability pervades and the movie does get a bit exhausting after the charm of the sensational start wears off. But heck... I think it is meant to be exhausting. How else can one see Maine's star wane and Ally's get meteoric?<br/><br/>A Star is Born's blend of romantic tragedy and emotional delimma is presented with compelling conviction and honesty. It ends with a sort of honey-trap but by then I was a goner and with a definitive final shot the movie earned its namesake, A Star is Born."

","While the storyline is similar to that of many romantic stories, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I love the connection between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's roles. Their voices sound amazing together and the songs evoked an honest, emotional response. The song at the very end had me sobbing but only because the events of the storyline had made me feel apart of their lives. Great movie over all. I hope they both win an award for their parts in the remake of this movie."

","Trying to write this without spoilers but checked the box to be safe. Did anyone else (fellow recovering alcoholics maybe) feel like we skipped around some crucial elements of his addiction, and that the ending was a rushed scene that skipped some logical steps, in order to stay true to the original? This was my first time seeing it (it's been remade 3 other times!) but I was left with a lot of questions as why it was ""the only way."" It didn't feel as genuine as the rest of the film which felt raw and real. I was surprised that Cooper would leave so many dots unconnected, since he has firsthand knowledge of this subject. I didn't need a big message here, just a stronger foundation for what ultimately happened to have made sense. That aside, songs were great, acting was great, and while it could've been about 20 minutes shorter, it wasn't still without its edge of your seat moments, and a sadness that frankly stays with you for days. Also, put a sad dog in anything for three seconds and I will lose it completely."

Sam Elliot says in the movie: not an exact quote but to the effect of ""12 notes, a story played over and over only in different Octaves by different songwriters as they see it,""
 Well that was for me the whole heart of the movie. The story of drug, alchohol abuse, suicide, and love, told throughout Modern history, how it is told over and over(by those affected) only between different families in different circumstances through this modern age. If you were close to someone who committed suicide or fell to drug, alchohol abuse, this movie will mirror some of those exact experiences, right down to the conversations or thoughts you may have had if your life was touched by such things. If so you need to be in an extremely strong place to be able to watch this. Over 40% of the people(including men) were wiping away tears and some even weeping."

","So many reviews dwell on the fact this film is a re-make. I have seen two of the previous, the best being the Streisand version that I disliked because of Kristofferson poor performance.The overall story line is the ONLY thing in common with the the previous versions and for this reason, it stands alone because it so so well done in every aspect.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is amazing as an actor, musician, singer AND director; WOW! It's hard to believe that he performed all the musical parts of the film LIVE as did Gaga who proved herself to be THE bonafide Diva of her generation of singers. The performances were expertly captured by incredible cinematic work that made it certain that there was nothing faked in this movie. The acting by Gaga and Cooper were superb; real, believable and touching.
Clearly this is a movie worthy of awards in many of its aspects. The music was fantastic, who wrote these musical gems? Gaga and Cooper could go on tour tomorrow and be successful as a singing duo.<br/><br/>This movie marks the making of two stars, Gaga and Cooper; Gaga for singing and acting and Cooper for singing and directing!"

You know I had a rough night yesterday and you have just gone and booked me into watch some Movie with you and Dad from out of nowhwere?

So I Said to mom ""No, I stay home and Take it easy today"" (Without even knowing what Movie it was).

So I was like, Which Movie is it? Mom replied ""A star is Born"". Here is the fun thing, just Right before My mom came and Waked me up. I was laying half asleeped in bed and thinking about if the Movie ""A star is born"" would be worth to see and maybe I would actually Take some time later that day to see it. So after some thinking, I choosed to join them. And I can Say that this movie I called ""some movie"" before, wasn't just ""some movie"". This movie is one of few that actually had made me emotional on a new different level( and Im not just talking about crying, it was so much more) and let out some tears.

This movie, the 4th version of it, now officially belongs to Cooper and to Gaga, and to the ages. A phenomenal telling of the quintessential Hollywood story with a soundtrack that is unbelievable. Stay for the credits and shake your head at the sheer number of songs written and performed by Cooper and Gaga. I wasn't using a metaphor when I proclaimed Cooper a rock star! And he directed the damn film as well! First-time director? He must have had a hell of a crew to turn this out. Plus screenplay, music, producing, and performance? BRA-VO BRAD-LEY!<br/><br/>Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known professionally as Lady Gaga, has some acting chops, too. No question she was going to do a great job with the singing, I remember her national anthem performance as spectacularly moving, but she nailed her character straight up. Sometimes so subdued you might think she was waiting for her next song, sometimes so wonderfully over the top you KNEW Ally was going to be a star, but Gaga never missed a beat, never made me think she was just playing herself, never once made me cringe -- and that's about the highest compliment I can pay an actor. GO-GO GA-GA!<br/><br/>I cried a couple of times during this movie, I laughed more than once, I felt something throughout, and that's my definition of a good movie.

That the he wouldn't wear the hearing aids because he wanted to be ""out there"" with the audience and not in his own head? That he was clinging for life to the sliver of hope that was someone who saw and loved him, and he let go when someone convinced him that trying to build up the first level of his Maslow's hierarchy of needs was codependent and toxic? <br/><br/>It's a very effective love letter to human suffering.

Gaga and Cooper's chemistry is unmatchable against any film released for a very long time.

","Bradley's first Directorial debut & Gaga's first major lead actress debut.. there couldn't have been a better pair for the impeccable chemistry these two hard working artists gave us. 
They absolutely nailed it musically. Bradley taking voice lessons was a major plus, he worked hard and took the time to learn how to play instruments.. learning the stage management, and the overall process of being a musician..for them just working together, helping each other.. on acting and being a musician for each other honestly showed. Performing each song live on the spot to film, takes more than we think with most films who just lip sync each scene.. it felt so raw, and vulnerable watching them perform every single time. <br/><br/>Their acting was purely beautiful..once again, their chemistry played so well off of one another... I felt like I really knew them without knowing anything of the original story.. for them to strip down each other, and to know every single thing about one another really showed. On and off camera as Jack and Ally doing a scene, or Bradley and Stefani in a interview... they genuinely had this beautifully authentic, kind shared soul.. between the two of them...They really knew each other..and it completely showed in the film...you could see it in the eyes of each character.. It was a certain kind of love like I've never seen in the eyes of an actor before.<br/><br/>The cast and crew of this film really outdid themselves..it had beautiful shots, the crew nailed the live recordings, the location scouts for specific scenes like using Stage Coach, Coachella, SNL, etc.. really sold the feeling and the energy of the scenes.. the supporting cast gave lovable characters on screen as well really connecting it all together..the writers connecting the audience so well with the story was very crucial and was written perfectly.. to understand the hardships and ups and downs a human being can experience was so realistic and so relatable, it's honestly scary. It was all created by the outstanding job that Bradley pulled off as the director.. you could see that there was clear, direct vision for every single scene from start to finish. <br/><br/>Overall I'm completely blown away by the beauty of this retold story. Just knowing and being there throughout the time and the process of the entire project really makes me appreciate it more than I thought I ever could. <br/><br/>I'm completely proud of my Lady for coming this far into a 10 year career. Sticking by her side for this long has paid off in so many ways I could ever explain.. Everyone who knows me, knows I have a very large Heart for her... seeing her on the big screen surpassing my expectations really means the world to me. Coming this far so quick in her career is something many musicians aren't able to do.. job well done..and here's a standing ovation for you, because you completely deserve nothing but happiness for all you've conquered. Thank you so much for giving us the true essence of what it means to be a legendary artist of our lifetime. -Alex Wilson"

Gaga takes the stage and boom, it becomes a Gaga concert, which I thoroughly enjoy but does not serve the story. The love story was drawn out, as was the conflicts after married life, and I fell asleep before the finale. Also, I was deeply distracted by the fact that Cooper cannot really play the guitar and it was very obvious that camera angles try to hide this fact.

She puts al the other female singers who sing through their nose to shame. I had never before seen Bradley Cooper and have been a fan of Sam Elliott fan for a long time. I did not know what to expect from Lady Ga Ga and was plesantly surprised. I was also surprised when I found out how pretty she was without all the tattoos, and gaudy make-up and wigs. I am also sorry to read of her constant medical pain; I am also a big fan of Barbara Streisand but did not go see that movie because Kris Kristoferson was in it.

"Lateksis","5","2","7","30 October 2018"," A disappointment on the drama department
","As a foreword, I went to see this movie in a theatre when my girlfriend asked me to go with her. At the time this film had a IMDB score of 8.4 and the internet was full of overly positive reviews and praises. so I naturally had high expectations. I also had no idea that there are several older versions of this movie, so this review is based solely on my experience of this particular film.<br/><br/>I have to admit, the first ~1,5 hours of the movie were a big disappointment. It felt like watching a self-insertion fanfic of a 16-year-old girl who dreams of a famous and rich man just suddenly appearing into her life, giving her his full attention and basically donating his musical career to her - all the while her character presentation gives me no reason to believe this course of events or even root for the protagonist. The only ""flaw"" that Ally seems to have is her ""weak"" self-confidence in the beginning of the movie, which is conveniently fixed when Jack - after knowing her for about 12 hours - sends a guy to stalk her until she finally agrees to come to the concert where they perform the song she invented last night. As the last song of Jack's gig. In perfect harmony. And everyone in the audience instantly and utterly loves her more than the person they actually came to see. It could be possible, yes, but for me it really killed the willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Instead of establishing solid backstories or personalities for the characters, the movie seems to focus on the fact how ""perfect"" Ally is, and how much Jack seems to love her. The thing that bugged me the most was how she actually never seems to do anything on herself. After being pampered for a while by Jack's crew, she is taken in by Rez who makes her into a big Grammy-winning star. The theme of staying true to oneself is mentioned a couple of times by Jack, but it is never explored further or used as a motivation for any of the characters. In the end Jack just randomly kills himself, and with no true character development Ally just seems like a flat sell-out. Even the last song that she sings was written by her husband, not her. I actually have to admit that in the bathtub scene where the couple is arguing, I agreed more with Jack because he seemed to have even a little personality compared to Ally.<br/><br/>The storyline itself seems to have potential. Jack's drug abuse, the tension from him losing his career to Ally, or Ally losing her own musical expression and becoming a tool for the industry are some of the things that the movie could try (and tries) to derive drama from. It's a shame that these themes are diminished by the flat characters, occasionally corny dialogue and some weird scenes (i.e. the wedding scene was surprisingly unemotional and out of place). This makes the whole experience disappointingly shallow. The subplot between Jack and his brother was the most interesting thing in the movie, and it actually had some good moments in the delivery of lines.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie isn't terrible. The acting is solid, Lady Gaga is a good singer and the drama actually gets a little better on the second half of the movie. The songs aren't really something I'm into, but I respect the talent that went into making them. Maybe it's the hype backslash that got to me somewhat, maybe it's the fact that I was feeling a little sick while watching the movie, but I just found the whole thing just too soulless, shallow and boring to be an ""instant classic"" like many people seem to think.<br/><br/>If you try to breathe new life into a very old and overly used plot, you should actually bring something more to the table. Not less."

","In the beginning of the film the chemical love between Brad and Gaga pops of the screen. But from the moment Gaga steps into The Star it's like you watch the summary of too much material of filming or ten episodes of a soap drama serie. Very fast timelapses and shortened scenery seem to hide something maybe just by using only the good stuff of acting. A pity because the story deserves better."

","After all of the hype about this film and Gaga getting nominations, I thought that I would give it a chance...why not? I'll never trust me again. First off the film overall was too boring and one dimensional. It could have easily ran on the Lifetime Network and had spared many people the boredom of watching it in a theater. Don't get me wrong, Cooper's acting was pretty convincing, but his character lacked any real similarities to any musician I've ever known. Being a musician myself his character in this film simply made no sense. Why would any self respecting musician start up any kind of a relationship with a song and dance vacuous pop star and become engulfed in HER career? And then completely spiral out of control to the point of taking his own life? I mean her manager tells him that she would be better off without him and he decides to die???? REALLY??? Wasn't buying any of it. From an acting standpoint Cooper shined, and Gaga wasn't as horrid as I thought she'd be (quite photogenic as well) But this movie of course played to the whole ""man is weak and pitiful and the woman is powerful and strong"" formula which is just as tiring as it was 20 years ago. The characters could and should have been more fleshed out and believable. Had that been the case this movie would have been more tolerable. But instead it was nothing new, just the same old drivel with too many feminist hollywood stereotypes that would have played better on cable tv."

Cooper was so convincing as a music star and Lady Gaga is an incredible actress.

Drama is not convincing and I did not even shed a single tear :) And here is someone who cried a river watching Titanic. The movie drops the ball in the second half and generally the pace is very uneven. The story is so predictable and almost everything is a cliche.

On her journey from obscurity working the club scene, and a part time job to pay the bills, she is presented with an opportunity to tell us a story which will drag you furiously through every emotion in 2hours. A Star is Born is a thought provoking, positive, feel good, and at points; eye opening, film which will last for decades. This film has a fantastic cast and a wonderful story.

","I suppose if you live on the moon or are one of those people who's never seen a movie from a previous decade, ""A Star Is Born"" might seem like something special. But for the rest of us, who've had at least three chances to experience this story in the past, the newest version is a pedestrian retread.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, except that it was something more than I got given the ravenous audience response to this movie. Everyone is going gaga for Gaga, the Lady that is, and she's pretty good, but I think the praise she's getting is driven more by surprise that she might actually be able to act and less by her actual performance. Cooper is decent too, and they both do have tremendous chemistry, I'll grant them that. The first half hour or so of the film, and especially the scene where Cooper and Gaga perform together for the first time, does promise to be special, and if the whole movie had been like that I could understand the film's reception. But midway through the movie it settles into a dull routine, and the ending, which clearly thought it was going to move me to tears, made me feel nothing at all.<br/><br/>In a culture clamoring for more stories about women, and with a female personality as out of the box as lady Gaga to work with, I don't know why this movie decided to be about a white man and his -- let's face it -- not very interesting demons. Ok, so I know why -- Bradley Cooper starred and directed. But how much more interesting the film would have been, and what a greater departure from its previous incarnations, if it had instead been about Gaga's character and her own struggles with stardom. But no -- her working class broad makes the leap to international sensation seemingly without a hitch, and any nuance her character might have had, like some initial worries about losing herself and being true to her art, are quickly ditched by the screenplay so that we can instead focus on Cooper's moping. What we're left with is a dude who's sad because his best years are behind him and a lady who's sad because's he's mean to her in a bathroom once and embarrasses her at the Grammys. Well, let her Grammy be her consolation, and remind me why I'm supposed to care about any of this.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

"plpregent","7","1","3","15 October 2019"," Amazing chemistry between both leads
","There is a lot to like about this film, and it translated quite clearly into its worldwide success at the box office and overall popularity. You've got two big stars as the leads playing well-written characters and generating an impressive on-screen chemistry. On one hand, you've got the acting debut of one of these stars, Lady Gaga, and, on the other hand, the directional debut of the other star, Bradley Cooper. And they both impress in these respective debuts.<br/><br/>During its first half, ""A Star is Born"" is a feel good movie. It tells the (very unlikely) story of a well-known musician, Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) who falls in love with a super talented yet struggling and unknown singer, Ally, and takes her under his wing, catapulting her into superstardom. As her career takes off, the relationship between the two of them faces a number of challenges, including Maine's alcoholism. If this sounds like a familiar story or film title, here's why: movies with that same title and storyline were released in 1937,1954 and 1976, respectively. So for those who feel like Hollywood struggles to renew itself and come up with new ideas lately, this will not rock your world with its originality. This is somewhat standard Oscar material in many regards, and especially in its delivery of emotion. It's got a big bulky buildup filled with positivity in its first half, only to then go down in a classic (and quite predictable) tragic path in the latter half. Yes, you can definitely expect half of the audience to shed tears as the credits roll.<br/><br/>That being said, ""A Star is Born"" is highly successful at generating emotions, albeit relatively uncomplicated ones, and the magic operates through the film's main qualities, which are honestly pretty outstanding: the chemistry between both leads, and very well-written characters and dialogue. Both Lady Gaga's and Bradley Cooper's performances are absolutely fantastic and the chemistry between both characters is beyond tangible. It is beautiful to watch, actually. The cast is great, and that brief appearance from Dave Chappelle was a pure delight too.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper's directional debut is very promising, to say the least, as those concert scenes truly made you feel like you were on stage with a rock band, with blinding projectors partly blurring glimpses of a cheering crowd of thousands of people, giving the audience a nice sample of a surreal feeling that only a handful of major on-stage performers get to experience in their lifetime. Hats off to Cooper and to the whole crew for a visually gorgeous picture. The musical performances are also excellent.<br/><br/>With regard to the script, while the dialogue is outstanding and (thankfully) does not shy away from including a surprising amount of F bombs, the tragic denouement, to me, didn't get a proper development to warrant an event of this significance/dramatic impact. In contrast with the first two thirds of the film, which takes a somewhat lengthy approach at detailing the different stages of a relationship and the psychological evolution of the characters, this seemed like an abrupt turn of events resulting from a shortcut in the psychology of an otherwise beautifully-written character.<br/><br/>Regardless of this, ""A Star is Born"" is worth watching for the chemistry between both leads alone."
"jamie_ninja","10","1","3","13 October 2019"," A Star Is Born Is Absolutely Phenomenal!!
","Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born, is quite simply, one of the best films ever made and in my opinion, the best film of 2018 and the rightful winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture (but the film sadly lost out in this category to The Green Book, which is another extraordinary film). I have watched this film a grand total of 9 times since it was released 12 months ago in October 2018 and my opinion on the film has remained unchanged; Bradley Cooper's directorial debut has given us a film that explores deep, complex and heart-felt themes such as addiction, coming to terms with stardom, ""selling-out"" in the music industry and feelings of being a burden to one's loved ones, in such a masterful and poignant fashion. This film is an extremely well-acted piece of drama, with the acting highlight coming in the form of Sam Elliot's portrayal of the character of Bobby Maine, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film's soundtrack is also a revelation and the chemistry between the film's two co-leads, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, is very strong, deep and realistic, so-much-so that as the viewer, you are drawn into the characters' worlds in a way that makes you can't help but care for them. This film is an extremely well-acted, well-directed passion project about what it means to be a struggling star in a modern and fast-moving music industry, where those who are considered ""has beens"" are left behind and those who want to make it have to look and perform in a certain way, in order to be successful. I truly believe that this film will become a prime example of the retelling of a classic Hollywood love story done right, in the not-so-distant future and I believe that it is an absolute must-watch for all film and music fans in general."

This is pure Hollywood telling everyone how amazing Hollywood and fame is, while glorifying alcoholism, violence and self destruction.<br/><br/>But above all that, this movie is BORING! I've honestly felt zero interest in the characters. The dialogue was pointless and banal. Every scene felt like scenes from millions of other movies.

For about 15 mins they share an evening in a bar and gas station and make it seem like they have some kind of strong bond which seems highly unbelievable.<br/><br/>After this night Bradley gives her 5 mins on the big stage, which made her a star. 5 minutes later into the movie they go from being a happy couple to Lady Gaga being the most popular artist and Bradley being some kind of drunken mess she has to take care for 24/7.<br/><br/>From this point on (about 30 mins into the movie), you have to go through 90 minutes of Bradley Cooper being drunk and given no dialogue at all. This must have been the longest 90 minutes i have ever had to sit out. The last part was predictable, but played out unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Bradley had to perform on stage with Lady Gaga, I'm not sure why he wasn't escorted like they were in the rest of the movie. He was supposed to drive to the stage by himself but wasn't able to because he was drunk. Feeling like a liability, he decides to hang himself. Lady Gaga finds sings the last heartbreaking song, they show a few throwbacks of Bradley singing this song for her and that's it.<br/><br/>A few things I did like in the movie: Lady Gaga actually used to come from a modest family, her family had Italian roots, it's all in the movie. For me, this did make me believe her story more. The film also touches the subject of 'being yourself or being something the big audience wants you to be'. This wrote in Lady Gaga perfectly.
Bradley Cooper had nothing to play with, but nothing felt staged when he acted drunk. It's something.<br/><br/>TLDR: Slow-paced, predictable movie. Highly recommend if you're a Lady Gaga fan. Wouldn't watch it if you're here for a good storyline or dialogue."

Making it one of the greatest movies of the year, contending for more of six academy awards, winning ""Best Original Song"" for ""Shallow"", which would become the most awarded song in history of music.<br/><br/>The movie shows-off great emotional engaging scenes and performances from a powerful cast and production team, giving a powerful plot about love and fame, within the modern era, with a heartbreaking and moving lesson to give. Overall the movie is a fresh take on romance stories, maybe falling in clichÃ©s sometimes, but powerful enough to impact you emotionally, and resonate through the rest of cinematic history."

"Amthermandes","7","1","3","28 February 2019"," It's good, but a bit pretentious and unrealistic
","Here is an emotional tale about a well established, and internally troubled musician who falls instantly in love with a talented woman, and takes her under his wing. What stands out the most are the performances by both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, both of whom work together like Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. And despite the story being about two people in a professional position the vast majority of hopefuls could only dream of, their relationships and struggles are relatable, and captivating. And while I'm not a fan of Gaga's usual musical style, I personally found myself really enjoying the music. And wow, you'd think Cooper and Gaga have been lovers since before both their careers even began.<br/><br/>But there is NO WAY Gaga's character would have had that vocal range and stage presentation that early. Lady Gaga is a heavily practiced and trained performer, and her character was someone who was just used to small audiences in a familiar setting. To suddenly start performing at the level of Gaga herself from the get-go, is a little ridiculous. The story is a bit cliche and predictable, and Cooper was definitely coming off a bit ""rapey"" at the beginning. If he wasn't such a stud, more people probably would have been put off by his character early on (I mean imagine during the scenes at the club, where he first meets her, replacing Bradley Cooper with Michael Emerson or Andy Serkis. SERIOUS creepy vibes). It also seemed as if they wrote the film with the intention of making it into the Oscars (a modern age problem, an Oscar award should be just that: an award. Not the main goal).<br/><br/>Still, I was hesitant on watching it in the first place (honestly, only reasons I ended up willingly watching it, was because I love Bradley Cooper, and I used it in an act of compromise with my wife to get her to watch a horror movie with me), and I'm glad I did. Good movie, worth checking out."

Something that brings you along and makes you feel something you know you have been missing. A story that takes you through all the twists and turns leaving you realizing how beautiful love, music, and life truly is. From the moment the movie starts to the last note of the film. You are taken into a landscape of beauty and are even shown the complexities of the career, relationship, and heart of an artist. This is a must see film and easily one of my top 10 films of all time. Stephanie (Lady Gaga) and Bradley Cooper shine so bright it bursts your heart into a million little pieces. Each moment of acting and singing drives the film to it's inevitable conclusion leaving you to want to start the film again.

They take you on tour, make you feel their music and its actually real music, real voices. Ive watched the movie several times and i got goosebumps...every time.
Gaga could have easily done a poor job being the character's story so similar to hers in real life; but shes great, she's genuine, and the chemistry with brad just flows.
Maybe i would have liked to see more of Ally in her process of becoming a star, but i guess by the end you get a feeling that her career is just beggining, and Jackson was part of the road to a greater destination. He's her first step and she's his last breath.
They meet at an intersection, where she gets directions and finds her way, but hes already 'too far gone'."

The acting was also excellent, which is surprising considering Lady Gaga has spent a career making music, so another WELL DONE!<br/><br/>Weak point: The pacing. Mind you, I rated this movie 8/10, so I didn't see it as a failure, but the pacing is uneven. The beginning meet between the couple is done well, but takes some time, and to be able to maintain putting that much into different parts of the couple's relationship would have turned the movie into a 2.5 hour production, which I would have liked better, but I don't mind long movies when done well. What happens is some of the dialog that comes out doesn't seem like there's much backstory for it. So towards the end, the movie gives a snippet of a timestamp in the relationship, then another, then another, and is too rushed. I would have liked those snippets to be a little longer so it didn't feel kind of choppy at the end. It was a good enough storyline to add the additional 15 minutes."

The tape manages to reflect in a natural way a sincere love and without condition that not always manages to overcome any obstacle. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is the best and when they are separated loses a bit of rhythm in the story but still understand why this happens, their performances are excellent highlighting especially Lady Gaga who captures her love very well, her delivery and suffering giving reasons to believe in his acting skills, the work of Bradley Cooper in the leadership is outstanding and shows the great potential it has. To Finish A star is born is a film that manages to connect with the public due to the connection of its characters, being totally emotional and real with a raw look towards fame that could be explored in a deeper way but still not It prevents it from being a big tape."

Bradley Cooper is better than Kris Kristofferson. Sam Elliot is preferable to Gary Busey. And as talented as Lady Gaga might be, face it, she is no Barbra Streisand. I wasn't sure what the whole stupid nose discussion was about. Many rock stars have huge snouts. Was this a swipe at Streisand? I did prefer the drama in the 1976 film.

","A Star is Born is all kinds of special, it truly captures the love story that film revolves on, it just hits all the right spots, from the amazing music to the unbelievable acting to the great directing, it offers a lot of things at once and the best thing about it is that they all say one thing and that's there is incredible.
And now for what I think was the centerpiece of this film, Lady Gaga just wows, it is incredible to see her perform like this in her first serious role and her first ever lead, she delivered a heartwrenching performance that captured her own real-life persona, in other words, she played herself in a way, it felt natural and seamless and effortless and in my opinion she really outperformed Bradley Cooper, which brings me to his role which he excelled at playing as he incorporates his vision as a director into the character that he played, you can actually feel that he's in command of his performance as he knows exactly what to do to complement Gaga's performance, one thing that really made it what it is, is the chemistry between the two leads, their love story is charismatic and charming and I really enjoyed watching that unfold.<br/><br/>Cooper does a really good job of framing this film in the right way, you can see that he carefully picks his scenes and just let the leads draw the scene and I felt like that worked perfectly.<br/><br/>A Star is Born is a dreamy downright exhilarating film that leaves with a timeless good impression, it's just magical to watch."

","It's pretty difficult to watch this film from an objective standpoint with the amount praise surrounding it. Gaga's performance was believable showing sides of vulnerability, which was quite endearing. Cooper also jungled the directorial and acting roles quite well.<br/><br/>Having no knowledge of the previous versions, I found this to be a little unevenly paced though. The fast paced rise of Gaga's career and the development of their relationship happened seemed a little rushed. Then to have a montage of shots thereafter, felt a bit like a musical video clip. Perhaps this was intentionally done, to emulate the elation of an initial relationship; and ebbs and flows that go along with it thereafter?<br/><br/>On the whole, I can see why many would love this film and the soundtrack will have many a sale as a result. This undeniably a success for Bradley Cooper (& Lady Gaga), despite any wavering opinions."

The sound mix and edit, the color corrections, the cinematography are all top notch, and of course Cooper's direction is all over the place (positively taken).<br/><br/>The weak spot of the production is its script. It is not a bad one for sure, but it is an ""unstrong"" one. Especially, for the last 40 minutes is all over the place (negatively taken), with it being rushed for the grand finale.<br/><br/>I totally recommend this one to any cinefil out there and I truly hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did, if not more!"
"dan_b_grimsey","7","1","3","3 January 2019"," Is this actually how pop music works in 2018? I'm not sure it is.
","Let's get all the good stuff out of the way. Yes, Lady Gaga is a revelation. And yes, Bradley Cooper does shred his guitar, quite well. And yes, heart strings are indeed pulled, in a masterly fashion.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>There's a nagging question that followed me all the way through ""A Star Is Born.""<br/><br/>Does Bradley Cooper, or anyone working on ""A Star Is Born"" - a movie all about the music/celebrity/fame industry - actually understand how the music/celebrity/fame industry actually works in 2018?<br/><br/>You'd assume that he/they do, since Bradley is a celebrity, and Lady Gaga has released one and half albums about the very subject of fame (""The Fame"" plus the ""Fame Monster"" EP); but on the other hand there are so many that-doesn't-quite-feel-right aspects about ""A Star Is Born"" that is really makes you wonder.<br/><br/>A lot of this is the managers fault. We know we are supposed to hate the manager because... he doesn't wear socks? Or he wears very, very short socks?<br/><br/>But regardless of his sock-wearing habits he does seem to be utterly clueless at how pop music works in 2018.<br/><br/>Let me get this right? You sign Ally after she becomes Internet-famous for singing a self-penned power ballad with an aging has-been country-rock-star. And you've heard a couple of her other songs, and they are all very power-ballady as well. So why do you think it's a good idea to market her as a dance troupe fronting pop diva of songs about butts?<br/><br/>Now I'm not dissing dance troupe front pop divas of songs about butts. Some of my favourite songs are by dance troupe fronting pop divas of songs about butts. But in a world full of Adeles, Lordes and Lana Del Reys - all of whom have managed to avoid that sort of thing, whilst remaining both pretty amazing and very successful - why does this seem like a good career move to you?<br/><br/>Then there's that weird insistence that having Jackson urinate on himself at the Grammys would destroy Ally's career, which - whilst no doubt embarrassing for all involved - would clearly not be the case. Do these people not understand how memes work?<br/><br/>Whilst it's never quite clear just how big Ally is - outside of the original YouTube video, no-one seems to talk about chart positions or first-day streaming figures, which in itself seems a bit weird - we can assume that prior to the Grammys she hadn't quite hit household name status yet. Well, having your husband urinate on stage in front of a global audience will solve that problem for you. I mean, as famous as Kanye and Taylor already were prior to the VMAs, their fame quotient probably doubled afterwards. And it's probably fair to say that the impact of Urin-gate would be far greater.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that Ally wouldn't have been humiliated, and actually that's another issue: where was the scene where she broke down crying after reading all the mean tweets? And then got cheered up by a Buzzfeed listicle of ""10 Reasons Why Ally's Handling Of Urin-gate Is An Inspiration To Us All""?
Actually, come to think of it, does Ally even have a Twitter account? Does she even tweet? We are never told, and again - in 2018, for an up-and-coming pop star - that seems a little odd.<br/><br/>For a movie all about fame, it sometimes behaves as though the media/social media, and hell, even fame itself barely even exits. And we know that Lady Gaga for one, is hyper-aware that it does."

Their acting is convincing all the way through Ally rising in her career and Jackson sinking deep in alcoholism.<br/><br/>Again, I'm no music fan and I'm in no position to judge how good those songs are in their own right. But the songs do make this film work because they literally serve as a medium of communication between Jackson and Ally. I'm even tempted to add them to my music library filled with movie soundtracks.<br/><br/>I won't judge this film in comparison to earlier versions of ""A Star Is Born"" because I haven't watched them. But this version was good enough to convince me to watch the earlier ones too."

"nickdnk","9","1","3","30 December 2018"," Very good
","This is a good story. If you haven't watched the original and don't know what happens, it also is surprising and very emotional.<br/><br/>I was not a big fan of the direction. I thought some scenes were oddly out of place and actually distracted me a little bit. However:<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is absolutely amazing in this. Rarely does talent of her scale come along. The big problem with original stories about musicians is usually that the music sucks - otherwise, why not just release the music? I'm looking at you, Rockstar (2001). Not so in this case. There are some nothing short of stunning songs and vocal performances to be experienced in this movie, albeit with a distinctive Lady Gaga-feel to them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. She will at the very least receive an Oscar nomination for best original song for either Shallow or Always Remember Us This Way.<br/><br/>Cooper did good, and I was surprised to find out that the vocals are actually his and are actually recorded live. Usually this would be dubbed afterwards, possibly by a whole other person, but as I understand Gaga would not allow this, which resulted in some very convincing shots of their live performances together.<br/><br/>And:
If you give this movie 1 star you're obviously a moron. The 1-10 scale is not meant to be used as a binary, so if you didn't like it, argue why and give it a 5-6-7 or something reasonable."

","I went to go see this movie with my mother the day it came out. I had not seen any other ""A Star is Born"" films. So I didn't have anything to compare it to. I'm my opinion that is an advantage on my end because I could really appreciate the plot and the way their love story unfolded. From the very first scene to the very last in my opinion it is perfection. I truly fell in love with Jackson Maine and then fell even more in love with Ally and then fell even MORE in love with their love story. That's a lot of love I know but I assure you that you will feel the same. Bradley Coopers acting is always phenomenal and I think he should've received an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook and American Sniper. If he doesn't get an Oscar for this he is going to be the next Leo DiCaprio (always getting snubbed at the Oscars). He should receive an Oscar for his acting and his directing. And then there is Lady Gaga... I mean she seriously captivated the whole audience with her voice and her acting. I loved her in American Horror Story and knew she could act but seeing this side of her made me fall in love with the person she is. She can be misunderstood by people at times but from watching all of this you will find a new found respect for her. You will cry in this movie, and I'm not talking about your eyes watering up, I was full blown hysterically crying. But it wasn't just me, the whole audience was this way. Even the men that were in there were crying. A movie that has an impact like this one did on so many people deserves an Oscar completely. You will leave the theatre just wanting to talk and engage with others because it is just that good. Hands down best love story I've seen since The Notebook. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie! You won't regret it one bit!"

A very predictable and old school story line that works very well with the plot in this case, given the film's background and history, but also one that is powered by great acting.

"darrelldunn-25664","4","1","3","22 November 2018"," Keep at it, Mr. Cooper
","I felt the need to write my first IMDB review after waiting through months of build-up to watch this movie. I can't understand the ratings in here. Mr. Cooper's first attempt at filmmaking seems just like that - a first attempt. He's a talented artist so hopefully he'll come into his own with filmmaking one day but this was miles from brilliant, in my opinion. I wanted to love the movie so much. Gaga's acting seemed amateurish, as well. It wasn't as painful as the 70's version of this saga but I do not get the level of praise for this effort. Maybe I need to go far back to Judy Garland to plug into what magic ""A Star Is Born"" may ever have existed."
"NTass","7","1","3","17 November 2018"," A+ for acting... the premise, not so much.
","I want to start by saying that Bradley Cooper was amazing as usual. He played the character to a T. Lady Gaga was better than I ever could have imagined. I was a huge fan of her prior to this movie, and left the theater an even bigger one. The music was great, and I definitely recommend buying the soundtrack.<br/><br/>That being said, I didn't get into the love story like many (almost all) others did. Bradley's character was a mess from the beginning. He wasn't just a casual drunk when he met Lady Gaga's character. He was a literal fall down drunk. I love love. Romantic comedies, or romances in general, are some of my favorite movies to watch. I even like to watch people go through personal struggles in relationships which ultimately lead to the strengthening of the lead couple's bond.<br/><br/>However, as much as Jackson loved and adored Ally (he truly did), I couldn't help but think that I would never wish this relationship on anyone. We were given several scenes of how passionate their affair was - we can all hope for a romance as passionate as theirs - but the passion didn't justify the constant struggle Ally had to go through from the second they met until the very end. I hate thinking that people may feel that having a tortured love affair is what's needed to have passion with someone. You can have passion and stability.<br/><br/>It was also much longer than needed. There were two or three too many scenes of Jackson drunk than were needed.<br/><br/>I know I must sound crazy, but the above is my honest opinion of the premise of the movie. I still gave it a 7, though. And for people who can look past the issues that bothered me, you're going to love this. It is an A-list movie and one that I feel should garner some awards for both Gaga and Cooper. See it on the big screen. It made Cooper's and Gaga's musical performances all that much better."

Can't wait to see what this multi-talented producer/director/singer/songwriter (played all 4 roles in this movie!) does next! As for Gaga, she deserves all that loving adoration she gets from her multi-talented co-star. Incredible how she manages to come across with zero victimhood in what could have easily become maudlin with less sensitive handling. A tour de force performance!"

","Being a huge fan of the original masterpiece and it's music, they should have not called this by the same name. I do not want to bash the effort, but we were very very disappointed. If Gaga and Cooper were unknown and this was their first film.... it would gone straight to DVD. Gaga can sing like mad, she is an amazing vocalist (one of the best) and I'm sure her fans all gave her movie a high rating for her singing, but honestly these fans do not know anything about acting. When we watch a movie - - and we've probably seen 7000 or more in our lifetime - - when you stop and notice the person is acting, forget it. We did that throughout this moive - not beleivable.<br/><br/>And Cooper with his low fake gruff voice, so distracting and irritating. They should have cast Gary Busey if they wanted a growly voice.. lol.
The original was a masterpiece in acting and song and will long outlive this attempt at a remake. The original script was leagues ahead of this movie and its time.<br/><br/>Again, they should have changed the title and I would have maybe given this movie a 5. But as a remake a 3 is more than generous. No way should this movie be rated an 8,, NO WAY (unless you are a monster)"

"CineMuseFilms","9","1","3","29 October 2018"," a modern classic of musical entertainment
","A universal trope that reappears in various cultural forms is drawn from the Ancient Greek mythology of a sculptor called Pygmalion. After falling in love with one of his statues he was granted a wish that she come to life and love him in return. In its modern form, the story is usually based on a successful male who nurtures the potential of a rising female and is rewarded with love. The unbroken lineage of this narrative can be seen in its latest and most spectacular version of A Star is Born (2018), updated with themes of substance abuse, mental illness, and the fickle perils of celebrity.<br/><br/>Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is a famous country music singer who regularly binges on drugs and booze. The film's opening scenes define the man: he holds a packed concert hall in the palm of his hands, then goes onto a night bender in a chauffeured limo. He stops to drink at an obscure drag bar where he is swept away by waitress-singer Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) who mesmerises with her rendition of Edith Piaf's La Vie En Rose. The rest is well known: they fall in love, he literally sweeps her onto the big stage with the simple words ""Just trust me"", and she is a knockout. It's a whirlwind romance that sees them bond emotionally and professionally. He fights his addiction and promises to stay clean, but as her celebrity star rises, his tragically falls.<br/><br/>Describing the storyline is easy but the powerhouse acting and musical performances of Cooper and Gaga are superlative. Both fill their roles with authenticity because that's who they are. Unlike her real-life persona, here Gaga is stripped bare and is the epitome of vulnerability. Words and melody take second place to the expressiveness in her vocal tones, and her simply divine finalé of ""I'll Never Love Again"" is unforgettable. Cooper channels every all-American country singer that ever existed: macho, hard-living, and impossible to listen to without tapping your feet. The chemistry between them is palpable; whether it's in the highs of romance or the lows of shattered lives, the synergy is electric. The cinematography never wavers in its intensity. It turns stage backlights into an organic canvas, and shapes big and small spaces into elements of narrative.<br/><br/>Much more could be said, but it's the performances and music that leave their mark. The film has things to say about the misery of addiction and it teases out high-art music against pop pulp. Depending on how you look at it, there is also gender power in play. But these are not what you will remember most. It is a standout musical and a modern classic of entertainment."
"epup901","6","1","3","29 October 2018"," Could have been so much more
","We really wanted to like this movie. In short: great musical performances, good acting, but poor writing and character development. The central message Jack was trying to convey to Ally - be true to yourself and your music, tell YOUR story - never developed. There were so many missed opportunities: the bath tub scene should have been where he told her: You are selling out! Not, you have no talent, your ugly, etc. The back stage conversation with her manager about the dancers: she should have insisted that she wanted things done her way. She caved to fame and never fought for her own voice. Jack's death was hollow. He succumbed to his demons, with no hope or belief in himself. Did Ally EVER realize what Jack was trying to help her understand about herself? Yes, she became a star, but she never became the singer Jack saw in her. Was the last song supposed to convey all that? We just don't know."
"txmartyhm","10","1","3","28 October 2018"," Brilliant!
","Absolutely amazing acting by Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott, and the rest of the supporting cast. Kudos to Cooper as director for making every character real, well-developed and flawed. And double kudos to Cooper and Gaga for not only performing but also co-writing almost all of the movie's music. I predict Oscar nominations in about a dozen categories."
"carlosrperez97","5","1","3","27 October 2018"," Good Acting; Great Singing; Well Directed; But still a ""meh"" movie
","I have to say, I'm not a fan of Stephanie Germanotta a.k.a. Lady Gaga. But I'm a fan of movies and I myself studied screenwriting (and journalism). This said, I can't say her performance isn't (very very) good. That's the first ""surprise"" of the film. We've seen her before in a screen (though not a big one) but she prove she can star a film.<br/><br/>Of course Gaga sings amazing, that's out of discussion too, which takes us to the second surprise: Bradley Cooper can sing and play, and also very well. And he can direct, too. The movie isn't very challenging through the lens, still the job is well done.<br/><br/>The problem in this movie is the story itself. There's a point when you wonder when is going to happen something really breathtaking, but it doesn't, it falls into a cliché drama with only one way to end. And you're really hoping it won't end like that because if it does, then you'll feel like you've wasted 2h16m of your life (and money, if you watched it in a cinema)<br/><br/>I'm not saying is bad, I'm only saying is ridiculous to think this is one of the best movies ever made (like so many people these days). This is a film where you will enjoy certain things: Gaga acting and singing; the criticicism of a pop industry (which is as shitty as the movie describes it) and Bradley Cooper directing, singing (damn well) and playing the guitar like a natural born rockstar.<br/><br/>But seeing this in IMDB top 250 (well, of course the IMDB doesn't stands up for greatest movies in the history of cinema, only stands for Most Popular Films in the (immediate) present) is absurd (8.3??!!).<br/><br/>Yeah, of course the fans of (maybe) the biggest pop star in the past decade had something to do with it. But if someone tells me to recommend a very good movie, or at least a good one, this one is definitly not on the options. If you want to see a plain movie where you know what's going to happen since the first minute, then this is the right movie for you.<br/><br/>Overall: Good acting (from a singer) and great singing and performing (from an actor); well directed but with a script that's only making this more and more soap opera as the time goes by. Too predictable and it felt like an excuse to show the world Lady Gaga can act (and Cooper could be a rock/country star) while it forgot that is a movie and should have a good story too, not just good acting. But of course, this will be nominated for many Oscars, because the Academy gets worse every day.<br/><br/>This movie is an example of how marketing makes people think they're watching good movies and future cinema classics, when actually, they aren't."
"ansonlam","8","1","3","27 October 2018"," Great music, fantastic acting; decent plot
","I went into the cinema with pretty high expectations, having seen such phenomenal ratings for the movie. All throughout, it didn't go as I'd expected so I was just ever-so-slightly disappointed in the plot arena. However, it turned out to be okay. It wasn't a perfect, Oscar-worthy plot, nonetheless.<br/><br/>The biggest problems I have with this movie are two things - jumps and focus.<br/><br/>Jumps is the editing and time jumps in the movie. The ratio of Jackson and Ally's story was far less than the final scenes mainly revolving around Jackson, and you could very easily tell the movie was rushed, and they were forced to cut out a lot.
The focus was not too clear. Whether the story revolved around the couple, or Ally, or Jackson, it was just too ambiguous to figure out. It began with Jackson, and then moved on to them as a couple, and Ally's part of the story - both were rushed in order to continue focusing on Jackson, on which note the story ended. The ending was sad, at first, and then it just felt empty. I imagine the production team just went ""We need a plot twist, and the audience should be expecting Jackson's lost of hearing in the end, so we need something that is unexpected. Let's kill him off.""<br/><br/>All in all, the acting and songs were enough to compensate for the points deducted for the mediocre plot."

His portrayal of Jackson Mayne is so deep and well defined as he falls you can't help but ride the spiral with him. He plays him with love for the woman he adores and does not do the same for himself, truly heartbreaking. Lady Gaga does the same for her character and she is beautiful and graceful at the same time, not to mention her voice is brilliant and a true talent in today's music and it lends well to this movie. I swear she is not acting, she lives this everyday. She also displays something you don't see much of today. Love a deep love for her man and through all his faults her love is unwavering and she is committed to helping him overcome his demons. She goes down the spiral with him till the last and wishes she would have done so much more to help him. Regret is what is left, but spending the time you had with the one you love is not lost on her. I truly hope if you're on the fence you see it. You might be glad you did."

"MrDHWong","9","1","3","18 October 2018"," Flawlessly showcases the immense talent of its two leads in both their acting and music
","A Star Is Born is a romantic drama film based on the 1937 film of the same name. Starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, it flawlessly showcases the immense talent of its two leads in both their acting and music.<br/><br/>After another successful concert, famous country singer Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) stops by a bar for a drink where he witnesses a performance from Ally (Lady Gaga), a young waitress who dreams of becoming a singer-songwriter. Impressed by her musical abilities, Jackson decides to take Ally under his wing to help her rise up in the music industry, despite battling his own problems with drugs and alcohol.<br/><br/>Anchored by its two captivating leads and its music, A Star Is Born may well go down as one of the greatest film remakes of all time. Every song is memorable and thanks to the brilliant sound design, the audience constantly feels like they are at a real concert whenever a track is played. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have perfect on-screen chemistry. It is sheer joy to watch them sing together and act off one another throughout the film. Despite her glamorous and artsy image, Lady Gaga's outstanding performance as Ally is raw, down-to-earth, and should be highly relatable to any up-and-coming musician who may be watching, which, in turn, perfectly shows her versatility as both a singer and an actress. Bradley Cooper (who directed, co-wrote, and produced the film as well) was also fantastic as Jackson and in addition to singing his own songs, he leaves just as much of an impression as Lady Gaga, but never so much that it feels as though he is overshadowing her. This is a remake for the ages and most certainly needs to be experienced on the big screen in surround sound.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"
"javomed88","10","1","3","18 October 2018"," A Star is Re-Born
","I haven't seen any of the previous versions of 'A Star Is Born' but I can say that this film pays great tribute to its predecessors. For a story that has been told in many ways and different eras, I believe that the power and authenticity of Bradley Cooper's remake is outstanding. His omnipresence in the development of this film demonstrates not only his remarkable creative and directorial capabilities, but also proves that he can make anything happen. Same thing with Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>I was always aware of Gaga's versatility as an artist and her passion for acting. However, her involvement and delivery in the film is absolutely breathtaking. Not only she is the queen of music, but also is one of the best actresses nowadays. I wouldn't be surprised if her career follows the same path as Cher or Streisand herself. Not to mention that the soundtrack (co-produced by Gaga) has already made history as a chart-topper. Every song in this film has been beautifully crafted to enhance every moment of this masterpiece. My personal favourites are ""Shallow"", ""Always Remember Us This Way"", ""Is That Alright?"", ""Before I Cry"" and ""I'll Never Love Again"". The last song already is the ""I'll Always Love You"" of today.<br/><br/>I had high expectations for this film given the critical acclaim and box-office reception. I can say that these expectations were met and surpassed. I was also impressed on the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga. They really converged magnificently. The only issue I perceived is that the story focuses too much on Jack's (Cooper) demise. Ally's (Gaga) character doesn't fully develop as it should. Nevertheless, Gaga's performance is of such greatness, that it's easy to notice how she progressively steals the film.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a beautiful film. As said before, acting is amazing. Cooper, Gaga and Sam Elliot will get tonnes of awards. Cooper did incredibly well for a directorial debut and production, but awards in these fields will come with further projects. Highlights are music, editing, cinematography, sound mixing and sound editing. I anticipate 10 Academy Award Nominations at the very least, including Best Motion Picture. It will win a handful of Golden Globes, including Best Picture. Hard to tell at this stage if it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, but will definitely win Best Original Song for ""Shallow"" or any of the aforementioned themes. Given the relatively low competition this year, I anticipate that it will grab 3 Oscars minimum.<br/><br/>The story of ""A Star Is Born"" deserves to be told over and over. If it is revisited in 30 or 40 years, it will have to surpass the high standards set by this film. I highly recommend watching this movie on the big screen, you will enjoy every second and it will stay with you for long.<br/><br/>Score: 9.5/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"

","A STAR IS BORN - Officially, this is the 4th version of the oft-told tale, but, it's more directly a re-do of the 1976 Streisand edition (all three prior versions get credit). <br/><br/>It's a familiar story of a rise and fall of a musician/actor/painter/author etc. With Lady Gaga as the riser and Bradley Cooper as the fallen (curiously, the movie never truly makes clear how successful Cooper's character's career is when the story begins). As clichéd as the plot is (oh, and there's a welter of them), there's enough innate charm with Gaga's Ally that it carries the picture through the rough patches and dull sections. <br/><br/>While Gaga has charisma, and, obviously, on-stage talent, her acting is passable at best. She's most comfortable when just being a natural, but, when the movie demands more of her during the more heavily dramatic scenes, it surpasses her abilities (a couple of times you can even catch her consciously 'hitting her mark'). Cooper's Jack is so obviously a nod to Kris Kristofferson's John Howard from the 70s version that it hampers his acting (it's doubly amusing because the movie makes several references to Jack's 'voice' being indebted to his brother Bobby (Sam Elliott)). Cooper fares best in the last act. After some awkwardly bumpy scenes, Elliott's performance may be this version's best. Cooper's Direction gets the job done, but, the use of close-ups is excessive, carrying on into scenes where such tight framing isn't needed. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is so sharp and brightly lit that you can see the makeup caked on Gaga's face (digital photography will do that if not careful), although he achieves some fine visuals elsewhere. <br/><br/>The new STAR IS BORN is an adequate enough production. But, the fact that it and Lady Gaga are being touted for Best Picture and Actress says a lot about the current state of the cinema."

","The key line comes early: ""A Jon Peters Production."" Bradley Cooper's new film closely adheres to the previous Jon Peters version, the one with Barbra and Kris. Very closely. Only out of discretion was this not titled Another Jon Peters Production, Another Star is Born.
 Ally's leggy version of ""La vie en rose"" evokes Judy Garland sufficiently for Cooper to have cut her ""Over the Rainbow"" from the film (it's still in the credits). His Jackson Maine replaces Norman Maine. But apart from these homages the '76 version weighs more heavily than the '54 on this update. (The March/Gaynor nonmusical is out of it altogether). Bradley looks and sounds like and plays Kristofferson. Ally has Barbra's nose-concern. The score is updated but kindred.
 The plot still works. That's how art works, recombining familiar, basic elements, as Jack explains the elemental power of the 12-note core of music: ""Music is essentially 12 notes between any octave - 12 notes and the octave repeat. It's the same story told over and over, forever. All any artist can offer this world is how they see those 12 notes. That's it.""
 The songs, lyrics, music and overall production deserve their warm reception. 
 But I find the acting plaudits overhyped. If there are any proper Oscar performance nominations here they are Andrew Rice Clay as All's father and Dave Chappelle as Jack's friend. They feel real and new to them. The others make only marginal departures from their familiar personae. 
 Lady Gaga is a pleasant and impressive surprise, but she remains an image not a fully-rounded new character. To remember what an Oscar-worthy ""performance"" might be, check out Emma Thompson in The Wife. That is a nuanced, intense, deep apprehension of a character on another level altogether. That's ""acting."" Lady Gaga was excellent, but more as a surprising presence than as a fully realized new ""being."" 
 In my favourite irony, when Ally - in Jack's view - sells out and accepts her new manager's showbiz glitz over her simple sincerity, she lets herself be remade into - Lady Gaga. On that SNL show she perfectly matches Alec Baldwin's persuasive ""performance"" of himself.
 Cooper makes his Jack the centre of this film more than James Mason or Kristofferson were. He gives himself the more fully detailed backstory, with his problematic dad, sibling rivalry and debilitating afflictions. 
 When his addictions are described as a ""disease"" the film is more attuned to our understanding than the 1950s. But the old puritanism persists when brother Bobby assures Ally it was all Jack's fault. A disease isn't the victim's fault, remember? There's more balance in Jack's tinnitis, the other physical affliction that he fails to address and treat. 
 I show my age here, but this fine film doesn't supplant the Garland-Mason one. I hope it encourages younger audiences to check that one out. It may be time ""to let the old ways die,"" but it's also the time to revive the best old art."
"bankofmarquis","9","1","3","9 October 2018"," 4th time IS the charm
","I, like many, rolled my eyes when I heard that Bradley Cooper (of all people) was tabbed to write, direct and star in the 4th film adaptation of A STAR IS BORN. I was not a big fan of the Streisand/Kristofferson version from the 1970's, have vague memories of the Garland/Mason version from the 1950's and never saw the original Gaynor/March version from the 1930's. But when I heard that Lady Gaga was cast in the female lead of this film, I was intrigued and decided to check it out.<br/><br/>And...I'm glad I did as A STAR IS BORN now resides atop my list of BEST PICTURES OF 2018!. The music, acting, directing and story all work well in conjunction with each other to bring this tearjerker new, relevant life for a whole new audience.<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with the plot, A STAR IS BORN tells the tale of an up and coming performing talent who is taken under the wing of an aging, on the decline, alcoholic superstar performer. We watch her rise and his fall.<br/><br/>In the lead role of Ally, Lady Gaga is outstanding. From her first musical performance to the last, you can clearly see that she has the musical chops, bravura and heart to pull off these scenes and this character. She really brings it here and you are drawn in whenever her character is on-stage, performing. As an actress she is better than ""fine"". You can see some moments of acting skill and depth, but you do see some of her lack of experience in her acting in some of the quieter scenes. All that said, I will be shocked if she is NOT nominated for an Oscar for this performance - she certainly is going to be nominated (and will probably win) as well for Best Song.<br/><br/>Complimenting her - and holding the screen, and our attention throughout - is Bradley Cooper's performance of Superstar-on-the-decline Jackson Maine. His Country/Rock legend lives up to the billing in voice, musical performance and attitude. This is Cooper's finest performance of his career, nuanced and crushing, drawing us in while simultaneously pushing us away. He is, easily, the front-runner for the Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Complimenting these two are Andrew Dice Clay (interestingly enough) as Ally's father , who brings a multi-faceted character to life. He is star-struck, hopeful, protective and angry - always wishing for the best for his daughter, and protecting her from those that will prey on her. I would say he could be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he is not the Best Supporting Actor in this film, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>That Best Support Actor performance belongs to Sam Elliott who plays Cooper's (much) older brother. Cooper and Elliott's characters have a love/hate relationship with deep familial scars. As often happens with Supporting Roles, Elliot's performance shines and then is elevated to another level from one scene late in the film. He'll easily get an Oscar nomination - and will probably, finally, earn the Oscar he deserves.<br/><br/>But this film isn't all about acting. The Direction by Cooper (who will probably be nominated in all 3 categories - acting, writing and directing) is sharp and to the point. He films the musical scenes with skill and doesn't let the camera get too crazy while driving his lens close in to the actor's faces during the quiet scenes, drawing us in to this pair.<br/><br/>And of course, with this type of film, it will hinge on how good the music, and the musical performances, are - and this film delivers the goods in that space. There is memorable song after memorable song, performed strongly by both Cooper and Lady Gaga. They are good separately, but are INCREDIBLE when they perform together.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough good things about this film - it IS that good. Check this film out, you'll be glad you did, and you'll be able to say that you've seen the front-runner for all the OSCARS of 2018.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","I took my mom to see it and at first i didn't want to see it my self. The movie is incredible with amazing music and great acting work. You are just watching Ally and Jack having an comlicated but amazing life, your not even thinking Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Personaly i think the ending is overrated, it would be more promising if it was an ending with alot of questions, but that is my amateur opinion.

","I've been a fan of Bradley's since I saw him kayaking in Alaska as a teenager and didn't think there is anything he could make me to love him more. BUT this film is just amazing! I loved Jack and cried so bad in the end. I loved my heroes and villains from the time I watched Alias. I loved the cinematography and the music, but I think the think I lived the most was Lady Gaga. How she acted and sang in the film just gave me goosebumps all the time! It's like the best film of the year, maybe even of the last years (even if Bradley hadn't done or acted on it!) Go see it folks! Just don't forget the tissues and don't go on a date night if you don't like showing your vulnerability on the first night. Awesome, awesome film! 😍"
"lula-25383","9","1","3","8 October 2018"," Good love story
","I also liked the Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand version but Lady Gaga out did herself in this. Barbra Streisand is an excellent actress and singer but Lady Gaga is beginning to be a better actress than singer. I don't listen to much of her songs but I will definitely see her again if she decides to be in any more movies. She should win an award for her part. Especially at the end when she sang the song to her husband. Bradley Cooper did good but Lady Gaga really stands out in this movie. If you like the Kris Kristofferson/Barbra Streisand version, you'll love the Cooper/Gaga version. I hadn't seen the Judy Garland/James Mason version but I'm going to go back and see that one also. Good movie! Good love story!"

","My daughter and I who are real movie buffs went to go see this weekend. Love the start of the movie and the huge chemistry with Bradley(Jack) and Lady Gaga(Ally)! We felt like there could and would of been more with Bradley's (Jack) relationship between him and his brother and more to the relationship between Lady Gaga (Ally)and her father. How did everyone get to where they are today? You have an Idea but not totally sure? Also, when Bradley (Jack) kills himself. We felt that we should of seen more... Maybe Ally finding him or her getting told for the first time or Ally with Jack's body (more of an emotional impact) Also her manager ultimately pushed him over the edge should of had Ally find out and show her quiting or firing him all together! Bradley was AMAZING other wise and very believable the part with Jack talking to his brother about how he truly feels about him, very moving! Love this movie 2018 version more than Barbra and Kris 1976 version but loved the reaction out of Barbra (Esther) finding Kris(John) and her moving out of their home (after he is gone) and hearing his voice thinking he is back. But will go and buy this Movie for my DVD Library."

The emotion that it brought out of me and my boyfriend was just so unexpected but the acting was so natural and the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga was just unreal. <br/><br/>Absolutely the best film I have watched in a long time. Take tissues."
"doxxman5","7","1","3","8 October 2018"," good update on the classic story
","I enjoyed the movie as well, its a nice update on the old story as i love the Judy Garland one. Story is depressing as ever, maybe more. I wish it would have been a more pointed attack on pop music as a whole, as it is hinted at but not really fully destroyed (i guess with Lady Gaga as lead the movie can only go so far.) I thought Cooper was amazing as an actor, and pretty much nailed the self-destructive alcoholic musician persona. Gaga held her own, though she was a little stiff in some scenes and im not quite as in love with her as some people are. Ending seemed sort of rushed, but i loved Sam Elliot. in all, worth a trip to the theater just prepare your self for some emotional trauma. 7 out of 10"
"hmb-51778","8","1","3","7 October 2018"," Great movie derailed by a terrible final scene

She doesn't need any reminders of what she's been through. <br/><br/>I know this is his first movie. So I'll cut him so slack for this (and the over use of UNsteady cam). <br/><br/>But he was THIS CLOSE to perfection."
"cliftonofun","8","1","3","7 October 2018"," Predictable, but powerful
","This movie really should have felt cliche. We have (literally) seen this story before, after all. Repeatedly. Add in a movie star wanting to be a director and a singer wanting to be an actor...well, I wondered how often I would roll my eyes. But I didn't. Not even once. The first moment when they meet feels real. The first moment when Jackson calls Ally out on stage is absolutely electric. From that point on, it is just hard not to care. Everything works. In fact, I forgot about the performances and just fell into the story. So it may not be the most original movie (and perhaps the first half was stronger than the second half), but it is a story well told, nonetheless."
"charlesrussellwhite","7","1","3","7 October 2018"," A Star Is Born: Compelling and Insightful
","I'm not going to lie; I came in to this with a bad attitude not knowing really what to expect. Is it going to be a ""chick flick"", a Bradley Cooper drool session for the 18-35 female demographic, or just a garden variety love story mixed in with musical elements?<br/><br/>It was neither of the above; this movie both defied and exceeded expectations.<br/><br/>The strongest element by far was the plot. Being Bradley Cooper's directing debut, he did a very good job of sticking to the basic elements: the introduction, the rising action, the falling action, the rock bottom, and the conclusion all in three acts. The story was capable of standing on it's own and immersing an entire audience with an incredibly real and compelling timeline of trials and tribulations. Each transition from one part to the next was made with the masterful effect of building anticipation, leaving us wondering what was in store for us next. It did the job of carrying the audience through a 2 hour, 10 minute roller coaster.<br/><br/>The acting on it's own was top notch as it featured a few heavy-hitters such as Cooper, himself and a strong supporting cast featuring Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle. Though the choice in casting Lady Gaga begs a question: was this role made for her or was the script written for a generic female lead for which she just so happened to fit the bill? Either way, Lady Gaga's breakthrough acting performance hit the mark; it wasn't bad, but there didn't really seem to be that much room to see if she had gumption for acting.<br/><br/>By and far, the weakest element was the character development. I get it, there was a lot of story that had to be told and only so much film in which to do it. However, I feel that a little more investment in character development would have allowed the audience to feel much more of an emotional impact for our two leads as they just so happen to find each other and later face adversity as a duo. <br/><br/>Overall, I say that this film is above average. Many moviegoers will come with the expectation of an incredibly strong soundtrack and name recognition. Where Lady Gaga's acting hit par, she made up with her voice. However, they will not only stay, but glue themselves to their seats for the storytelling. I don't see this film being at a competitive, ""award-winning"" level, but it is one of a handful must-see movies of 2018."
"partygirlchula","10","1","3","7 October 2018"," I was not disappointed

"Serendipity0221","10","1","3","6 October 2018"," This Movie is Electric!
","This Movie is hands down, the BEST Movie of the year! So far. I didn't go into seeing this movie with high expectations so I was unprepared to be blown away by stellar acting, stellar music performances and great writing. To begin with the casting for this movie is excellent. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is electric to the level of catching lightning in a bottle. Copper plays seasoned rocker Jackson Maine and Gaga plays up and comer Ally. From their characters first encounter, the chemistry between these two is palpable. As viewers, you feel their highs and lows. I've never cheered for a movie couple to make it more so than with these two. Lady Gaga proves to be a force to be reckoned with as an actress in this role. She comes across as visceral, real and genuinely vulnerable. She's a rocket, ready to launch yet she doesn't see it. Both Lady Gaga and Cooper give Oscar worthy performances and deserve recognition as nominees in their respective Best Actor categories. What's more amazing is the Oscar worthy performances given by the supporting characters. Veteran actor Sam Elliott plays Jackson's gravelly voiced road manager. Comic Andrew Dice Clay takes a step away from his ""Diceman"" character and gives a heartfelt portrayal as Ally's dad. Comedian Dave Chappelle is surprisingly great in a small role playing a subdued best friend. I saw this movie in a theater with Dolby Digital sound and highly recommend that you see it in a theater with Dolby Digital sound IF possible. Viewing it with Dolby sound you feel the excitement of a great concert. It feels like you have an All Access Backstage pass to the concert of the year. When Cooper's Jackson Maine takes the stage to sing and Ally joins him it gives you goosebumps. This movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions with highs and lows. I'd call it the BEST Concert movie since ""Purple Rain."" A Star Is Born is instantly a classic. Can't wait to own it on 4K DVD."
"compage","10","1","3","6 October 2018"," Not going to lie, I teared up in the movie...
","I had read the advance reviews, as such I had high expectations.<br/><br/>Cooper was fantastic but he has shown himself to be very solid in other movies, not a big surprise.<br/><br/>The shock was how good Gaga was. Setting aside her voice is insane and the music for the movie (By both actors) was great but her acting was more than credible.<br/><br/>This may be an unpopular opinion but I actually think this version was better than the original. Cooper is a far better actor than Kris has ever been and frankly Gaga can sing circles around Barbara Streisand and turns out she is a better actor as well.<br/><br/>The supporting performances were also very strong.<br/><br/>This movie should be up there during awards season, if not its a crime."

","A Star is Born is my new favorite movie of the year and it's gonna be really hard to top this movie. This movie made me need to think about it again and process it before I posted my review because this movie is truly a beautiful masterpiece. There is so much to talk about and it's gonna be hard not to say spoilers but I'm gonna keep it spoiler free. Here's my review for a Star is born.
Pros:the story even tho it has now been done 4 times this is number 4 it's still an intreasting story to see unfold if you have never heard or seen any of the previous films and the story is the huge part of the movie. The soundtrack I Already had it downloaded before I saw the movie but only listen to like 5 songs and boy is this one of my favorite soundtracks ever the music is so great and has so much emotions around it. When I got home I had to remember so much I don't remember some of the scenes which is a great thing in my opinion. Let's get to it the acting is phenomenal bradly copper and lady Gaga need to be nominated for a Oscar and Sam Eliot did a great job to. I can't wait to see what bradly copper directs later because this is his first movie. I didn't check my phone at all in this movie because how interested and how hooked I was. The movie looks and sounds great hearing the guitar sound through the whole theater is just great. The runtime might be a little long for some people but I don't think so. The characters were all made well.
Cons: I have none this movie is prefect in my opinion.
Overall: a Star is born is truly a modern day masterpiece and master class in cinema. I truly love this movie and I plan to see it again and I can't wait to own this movie. This is my favorite movie of this year and is probably gonna stay there and in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. A Star is born gets a 10/10"
"gav-12880","3","1","4","16 April 2019"," Extremely Meh!
","Bradley Cooper's voice (speaking), is the only thing that shines in this mundane, self righteous, farce of a movie. Yes, Lady Gaga can sing, exceptionally well, but so what? Where's the substance?? Is this just a vehicle for her singing?? I doubt she needs it!! She catches Cooper' eye, and ear, and they enter an unbalanced, while paradoxically, also symbiotic, eventually toxic relationship. He wants her to retain any initial integrity she has, but she persues success fully accepting of the sellout culture that it can be. The two love each other, but clearly for different reasons, and it just becomes pitiful to watch. The message is; who the hell knows!?? Pointless! I like Cooper and Gaga, but come on... extreme self love is extremely crass."

i would say she deserved a shot at the oscar for her acting, which was so damn real, raw, and hearfelt that you would never in a million yrs guess she only recently started acting...she has that ""something"" that all great actors have and she is gifted not only in vocals but in her ability to convey through the silver screen, right up there with the best..bradely was fantastic and did his own singing ,which bloody rocked! as well as portraying the grizzled ,alcoholic, uber talented version of a rock star on the skids on his way to oblivion...Supporting actor sam elliot was perfect in his role,just great! Lady ga ga was the real star of this film as she dominated every scene she was in with her presence..There were many times in the movie where i was just struck back by how beautiful a woman she is, especially the times when she was not made up...just a beauty...anyway I still would give the nod to Bohemian rhapsody and its lead Did get the oscar ,but this film deserves to be right along side it as a serious runner up and Ga Ga's incredible and heartbreaking music performances deserved the win they received.. this was such a cool movie, not only about discovered talent rising but also the romance scenes and heart to heart moments between her and bradley, i was glued to the screen and smiling from inside..."

","A musician helps a young singer find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.

Theirs is a complex journey through the beauty and the heartbreak of a relationship struggling to survive. In this new take on the iconic love story .<br/><br/>Apparently you can make the same movie four times and still make it work, as this 2018 remake of the 1976 remake of the 1954 remake of the 1937 original certainly proves. Who knew Lady Gaga was this good an actor or, for that matter, that Bradley Cooper was this good a singer and director? Wonderfully updating the timeless story of rising fame and fallen stardom to our modern perception of celebrity, A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again.

However what I really wanted to see was ally going back to her roots and rediscover herself, especially after that scene where she's in the bathtub and Jackson comes in drunk, asking her what her SNL show was about with the pop star act. I really wanted to see her do a classic sit down play the guitar and just sing instead of her doing some pop star act.

None of the fangirls/-boys I've seen so far seems to get that the label just want to make a product of her rather than a true and original artist.

The movie's pacing, acting and sets are all akin to art-house style movies.<br/><br/>The two leads starred by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper meet and hit it off almost immediately even though he is clearly drunk at that time. What do they see in each other? I can only guess she is ""needy"" and likes being with a washed out singer while he is just a drunkard looking for companionship. No romance what so ever. They are not the protagonists I can identify with.<br/><br/>Even when she finds fame, the movie cannot hit the high notes for the audience to cheer for her as the scenes are overshadowed by Cooper's problems. From there on, the ending becomes predictable.<br/><br/>The only saving grace are the songs.

","I thought the acting was okay, but the characters were not believable to me. What was motivating them?

In one scene it looks as if Jackson is near death, and she doesn't even seem to have any kind of reaction to this. Then the next moment she is agreeing to marry him without even seeming to give it any thought. Why? And the ending is just not believable. Why would any rational person just off himself after a single conversation? He could have just walked away. I don't know, but these characters just didn't seem real at all, and Lady Gaga was practically emotionless throughout most of the movie. I mean even when they have a fight, she just doesn't seem to even really be there in the scene. I wanted to slap her so many times, and I just didn't feel anything for her by the end. Jackson was more believable except for the ending. The film itself had such a strong 1970s vibe, and I don't care for that. The editing was distracting, and the camera work I didn't care for so much. I liked a few of the songs, but most of them I didn't care for. I appreciate that they did the songs live like that, but they didn't feel real. The song Shallow just didn't come off as realistic at all to me. Neither did this idea that she came up with complex song lyrics on the fly when they were first getting to know each other. Overall, I got through the movie, but I really didn't care for it. It didn't move me at all or entertain me. I really don't understand the hype other than it appears that they want to profit from the legions of Lady Gaga fans. I am disappointed that other films and performances are being ignored because of this film."

","Well, I asked my wife to watch this movie together as it gets nominated in 2019 Oscars. After first 20 minutes, she just paused the media player, turned towards me and asked, ""Have you seen Aashiqui 2, a Indian musical drama movie released in 2013?"" I didn't watch that so I said no. She told me the starting 20 minutes she watched is almost similar to the Indian movie. Then we start to watch it again. After an hour it starts to torture us with horrible acting of Bradley Cooper and his voice. Lady Gaga not an actress mate! Please concentrate on your voice, its for music not for drama.
Okay, then after 1.5 hours my wife told me the ending of the Indian film. She bets that 'A star is born' is fully copied from 'Aashiqui 2'. It was hard to believe, but at the end of the movie I see that the ending is just like my wife said before.
I guess Hollywood has reached a critical point where they are unable to find good scripts! That's why this type of old remakes are still in the box office and alas! people are buying that too.

","At first i really really like the music, the pace and i thought it was going to wash away the raunchy memory of the 1976 version, where the immense ego of one and the famed personality of the other actor overwhelmed the story .
i did not know bradley cooper before this role so i thought he was a good match for lady gaga, and an offset to her personality . then, it became draggy and boring . an alcoholic performer is a pitiful sight but becomes really annoying when the misery is stretched for too long, especially when i came for entertainment, not sufferance . his ending puts a totally depressing note in an entertaining feature .
lady gaga was good in her early role as a performer, but as she rises in fame, she becomes lady gaga herself and rivals the immense ego of barbara streisand in the earlier version .
after the wedding, the movie becomes draggy and boring . it should have been edited to last under 2 hours but was stretched way too long . i can understand why it failed so soon from the premium theaters to be relegated to the cheaper venues . waste of my time . and i hadn't seen so many people leave the theater during the show in a long time .
if a little bit of the dirty, funny business behind the scenes like in the 'rock star' (mark wahlberg, 2001) had been used, it may have spiked the action, fun, interest into the movie ."

Its a movie about life, about ups and downs, about finding yourself in life, about losing yourself both physically and mentally in life. It about the music business best and worst sides. Its is a deep movie on that level, but on the surface also manages to keep you interested in the character development and plot. Its a perfect balanced movie.

You feel with the character and can easily identify yourself in the things that the characters goes through.<br/><br/>And the soundtrack... WOW. Lady Gaga shows her full repertoire and her beautiful voice and i honestly was a little afraid that Bradley Cooper would stand too much out singing with a musician as Lady Gaga, but no hes great.

","I too am surprised by all the fantastic reviews and talk of Oscars for this film. I went to see with high expectations and maybe that's why I am somewhat disappointed in what I came away with. To be fair, I was entertained and did enjoy the movie.
First, most obviously, Lady Gaga's singing is by far the strongest asset she brings to the movie. However, her acting performance is flat and wooden, especially when on screen with a seasoned strong performer like Cooper. At times her performance almost seems awkward and staged. Secondly, Cooper amazingly has a great voice! The songs he sang were actually more enjoyable than the songs Lady Gaga sang. Better written songs and performed really well. The story itself is not breaking any new ground. One career begins to accelerate as another starts to decelerate. The movie is enjoyable, but certainly not this amazing drama with an amazing chemistry between the actors that should suck you in! Cooper carries this story and Gaga could use more acting lessons."

Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of her work and her music...but just that in this role she wasn't as compelling as I think her character should've been. Basically, she didn't convince me of her character's anxiety, desperation, fear, eagerness, and love throughout certain points of the movie. The only emotion she portrayed really well when the time came was confidence! (go figure lol). Anyways....Cooper did an amazing job with the character he played and everyone else wasn't so bad.

The male ego, dieing fame of the husband who's wife's career is blooming, depression, alcoholism, giref and many more topics could have been explored but the audiences are being fed the idealiztion of toxic relationship.

The role of the aspiring singer was practically made for Gaga. This version is grittier than the previous ones, giving it a more realistic flavor.<br/><br/>The obvious downside is that the movie comes across as a star vehicle for Lady Gaga (much like the 1976 version did for Barbra Streisand), and a lot of the tension between the characters seems overplayed. Even so, I found the music quite impressive, and the cast members all turned in fine performances. So, I recommend it, even though I consider the 1937 version the best of the four."

Music ( not my preference) is wonderfull.
I listen to the soundtrack at home now.
The pain of a drug addict and the desperation .. it all done in a good way. Not over the top.
The story line is simple .. not much happening.
Woman falls in love with man she becomes famous and man kills himself, she's devastated .
And all that in two plus hours.
It ' s not a happy movie but it makes you think."

","Saw the movie yesterday,...... I loved it I thought it was remarkable... Bradley Cooper is amazing... not only an amazing actor but also a Talented Director... on his first feature directorial Film Debut.. Amazing......
The way he captures our hearts'... His voice it's enigmatic........ I didn't even know that he can SING.. yes.... I loved the movie it was transcending.. 
Let's talk about Lady gaga.... Omg... she was a revelation. I loved her and let's not forget how beautiful her voice... IN my opinion she has one of the best voices at this moment in the Music Industry......
I enjoyed it... I though Both Bradley and Lady Gaga, excelled they had so much Chemistry that it was Insane... I felt it.. and so did the audience. Highly recommend watching... if you want a pretty love story with great music and singing... and yes Let's not Forget Bradley :)...."

so, okay, I bought the tickets thinking, well, I'm not really a Bradley Cooper fan, and Lady Gaga's, well, pretty good, I guess (awesome Super Bowl performance a couple of years ago).
But the movie was excellent. Lots of emotion, great songs, Cooper really looked and sounded like a rocker- his best performance ever. Lady Gaga was Lady Gaga- that is, incredible. Just go see it. Old story told in a brand new way. I'd like to take at least 'one more look' at this wonderful movie."

","I'm not a Lady Gaga fan nor a fan of Bradley Cooper (though I might call myself one now), but a fan of good music and read some raving newspaper reviews on Thursday. Decided to watch the film on Saturday, and it really blew me away. So much that I watched it again today. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were amazing in their roles and had so much chemistry. The way Jack looked at Ally through the first half of the film was unbelievable. It's still stuck in my mind. It was beautiful watching these two meet, hitting it off right away and watching them as musicians and watching Ally finally gain the confidence to get on the stage and perform her own songs. All characters, including the supporting roles, are beautifully written and beautifully played by the cast. The way Jack's addiction is handled seems very realistic to me. The second part of the film was almost physical painful to watch. To see Jack disappear more and more in the bottle made me cry. I was suffering for him and with him. By the end of the movie I was totally shattered and couldn't stop crying for an hour. No film has ever moved me as much as this one. I also loved all live performances and it really makes a difference that they sang live. Songs like ""Maybe It's Time"" are special and Bradley Cooper is a fantastic singer. This is a great bitter-sweet love story with great music and a starring couple that is absolutely outstanding. Crossing my fingers for the Golden Globes and Oscar's. Best movie, best director, best female leading actor, best male leading actor, and of course best song."

","The story is familiar and predictable with the freshness delivered by Bradley Cooper's excellent directing debut and acting, and Lady Gagas second to none vocals along with the comfort she has in her own skin. Granted she's perhaps a little old to actually find herself in the situation she does in the movie and should have been 10 years younger to be doing the moves and songs she does, but she still delivers on every level, in fact on occasion through the movie she appears so natural you'd believe she wasn't acting at all, I did find that sometimes her confidence in front of the camera removed some of the vulnerability that again a younger actress might have delivered. Whilst some of the story does leave the viewer frsutrated it only adds to the rise and fall the 2 leads suffer, this rise and fall is found throughout the whole movie and in the songs, it's delicate and brutal in equal measure. Whilst some of the songs won't be memorable for most, the story and performances will be and I thoroughly recommend it."

","I do not understand all the accolades and hype for this movie. The writing and directing was anemic and awkward. When you have to drop a bunch of 4 letter words all over the place,it just demonstrates that you do not have anything intelligent to convey. Over the top distracting. I think Bradley and Stefani sang well together. They should have sang the entire way through it. His gravelly speaking voice was unnecessary in my opinion.. He was trying too hard to sound like Sam Elliot. It failed because half the time it was so muffled and garbled you could not understand him. The dialogue is quite awful and I felt no connection with anyone. That is rare for me. My husband and I were fast forwarding. I do not want to leave a bad review but to me, this had the opportunity to deliver but it failed. Bradley can sing well and Stefani gave a fine performance. It was no fault of hers that this was a miss for me. Awful directing and writing in my opinion, cringe-worthy. It is too bad because Mr.Cooper is a decent actor typically."

"dfranzen70","7","1","5","11 March 2019"," How did she not win an Oscar?
","There were times during this movie that I felt it was just one of the best I'd seen in a while...and then Bradley Cooper would appear in a scene, or open his mouth, or do anything. This brought the movie's quality down a little for me. He tries very hard to look and sound like a combination of Sam Elliott (he even modeled his character's voice after Elliott's) and Jeff Bridges' character from Crazy Heart, but he doesn't have the gravitas to pull it off. And although it was exhilarating to see Lady Gaga's Ally transform from unsure songstress to confident siren, Cooper's Jackson never really had the same kind of journey. The movie is supposedly about the crossing of paths, with one on the rise and one on the decline, but here Jackson is in decline and a bad egg from pretty much the get-go, and he never really wavers from that. He's the same throughout. I haven't seen the other versions, so perhaps this is how it should go, but it just felt to me that Cooper couldn't bring the right amount of pathos for his character. His chemistry with Gaga was terrific, but I think a lot of that had to do with her passion for the role. Cooper just felt kind of there."

Sadly, with all the very high ratings, this will get at least a nod from ""The Academy"". Bradly Cooper was great, although ~ the drinking, and drunkenness just got to be the norm.

","Hard to make a remake,especially with the powerhouses that have created this story in the past. I expected a lot and received the powerful gratitude of satisfaction. Coopers foray creates a movie that's near perfect for today's attention jumping audience.
In the realm few get to achieve even after a lifetime of being in cinema Bradley Cooper has hit his mark. His style of quick edit seamlessly sent me the message that as Jackson Maine was missing so much of his life w/cinematic soulmate Ally. I felt his world crumbling as each successive edit was jumping even more time as his addiction and hearing issues were taking toll on his grip with reality. I never realized 2 hours had gone by until the movie was over. Outstanding performances all around, Lady Ga-Ga shines as the unknown whose star rises as quickly as Jackson Maine falls. The quick jump edits conveyed again her growth as true talent, her acting was superb and I felt a lump Well up in my throat as she held onto him to the bitter end. I have never personally felt the love she shows to Jackson and made me long for that type of relationship. This movie made it possible for me to believe I might find my true soul mate. Supporting roles by the cast on stage and behind the scenes was flawless, showing the enablers of Jackson Maine's life. Even Sam Elliott older brother proved to be an excellent choice and all his scenes prove without a doubt why he could work all year long if he so chose to do so. Touching end as he lets Ally know "" not your fault, not my fault, Jackson did this to himself. Nobody else did this to him. "" is so powerfully instrumental for the final scenes w/Ally singing the song Jackson wrote for her. I see Oscars"

"acoolmac","9","1","5","14 December 2018"," Every Aspect Perfect
","All too infrequently the movie industry gives us a classic.This occurs even more infrequently in a remake. In a fourth? Unfathomable. In the 2018 version of A Star is Born the screenplay, dialogue, acting, pacing, editing, and soundtrack meld into a magnum opus. I suspect there is a certain element of luck involved as well.<br/><br/>To say that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper generate on-screen chemistry would be
an understatement of universal proportions. They simmer, sizzle, then explode to the point that you almost fail to appreciate how brilliant Sam Elliot, Andrew Dice Clay and the rest of the cast portray their supporting roles. But, that brilliance doesn't go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Perhaps a small part of the reason classics come along fewer and further between these days relates to dialogue that often feels forced or trite, characters that are pushed outside their elemental spheres by the script. Their interaction can feel marginally unnatural. That simply doesn't happen here. Cooper and Lady Gaga as Jackson Maine and Ally Campana don't slip out of their roles. It is another aspect, as mentioned, that is perfect.<br/><br/>And the music? Lyrics and melodies that will bring tears, that is as powerful as it gets. I'm a romantic. (I am also an old rocker, so the ripping guitar scenes had me playing my invisible Gibson right along.) And who would have suspected Bradley Cooper had such a dynamic voice and energy?<br/><br/>There is one final aspect that warrants mention, the treatment of suicide. It is depicted in a truly appropriate and fully relevant manner.<br/><br/>This film, with all its components spinning in perfect synergy, will be talked about for many years to come."

I just want to represent my different pow. Do not want to offend anyone.<br/><br/>I watched this with my wife. Let me share her opinion first:
Bradley Cooper is soooooooo sexy.<br/><br/>Ok. Now comes mine.
I wasn't interested in this movie at all. So I just watched it quite objectively as a piece of art, to evaluate it, if it's well done or not.
The storyline is mediocre. It reminds me of Rocky whichever where he is getting old and finds a new trainee and his experience is wasted on the young pretender.
The characters are a bit shallow or they are not explored in depth.
They are supposed to be going through different crises, one of them saying goodbye to a career and the other facing a choice between her own unique style and personality and the fake but sure to succeed style that her manager forces on her. None of this is explored, discussed, resolved.
Bradley as an addict and a drunk but having a sixpack that we can only envy.
It's more like a musical than a movie, the songs are good but the movie part is so so."

","Overall good. I love the songs so much and the story can get one easily emotional.<br/><br/>But I and my friend thought of a better way to end the story -
Instead of committing suicide, Jack might choose to leave Ally and live his life alone in the farm where he was raised by his dad. Ally might not bother him and continue her career, but she would take Jack's advice and become ""the original and real Ally"" again.<br/><br/>So the ending would be like this - one day when Jack sit in the house, the radio/TV is playing the latest song of Ally - ""I'll never love again"", which carries a message to Jack. Sadly, Jack has lost his hearing at that time and he cannot listen to the song. He can never know how much Ally has been missing him and waiting for his coming back...<br/><br/>Just a little thought - which I personally think it will be better than Jack's suicide."

"RforFilm","10","1","5","8 October 2018"," This is a story about the stars unready to accept or lose fame. A Star is Born will shine forever
","Most people will never have an idea with the pressure that celebrities are put under. Their put under the spotlight to showcase their talent and to face another popular face similar to theirs and have to find ways to be unpredictable, but great. This is why the music industry and Hollywood have been known for being unkind businesses. You ever notice that when asked about being famous, a lot of celebrities reply, ""don't""? Is it because they'll have moments where they were once godlike, only to be cast aside because their not ""hip and cool""? I can't imagine the hurt they receive. I can only hope that those people have something or someone to turn to when that feeling becomes unbearable.<br/><br/>The tragedy of the fading star had been showcased before in the original A Star is Born with Judy Garland and it's remake in 1976 with Barbara Streisand. I haven't seen either of them, but are constantly said to be great movies. Perhaps I'll look at them at another point, but in the case of the current A Star is Born, this is another great story of the modern celebrity and his pressure to both keep a lasting career and help the girl of his dreams. <br/><br/>Country/blues singer Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper) sells out constantly with his popular concerts and good looks. He plays a mean guitar and has an ""Americana"" voice. He's hiding a drinking and drug problem, which helps him cope with the pressure of pleasing his fans and finding new inspiration. He has his fair share of people working for him, but the only one who tries to care for him personally is his older brother/manager Bobby (played by Sam Elliot). It's clear that while he does fine financially, he's still more alone then most normal people.<br/><br/>We also have a young woman Ally (played by Lady Gaga) who gets by as a waitress while singing in a drag bar. Though she seems to have friends, she is constantly told by her father Lorenzo (played by Andrew Dice Clay) to take it further. One day after a concert, Jackson stumbles into the drag bar, simply looking for place to drink. It's here he sees Ally singing ""La Vine en Rose"" and is memorized by her beauty and voice. After meeting her backstage and a night of hanging out, she is flown to his next show where he brings her on stage to duet with him. As the two become an item, the world is drawn to Ally.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop there as A Star is Born is not only a great look at the tragedies of celebrity, but is also one of the best movies of the year. It may be a remake, but this film is just full of honest chemistry by the two leads, along with some beautiful looking cinematography. I swear, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga have to be one of the best onscreen couples in a while. <br/><br/>Screen chemistry is often hard to describe, but if showing how these two people need each other without explaining does the job, I don't know what does. I'll start with Lady Gaga who is not only a natural beauty (it was said that producers told her she would be too ugly for film), but convoys a lot of her side of acquire fame and learning how to deal with it. Bradley Cooper is her best friend going into this and he nicely shows a Kurt Cobain-like lifestyle in which you know he has a lot of demons and could take down a lot of people with him. He's just so likable and friendly with how he is with Lady Gaga that you really find yourself sympathetic for him.<br/><br/>While I don't know if I would go as far as calling this a musical, but A Star is Born does have a lot of good music. They all seem like songs I'd hear from Lady Gaga or a blues-like singer. I don't know if it's something I'd listen to all the time (it's not my thing), but the important thing is that it feels authentic. It's honest enough that I'm sure it's going to receive awards. <br/><br/>I'll give this ten Grammys out of ten. A Star is Born is what you call a perfect remake of a great movie. It's beautifully shot, beautifully written, beautifully acted and beautifully performed. It's just a beautiful movie. But along with it, it's also an honest portrayal of being a celebrity and what happens when your not ready to either receive or lose the fame. The stars shine bright enough to recommend this for everyone."

Bradley, as always was a masterclass in acting and absolutely should get awards for this, they both should.

","'A Star Is Born (2018)' is an incredibly accomplished piece of work, both in terms of its filmmaking and its music, and it actually introduces us to two bright new talents: Lady Gaga the actress and Bradley Cooper the musician (and writer/ director, to boot). They're both, arguably, at the most real and raw they've ever been, turning in wonderfully nuanced and realistic performances. They each bring a weight and history to their roles that just seeps off the screen. The direction really is superb, too, as it constantly makes distinct and assured decisions that infinitely enhance the story-telling. While it does feel quite long, the story has a lot to get through and, even though this is the fourth version of this tale, it feels very timely because it comments on fame, the music industry and the all-too-often-seen tragedies that come with both. It also includes some subtly meta layers, too. The end result is a compelling, believable and surprisingly moving film that packs a pretty powerful punch and isn't afraid to do so - especially with its massively, almost devastatingly emotional ending. 8/10"
"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","5","8 October 2018"," A Star Is Born has given birth to two incredibly multi-talented stars.
","A universal story that transcends time, so much so that this is the third remake since the 1937 original (excluding Bollywood's 'Aashiqui 2'). Comparisons could be made between each iteration, however having not seen any of the previous remakes I can only judge the story solely based on this interpretation. To say I'm stunned is an understatement. A story so clearly personable to both of the lead stars, that one can instantly feel the passion in the acting, music and directing. Astonishing. A server stuck in a demoralising job happens to sing in front of a famous musician, who instantly takes a liking to her. Guiding her under his wing, she swiftly turns into a star where his jealousy soon gets the better of him. A directorial debut for Cooper who also acts and sings alongside Gaga. A near-perfect direction for a story that could've easily succumbed to melodrama. His focus and attentiveness on the flourishing romance and the music was astutely resonating. He never once deterred from them. However what elevates his style even further is just how stripped back it really is. The method in which he approaches Gaga, whose character believes she does not have the attractive qualities to be a successful musician, was close and personal. Almost caressing her with every movement that she makes, propelling her extraordinary voice and converting it into beauty. It's because of his delicate directing style that both the relationship and the characters feel real. Raw, emotive and visceral. Whether they express rage, passion or sadness, you feel every moment. Clinging onto the screenplay as if each word is a lyric to a meaningful ballad. The exploration of the music industry, identity and family is thorough and slightly underdeveloped, but applause must be given to the sheer focus and intent on the romance. It's an emotional rollercoaster of a drama. One moment you'll be singing and smiling, the next you'll be crying and depressed. This plethora of feelings reflect the relationship that is portrayed, making you feel just as involved as the actors.<br/><br/>Much talk has been given to Gaga recently, with even the possibility of awards. For a global superstar to transition into a leading actor for a drama filled with musicality and emotional depth, she did a dazzling job. The solo performances, particularly 'Shallow' and 'I'll Never Love Again', were sensational. We're talking shivers down my spine and goosebumps on my arms. Fortunately, she is just able to balance the marvellous singing with some decent acting. However, there were times where she struggled to convey emotion. Her facial acting was lacklustre, unable to present conviction in any emotional response. It was if she was trying too hard, and unfortunately it showed. It seems Gaga had stolen Cooper's thunder, which is a shame considering his performance was irrefutably exceptional. A truly transformative performance that showcased the destructive force of envy. A damaged individual who has succumbed to drinking and drug misuse. Constantly captivating. The music itself also shares an adequate amount of screentime, with performances embedded within the narrative. This does diminish the pacing somewhat, as dialogue that proceeded these were typically monotonous and cold, acting as cool downs from the energetic musicality. However despite the shortcomings that prevent this from being outstanding, Cooper has outdone himself. No longer do we question ""can Gaga act?"" or ""can Cooper sing?"". The amalgamation and chemistry of these two talents was seamless in this engrossing drama. Merging two art forms into one spellbinding film."

He recognize her talent to touch people, he singing voice and her special way of touching people. He falls for her.
He sees in her a something pure and true.

"lesliecolejr","9","1","5","7 October 2018"," Humor helps to soften the blow in 'A Star Is Born'
","Humor helps to soften the blow in Bradley Cooper's directorial debut, ""A Star Is Born."" When Jackson Maine (Cooper) puts the moves on Ally (Lady Gaga) he does everything from peeling off her false eyebrow to insisting that she admire the shape of her nose as greatly as he does. The laughter ensues. There is also great fun to be had in the company of Ally's friends and coworkers, some of whom share the stage with her at the bar where she sings. <br/><br/>Anyone who has ever worked a dead-end job for a demeaning boss and daydreamed about wanting something better is sure to be swept away by the fantasy of the film. Cooper and Gaga not only have tremendous chemistry, but also find a way to create an on-screen romance replete with the stuff that off-screen romances are truly made of.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott delivers the most authentic performance in the film."
"GaryKurt101","9","1","5","7 October 2018"," Worthwhile Remake
","My main issue with remakes is that they rarely seem to bring anything new to the plate and have no reason for existing. With the case of A Star is Born, enough time has passed since the last incarnation (over 40 years), so it's not like the filmmakers only made this to cash in on a popular title. In fact, I'd wager most people under 30 might not even know what A Star is Born is. <br/><br/>This new film updates the story and gives its stars, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, multiple chances to shine. Thankfully, they're more than up to the task and they're shine like never before. Yes, everything you've heard is true - they both turn in phenomenal, career-best performances. <br/><br/>Sam Elliot offers a lot of solid support as Cooper's tired older brother/manager/drunken-mess-picker-upper and is featured in one of the most moving scenes of the film.<br/><br/>The story has been done before obviously, but the updates, the soundtrack, and the wonderful performances make a strong case for this film's existence."

"emkay905","6","2","18","17 November 2018"," weak script and clunky direction from Cooper
","I may be in the minority but this film was extremely mediocre in my opinion. The acting in this film however, was phenomenal, though sometimes Cooper's character mumbled his lines which made him very hard to follow especially when his character was so dialogue heavy, the music is also very well done. However, that's all the positives i can think of for this film.
This film seemed like it had great potential but Cooper just wasn't the right director for the film, his style just didn't bring the best version of the film out. The script itself felt very oddly paced, the first act was fine and probably my favourite portion of the film, however after transitioning into the second act, the pacing felt extremely clunky, perhaps on paper it was perfectly fine, but editing ultimately messed up the pacing of the film. This could've been in large part due to the high amount of time jumping throughout the film, these all felt very sudden and clunky for the most part as the passage of time was basically negated in the film, there were so many major events during each time period in the film but there was just such an uneven distribution of focus for specific key moments in both the main character's storylines in each period. (some key scenes are ridiculously short while some just refused to end) i didn't feel like i got enough screentime in some of these key scenes to really buy into Gaga and Cooper's character's issues, and fully empathise with their situation. The result was a film with potential for greatness but ultimately left me feeling disappointed, due to seemingly sloppy execution of what could've otherwise been a fantastic film with a great script.
Cooper's direction had me incredibly confused, perhaps i just don't understand what he's trying to convey, but his style felt all over the place, his shot composition felt very ugly and strange, i never really felt connected with his style, this meaning how in tense moments of the film for example, his direction just didn't seem to correctly capture the emotion it was supposed to be going for. There were also some awkward editing, you'll know it when you see it as it happens pretty frequently but it was very distracting and took me out of the experience, and some strangely short scenes (like 5-10 seconds a piece) which honestly added nothing to the film yet kinda just got left in, i guess it was Cooper's idea for transitioning from one scene to another but it just felt silly and useless. I honestly just didn't think he was the right guy to direct this film, his style just didn't emanate the tone of the film and the clunky pacing of the script/film just took me out of the experience too.
It's not a bad film, but i definitely don't see this as an oscar calibre film"

"BandSAboutMovies","3","1","6","18 January 2019"," A meandering mess of a film
","Remember when movies used to be a tight, compact 90 minutes or less? There was a moment during this one -- this has happened more than a few times lately -- where I paused the movie and figured there could only be twenty minutes left. Nope. There were still 51 intolerable minutes of bonecrunching, screaming into the microphone pain, drunk fighting in the tub ennui left to go.<br/><br/>You know how you can tell this movie is a bloated mess? Even the trailer is more than three minutes long.<br/><br/>The first time A Star Is Born was made was way back in 1937, when Janet Gaynor played a young actress and Fredric March the star who introduced her to the industry. It was remade in 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason, then most famously in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, perhaps less famously in 2013 as Aashiqui 2 with Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor and now, we have Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>Let's get the nice parts out of the way: Lady Gaga is amazingly talented as a singer and is a pretty decent actress, too. I'm all for anything she wants to do with her career, as she's been really solid in just about everything I've seen her try her hand at. But man, this movie...I was about an hour into it and looked over at my wife, who was overly enthused about watching it due to how attractive she finds Bradley Cooper. Throw in a beard and a cowboy look and I had been told numerous times just how attractive Mr. Cooper was to the point of near absurdity. Surely she would be enjoying this film. Nope. She shot me a look and then said, ""There's no way you can be enjoying this horrible movie.""<br/><br/>Jackson ""Jack"" Maine (Cooper, who also directed and co-wrote this film) is a country music star battling addictions and tinnitus who we first meet on stage. He's in California and just looking for a bar when he ends up at a drag bar that of course features a real woman singing as the lead performer, which is how I assume all these things work out. Ally (Gaga) and he fall quickly in love, despite the fact that she punches a guy in a cop bar for reasons that are never really disclosed. Pretty much everyone's behavior in this movie is like the bars in my hometown around 1:55 AM. If they can't get some action, they're gonna punch you right in the puss.<br/><br/>Jack invites Ally to his next show, where she plays hard to get for all of seven seconds. He brings her on stage with him, then passes out right when they're about to make love. She's upset, because after all, she took the special time to go into the bathroom and dry her lady business and underarms down with a hotel towel for this.<br/><br/>Somewhere in all of this, they visit the ranch where Jack and Bobby -- his older half-brother tour manager played by Sam Elliot, who really deserves better -- grew up. Turns out that Bobby sold the land, so the brothers get in a fist fight. Then, Ally meets Rez, a combination music producer and manager who takes over Ally's career, taking her from country to pop.<br/><br/>This is where the film shows how out of touch it is with culture, as these days, pop and country are pretty much the same thing. After all, just ask Hootie, who did more than just fine becoming a country artist. Jack starts getting drunker and angrier and drunker and saltier and angrier and passes out after doing drugs at a pharmacy trade show he plays for money. I mean, first off, if you're gonna do a pharmacy trade show, that's the best place to smash up some Somas with your boot and do rails of them. Also: if your entire character arc is that you want your girl to have artistic integrity, have some yourself. But let me get to that in a bit.<br/><br/>This is where Dave Chapelle shows up for no real reason at all as an old bandmate named Noodles. Jack proposes to Ally with a ring made out of guitar string and they get married by Eddie Griffin. You might think that I made up most of the previous sentences, but no. I didn't. Other films non sequiters are the plot of this rambling mess.<br/><br/>As Ally's star goes up -- she's on SNL with Alec Baldwin! -- Jack goes down. They get in a fight about one of her songs being about a guy's ass and he calls her ugly while she's in the tub. If it can get any worse, he gets wasted before his tribute to Roy Orbison -- who again, deserves better -- and then pisses himself on stage while Ally wins the Best New Artist Grammy. I literally yelled from the kitchen, ""I predict he pees on himself at the Grammys,"" because most of my humor is of the grade school variety. Imagine my glee when I was shown that I was correct.<br/><br/>Ally's dad -- Andrew ""Dice"" Clay! -- yells at Jack and our hero, such as he is, goes to rehab where we learn that he's tried to kill himself since he was thirteen. Look, I know alcoholism is a disease and all that, but throughout the entire film, Jack has been nithing but selfish. There are no moments where you see goodness in him, only someone who becomes an ogre to his wife when she achieves her dreams. Even after he gets out, she puts her entire career on hold for him. After all, the mean music producer/agent doesn't want her husband on tour so she just cancels everything.<br/><br/>Jack responds to the love of a good woman by hanging himself while she plays the biggest concert of her life, again proving that he's nothing but a complete waste of humanity. The dog he adopts is the only good thing about him.<br/><br/>Ally then takes his name and sings the love song he wrote to her at a tribute, which is some redemption, one would think. But really, after way more than two hours of a drunk treating her horribly, it all just makes her seem pretty weak. I mean, at no point did Ally realize that her career success was all due to her hard work and talent. Somehow, all of Jack's behavior is worthy of cannonization.<br/><br/>Did you get the idea that I didn't like this one? Oh man -- you'd be right. Brevity is the soul of wit and this bloated mess just went on and on, pretty much like this review. Lots of people loved this, it's going to win plenty of awards and I honestly don't get it. It's not for me. It may be for you, if you want to suffer through a clueless woman dealing with a manipulative man child on her way to fame that may ultimately be soulless.<br/><br/>No one speaks -- everyone either mumble whispers or screams loudly directly into your ear, which rings with the sound of deafness. This movie is as subtle and interesting as a drunk warbling an Alan Jackson song at supersonic volume, then crying about what a loser her man is before being into a garbage can in the bar's bathroom."

","I watched this film with no expectations really even tho the reviews have been great. I thought it might not be my thing.<br/><br/>Bradley Coopers directing was amazing, most of the songs were great and Lady Gaga is a great actress too. But the best thing about it for me was Coopers acting. He was perfect for the role and he is a great singer too. I loved how it was filmed to mimic real life filming too. Also, it's not as emotional as people are going on about. I did sob, but I cry at anything. My one flaw is that it dragged in the middle a bit and it could have probably been 20 mins shorter.<br/><br/>Eagerly awaiting the Oscar nominations (and hopefully wins) for this one. Best film I've seen this year!"

","Who are the people who are losing their heads over this movie? Was this their first trip to the movies? It's a fantastic movie... IF YOU NEVER WATCHED A FRIGGIN MOVIE IN YOUR LIFE. The music in the movie was definitely a big enjoyment. Bradley Cooper's singing was a delight. His debut as a musician was worth to watch. As for the rest of the movie. Where do I begin?! The good old prince swoops in and saves a poor Cinderella from the misery of her reality. Yawn! The prince kills himself was a good plot twist. But boy it came out of nowhere. A sleazy music producer tells him something and he goes hangs himself. The story did have a good potential but the execution wasn't good. Lady Gaga's acting was unconvincing. I wasn't feeling any of her heroes emotions. Neither was Cooper anything above the ordinary. This was supposed to be a man with a lot of inner battle that kills himself so he isn't a burden to the love of her life. But only thing I saw was a static regular drunk that failed to show any emotional growth nor fall. Last but not least, Lady Gaga's character's music career went from Aretha Franklin to go-go dancing J-Lo. And apparently that's amazing. Oh well, at least the music in the first half of the movie was good."
"newguy85","6","1","6","12 November 2018"," A Star is Born Review
","I will preface this with stating that I have not seen any of the other iterations, but read wiki enough to understand - Man falls for rising star as his fades due to alcoholism, conflict ensues, he dies either by walking in the ocean or driving drunk, and the despondent rising star finds a last token of his love that gives her the strength to carry on.<br/><br/>Now, given that synopsis, there are two things I would expect to see in the film; either his jealousy ruins their marriage and sends him into further decline, or their love lasts through it all but he can't kick the addiction and takes his life when he realizes how much he's hurt his wife.<br/><br/>I think that where this version went wrong is that this version tried to do both, and ended up not doing either well; the love story was sloppy, and conflict was hinted at but never essential, and the story ended up being about the man and his addiction rather than the love story.<br/><br/>Love story was sloppy: There was a scene where the two ride out to Arizona on a bike, no words, a flash to them kissing at a gas pump, Jack's feet in sand, and then he punches his brother in the face. What could've been a scene where the couple talk about his anger, her fear that he would overreact, etc, we just see her standing in the background as Jack and his brother yell at each other. I call the budding romance via music montage the ""twilight effect"" because you never actually hear these people share there souls with one another. I also felt like we only saw things from Jack's perspective; a cut-over to a new scene, and Ally was at the next phase of her career. It had no meat, they were just head over heels and we were supposed to believe it.<br/><br/>Conflict: When Ally goes on SNL and does her ""ass in them jeans"" song, Jack's anger is shown when he calls her ugly later on, but we never see the compromise from Ally's perspective- again it's hinted at with the dance class and her saying ""it was supposed to be one song"". I would have wanted to see her making the decision to ""not say anything"" and the early conflict with Jack about the new direction... instead we get reaction, repair, and then it's forgotten. There were also other ways they could have shown his light fading - paparazzi not wanting a candid of him, and only wanting Ally, him acting out and punching them - a quick 5 min of film and we could've seen his frustration.<br/><br/>A story about an addict: At the end of the day, Lady Gaga is just a set piece in this story about an addict who can't stop despite having people who care for him and his physical reason for taking the pills being gone - that was the emotional anchor of the story - no matter how many times you scream at Jack to not take a drink or pop a pill. What we got was a rich backstory of a boy who had already tried suicide but whose alcoholic father didn't even notice, a boy who became a rock star whose brother gave up his dreams to keep him alive.<br/><br/>Sadly Cooper didn't seem to agree that's what the story was about, and instead we got a movie that tried all the things and ended up not doing any of it well."

","A Star Is Born is the latest film to be remade and stars Bradley Cooper(who directs this movie and wrote it) and Lady Gaga and tells the story about this troubled musician named Jackson Maine who falls in love with an inspiring singer/songwriter named Ally who he meets at a gay bar. As he is helping Ally with her stardom will her career ruin their own relationship as a man wants to take her away from Jackson and become an International pop star?<br/><br/>Lady Gaga totally knocked it out of the park as Ally and her chemistry with Bradley was brilliant;as it reminded me of Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoniex's chemistry in the 2005 biopic Walk The Line. Bradley Cooper was brilliant in this movie as the Alcoholic/Drug Addict Jackson Maine and his directing was brilliant also. For his singing voice oh boy can he sing so good as well as play the guitar. If he doesn't win an award for this film I will be upset,same goes to Lady Gaga.<br/><br/>
The last 10 minutes of this film had both me and my mum in tears as Spoiler alert(Jackson commits suicide in the end by hanging himself in the garage) and the last song I'll Never Love Again was such a heartbreaking/beautiful ballad sung by Gaga on stage.<br/><br/>
For 2 hours and 20 minutes this film is such an emotional rollercoaster ride I'm still crying over it. For someone who wasn't a fan of Lady Gaga she won me over in this movie<br/><br/>My advice believe the hype and enjoy this brilliant Oscar Worthy flick.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Bring home the Oscars and the Golden Globes Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper i 2019."

"Kingslaay","Null","1","7","16 November 2018"," Not even nearly as good as it's made out to be
","A Star is Born was a mediocre film. The only redeemable quality is the decent acting by Bradley Cooper and Lady Ga Ga.<br/><br/>The script is poorly written and executed. Jack's backstory is barely touched upon. We see a spiralling drunk but the reason he got that way is not fully explained. The lack of development, dull scenes and overuse of unexplained emotion made a weak and depressing film. Even the end was underwhelming as she just performs to an audience and the film suddenly finishes.<br/><br/>In this story is a great film, possibly a masterpiece. If rewritten, change of directors and pace it could have been great. But the outcome is an unimpressive film. I stand by the principle that one must judge on a film's merit rather than be one of the many sheep screaming praise."

","I usually am the type of person that goes in a movie with certain expectations, depending on the cast and the trailer (which i always watch before hand). However, for this one i haven't had watched the trailer but i was starting to get sick of everyone's ""OMG HOW HAVE YOU NOT SEEN IT YET, IT IS INSANE"". Automatically my expectations hit the roof and took my fiance (after convincing him that is is not a girly / romantic movie) to watch it. The very first scene of the movie started of on a great note, setting the tone for Bradley's character but as the story started unfolding my patience started to wear off bit by bit. First of all, why on earth did they have to dwell over unnecessary elements that never progressed in the movie! There were way too many unfinished stories that could have built a much deeper / meaningful story. Let us start with Bradley's character, his drug addiction for starters, why did they not show us the history of that? so that we can connect more with the character. His relationship with his brother and dad? showing us a pathetic small fight, says nothing! Or what on earth was this hearing problem all about! i thought he was going deaf which would have made this alot more interesting since he is a god damn musician. His relationship with music?? the fact that he only played so ""amazing"" when he met lady gaga is a fair play but how but the reason behind why he played with such lack of passion before?? Another big disappointment is how his relationship with Gaga was not dissected properly and super fast-forwarded in situations where it should have taken longer int he movie i.e their marriage ! or how he felt about her career decisions and how it affected him and their relationship and even though she loved him so much , it was a blurry line between whether it was love or the fact the she owed all her success to him... that should have been elaborated on ! i understand this is a book and a re-make but there was a big opportunity to make this the best story telling cinematic piece, because of the fact that not alot of people knew that this was a remake !"

","From the opening minutes, we are fully engaged with the characters and the music is just so good! Recommended particularly at the cinema to feel the bass rumble and have the sublime vocals rush through you. You may have heard this already by now as there is a lot of buzz; Lady Gaga is outstanding as Ally, a smart, funny and charismatic woman, waitress by day and amazing singer by night. It's not until she meets Jack played by Bradley Cooper that she is told her voice is too beautiful to be ignored and has a real chance at the big time. The way I've described it makes it sound incredibly corny but it's not that at all in the context of the film which is very much a compliment to the filmmaking and in particular the stunning central performances by the two great leads. Gaga is quite breathtaking in certain scenes leaving a tear in my eye in one scene in particular and is just a very natural and talented actor. Cooper is brilliant here too, also directing the film which has been a passion project of his for quite some time now. Sam Elliot also appears as Bobby, Jack's older brother, and he is once again a warmly familiar and great screen presence. It is ultimately a film you should be prepared for before going to see as it is a tearjerker but it is also filled with many beautiful moments exploring Ally and Jack's relationship and captures the blossoming of their romance quite perfectly. The soundtrack is awesome too to say the least; such an important part of the narrative and they do such a good job of excentuating that and spending just as much time and effort into the quality songwriting and performance as well as the drama of the story"

","A story of love. What performances, Wow! Challenging to remain dry eyed throughout."
"v-07857","9","0","1","24 January 2020"," Outstanding Movie, You need to see it if you haven't.
","I did not want to see this movie, but my mom drug me to theaters because she had seen Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand in the 1976 version of A Star Is Born growing up. After seeing it the first time I absolutely fell in love with the film. It has become one of my favorite movies. The way Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are able to show their affection for one another gets me teary eyed, I admire the way they show their love. A lot of movies that star couples shows how perfect their relationship is and how they live the perfect life. A Star Is Born does a good job in showing how they struggle in their relationship when Bradley is suffering from drug and alcohol use.
As many of you may know this movie is also very well known for the soundtrack that came out the same day as the movie in 2018. During the Oscar award ceremony in April 2019, the song Shallow sung by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper won the best original song. During the movie, Jack Maine, played by Bradley Cooper, pulls Ally, also known as Lady Gagaonto the stage and sings Shallow together for the first time. By the way they look at each other and the way their voices harmonize together, this scene shows that they are starting to fall in love. When they sing with such confidence it made me get the chills watching how talented they are.
Bradley Cooper has also starred in a lot of other films including The Hangover and American Sniper but I think his acting in this film has been the best work he's done. He played all of his parts perfectly. He had to show generosity, because he is the one who made Ally a star. He showed love and commitment while also playing his role of being a drunk. At the end of the movie when Jack commits suicide it sends such a powerful message to viewers. Jack loved everything about Ally. He knew that by being with her she would never succeed in her career, so what he did was out of his heart. Lady Gaga did very well but I can't say she blew my mind. It was her first big movie so I give her credit but I would say she needs some more work. Don't get me wrong, still very well done and still better than most people could have done but that would be my biggest flaw of the movie.
In the end I think A Star is Born would get a 9.5/10. I would definitely spend the money and go see this film. It gives you a new perspective on things you wouldn't have thought about before. It shows a side of love that many couples don't experience. Because they are both singers and songwriters Jack and Ally have an instant connection and are able to connect in a way a lot of people can't."

"l-26061","9","0","1","22 January 2020"," A Star Was Really Born
","To start us off the movie A Star is Born is an absolutely spectacular movie not only starred but written by the man himself Bradly Cooper. The story line is about a very musically talented man, Bradly Cooper, and an undiscovered artist, Lady Gaga. Throughout the story they fall in love through what I believe was their music. Both Cooper and Gaga had very solid performances and lived up to the expectations people had for them. For me the movie was absolutely mind blowing you could feel the emotions through the characters throughout the movie. The solid performances through the actors led us to believe that love they shared was real. For being the first film for Lady Gaga, she lived up to the standards and proved to so many of us that she was meant for that roll. With that being said, something does not even cross our minds is that Bradly Cooper not only starred in the movie but he wrote and produced the movie he was a big part in making this whole movie happen.
One of the greatest things about this movie is the love story behind it, I myself am a sucker for love stories and this one by far meets my expectations in what I believe is important for a love story. The thing that makes this movie stand out to me is the amount of versions there are of this particular movie throughout the years, I wish more movies would do this so that it can modernize the movies. Something that in the movie that is hard for me to believe is Cooper's character being an alcoholic. Although Cooper is a phenomenal actor and shockingly a good singer, it is hard for me to believe when he is drunk in the film it just is not very believable to me.
Something important to me that always stands out is the music put into films, in some cases the song choices and tie the whole thing together. The song choices in this movie are amazing and allow you to really connect with the characters. (SPOILER AHEAD!!!). The song, I'll Never Love Again, that Lady Gaga sings at the end of the film after Bradly had passed is what allowed my tears to fall. Listening to this song allows you to understand the love she felt for him which I believe is really important in this film. When they put Bradly's voice at the end singing is just a very powerful move by the producers just because it shows it was a song they worked on. The transition was not very smoother but the concept was smart on their half.
To conclude this movie was a dramatic love story between two characters where you learn to understand the love and passion. The film is a phenomenal film and a real tear jerker if you are particularly sensitive to movies. Overall I thought it was a great must watch movie."

"davideo-2","9","0","1","8 January 2020"," Thorough, affecting remake with a shattering ending
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Singer Ally (Lady Gaga) struggles to get by in life, working behind the scenes in a restaurant. But she gets a lucky break one night when famous country singer Jack (Bradley Cooper) and his entourage roll by a bar she's drinking in, and the pair hit it off. Forming a relationship, Ally is supported in chasing her dream as a recording artist by Jack, and becomes a star in her own right. But Jack is plagued by demons, struggling with a drink problem that plunges them both into a tumultuous journey of love and despair.<br/><br/>There was, it would seem, a love drama from the late 70s/early 80s entitled A Star is Born, which established star Bradley Cooper has decided to remake as his acting/directing debut. While he felt confident enough to do this as an actor, we have co star Lady Gaga, apparently feeling confident enough to make her acting debut, but conversely, in a film about singing, having more experience of this than Cooper, who's playing a country singer. So we have a film with two diametrically opposed co stars trying something new. The result is a surprisingly affecting, thoroughly examined tale that will leave an impression for a while.<br/><br/>Cooper leaves no stone unturned fleshing out the development and subsequent dynamics of the relationship between the main antagonists, and, despite their considerable age difference, manages to create a convincing couple. They say behind every strong (or apparently strong) man is a strong woman, and the film is a testament to that, with Cooper as the crumbling, destructive guy, raging with inner turmoil with demons from his past, and Gaga, effective in her debut performance, as the girl who is more attracted to his faults than his virtues, desperate to save him and save him from falling down. It's an affecting tale, thoroughly examined in minute detail by Cooper in his debut directorial project.<br/><br/>There's a little bit too much of the f word (how true that is to real life characters like this, I don't know) and it doesn't always sail a totally steady course, but it's still a highly worthwhile drama, with an earth shattering, gut wrenchingly unexpected ending that leaves you with a solid emotional punch. ****"

","Just finished watching, one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Gaga's performance was great but I had a feeling it would be, she ""killed it"" haha in AHS. Bradley Cooper's performance was absolutely outstanding, I had only seen the Hangover and had no idea of his acting chops. I didn't know he directed it too until after I watched it, what a talent. The whole thing was just so heartfelt to me and so bittersweet which is the nature of our human existence, I don't want to spoil it but if it wasn't for Jack's demon of alcoholism then they never would have met and Ally's star (arguably) would never have been born. All of the actors performances were award worthy, the soundtrack was fantastic, just really great and to me memorable movie."

","The film starts with popular singer Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) getting ready to perform to a sold-out audience, but only after secretly taking a few pills with some whiskey. He sings the song ""Black Eyes"", which the crowd loves.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ally (Lady Gaga) is a songwriter working at a catering hall. She is seen apparently breaking up with someone over the phone before joining her friend Ramon (Anthony Ramos) at work where she gets constantly chewed out by her boss Bryan (Jacob Schick). After work, Ally heads toward a performance while singing to herself.<br/><br/>After Jack's show, his driver Phil (Greg Grunberg) brings him to a drag queen bar. There, he meets Ramon and has some drinks as Ally goes up to perform ""La Vie en Rose"". Jack is moved to tears by Ally's voice, and Ramon arranges for the two of them to meet in the dressing room. Jack charms Ally and invites her to have a drink, but first Jackson performs a song for one of the drag queens there.<br/><br/>Jack takes Ally to a cop bar where she tells him that she doesn't sing her own songs because people have told her that while they like her music, they don't like her face. Jack disagrees and tells Ally that she is beautiful. An off-duty cop then walks over and harasses Jack for a photo, which Ally finds disrespectful, and she punches the man in the face. Jack then takes Ally to a grocery store to get frozen peas for her injured hand. Outside the store, Ally sings the song ""Shallow"" that she wrote, and Jack loves it.<br/><br/>Jack brings Ally home to his house and invites her to see him perform at a show, but she declines as she has to go to work. Ally returns home to her father Lorenzo (Andrew Dice Clay) and his friends, who all work together as part of a limo driving service.<br/><br/>Phil later goes to Ally's home to pick her up to fly her to the show, but Ally insists that she has to work. While at work, Ally gets annoyed when Bryan chastises her for being late, so she finally decides to quit, and she takes Ramon with her to fly and see Jack, who starts by performing one of his hits, ""Maybe It's Time"". At the show, Jack invites a nervous and hesitant Ally onstage to sing ""Shallow"" together, and the audience loves it. Videos of their performance becomes a viral sensation.<br/><br/>Jack brings Ally back to his hotel room for some alone time. However, Jack gets high and passes out. His manager/older brother Bobby (Sam Elliott) has to help Jack into bed. Bobby tells Ally that he hasn't seen Jack perform like that in a while, and he credits her for that, but he also warns her to be careful around him.<br/><br/>Ally starts to join Jack as he tours around the country, and they start to form a relationship. One day, Jack tries to bring Ally to a farm that he bought for Bobby, only to find that Bobby sold it. He finds Bobby and punches him in the face, feeling that Bobby betrayed him and their late father. Bobby blames their alcoholic dead father for introducing Jack to alcohol when Jack was only a teenager and he states that their father's body was washed away in a storm. Bobby then quits working with Jack.<br/><br/>Ally joins Jack for another performance onstage to sing ""Always Remember Us This Way"". After the show, Ally meets Rez Gavron (Rafi Gavron), a record producer who wants to sign her to his label. Although he's not crazy about the idea, Jack supports Ally's choice to join the label and stands behind her.<br/><br/>Ally soon becomes a rising star in music, and she and Jack start to live together at a country house with a dog named Charlie. During one of her shows, she chooses to leave her dancers offstage, which doesn't sit well with Rez. He also suggests that she dye her brown hair blonde, which Ally doesn't want to do. She eventually dyes it a bright red color.<br/><br/>Jack tells Ally that he will be at one of her shows, but he actually gets loaded and passes out in front of the home of his old friend, George ""Noodles"" Stone (Dave Chappelle), a retired musician. Noodles invites Jack inside to share a meal with his wife and kids. Ally later shows up and forgives Jack for missing out on her. He goes into another room and cuts a piece of guitar string to fashion into a ring. With it, he uses it to propose to Ally, and Noodles then suggests that he can arrange for them to be married the same day. With several people in attendance, Jack and Ally tie the knot in a private wedding ceremony.<br/><br/>Over the next few months, Ally's career continues to skyrocket, while Jack career deteriorates and he continues to hide his substance abuse from the public. Rez books Ally a spot as the musical guest on ""Saturday Night Live"" where Alec Baldwin is hosting. She performs a new song, ""Why Did You Do That?"" As Jack watches Ally onstage, Bobby shows up, and the two of them reconcile.<br/><br/>While Ally is taking a bath, a very drunk Jack starts to berate Ally for her suggestive new song, making her seem and calling her ugly. Ally angrily throws Jack out.<br/><br/>Ally gets nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. Jack is hired to play a Roy Orbison tribute with a younger artist. During the performance of ""Pretty Woman,"" Ally notices that Jack is clearly drunk/high, but he manages to make it through the song.<br/><br/>Later at the Grammys, Halsey announces Ally as the Best New Artist winner. Ally goes up to accept and gives a speech, but the very drunk Jack screws it up by hobbling onstage and then pissing himself right next to Ally, and finally fainting on stage. Lorenzo and his friends bring Jack into a nearby bathroom where he yells at Jack for ruining Ally's big night. Ally stays by Jack's side in the shower.<br/><br/>Some time later, Jack enters a rehab program and attends weekly group AA meetings. When Ally visits him, Jack tearfully apologizes to her for what he's been doing.<br/><br/>Another time later, Jack finally comes home from rehab. Ally tries to suggest to Rez that Jack join her for her upcoming tour to rejuvenate his career, but he says that's out of the question for the stress might trigger a relapse, and Ally says she would rather cancel the tour at the risk of her own career. Rez later personally talks to Jack at his home and tells him that he ought to stay away from Ally because he is just going to drag her down with his behavior and substance use.<br/><br/>Before heading to one of her shows, Ally tells Jack that she is canceling her tour so that they can spend the summer together. Jack promises he will go to her last concert and try to stay sober.<br/><br/>Ally is at her show waiting for Jack to show up, but he is at home, having taken some pills and booze. He goes into his garage with his belt and shuts the door with Charlie sitting outside. In between songs, Ally asks someone to go to the house to pick Jack up, but he has already hung himself.<br/><br/>After learning of Jack's suicide, Ally is distraught and spends time alone, but she has a mental breakdown and smashes a couple of her framed posters. Bobby consoles her and tells her that Jack's death was his own fault and not her own. She is remorseful because the last thing she did was lie to him.<br/><br/>A memorial service for Jack is held. Ally performs a song that Jack had written but never sang called ""I'll Never Love Again"". As she sings, there are clips shown of the time the two spent together, ending with Jack singing the end of the song himself for Ally."

"jayjaycee","10","0","2","28 October 2019"," The tragic side of superstardom
","""A Star Is Born"" is a 2018 musical drama directed by Bradley Cooper starring him and Lady Gaga in the leading roles. Exactly one year ago, I was watching this film with my then girlfriend and was absolutely impressed by it. Not only played it a key role in my relationship, it's even my favourite movie of 2018. And after rewatching it, my personal opinion is even more confirmed. Coopers directorial debut is a flat out masterpiece. It might be the third remake of a story as old as time, but he excellently managed to put it in the modern times. It's a love story with music in it's blood, not only this, it tackles even more important themes: drug and alcohol addiction, the importance of never losing oneself and especially, the shadow side of fame. It's a perfect portrait of a musician dealing with his demons and declining fame and the rise of a promising talent all the same. Both parts are outstandingly played by their respective actors, Cooper and Gaga, and it was a shame that neither of them won the academy award for their performance. They both acted with extreme passion (surprising: Gaga) and both showed their immense musicality (unexpected: Cooper). Furthermore, it's an amazing overview of how the modern music industry works. The character development of both Jack and Ally is absolutely well paced and tragically shows us how much success influences your personality. Next to this, the plot is written with such great empathy and it extremely effects the overall atmosphere. Also, this film has one of the greatest soundtracks of the recent years and, as it's usually not my habit, many of the songs are still in my playlist. As if that was not enough, the final act is even the most touching part of it all. The camera work and editing make it possible to capture the absolutely heartbreaking scenes and the overdose of emotions linked to them. It's absolutely devastating and sad, it hits you with such vehemence that it will leave you speechless after it. Honestly, I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried my eyes out, especially with this rewatch where I knew what's gonna happen, but this time I could understand how it all comes together. All in all, this drama is an outstanding masterpiece that manages to combine both a love story and drama to an absolute tragedy. With convincing and genuine performances and excellent writing it offers a critical look at superstardom and the interpretation of talent . One of the most heartbreaking dramas of the recent years and one of my favourites in general."

","Beautiful acting, performing, directing, editing. I didnt like a single song but could see the beauty in them all. It does require your full attention for the full effect (very difficult for some these days, as evinced by the other reviews here.)<br/><br/>The story is updated - a contemporary view of a life destroyed by pain and drugs and/or alcohol. The love story and rise and fall and more are just the vehicles. It is so successful that I think that's why its loved AND hated. Alcoholics hate seeing the truth and consequences of their actions."

"pswanson00","9","0","1","11 October 2019"," Surprisingly good
","First: before this film, I was really not aware of who Bradley Cooper is, and was barely aware of Lady Gaga. When I heard that the film was being made, I thought ""Again! How many times do they need to film this story?"" I like each of the three earlier versions to varying degrees, and this version is worthy to hold up its head in the company of the others. I really enjoyed seeing Ms. Germanotta (her real name) without feathers and makeup, and to hear that she can REALLY sing! Over the years there has been more than one popular artist who had minimal talent, but good electronic voice enhancement, and choreography to distract from the music. Gaga is not one of those; she is the real deal. I was surprised to see that Mr. Cooper is a reasonable singer himself, and either really plays guitar, or is very good at simulating it. I cannot remember the last time that music went straight to my emotions the way that some of the songs in this film did. The first time the 2 characters sang ""Shallow"" in concert, I just sat in front of the TV blubbering and blowing my nose. I found it amazing that Bradley cooper also directed. I'm goin to have to seek out more of his work. Minor sidebar: I ride motorcycles and love dogs, and I was delighted that one of each was featured in this movie."
"janoffpeter","1","0","4","5 October 2019"," Wake me when it's over!
","It's pretty amazing what star power can do. Just because the two leads are superstars doesn't mean this tired old rehash is any good. Bradley Cooper is always typecast as a debonair leading man and generally pulls it off regardless of whatever lousy script he's handed. But Gaga? Please. She should have quit while she was ahead with her music and during or after her string of hits. Poker Face and Alejandro were good tunes. But an actress she's definitely not and is simply ruining her musical legacy by performing in this contrived bore. People should do what they do best. Acting isn't for everyone."
"JelenaG890","7","0","1","4 October 2019"," Good, but not great
","Okay, the elephant in the room first. It's a remake, of a remake, of a remake. There have been four versions of ""A Star is Born"" and I've seen all four. My favorite is Judy Garland's, since it is truly a great showcase for her as an actress and the amazing singer that she was.<br/><br/>It's not an original story, of course, but I give high marks for the music first and foremost. Secondly, Lady Gaga is a very good actress. I didn't really expect to be impressed by her, but I thought she was the right fit for this part. Just like Judy Garland, it showcased her as both a singer and a good dramatic actress. Also, she is quite pretty, naturally, without all the crazy makeup and costumes that she always wears.<br/><br/>I was less impressed with Bradley Cooper, to be truthful. He's a good actor, but I thought this film was slightly overrated as a whole. If the music hadn't been fantastic, I'm not sure you would have heard as much about it as you did."

"samwillpearce","7","0","1","3 September 2019"," A solid retelling of the classic tale
","""A Star is Born"" may be the definition of Oscar bait, yet the film does enough to differentiate itself from previous versions and is legitimately enjoyable on its own. Well-crafted and emotional, ""A Star is Born"" is well worth the watch for cinephiles and average movie-goers alike.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful in so many ways. The most outstanding is the cinematography; the visuals in the movie are captivating and gorgeous. This makes sense, as a movie about musicians is free to play around with bright colorful lighting and energetic camera work during the musical performances. Even outside of the music scenes though, every frame in the movie is a work of art. An absolute pleasure to the eye.<br/><br/>The acting is also a major highlight, specifically the chemistry between the leads. I remember being surprised at the casting of Lady Gaga in a big dramatic role (I'd guess I'd never thought of her as an actress), and even more surprised that she got an acting nomination, but after finally watching this movie long after awards season came to a close, it became clear to me that there was no better choice for the role. Her chemistry with Bradley Cooper is incredible; both leads do their absolute best to make this relationship real, emotionally charged, and heartbreaking in the end. Sam Elliott is also a standout, of course, as he is in any role.<br/><br/>And of course, one can't talk about ""A Star is Born"" without mentioning the phenomenal music. The soundtrack is also incredible, and the way that the individual songs mirror the action taking place on screen is even better. The soundtrack album is one of those where, if you listen to it before even watching the film, you're likely to go into it liking the movie before you've even seen it.<br/><br/>Regrettably, the only thing standing between this movie and near perfection is issues with the script. The time frame for the movie is not made clear at all, it could have taken place over a month or a few years and we wouldn't know the difference. This muddles Jack and Ally's relationship a bit, although clearly they are somewhat instantly attracted to one another, it's not made clear how long their tour together is, or how long it takes Ally to record and release her debut album, or how long after they met they get married, and as such their relationship lacks some depth as the audience has no idea how long it took to develop. In addition, there's too much reliance on plot conveniences (for example, why was Jackson's driver waiting for Ally outside of her job when she gave him no indication that she would be going to Jack's show?) and these can distract from the narrative.<br/><br/>In the end though, ""A Star is Born"" is heart wrenching, beautifully made, and a musical gift, making it a worthwhile watch for anyone."

So I eagerly looked forward to this movie, firstly Lady Ga Ga has no acting abilities, she just has this stunned mullet look on her face the whole movie. Bradley Cooper over acted, his over painful performance was tedious. One thing happened in the movie that really put me off, In the beginning they discussed how her nose was to big to be famous. She ran her finger down her profile to show how much it stuck out. For the rest of the movie all I could see was her big nose, I never realised how big it was, very distracting. To sum up this movie is soulless and sterile. Go watch the original for a fun time."

In my opinion for anyone who is contemplating whether or not they should ""sacrifice"" 136 minutes of their life, to watch this (average) movie, I would say that depends on how much of fan you are of Lady Gaga and/or Bradley Cooper?<br/><br/>For anyone who is a little more serious about film I would suggest you try watching the original from 1937 (Janet Gaynor & Frederic March) and then the first remake which came out in 1954 (Judy Garland & James Mason)!<br/><br/>Happy viewing folks!"

While the song itself I'll Never Love Again is beautiful- the performance of this had an element of pretentious, public posturing for loss.

As Stephen Colbert said, ""A Star Is Born"" impresses as it never misses a beat, as well as holds you in suspense as you wonder if the movie can really take you there. The film is an instant classic too, as others say, with a remarkable soundtrack that has become a radio favorite in songs like ""Shallow.""<br/><br/>Cooper and Gaga have wonderful synergy. Cooper makes you feel for his untold heartache and Gaga makes you glimpse an amazing empathy that few have, and that you hardly expect in a movie with these beats. There isn't really a movie like this, and the message that comes across is deeply impressive, even if part of it is never said, but only felt through these two actor's meaningful expressions and gestures, and music.<br/><br/>Superb job Bradley Cooper, writer, director, actor and talent.

"classicsoncall","9","0","1","15 June 2019"," ""It's the same story over and over. Forever.""
","I wasn't compelled to see this movie when it came out just because of all the hype. Instead, I looked up the 1954 version with James Mason and Judy Garland, a film that came across to me more as a musical than a drama. Even though that picture had an intriguing theme, I found it to be generally boring and never really caught the connection between it's two principals. This one on the other hand, had a dynamism that the earlier version lacked, and I'd have to say I liked it. Actually, I really liked it, notwithstanding an aversion to Lady Gaga based simply upon her reputation and no other reason. Quite honestly, for a debut acting performance, Miss Gaga (real name Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta) not only surprised me with her singing, but was quite exceptional in the role of a rising musical performer while her sponsor, benefactor, lover and eventual husband Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) struggled on his way down. Their on screen chemistry looked like the real thing, and for his directing debut, Cooper wound up excelling in both areas. The musical numbers, many of them written or co-written by Cooper and Lady Gaga, were particularly well placed and poignant for the scenes in which they were used, and to hear Cooper actually sing his own numbers revealed yet another unknown talent the man had at the time this film was released. Overall, this was a worthwhile viewing experience and one I'd recommend on it's own merits, regardless of any of the prior film versions."

","I did not want to watch this movie but took my wife to see it, because we both saw the one with Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, growing up. The crowd was a lot older than we were(we are almost 50) it was the biggest screen they had at our theater and seats a lot but it was maybe half full on Sunday afternoon. Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have."

"oscarporras","7","0","1","21 May 2019"," just if you like country or lady gaga music...
","First I want to sy this is a good movie, the main characters are well developed and the plot has no problems. After the first half hour you can predict the end of the movie, but is stil very touching, how jackson is destroyed cause his multiple problems (family problems, alcoholism, health problems) is predictable an cliche but the character is so well developed that you feel the pain of the tragic final.
Different to most of people in reviews I find bradley cooper character more interesting than lady gaga, even though both of them make a great work.
The bad side of the movie (beside being so predictable, cliche and with a very simple script) is the music. This is just my taste, but I don't like most of the music in thisi movie, is not my genre, i like the main song (shallow) and maybe another one that I can't remember now, but in general I was bored most of the time the movie was with the songs. Even with the main song, I was tired after two or three times. This is highly subjective, for example I enjoy la la land and bohemian raphsody. If you like the country music oryou are fan of lady gaga then you will probably enjoy all the movie, otherwise you will feel a little bit bored with some parts."
"MihaiSorinToma","9","0","2","20 May 2019"," Music at its best
","A movie which features my personal favorite singer Lady Gaga as a protagonist is something I personally can't wait to see. As the film is aimed towards music and it has Bradley Cooper to join her, it seems like a recipe for success. And, for the first time in quite a while, it actually is! The movie tells a solid story, with a couple of twists which do it much good. It also has great, likeable and even memorable characters, thus is able to create plenty of drama and emotion along the way. The music it features is simply astonishing, generating goosebumps and tons of emotion with every chance it gets, making the overall experience a true pleasure. Even though it tends to be very dramatic in some ways, especially towards the end, it is something unique which only adds value to the movie's performance.<br/><br/>There's little to say about this movie's bad aspects as it tends to not have any. The only thing which I can say I didn't like about this movie, although ""didn't like"" is quite an exaggeration, is the fact that is has a very slow pace. I know that it has to be this way and you shouldn't think that it is close to induce boredom, far from it actually, but it felt that it over-prolonged some scenes where it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a wonderful execution of a great idea which features lovely characters and actors which manage to do a very good job in the movie's entire screen time. It deserves to be seen only for its move, let alone its plot."

"jchen-07237","7","0","1","12 May 2019"," Amazing Story...But Some Tweaks...
","A Star Is Born is a romance, and it is not sappy whatsoever. It is true, and it shows what fame and fortune can do to you. This story was very meaningful, but it sometimes cannot make someone cry, depending on the person you are. I'm a person to easily cry, but this film did not make me cry. This film was deeply moving and everything is well put and the music is very deep and can hit back home for many.
But...if you don't want spoilers, do not read this! After Jack, (Bradley Cooper) hangs himself in his garage and dies, Annie, (Lady Gaga) is, Yes, very sad, but I wish that she could've come to a realization that fame was not important anymore, and that she should sing things that mean everything to her, and that push her to keep going, and to not be manipulated by other people to become someone she's not. It focused more on Jack's death other than Annie's change through time. It was a great story and film, but it could've been improved."

","Immensely sweet, warm and investing, A Star is Born is our first time seeing Bradley Cooper in a leading role in several years, and what a comeback. We can see exactly why he has not been in any film beyond playing Rocket Racoon in the MCU for a long time, cause he was pouring his heart and soul in to this film. Writing, Directing, learning how to sing, play guitar, and also playing a genuinely enriched, layered character. I was engaged and routing for this flawed character from start to finish.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga is also spellbinding as Ally, doing something that no one really expected from her, playing a soft spoken, shy character with so much believability. I was convinced it was similar to who she is in real life, and was very surprised to hear her say in a recent interview that she is nothing like that, she was just sincerely playing a character..<br/><br/>The only issue I had with the film that brought it down for me was the ending, which I found underwhelming, so to speak. It just felt like a cheap shot, an easy route to take in order to bring the audience to tears. I understand that this is how the other three ""A Star is Born"" films ended, but a modern day audience expect a bit more. It just fell flat for me.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful. Featuring many original songs that are both inspiring and heartwarming. ""Maybe It's Time"", ""Shallow"", and ""I Don't Know what Love Is"", are particularly beautiful tracks.<br/><br/>An entertaining ride, featuring two terrific characters that you will definitely find yourself forgetting are played by the dude from the Hangover and the woman who sung Poker Face, A Star is Born is bursting with heart and soul.<br/><br/>

","Throughout this movie, I see a culture change take place. In the beginning, Gaga is the poor, happy one, and Cooper is the rich unhappy one. When good comes to Gaga and she gets her break through meeting Cooper, things change. She begins to take away his fame and glory, and when she becomes bigger than him, he starts to rely more on drugs and alcohol. He finds himself in a dark place and does not know where to go. I feel as though even when things are going perfect in life, you need to be prepared and be on your game for the next steps in life. After Cooper was told that he should get out of her way by her producer, he decided it best that he kill himself. Things did not use to be like this, so what changed?"

We saw joy and happiness, and we saw low and empty points. The scene that stood out to me the most was after Cooper messed up at the award show and how Gaga's producer reacted, He let the struggles in his life overwhelm him, aka. drugs, alcohol, and losing his fame to his wife, all fall at the same time. He feels as though he has nothing left to live for and takes his life. This is normal in our culture when things do not go our way. We see no way out or no way to improve. Years ago this was not a thing. People always found something to live for. What changed?"

","""If we've been around long enough, we think we know 'A Star Is Born.'"" Uh uh, not this time. Here, both the actors (including the supporting actors) and the screenwriters have uncovered new material.<br/><br/>First, we see a juxtaposition of entirely different musical genres - country-acoustic and techno-pop, both in the hands of masters. Actor and Actress demonstrate their respective abundant skills. We enjoy seeing the ever-versatile ""Lady Gaga"" in three ways: out-of-makeup, in her chosen element, and in evening cocktail dress. We see a glimpse of the highly-choreographed and well-rehearsed processes which bring her shows to us. Likewise we see a ""talented audience-connecting guitarist, doing the same with nothing but a guitar.""<br/><br/>We enjoy a plot-line that carefully never throws the ""descending arc"" character under the bus - never shows him as ""washed up"" - but instead shows an auditorium full of people attending his memorial service ... after a death that you never actually see.<br/><br/>Most of all, this movie centers very realistically upon the human tragedy that is substance abuse - including very-sincere efforts to escape from it which sometimes don't succeed. It shows the reality of interventions by others, which once again sometimes don't succeed. It shows, also, that sometimes neither ""the love of a spouse"" nor ""the love of a brother"" - - - succeed.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie - I grieved for, and with, both lead characters, and with the many supporting characters who were in their own way caught up in the tragic story-arc. And yet, I still felt hope. Substance abuse is a tragedy that we probably will never manage to get rid of in our society, and here - masterfully staged and executed on all points - is an illustration of just what it costs. OscarsÂ® were richly deserved."

To me being able to look at a famous person and still be moved by their acting is a testament to their acting abilities. I am a big fan of both the stars so I didn't want to be disappointed and I was not. Lady Gaga was believable from the start ...she was a natural at acting. The emotions she had to portray were so genuine it drew me into her character enough to feel her heartbreak and to feel sad for her. Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the country singer with drug and alcohol addiction problems. He shines in this role as he has in every role i've seen him in. I loved the puppy ...he even made me cry.

","I had little awareness of Lady Gaga's back catalogue apart from a Tony Bennett album I bought so she was fairly new to me as a personality. Never having watched her before I probably had a big advantage over all her die hard fans and maybe some of the bad reviewers on here but I found her really charismatic, both as a first time actress and as a singer. Bradley Cooper, who I have seen many times on screen is equally as compelling, but he usually is good
and not a bad singer as well. I don't quite know if his guitar playing was genuine or not, very much as Ryan Goslings keyboard work in La La Land is equally mystifying but they certainly acted it convincingly. A Star Is Born is a tragic story and having seen the Janet Gaynor and Judy Garland movies years ago I didn't expect too many laughs. I suspect a lot of the bad reviews on here are by younger viewers who have a short attention span for the sometimes drawn out scenes of anguish but it was all fine with me. I've seen three newish musicals in the past few weeks, The Greatest Showman which I hated, La La Land which I loved and this one. I honestly don't think any of them measure up to the musicals of of the 1930's to 1950's but by today's standards I'll give this and La La Land 8 stars and Hugh Jackman's mess of a film, zero."
"isaacj02","8","0","2","6 April 2019"," Cooper and Gaga shine in enticing retelling
","Here, in his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper presents a third retelling of a timeless romance. It is said that each generation has their own version of A Star is Born; whether it's the 1937 original, Judy Garland's 1954 retelling or Barbra Streisand in 1976. This modern adaptation draws on that same arc of one star ascending whilst another falls, but it also feels very different; Cooper's film is a raw, affecting love story, perfect for the audiences of today.
Cooper himself stars as Jackson Maine, grizzled and drug-addled country rocker, cruising through fame down the side street of self-destruction. The film opens in the midst of an immersive rock concert... before which we see Jack swig from a bottle and pop pills on the side of the stage. Soon enough, we meet the other half of our captivating double act, as Jack stops off at a drag bar only to find Lady Gaga's Ally performing a belting version of La Vie En Rose. He's instantly smitten both with her and her undeniable talent. What follows is a love story of highs and lows, as Ally's success blooms and Cooper's Jack spirals steadily into a pit of addiction. This film not only explores the personal struggles of a relationship, but the paralysing and enticing nature of fame.
Bradley Cooper is transformative in his performance as Jackson; his gravelly tones and haggard gait make for a portrayal that is unrecognisably convincing. What is even more revolutionary, however, is Cooper's direction, an attentive approach to a story that deals with tough themes.
Lady Gaga is a powerful force as Ally; we already know this megastar's ability to dominate a stage and deliver a vocal performance, but what is even more impressive is what we see of Ally when she is still a waitress too afraid to sing the songs she writes. Gaga's performance is a compelling one and the director in Cooper is brilliant at playing to her strengths; we learn to love Ally as she grows into herself, with the help of (but not dependency on) Jack.
Ultimately, what makes A Star is Born a story worth retelling is its central romance; this film always rested entirely on that being believable. Gaga and Cooper's chemistry is simply wonderful; theirs is a real relationship, full of laughter, love and resentment. There's something so ineffable just in the way the characters look at eachother that makes their love so potent and only heightens the emotional effect of the tragedy that follows.
Whilst Jack and Ally's relationship is the obvious focus, other characters stand in the background with Sam Elliott giving a beautifully understated performance as Jack's half-brother Bobby. The relationship between Jack and Bobby is superbly done; the screenwriters know never to allow it to take too much light but it still reaches an emotional payoff in one of the best scenes. In contrast, a manipulative triangle that forms between Jack, Ally and Rafi Gavron's hissable manager is one of the weaker aspects of the film, a little too cliched and rather stunted.
There are also a few structural problems; throughout the second act, events in the story (from hastened wedding to SNL skits) stream too quickly by, yet the pace of Cooper's edit seems to drag. These are quickly resolved by the third act, however, where we are brought back to the lyrical pace of the first hour that works so well.
The soundtrack leaves one slightly underwhelmed; whilst the film's booming anthem, 'Shallow' will stick with you for days, many of the songs lack much memorability with only a few really aiding the storytelling. You almost forget about the songs however in the many concert scenes; Matthew Libatique's cinematography is judicious, an engrossing shoot, from the bright neons of Ally's tour right through to Jackson's rock concerts which we see in the same drunken haze of their star. Outside of these moments too, the film is shot with a tenderness that also manages to feel totally involving.
Early on in the film, Jackson wisely states the importance of having ""something to say and a way to say it"". This couldn't ring truer of A Star is Born; despite being a third remake, it's a retelling that feels like it was meant to be told.

""A Star Is Born"" sets a bar for all future modern music movies - i don't ever want to see anymore in a future movies any actors mimicking their music performances or music people trying to act - ""A Star Is Born"" (2018) showed, what can be done when such talents do what they do best and not only one of them directed the movie for the first time, but what a great, modern classic it is.<br/><br/>Overall, ""A Star Is Born"" is a Bradley Cooper's masterpiece.

","Wow, I really mean wow! This movie blew my mind right away it begun. I have never thought that Lady Gaga could act that good as she did in this movie. She made a great performance and I hope that we'll see her in another movies in the future. I have always liked Lady Gaga's voice and in this movie she can show herself more than just a pop star even though she starts to make pop music in the middle of the movie. I prefer her singing more in rock music, for example, in ""Shallow"", but she still can sing in any song.<br/><br/>
The soundtrack in this movie is absolutely perfect! How could you ever do such a good duet song as ""Shallow""? It has became one of my favourite songs and I always enjoy it when I can hear the song somewhere. The soundtrack is on my list on Spotify because it's so good! I just want to say that Bradley Cooper made one of the best movies in 2018 and it should have won more than just one Oscar, especially Lady Gaga should have been awarded from Best Actress. Thank you for reading my review!"

","A watchable but typically run of the mill 'unknown singer meets ageing artist' movie. Some decent music and storyline was ok."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","6","0","4","14 March 2019"," A retread that's still somewhat relevant.
","If this movie feels like the same old song and dance, it's because it is. This film is the fourth iteration of the same plot that was nominated for Best Picture back in 1937. While it's been over 20 years since its last incarnation in 1976, A Star is Born (2018) is surprisingly still relevant. While they're somewhat touchy subjects, alcoholism and depression are still as alive and well today as they were just over 80 years ago. After all, you can't be an entertainer without sex, drugs, and rock and roll. That being said, I do appreciate this movie's overarching theme of ""words have power.""<br/><br/>I did find it hard to suspend my disbelief with the casting in this film, though. I mean, even if Lady Gaga is playing some nobody, it's not like I have to stretch my imagination to think that her character would suddenly become a music superstar almost overnight. Of course, its predecessors also cast famous singers like Judy Garland (1954) and Barbara Streisand (1976), so I can't blame it for taking the same path. Perhaps part of my disbelief comes from how this movie was filmed more like a Lady Gaga concert with little bits of plot dropped in between the songs. If you're into that, great, but I'd rather see a concert live instead of via the big screen.<br/><br/>Despite what it is, A Star is Born packs an emotional punch. Since it bangs you over the head with the importance of words, you start to pay attention to what's said, both in the dialog and in the lyrics of the songs. Plenty of the songs are catchy, and (ironically enough) Bradley Cooper's song that starts the film off is the one that's primarily stuck in my head (instead of any of the ones by Lady Gaga).<br/><br/>A retread that's still somewhat relevant, I give A Star is Born 3.0 stars out of 5."

"annlevtex","7","0","1","10 March 2019"," Worthy But Not Great
","I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did, because a friend told me it was depressing. I wouldn't say depressing, more bittersweet and sad. I was crying at the end but that's not a bad thing. What's the point of drama if you don't feel something watching it?<br/><br/>I loved the first hour of the film, when Jackson and Ally meet and basically fall in love within 36 hours that ends with an amazing, impromptu on-stage performance. ""Shallow"" is a great song and the whole sequence works almost perfectly. They have wonderful chemistry and I bought that she fell in love with him despite knowing he's a drunk. It doesn't hurt that Bradley Cooper is ridiculously handsome, even if he looks worse for the wear in this film. And even though she isn't a classic beauty and I understand why her character is self-conscious about her nose, Gaga is very attractive here. She has beautiful eyes and seems lit from within, especially as she comes out of her shell.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, certainly good enough to carry the story, if not Oscar-worthy. It would never work without the stars' chemistry, which they have in spades. I loved the supporting performances, particularly by Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's doting father. Dave Chapelle and Sam Elliot are very good too. The whirlwind proposal and wedding could have been cringeworthy but they work beautifully here, at least for me.<br/><br/>Now, I wasn't crazy about the second half, and not just because it is sad. I felt ambivalent about Ally's rise to fame, which I think I was supposed to support? The two men sort of fighting to control Ally and her image/career works ok but I would have liked to feel that the Pop style she embraces as a solo artist really represents her. I guess it's because I just liked the songs from the first half so much and the one she performs on SNL just isn't my cup of tea. Granted, at the end she forges her own musical identity with the ballad she dedicates to Jack, so I suppose that was meant to be seen as part of her journey to stardom. As for the final song, while her performance is amazing, I still don't like it as much as ""Shallow"" or ""Always Remember Us This Way."" The film peaks with those two performances.<br/><br/>As for the producer (I forget his name), again, I am not sure how to feel about him. When he confronts Jack toward the end about how he nearly derailed her career by stumbling drunk onto the stage during her Grammy speech, I think he's crossing a line. He's right, of course. But is he just protecting his investment or does he do it because he respects and cares about Ally as a person and hates what Jack did to her? I felt it was a mix of both, so I understood, but I still thought it was out of bounds. When Bobby tells Ally that Jack's suicide is his fault and his alone, I believe it, but a part of me still thinks the producer should never have tread into the territory of Ally's personal life and decision to stick by the screwed-up alcoholic husband she loves.<br/><br/>I like that Jack is definitely a flawed character. He goes from being basically a functioning alcoholic to a Mean Drunk to a true train wreck. It is impossible to forgive what he says to Ally during a morning bender, jealous of her success. So yes, you feel she is better off without him in some ways, and he is certainly holding her back. But there is no question she loves him and he loves her, and you root for his success when he sobers up and re-dedicates himself to her and their marriage. But that's what makes the situation so sad. Yes, they love each other, yes she is understandably devastated by his death, but yes, he is also an alcoholic and you know that there is a pretty good chance he would fall off the wagon again and things would get ugly and toxic. His suicide is cowardly, but it is believable. And I'm sorry, as corny as it was, I teared up at the dog waiting outside the garage for Daddy. Apparently that is Bradley Cooper's actual dog, and it is sweet seeing them play with each other and sad knowing the dog has lost his beloved owner.<br/><br/>Anyway, I cried at the end and I watched the ""Shallow"" video about five times. It is an emotional roller coaster with some weak spots but an affecting love story and mostly great music all carried by strong performances. Gaga's Ally is maybe TOO sympathetic. I would have liked it if she had been a little more flawed, but seeing as this is her first acting gig, she is pretty impressive.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing and it should appeal to a broad audience. I get why it was so successful, but I also get why it only won the Oscar for best song. That song and scene really is the best thing about the movie in many ways, at least for me."

My problem with the movie, though it's just me, and might not be for everyone, is that towards the end, the focus turns more to Cooper and his unraveling, rather than the rise and 'maturing' of Gaga's character.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the movie is great.

"TxMike","Null","0","2","8 March 2019"," Yet another take on the long-established story, and a very fine one at that.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. It is a 2-disc set, the second disc has several interesting extras, including a 30-minute glimpse into what all went into making the movie. Cooper studied voice, guitar, and piano for 6 months in preparation for his role.<br/><br/>The long-established story is of a worn out performer, existing on booze and drugs, coming upon a young singer and sending her on a trajectory to stardom. Gaga (real name Stefani) is perfect for the role of Ally because in many respects it mirrors her own early life as she fought for recognition. This is her first role in a movie and she does just fine.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has had an itch to direct and this is his first movie. He also is the second featured role as Jack, the grizzled and famous singer and guitarist. His training paid off, his songs, both solo and with Gaga, come off very professionally. In addition some scenes were actually filmed before live audiences at festivals, the film acts were sandwiched between the regular acts.<br/><br/>It is a story with both heartbreak and triumph, they pull it off very well. I was totally entertained, I will watch it again before I return the DVD to my library. As we would expect, grizzled veteran Sam Elliott is good as Bobby, Jack's much older brother who mostly raised him after their dad died when Jack was still young."

"sixteenthsaltine","5","0","1","5 March 2019"," Uninteresting in all aspects
","The plot is pretty basic, predictable and boring. The movie failed at making me care about the characters at all. The whole 'rockstar falls in love with a random girl and makes her a superstar' thing is too much of a clichÃ© and it all feels like the sole purpose of the movie was to appeal to an audience of young females. For a better story about chasing love and a career in the showbusiness, see La La Land (it has better music too) . Jack is a charicature of an aging rockstar, going down the established path of alcohol and drug abuse combined with failed attempts of rehab. The highlight of it all was the moment he decided to commit suicide by what looked like a combination of pills, carbon monoxide and hanging. At that point I wasn't sure if they googled 'most popular ways for rock n roll suicide' and decided to include them all just to be sure. The songs all sound generic to me and I nearly fell asleep a couple times with Gaga's singing. There were some moments where the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper made it better. Overall, it's not extremely bad, I've seen much worse movies, but it's not something I'd re-watch anytime soon.<br/><br/>Basically, the only reason I watched the movie all the way through is because Cooper looks kinda like a lovechild of Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell in it and is shirtless at times. And the dog was cute."
"takethedayhoff","7","0","2","4 March 2019"," Too many storylines
","As predicted, the music was great. Bradley Cooper was fantastic as ever and his voice holds up well and makes him a believable music star. It was great to see Lady Gaga sing in a different style than we are used to and to see her act as a non-celebrity. Of course her singing is flawless and beautiful, but she's really not a strong enough actor to make Ally multi-dimensional or to bring enough depth to her character to illustrate a journey through the story. Cooper's character, though more detailed and interesting, suffered a similar lack of character arch. This was probably due to the inherent difficulties acting in and directing a film at the same time. The story also had two slightly conflicting points of view (his addiction and her rise to stardom) and neither was able to speak loudly enough to create a real sense of depth or sympathy to either character nor did it allow there to be a palpable sense of chemistry between the two. However the movie had it's terrific moments too, though mostly between Sam Elliot and Cooper. Both seasoned actors, possess the skills to create a backstory that carried all the way through to their current conflicts."

But, it sure is hard to give this movie a full review.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is great especially when Jack first meets Ally singing a beautiful rendition of ""La Vie en Rose"". I loved the way he fell for her and the chemistry was booming at that point in the movie, along with the scene of ""Shallow"", which was the best scene of the movie for me. Despite the beautiful ""coming out"" moment of Ally, there were still some holes in the plot of the love story, and to be quite honest, it was not very believable. After he meets her, Jack takes Ally to another bar where a random man walks up to Jack, tells him he ""doesn't look like his girlfriend's ex"", tries to take a picture of Jack, when Ally suddenly hits him (and gets hit back). This scene in and of itself was too fast for the viewers to understand what the motive behind what the random guy said to Jack was and why Ally suddenly had the urge to hit him. To ease her bruise, Jack then takes Ally to a supermarket and buys her some peas to put on her swollen hand. They sit in the parking lot and talk, and then out of nowhere, Ally bursts into (her) song, despite already introducing her as a shy character and despite meeting Jack for just a few hours. There was just no buildup to Jack and Ally's relationship, despite the endearing Shallow performance. There was also no chemistry or solid backstory that we could hear about Jack Maine.<br/><br/>
Even though the movie was lacking in many ways, the way Bradley directed the live performances of the movie is absolutely breathtaking (Jackson playing the guitar, damn!). it also touched upon a few important subjects in life, especially the rise of fame and how fake the whole process is for artists who want to be true to their art. Jackson hints to Ally about this after she won a Grammy, when he meant to tell her your music is not you, he tells her he felt something was wrong with her winning the grammy, unlike the feeling of success & euphoria she reached when she was on tour with Jackson. There is something empty in the process of Ally's rising to fame, since she was not being true to her art or herself; a process most artists go through. And, of course, it shows us the ugly reality of addiction & how alcohol & drugs is always a dangerous combination.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie just for the first part of the movie."
"tabuno","8","0","1","3 March 2019"," Doesn't Quite Capture The Ultimate Magic
","This third version of A Star Is Born, this time starring Lady Gaga Gaga and Bradley Cooper is a paradox that doesn't quite hit the highest notes. Bradley Cooper, as star and director, by making this more authentic movie however commendable, loses some its emotional and cerebral edge. The movie comes across somewhat disjointed, with several scenes seemingly just jumping out at the audience without any mental transition or understanding of the thoughts and thinking of the characters as to how the following scene came to be. The sudden AA meeting is one example. The lack of sufficient Bradley Coopers' character's explanation or motivation for his actions much later in the movie is another example. There is the harsh pivotal manager's scene that emotionally twists the audience in an expected but wrong way. Even the unnecessary very last shot of the movie brings a tonal dissonance that seems too traditionally commercial. Overall, this is a credible, great effort at direction and acting that unlike the class musicals of Moulin Rouge (2001), Chicago (2002), and Momma Mia! (2008) doesn't quite capture the dramatic operatic intensity nor the just as important mental connections to the audience. A nice contrast is Craig Ferguson's directorial effort in the more commercial but quite effective comedy drama I'll Be There (2003) and another more dramatic version of the ravages of alcoholism can be found in the classic Days of Wine and Roses (1952) with has similar overtones to A Star is Born but on a more real pedestrian level away from the glitzy glamour of Hollywood or Nashville."

","It's simply amazing. Wonderful little masterpiece. It has everything from drama to musical to romance. With Gaga's Holywood debut, I'm sure she'll do well also in other movies, if she'll ever want to perform again. She and Bradley are a perfect match in this movie and their songs are instant hits. It's hard for me to find anything bad about it, although it may be something that annoyed me: the mumbling of Cooper and his fellow manager or whoever he is. It is almost a perfect 10, in my view, kinda like a 9.5, but IMDb can't let us choose halves, so I'll stick with 9! :)"

","What a surprise! I approached this film, with a slight hint of romantic stupid for the mass ... and, instead, surprise! The actors are true, in the clear and, if desired, banality of the type of characters; but they are true, the life described is true, and there is not much of exalted or fake. Lady Gaga (i do not listen, but i know how to be a singer of absolute talent, sold to the world of pop music) is endless: beautiful, real, meaty, shameless to be seen beautiful in his adorable physical imperfections, good! Beautiful character; Cooper is able to carve out the role of shoulder and give her the stage, and this is from mature actors. I would say that as a first director has got it right on everything. We are not facing a masterpiece, but a film certainly mature and aware of its ""normality"", as normal we are, ordinary people, and they, famous people, basically we are all people, who try to go beyond their own ""shallow"". A word on ""Shallow"", in fact... it's been about 30 years that a song did not make me cry."

","My first ever 10 on IMDb goes to... A STAR IS BORN. A magnificent movie, with such captivating and emotional performances from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Bradley throughout this film played such an emotionally drained character which was exceptionally played, to the point I forgot I was watching a film. GAGA! FRICKING GAGA KILLED IT! Everyone knew she could sing... But DAMN! She can act. For her first major acting role, she stunned the audience and most of all stunned me. One thing I am annoyed about is Bradley Cooper not winning any awards from DIRECTING, PRODUCING, ACTING, SINGING AND LEARNING INSTRUMENTS! HE NEEDS AN AWARD. The story line was so gripping from a hopeless drunk, to the light of Ally coming into his life and how there relationship is in peril as Ally grows as a singer But Jack deteriorates. Simple but so complex at the same time. I wish all 32 songs were in this film, and it should've been 3hrs long. Definitely go buy it and watch it so you can give Gaga and Cooper the credit they deserve!"

","I will start by saying this was a very solid movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the soundtrack. I thought the acting was also very good. Lady gaga did an outstanding job considering the fact this is her first film. I also though Bradley cooper did a great job considering the fact that he was not a singer before this movie. I think the director did a very good job at displaying the effects of alcoholism and drug abuse, as it was very evident that Bradley Cooper was impaired at most points in the movie. I also think they did an impeccable job at creating a very believable chemistry between lady gaga and Bradley Cooper. The ending scene was what really got me. The emotion in Lady Gaga's voice in the last song sounded very raw and real. I also thought adding a clip of Bradley cooper singing the song to her gave the performance so much emotion and really made the viewer feel a connection with them. I also really enjoyed the love story portrayed in the movie. Overall, I would say this was a very well done film with lots of raw emotion."

"plex","7","0","5","25 February 2019"," Did we really need 3 versions of this?
","As a career musician, I approach any film that chronicles the music industry and/or known act with pre-disposed bias and skepticism. After all, aside from family, I take what I do, what I spend my time and make endless sacrifices for, very seriously, and am instantly insulted when film makers show disrespect to the craft by abandoning basic musical principles and adhering to tired and inaccurate oft used cliches. I have respect for both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, its hard to deny before coming to this, they have long-established themselves as very talented individuals. I also have respect for people who are not career musicians attempting to capture the essence of musicians and mimic their mechanics whether it be by singing or playing an instrument. Some film makers wisely stay away from those details when they realize they cant pull them off; Bohemian Rhapsody being a good example, Behind the Candelabra perhaps being another one. I also have to be carefully guarded, right from the start, against any film that shamelessly calls itself ""A Star Is Born"". Films of this nature easily become self-aware and self-indulgent.These days, the popular music industry isn't what it used to be, nor is the attitude of the average fan. Music has devolved to be free, industrial, mechanical, non-dynamic, and disposable, with a short shelf-life and abated connection between artist and fan. Consumption dollars are primarily towards live entertainment as there is no product except a ticket stub and a T-shirt. This doesn't upset me, not really, rock has been over-valued since the 70's, and everything that needed to be said about that genre has been said many times, to the point where critics, desperate to keep their jobs and hide their envy, consistently try to intellectualize something that is innately stupid. If being a rock star was so special, we certainly have had a lot of them, haven't we? There's a half-a-million more in the wings that merely a flick of the wrist being all that separates them from obscurity and fame. I was wondering at the onset, how much homage they would visit to either of the 2 preceding versions of this story. They wasted no time in making a jab at Bab's nose. Then the film continued its long course of one improbability after another, without realizing it IS those string of improbabilities that ARE/FUEL the cliche, the phantom character of the film. Don't get me wrong, the film resonates priority one, it draws you in. We're already familiar to Coopers work in film, we have high expectations. Lady Gaga's presence is fresh in this medium by comparison (although she was awesome in American Horror Story seasons 5 & 6, so a continuance in film seemed expected and assumed). She's got that natural magnetism that draws you in; you WANT to watch her. What se CANT do yet, as an actor, is hide her pain and vulnerability. This is a woman who trusted someone who deeply hurt her, its in her eyes, the way she walks, meanwhile trying to fool us into thinking she's the girl next door. She's anything but, something you'd think success would have taught her by now, but she still hasn't let her past go, still remains chained to the mast. Sam Elliot delivers a strong performance, and it was great seeing Andrew Dice Clay and Dave Chapelle so removed from their wheelhouse, I have always thought comedic people should always do drama after they got established in comedy. The directing style is a little claustrophobic for my taste, the pacing and dynamics a bit muted too. The film is a little slow and understated. This isn't to say ASIB is a bad film, far from it. There are a huge amount of Cooper/Gaga fans, as well as a huge entertainment-base who will be curious and embrace the film just on general principle alone. For me, its a bit predictable, tidy, and uneccesary."

Very worth of its Oscar nominations."
"Dodo-phe","6","0","3","25 February 2019"," A pointless (spoiler) tragedy
","I could write a whole lot more, but hey - I've probably said it all in the title (sorry for the spoiler)<br/><br/>Some pretty good numbers, Bradly is always a refreshment and positive experience - though not at his best. I'd say he wasn't convinced either by the uninspired writing or the (non existent) chemistry, but most likely both.
Gaga is not an actress after all - but good try. Shouldn't be scolded too much.<br/><br/>Movie is looking for a point throughout it all, but it doesn't find it unfortunately, not until the end.<br/><br/>We're not convinced Gaga is a new artist from the get go, she's just too confident around famous singer, who she sees fit the first time in her life, and all of her movement that follows her singing shouts stage experience.
And, yeah, she's the one without chemistry.<br/><br/>Wonder how much better it would be with a better (and younger) actress.<br/><br/>Why did he have to die? What kind of catharsis has it brought to any of the characters? Yeah. Exactly. That's what I said in the first place.<br/><br/>Maybe it did make sense fifty years ago. Both pointless tragedy and old, depressed rock star. People were so much more serious in those days.<br/><br/>Old rock stars today just don't really die from alcohol or drugs, once they've made it past 27, it seems.
They seem to love their life to much to let go. My guess is - that's why they rock. They love sex, drugs and r'n'r. Not because they're depressed. They're simply the hedonists who give priority to satisfying their primal needs (and\or weaknesses, but that's another topic).<br/><br/>This guy could have been some other kind of artist, pianist maybe or some philharmonic instrumentalist or something, something - or ballet dancer. They seem to be so tense and competitive and under stress. At least that's what black swan wants us to think, I don't know, really."

","Bradley Cooper makes a bow as writer/actor/director for this re-visit to the perennial favorite story A STAR IS BORN. Whether or not the viewer likes the music as performed by both stars - Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga - is probably secondary to the visual spectacle and the intensity of the performances.<br/><br/>A quick overview of the well-known plot is supplied by Warner Bros: Seasoned musician Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) discovers-and falls in love with-struggling artist Ally (Lady Gaga). She has just about given up on her dream to make it big as a singer - until Jack coaxes her into the spotlight. But even as Ally's career takes off, the personal side of their relationship is breaking down, as Jack fights an ongoing battle with his own internal demons.'<br/><br/>Lady Gaga shines in both acting and singing - a sensitive and multifaceted screen performance. Bradley Cooper has early moments of credibility but the constant in-your- face dreary alcoholic behavior grows old quickly. The big Grammy Awards scene when he practically destroys Ally's fresh career is most disturbing to watch - as it should be.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is exceptional - Sam Elliott, Anthony Ramos, Dave Chappelle, Rafi Gavron, Barry Shabaka Henley, and Michael D. Roberts are especially fine. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique is exceptionally fine - both in the spectacle of the performances of the songs and in the intimate moments.<br/><br/>The plot drops out of focus too often for the length of this film, but A STAR IS BORN once again proves that the tale of rising from nothing to stardom merits retelling.

","Jackson -aka Jack- Maine (Bradley Cooper) a popular rock star takes Ally (Lady Gaga) a waitress and singer in a Drag Bar to accompany him on stage and basically this is where a star is born. The song sung by both of them in this opening was the best song in the film. Very enjoyable. I mention this because the rest of the songs in the movie were not as good, no real hooks which is to say the melodies were not there, and, at times, it was hard to understand the lyrics. Oh, and sometimes the songs went the distance and we heard the whole piece. Not enjoyable. Song selection wasn't good.<br/><br/>We see Ally's star rise and Jack's star diminish as he is way into alcohol and drugs, and he has a case of tinnitus. The chemistry between Jack and Ally is quite good and one would think there is something here worth preserving and leaving the egos behind. Doesn't happen that way.<br/><br/>Oscar-wise, there is much talk about this movie. I would award the Best Actor Oscar to Bradley Cooper as he has done probably his best work ever. Lady Gaga was okay, but needs some acting help if she is to continue in the acting business. And generally, I am not smitten with her singing. Bradley Cooper directed this movie and did pretty good and we know this because we have long been told that to act in and direct the movie is not an easy task. In here Cooper's directing and his acting went smoothly and who knows maybe he'll get an Oscar for directing. That's okay.<br/><br/>Notables: Sam Elliott as Bobby, Jack's older brother, who works for Jack; Dave Chappelle as George Stone who tries to give Jack sound advice that Jack ignores as he is too restless to settle in one place; Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's father, Lorenzo; Anthony Ramos as Ramon, Ally's close friend; Ron Rifkin as Carl who talks to Jack about his tinnitus; Rafi Gavron as Ramon, Ally's manager who changes her look and he tells Jack to get his act together because he is tired of cleaning up his mess; Greg Grunberg as Phil, Jack's driver.<br/><br/>All in all this is a good movie, but not an Oscar worthy movie although Bradley Cooper deserves Oscar for Best Actor (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Not really.

Gaga (Ally) delivers a performance that is reminiscent of and worthy of these other mononymous stars, delivering a fresh portrayal that dispenses with the glitz and pretension of her stage persona. Even more importantly, we believe she is falling in love with the man who stumbles into her life---providing a chemistry that was lacking in some other versions.<br/><br/>Sleeping on her bed under the album cover for Carole King's ""Tapestry"", she is believable as a young woman in a suburban family bedroom. When she interacts with Bradley Cooper (Jackson Maines) or walks onto a stadium stage for the first time, we believe.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, who also directed, is Jackson. Part Kris Kristofferson. Part Jim Morrison. Part Jeff Bridges. With an unexpected voice that growls like a weary instrument---tainted by alcohol, drugs, and inner demons----he embodies the scarred soul too weak to firmly grasp the lifeline that Ally extends. And Sam Elliott (Bobby) really feels like Jack's brother.<br/><br/>Ally is a person you care about. In fact, the film felt too short for me.

Cooper is the heart of the movie, as it's really a character study masquerading as a musical romance, and he plays the role with subtlety and a great range of emotions. Gaga frankly stole the show for me, as her expressions and reactions to Cooper felt so real and gave us a baseline for their relationship. I didn't think her character was written well and wasn't given enough distinctive characteristics, but she adds significant and needed depth in her line delivery and high-energy performance. The script on the whole didn't impress me, seeming predictable and cliche at points and not having consistency in focuses throughout. It could've been a more coherent and emotionally devastating rise to the climax if it had been more intentional in how Jack's alcoholism affected his everyday life and the psychology and struggle behind the addiction, but instead it just felt like an undeveloped plot tool. I thought Cooper's direction was on the whole excellent, particularly in the musical scenes where his shot selection and lighting were phenomenal. The musical scenes didn't just pause the plot to play music, but were shot in a way that continued to develop it, and the songs themselves were very good. However, the scene where he proposes was completely jarring to me and felt ridiculously unrealistic. I found the movie to generally improve as it progresses, with the early scenes requiring serious leaps of faith in Jack latching onto this specific girl and the unexplained and immediate attachment they have (as with many movie romances, their relationship and why they're in love is never explained). I also found a few early scenes bordering on an uncomfortable power dynamic where Ally was a toy for him to feel alive and excited and he could pluck her from her life and have her love immediately. The realism and emotional attachment picked up as the movie went along, and the late conversations between them and final song both held serious emotional weight. It's a good, skillfully made movie with excellent headlining performances, but a few inconsistencies keep it from being a great one."

","Review:
With the Oscars just around the corner, I thought that I should watch this movie because it's tipped to win the big categories. I was expecting a romantic chick flick, but it actually turned out to be quite emotional and very well written. The chemistry between Ally (Lady Gaga) and Jack (Bradley Cooper), was excellent, and very believable, but I couldn't really get into the music. That's not to say that it wasn't performed well, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I remember watching the Barbra Streisand version at a young age, so I had an idea about the concept, but I was still surprised with this adaptation, mainly because of the outstanding performances from these two A-list stars. The fact that Bradley Cooper also directed this picture, and performed the songs alongside Gaga, makes it a great achievement, which is why it made such a big profit at the box office. Anyway, if you haven't seen any of the previous A Star Is Born movies, it's about a famous country music singer, Jackson ""Jack"" Maine (Bradley Cooper), whose privately battling an alcohol and drug addiction. His main support is his manager, and older half-brother Bobby (Sam Elliott), who tries to keep Jack's personal problems under wraps. After a show in California, Jack visits a drag bar where he witnesses a performance by Ally (Lady Gaga), who's a waitress and singer-songwriter. Jack is amazed by her performance and they end up spending the night together, where Ally talks about the troubles she has faced in pursuing a professional music career. Ally goes to Jack's next concert, and with Jack's encouragement, she sings on stage with him, and they form a romantic relationship. Ally goes with Jack on tour, where she meets a record producer called Rez (Rafi Gavron), who offers her a contract. Jack supports her decision, and Rez refocuses Ally away from country music and towards pop. Jack misses one of Ally's performances after he passes out drunk in public. He recovers at the home of his best friend George (Dave Chappelle) and later makes up with Ally. There he proposes to Ally, and they get married that same day at a church ministered by a relative of George. During Ally's performance on Saturday Night Live, Bobby reconciles with Jack. Later, Jack and Ally fight after he drunkenly voices his disapproval of Ally's new image and music, which is nominated for three Grammy Awards. At the Grammy's, a visibly intoxicated Jack performs in a tribute to Roy Orbison, and Ally wins the Best New Artist award. When she goes up on stage to receive her award, Jack follows her, where he wets himself and passes out. Ally's father Lorenzo (Andrew Dice Clay) helps him sober up, and Jack joins a rehabilitation program shortly thereafter. Jack recovers in rehab for about two months, where he discloses to his counsellor that he attempted suicide when he was 13 and that he has been suffering from tinnitus, which has been getting worse. Ally wishes to bring Jack to perform with her on the European leg of her tour, but Rez refuses, prompting Ally to cancel the remainder of the tour so she can care for jack. Rez later confronts Jack, accusing him of holding her back. That evening, Ally lies to Jack and tells him that her record label has cancelled her tour so she can focus on her second album. Jack promises that he will come to her concert that night, but after Ally leaves, he hangs himself in their garage. It's definitely a touching story which shows how fame can destroy individuals, even though it looks like they have everything a person could want. I did find myself getting quite emotional when Ally was performing the tribute to her husband at the end, mainly because of Gaga's amazing journey throughout the movie. Although it's not the type of movie that you can watch time and time again, it's still worth a watch, even if you're into your action movies. Just make sure that you have a box of tissues to hand! Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This is the first movie directed by Bradley Cooper, and he has produced Limitless, Silver Linings Playbook, The Words, American Hustle, American Sniper, which he has also starred in. He also produced War Dogs, starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, but he didn't star in that film. For his directional debut, he certainly did a great job, by adapting the original screenplay to the present day. The only fault that I found with the film was that it occasionally seemed to jump from one scene to another, without much explanation, but I can understand that it would have made the movie about 3 hours long, which would have been a bit too much.<br/><br/>Budget: $36million
Worldwide Gross: $420.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Drama, Music, Romance
Cast: Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott, Andrew Dice Clay, Rafi Gavron, Anthony Ramos, Dave Chappelle and Alec Baldwin. 6/10"

","A Star is Born<br/><br/>The best things about sleeping with a famous singer are the costume changes and pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>However, the vocalists in this drama are both gifted so sex gets pretty smoky.<br/><br/>After a concert one night, rock-star Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) inadvertently catches a performance by emerging artist Ally (Lady Gaga), and is so impressed by her vocal range that he offers to help refine her singing and song-writing talents. But as Ally's star begins to rise and she garners accolades and awards, her mentor - now husband - descends into drink and a deep depression.<br/><br/>Although this is the fourth remake of the 1937 original, first-time director Bradley Cooper and his leading lady Gaga both make stunning debuts, which helps the dated material feel relevant. While it's darker than previous versions, this adaptation has the added bonus of original songs.<br/><br/>Incidentally, marriage is a lot easier for rock-stars because they have roadies.

Only after watching this movie I came to realise the B-wood version was also a remake of some kindof play or smthing. The story line is lucid , the flow is smooth Nd acting of the leads were great ..
P.S:- obsessed with one of the songs ðŸ’—"
"stevenrotherforth","10","0","2","13 February 2019"," Bradley Cooper can sing! I mean he can really sing!
","A Star Is Born<br/><br/>I first heard about this movie whilst sat around a pool in Tenerife back in October 2018.
When I say heard that's because I was listening to the excellent soundtrack that accompanies the film.
Being somewhat of a Blues, Rock and Country music fan I was immediately drawn to Bradley Cooper's musical efforts.
The opening track of the movie and soundtrack is a barnstorming rocker entitled 'Black eyes'.
This song fully showcases Cooper's excellent voice.
It's a gusty performance that continues as the album progresses.
I actually believe in some instances Cooper's vocal performance outshined that of seasoned professional Lady Gaga.
A particular track called 'Digging my grave' is evidence of this.
Gaga really gets into her own stride when belting out some of the soundtracks touching ballads. Her voice doesn't really lend to guitar based rock but she really does sells the pop and the heartfelt songs with the all megastar quality she can muster.<br/><br/>The actual movie is equally as good, elevated by the music but it is ultimately the two central performances by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper that make this a special film.
I have praised Cooper for stepping out of his comfort zone and becoming a credible musician.
I have to commend Lady Gaga for doing the same.
Her acting performance in this film is Oscar worthy.
She really is truly wonderful in this film.
Gaga sells every scene and her onscreen chemistry with Cooper is completely believable.
Cooper on the other hand is totally convincing as grizzled Rockstar Jackson Maine.
A man who's star is beginning to fade as he deals with alcoholism and a deteriorating sense of hearing.
This isn't a film that you will watch and be uplifted by. It's often a sad depressing film about a mans fall from grace.
At the same time it's a 'Rocky' type tale of a woman's rise to stardom against impossible odds.<br/><br/>There's good support from Hollywood legend Sam Elliot. He has a Oscar nomination for this movie but in all honesty his screen time is so small I begin to wonder why such an accolade has been granted.
Don't get me wrong I love Sam Elliot's work here and regard him as one of my favourite actors.
I just thought his appearance here was rather minimal.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective I am considering purchasing this movie on 4K Blu-ray.
I rented this film. Streamed in UHD HDR I was a little underwhelmed by the picture quality.
HDR seemed washed out with a lacklustre amount of detail and depth.
More fool me for streaming the movie!
After watching several reviews on the 4K Blu-ray, it seems that the transfer onto disc is way better as you'd expect.
A 4K Blu-ray purchase is probably worth it just for the Dolby Atmos sound.
When streaming this film the sound was Dolby Digital Plus.
The music sounded fantastic even in this more basic surround sound format.
Bass was really punchy and boarded on thunderous during the concert scenes.
Up mixing the sound to DTS Neural X via my Home Cinema amp gave the height speakers a good workout. Cheering from the crowd could be clearly heard from above. Drum rolls swept around the living room with much more clarity.
This is a great sounding movie. It can only be elevated by a true uncompressed Dolby Atmos track.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born is a must see.
Even if this isn't the genre of your usual liking I urge you to watch this film.
It is beautifully shot by an accomplished director.
Cooper as the Director further showcasing his talents.
It's a film with touching heartfelt performances from a script that is truly engaging.
I hope it wins all the award nominations that are bestowed upon it."

","Yeah, I get the appeal and would have loved to give it a ten, but honestly I do not think I will watch it again. Gaga and Cooper did well, but there is nothing memorable about the movie. Not that I am disappointed, but I am just too old for fan-girling so the story was a bit thin and it got lengthy at times while being too short to bring any real depth to the characters...yeah, of course I cried with Gaga in the end but that is because she is an exceptional singer not because I was moved by the story. So would I recommend it? Ja, go ahead, it is a good movie. Does it deserve an oscar? Nah, I do not think so, sorry to anyone involved. Now that I think of it would have made a good Netflix series... that would have given the characters more room and time to develop."

Elliott (Road House) plays Jack's brother, Bobby and Clay (Adventures of Ford Fairlane) plays Ally's father, Lorenzo. Dave Chappelle and Alec Baldwin also make appearances.

","Tiene una de las mejores presentaciones de personajes que he visto en mucho tiempo. Como presenta a Bradley en un solo momento es genial. Con Gaga no le pasa lo mismo, necesita varios planos pero no estÃ¡ mal.<br/><br/>La verdad es que no la querÃ­a ver, otra pelÃ­cula de amor, pero como estÃ¡ nominada pues toca verla. Y me ha sorprendido para bien. No es la pelÃ­cula del aÃ±o, pero estÃ¡ bastante bien. La quÃ­mica entre ellos es increÃ­ble. Si bien la mÃºsica, para ser una pelÃ­cula de mÃºsicos, no me hace que baile en la silla.<br/><br/>Es curiosa, o al menos yo lo he entendido asÃ­, la critica que hace la pelÃ­cula a los tipos de mÃºsica actuales en los que importa mÃ¡s la imagen que la mÃºsica.<br/><br/>Los actores estÃ¡n tremendos, todos ellos, no sÃ© si para nominar a Sam, eso ya me parece excesivo, pero solo por cÃ³mo estÃ¡n los dos si lo merecen. El parece que realmente esta borracho toda la pelÃ­cula.
La iluminaciÃ³n estÃ¡ bastante bien. Salvo algunos exteriores que tienen demasiada luz, pero el resto estÃ¡ de maravilla. Te mete en la pelÃ­cula y ni los conciertos, que sabes que es ordenador, ni se notan.<br/><br/>Como director, no le habrÃ­a nominado. Si bien tiene cosas muy buenas, sobre todo para ser su primera pelÃ­cula, pero no creo que sea para Oscar. La cÃ¡mara es un mero acompaÃ±amiento, solo observa, no cuenta. Pero sÃ­ que es capaz de contarte la historia sin aburrirte y eso que estÃ¡ demasiado tiempo con los temas musicales.<br/><br/>No me gusta nada el final. Se le ha ido. Lo ha hecho sentimentalista. Los dos Ãºltimos planos no quedan bien. Imagino que no sabrÃ­a como terminarla.<br/><br/>It has one of the best character presentations I've seen in a long time. How he presents Bradley in a single moment is great. With Gaga the same thing does not happen, he needs several plans but it's not bad.<br/><br/>The truth is that I did not want to see her, another love movie, but since she is nominated, it's time to see her. And it has surprised me for good. It's not the movie of the year, but it's pretty good. The chemistry between them is incredible. While music, to be a movie of musicians, does not make me dance in the chair.<br/><br/>It is curious, or at least I have understood it that way, the criticism that the film makes of the current types of music in which the image matters more than music.<br/><br/>The actors are tremendous, all of them, I do not know if to nominate Sam, that already seems excessive, but only for how are the two if they deserve it. He looks like the whole movie is really drunk.
The lighting is quite good. Except some exteriors that have too much light, but the rest is great. It puts you in the movie and not even the concerts, which you know is a computer, or noticed.<br/><br/>As a director, I would not have nominated him. While it has very good things, especially to be his first film, but I do not think it's for Oscar. The camera is a mere accompaniment, just watch, it does not count. But he is able to tell you the story without getting bored and that is too long with the musical themes.<br/><br/>I do not like the ending at all. It has gone. It has made him sentimentalist. The last two planes do not look good. I guess I would not know how to finish it."

","A Star Is Born: Quite the embarrassing moment when you regret putting on the movie as a family's movie night. This is my first time seeing over-advertisement on a film. Most times you only heard of them because bad films are either too bad to watch or too old to visit. Romance in films are not my area of expertise, as an audience, but that doesn't mean I can't have a good time watching one. With that said, lets dive straight to the negatives.<br/><br/>The movie had an interesting beginning segment. You've revealed the conflict, the possible romance, and given troubled family relationships. Sounds like a great movie to explore. Certainly creating a lot of expectations and hopes from the audiences, but no. The movie glances through these topics like they're not the focus of the movie. Who cares what happens with the dad or best friend, all we want to see are the main couple... or at least that's what the movie show. Lady Gaga is known as a famous music artist and Bradley Cooper for his films and looks. So when I saw Lady Gaga's acting, I was wowed. She did amazing, over-the-best realistic human emotion. However! Her role in music in this film did not exist. The music in this movie were horrible. Diving deeper, she sings pop musics in a romance movie. Sure, if she sang good, that doesn't mean much, however she didnt sang anything! Bradley Cooper on the other hand, was amazing with his singing scenes, but horrible with his actings! Here, let me explain,
Director: ""Act like an alcoholic""
Cooper: ""Okay. I'll just drink a lot and speak a little""
I'm amazed at such a role reversal, and would be surprised if or why the director purposely swap their talents. One thing's for sure, party pop rock music didn't fit here.<br/><br/>Much like the film, I'm gonna point fast to the other notes and not give out detailed or plain explanation. They rush pass by the other characters, including close family. You'll only see scenes with either couples in them. No back stories. Family have conflicts, but conflicts don't affects the main characters in any way. Conflicts gets solved but doesn't yield any importance. How do you show people love each other? Not with dates, but with sex... er, bedroom moments over and over until you understand that they love? each other. Finally, there's the ending moment. A good movie should have either an emotional finale or a unexpected twist. When I saw the ending outcome, I saw it coming. Worst of all, it wasn't emotional at all simply because the actors didn't portray any importance. Movie fast forward a lot, from single to spouse, and cut the boring dates?<br/><br/>After finishing the movie, all I felt was, ""Oh... is it done yet?"" Definitely a movie that is based on another piece of work, and not worth to see it as a film of its own at all. I did not see or knew it was a reworked film, but had the feeling, if it was this dull with their acting lines and music, it could might as well be. Long and behold!"

But boy the first 30 or so minutes was ok, interesting and good characters, especially from lady Gaga, she knows now to sing for sure. But, then, the movie kinda fastforwarded and much of the character depth disappeared. Bradley's struggle with alcohol and drugs was just not portrayed with any detail.

Nothing wrong with exploring that relationship dynamic but I find it weird when people see it was a love story of soul mates.

After a show he visits a bar where he discovers Ally (Lady Gaga), a waitress who enjoys performing a song once a week, since her big dream was to become a singer. Falling in love with her, Jack invites her to a gig to perform ""Shallow"", a song Ally has written. At first she is to shy to even show up, but as Jack starts playing her song she has enough courage to sing it with him. But as one star is born, another starts to fade.<br/><br/>What makes the fourth and probably best installment of ""A Star is Born"" work is the amazing direction of Bradley Cooper and the stunning acting and singing performances from both Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. And ""Shallow"", my god what an incredible song.<br/><br/>No part of this movie is as strong as its first third, which climaxes with Jack and Ally performing Shallow on stage. You can see the courage building up on Ally's face, as Jack starts playing Shallow - incredibly well acted, especially by Lady Gaga - what a scene.<br/><br/>The second third is still great. It highlights Ally's career taking off and Jack's personal issues becoming more and more of a problem, which results in their relationship breaking apart step by step.<br/><br/>The last third is definitely the weakest, as both the musical part and the storytelling take a big hit.

It felt like they had pretty much told the story and they were stretching it out.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*********<br/><br/>The suicide based on her manager's snippy smack down, was so out of character, that it wasn't a twist so much as just jarring. It was very forced.<br/><br/>The manager was a complete lightweight, without nearly enough gravitas to convince the audience that he could bully a kitten, much less a hardened road warrior. There is no way Cooper's character would not have thrown him through a window.<br/><br/>I think Cooper did a pretty decent job of directing but he needs more work as an editor.<br/><br/>Not terrible but not very good either.

","With how much hype this movie received I had a low bar, and I was happily surprised. I still don't think it's as good as everyone says but it's better than many other over-hyped movies. Lady Gaga was fantastic! I believed her 100% in this role, which was something I was very worried about. She's been great in other roles but her other acting roles that I have seen she has played very odd characters that felt very Gaga-excentric. Ally is a very caring and normal girl, which is a side of Gaga that isn't seen as often as her fierce meat dress wearing crazy. She played the role perfectly. As for Bradley Cooper, I felt he was trying too hard to make you believe he was an addict star. I was very disappointed in that sense. It seemed almost like a joke. Maybe with all the other roles he played as part of making this film he couldn't put himself fully in playing the role more believably, and that's unfortunate."

","This is not a shallow movie nor a great one, that's that easy. But still gotta say few things.<br/><br/>For a start I want to adress a scene that doesn't implys any spoilers, so relief. In the very first minutes of the movie Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga goes to this bar and Lady Gaga pounchs a guy because he wants to take a picture with Bradley Cooper. From that moment, till the movie ends I couldn't get that scene out of my mind. It was so pointless, fast, and unreasonable. We gotta make scene so they can go to store and he can hold her hand or something like that kind of a scene. I am going to say one more bad thing, Bradley Cooper did only a decent job as a director. Maybe its not a bad thing after all.<br/><br/>But as an actor he was great. The deepness of his voice and everything. Lady Gaga's acting was good to, though she is not mainly an actress.<br/><br/>One more thing, its true what Bradley Cooper says in the movie. Her voice is really something angel-like...

For sure there are scenes or other things that you won't like/didn't liked, but remember - that's how the director saw it and that's his idea. If you think you can do it better, then go and try, it's not that simple."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>With exceptional acting and a strong soundtrack, this version of ""A Star Is Born"" is probably the best. We all know that Lady Gaga can sing, but surprise surprise - she can act too.<br/><br/>A country singer, Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper), finds his way to a drag bar one night after a concert performance where he sees and hears Ally (Lady Gaga) for the first time. From the moment their eyes meet, both of their lives would change forever. He takes her on stage one night to sing a song that she had written, and it is obvious that the chemistry between them is real - and that she has the talent that can take her places. It is a story of love and loss, alcohol and drug addiction, rags to riches, and of the power and strength of music.<br/><br/>The film has received major accolades including 8 nominations for the upcoming Academy Awards - and deservedly so. Lady Gaga pours everything she has into her role and her songs. She's never sounded better behind the microphone. Bradley Cooper has probably given us his best performance, and behind the camera as director, has delivered a very sound movie. The cinematography was good, though I would have liked to have seen some more wide shots as the film uses a lot of close-ups. Overall, the story and pacing was good, but I did feel like it was rushed in parts. And the music ... wow, the music was outstanding.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and give it a high recommend. This one will find its way into my personal collection. I get the feeling that the more I watch it, the more I'm going to love it. One of the best films of the year and an instant classic."

My only qualm is that I didn't feel a very strong connection between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga during the film. Perhaps it is due to Bradley Cooper being emotionally departed for most of the movie, but still. There was more love and adoration in the Barbara Streisand version.

","I've not seen any of the original cuts of this movie so this review is my honest opinion on this movie as a standalone movie without bias from previous versions. I would say this movie is definitely worth watching if you enjoy good character acting, if you enjoy the interplay of relationships, and if you enjoyed the performance aspect of the singing and musical play by Bradley Cooper. I would say Bradley Cooper's performance as a broken individual with a broken past is probably the highlight of the entire movie. Combined with his singing and playing a various musical instruments he provides quite a compelling performance. Lady Gaga's performance was good as well but I wouldn't say it blew me away in anyway. I think the majority of people who are giving this movie phenomenal reviews are people who are fans of Lady Gaga as a musician and have a heavy bias towards seeing her in a movie that is basically her being herself singing on stage and performing. Not that she didn't provide a good performance but it's nothing that I would run home and tell my friends you need to see this. I think the best part of her performance was some small moments here and there in the intimate interaction between her and Bradley Cooper's characters. But I thought the play between Bradley Cooper's character and Sam Elliott was much more compelling and moving. Overall the movie is definitely worth seeing I would say but it's not the award winner that everyone is hyping it up to be. The storyline is a little slow at times. And it doesn't really feel like it moves along with a great compelling pace or really pulls you in with heartfelt emotion, with the exclusion of Bradley Cooper's performance. I'd give it a solid 7/10... maybe 7.5/10 if you're a big fan of Cooper"
"filmexperienced","9","0","4","21 January 2019"," Shooting Star
","As pure feel-good cinema nothing this year equaled for me the first hour of this movie. Propelled by Lady Gaga's endearing and naturalistic performance (even more impressive when considered in light of the character portrayed in 'Gaga - Five Foot Two') the wish fulfillment fantasy of being plucked from obscurity to hopping on private jets was a joy to watch. The early climax of 'Shallow', just one of many memorable, yet plot driving tunes, is the clear stand out scene. And while other critics have engaged with the films gender politics, and it's problematic second half, the escapism offered here is irresistible. As the film shifts gears to its downward spiral 2nd half, confusing unhappiness with the films direction with poor directorial orchestration becomes hard to do - an awards show is painful to watch but no less powerful for that. In short - the high water-mark for the omnipresent remake."

She's really a singer and songwriter, singing an introductory part of Over the Rainbow I'd forgotten about (and bought sheet music last week with that part). Jackson Maine is a boozed up rock/country star who flies in private jets (although they could be NetJets). After a concert, he randomly finds that drag bar, where Ally sings because they love her voice, performing the classic ""La Vie En Rose"", choosing to focus on him in her performance.<br/><br/>Just like <a href=""/title/tt0104694/"">A League of Their Own (1992)</a> wonderfully shows the behind the scenes of baseball, <a href=""/title/tt1517451/"">A Star Is Born (2018)</a> shows the behind the scenes of musical performance and stardom, including getting your picture taken when you hit a supermarket.

A well written scene with his dog acting as sad as H.W.'s.<br/><br/>It's wonderful for a movie to end with I'll Never Love Again which reminds me how shocked I am to be with my wife for coming up on 28 years with how our first date went. She (a violist) wants a memorial concert but the Shrine Auditorium might be much. (although with her musical friends, I may need a fair sized venue.

He was convincing and even powerful for his role (that was one-sided and had no character growth).

","The trailers are telling us the movie is about a young girl who makes it on stage thanks to a charismatic seasoned singer. Well, that happens after a quarter of the film. The rest is just drama: family drama, marriage drama, substance abuse drama, disease drama, industry drama, death drama. They only had to introduce some mobsters and a rape and they would have checked all the boxes. The marketing exploding out there is telling us that Bradley Cooper has an amazing voice and the Lady Gaga is an amazing actress. They are not bad, but certainly amazing is not how I would go. Lady Gaga has an amazing voice and Bradley Cooper is a great actor, though. So with all this in mind and without knowing this is a remake of a 1937 film that has been remade four times, I felt a little cheated. That is why I will rate it as average, although, objectively, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The story is nice, not exceptional, we've all seen it before, but nice. The actors shine, though. Cooper is great, Sam Elliott plays a sympathetic character that didn't annoy me (for once) and he kind of steals the scene whenever he is in one, Gaga herself was pretty good, in the sense that I don't know if she meant to play it as the natural girl or she was just being herself. It's clear people loved making this film and so it's a pity to see the same corruption of the soul described in the movie happen to the film itself when marketing people get their hands on it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: boy meets girl, they hook up, then the film actually begins."

","I went to see this with high expectations. why not, after reading rave reviews and having stellar cast. Well, after 5 minutes I could see this not going well. The drag club, the unnecessary over performed pizazz which lead to the introduction and the following obsession was so fake that it beggars belief how the screen writer got it past the producers, if they even read the script! And it got progressively worse for there. Gaga's acting is mono tone in expression and tone which becomes quite annoying and the viewer soon gets the feeling that without Bradley Cooper, the entire production would have been a massive flop.
The story kinda goes nowhere, and from about half way through the film begins to take on a Lady Gaga promotion with an over the top hard to believe revelation that she is some overnight pop star sensation born with superhero power of every of superstardom, dance, song writing and lyrical genius. Quite frankly, over the top gobbledegook. It could have to so much better if the director/screen writer toned the instant stardom fame thing down 10 notches and made more of an edgy drama out of the relationship and personal struggles.
None of the rest made any sense. like the desert scene where Coopers character goes to his fathers farm and finds 1000 wind turbines as far as the eye can see and confronts his brother ....

I truly hope he gets an Oscar for best director and actor. I did not give this the full eight stars because I kind of felt that Lady Gaga brought it down."

"jameantegrenkid","10","0","3","14 January 2019"," Not perfect, but still deserves a 10!
","PROS:
1) Some of the most powerful music I have ever heard in a movie. Lady Gaga's voice was simply incredible. Worth the ticket price times ten.
2) Lady Gaga fully exposed herself in this move. I'm not talking about nudity or her sexual body. I'm talking about exposing herself without the makeup and wigs. Especially since the makeup and wigs are part of her true personality. It made me appreciate how truly beautiful she truly is. With or without makeup.
3) Lady Gaga cannot only sing, she can ACT!!!<br/><br/>CONS:
1) Story of alcohol and drug dependence of Bradley Cooper's character was a downer. Kind of sad when Lady Gaga's music was so uplifting.
2) Bradley Cooper had to act like a drunk almost the entire movie so he slurred his words constantly. Hard to keep up with the story when you can't understand what he was saying. Also, he was sweating the entire movie. He needed a shower.
3) Bradley's brother also slurred his words and he wasn't playing a drunk. Hard to keep up with a story when there is mumbling. Not sure if it was a soundtrack problem or acting, but it was a problem."

"gundog79","7","0","3","10 January 2019"," Lady Gaga the Lion Star
","I always thought that Lady Gaga is a bit exaggerated.
But not because of her clothes or hair, but because sometimes she exaggerates in doing something or thanking too much when it's not necessary.
Obviously she is very talented and gifted and what I wrote above is not criticism, but more like a guy who sees a young woman who might overreact things, but the fact that she is more talented or sexy sometimes, it makes you forgive her exuberance :)
In this movie overall she was cute, she acted great and her voice was the cherry from the top of the cake.
You can obviously see that despite of her hair or exaggerations (sometimes), she is a great character and soul.
A real lioness in my opinion.
The sound, music and voice were perfect in this movie.
But let's talk about other aspects as well.
I thought the scene from the beginning when she sings the French song is bit overreacted.... maybe if they would have polished that scene, everything would have been perfect.
Also the punch she gives to the guy in the bar is again another unnecessary embellishment because even though she is a lioness with great heart... she is still a sensitive woman.
Plus that in real life, maybe that guy would have reacted in some way :)
As a subjective opinion I also think blue, blonde and dark curly red hair suit her very much, but not light red :)
Her voice is a true power, voice of sensitive great lion with a big heart.
I think though in a few years she will be a perfect star from every point of view.
I also watched the Golden Globes where I saw she overreacted again with too many thanks and gratitude she has to everyone :)
I mean it's clear she is great and she is aware of that, but a simple gesture of gratefulness is enough I think.
Those who helped her and at some point launched her are just regular people in the end and not Gods from Mount Olympus.
She sang after all with all those great stars until now and she is already a personality in music."
"ekvera","10","0","4","8 January 2019"," Best Movie ever!
","The aciting from both Gaga and Cooper is outstanding they both deserve an Oscar. The soundtrack is on top and the storyline is a perfect mix between happiness and tears and it deals with important issues of today's society"
"andrewmerritt-31652","7","0","3","7 January 2019"," I came for the music, but everything as was slow
","A Star is Born stars Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. Bradley Cooper plays a washed up rock star who is a drug addict and alcoholic who accidently meets Lady Gaga and he is so captivated by her singing voice that he decides that she should work with him. First thing I want to point out is that Bradley Cooper can sing. The very first scene when he starts singing for everybody I was surprised because all of his movies I haven't heard him sing, so for him to do his first movie where he we hear him sing is impressive. He also directs this as well and he has an idea of how he wants this to be made and what should happen in this scene, so I appreciate that he stuck with his vision. And as a first time director he pulls it off and I respect his admiration for his work. The soundtrack is terrific and I loved every song that Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga did together, but I kind of had a suspicious feeling that it was more Lady Gaga singing then Bradley Cooper. Don't get me wrong I find Lady Gaga to be a really good singer, but I would've liked to see Bradley Cooper sing more because he does have a good singing voice. However, the pacing of this movie is so slow as I was checking my watch a couple of times and finding some scenes to be incredibly long that they just dragged forever to make a point. While I appreciate the directing the script could've used some improvement as there were some scenes that had great dialogue and some that weren't so good. I cared more about the singing than I did for the script, as when certain areas kept dragging and dragging and then we get to the singing aspect of it, that's when I became fascinated. But after the singing stopped, I was wondering when we might get another song. It isn't until the ending that caught me off guard cause I had an idea of where this might be going. I had a completely different idea of how this would end, but they went with another direction that was totally unexpected that left me shocked. Overall, I will say that this has a great soundtrack with amazing vocals from Bradley and Lady Gaga, but as a story it could do with some improvements."
"mossow92","Null","0","3","7 January 2019"," Wow. Just wow.
","To be honest, I had been holding off on seeing this one because I had heard all the reviews and didn't want to head into another movie that was loved by critics and be disappointed again. I also wasn't sure about the Cooper/Gaga pairing, Cooper as a singer, or Gaga as an actress. It just all seemed like a combination of things that would never work.
And I'm happy to be completely and totally wrong on all counts. Simply, it worked. It all worked. Gaga and Cooper are brilliant in their portrayals and have amazing electric chemistry. All the actors put into their roles, no matter how big or small fit so perfectly. Sam Elliot is amazing in his supporting role, such an underrated actor. Man, even Dave Chappelle is good in his character as well.
The music is outstanding. So much imagery and meaning to the story on several levels. All the characters felt real and the story felt true. I guess sometimes it's a perfect storm of miscellaneous square pegs that somehow come together to form a perfect circle. Highly recommend. One of very few films I would gladly watch several times and probably will."

"oceanwoe","9","0","2","29 December 2018"," Not overly original...
","...but in this case it doesn't matter. I didn't expect too much, although I saw the reviews was surprisingly good. I can't really say anything bad about it. The story build-up works, but what really lifts this movie, was the performance of Lady Gaga and Brad Cooper. Their chemistry is so intense. I didn't expect that.
Cooper shows that he had some unlocked potential as a director. Wow, what a debut. As an actor, I never really saw him as anything but a pretty face with a good agent. Here he just really fit the part, and the role suits him well.
As for Lady Gaga, I never invested any time in her producer-polished music, but it seems to me, that the storyplot to some degree transcribes her own pop career pretty close on some points. Besides showing her powerful voicetalent, she also does a very decent job as an actor here, and I think she added a good amount of her own charm to the movie.<br/><br/>Congratulations, Mr. Cooper, I will definitely watch your next endeavour."
"NatKaminska","5","0","1","29 December 2018"," Overrated af. First part of the movie is good, but then it turns into boring mess. Gaga sings great, but she plays herself & Cooper is good alcoholic, but overall bland.
","This is the one movie of the year, where I really wonder how it has been recognized as such a masterpiece by almost everyone, and really it is just one more remake of very well - known Hollywood story, clichÃ© love story and familiar tale about glamour and pain of fame. For me it is nothing special, I prefer movies that bring something new to the cinema, from the technical side or from the plot/storytelling side, this film brings nothing new.<br/><br/>Lady Gaga plays Ally, a very musically talented girl, who works in a restaurant and occasionally, in the evenings, gives performances at a local bar. She dreams of being a real singer, but like so many artistic souls, she has complexes and little faith in herself, she doesn't have enough strength to face the brutality and falsity of the show business. And then one night, she meets Jack (Cooper) - famous and accomplished singer& artist, who is on the way down, destroyed by fame, his demons and alcoholism. He watches her performance, is delighted with her talent and herself, and from that moment things go fast - they fall in love with each other, Jack helps Ally become a real star etc. However, of course, only then the real problems start to emerge, Jack cannot defeat his demons, the finale is tragic, which can be seen from miles away, the most clichÃ© ending in the world, calculated for cheap emotions.<br/><br/>Yes, the first part of the movie : all Ally's way to the top and a thriving romance is a well made story, and Gaga& Cooper have an undeniable chemistry, but that's absolutely no masterpiece.<br/><br/>Problems of this film begin in the second part. The script very quickly and superficially jumps to Ally's success, and although we see Jack struggling with addiction and childhood demons, the protagonists' motives are shown very superficially and unconvincingly, real drama/conflict is nowhere to be found, there is a boring story about family drama, emerging from poor dialogues. During the second part of the movie, in one moment, I found out, that from the boredom, I did not even remember what exactly characters said a second before, because I started thinking about something completely different. Cooper is good alcoholic, but so were 10000 actors in 100 different movies before, the rest of his role is bland. It was even one really bad moment from Cooper, when Jack started crying, talking about attempted suicide - it was so fake, really bad acting (sorry, coz I like Cooper, but this is just how I see it).<br/><br/>The same goes with Sam Elliott, I genuinely don't understand what fuss is about and how is he supposed to win Oscar for best supporting role. He has maybe 5 scenes in the whole movie and he's not doing anything innovative in them.<br/><br/>Music, I admit, is very good and ''Shallow'' will win Oscar for best song, there is not doubt abt this one. Gaga sings great and imo is better than Cooper with her acting, but she still just plays herself, nothing special and I hope Glenn Close will finally win her Oscar, she is fantastic in ''The Wife''. I feel like a lot of people are exaggerating in the assessment of this film, because how they feel about music, great music makes them emotional ( the same case with ''Bohemian Rhapsody''), but we are supposed to rate the movie/acting not music and singing.<br/><br/>So, in general, the movie is massively overhyped. It's 6/10 from me."
"adamsosnowski","10","0","2","29 December 2018"," A story about love, family and truth
","Many words have been already said about this fantastic movie and of course most of them are true - the music is great, the actors are awesome, the screenplay is smart and interesting.<br/><br/>The most striking one for me, however, is the fact that this is a wonderful movie about the desire of having a loving family and living within the truth, especially when it comes to art. Above all Jack, the main character, is looking for a family and a home. He didn't find it with his father and that's why since being a boy he is seeking for love. He found it with Ally. The sad thing is that she needed a bit longer to realize that love is more important than success. But that is the true message of ""A Star Is Born"": love, family and truth are more important than anything else and if you don't live according to these values tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>That's why I consider it to be a conservative film, but one that is so subtle, gentle and heart-warming that it speaks directly to your soul. Watch it and be amazed."

","I watched this movie yesterday due to the high ratings and reviews. Like some reviews said this is a good movie but not a great one. Acting and chemistry between both actors are good and natural. The movie was about how a struggling bar singer rose to fame and became a star with the sacrifice of Jackson. The ending was tragic and sad to see Jackson chose the wrong decision to end his life. He could have gone to rehab or separated from Ally. I feel that real artists can relate to this movie. It was also sad when Ally's agent told Jackson he was derailing her career. I didn't know what happen to Jackson in the closed garage but I feel that there was a lacking of the emotion breakdown or feel of pain from Ally when she was so much in love with her husband. The emotions at the end were not deep enough I have to give it 8 stars."

"owanitall","6","0","1","26 December 2018"," The title doesn't quite fit
","I haven't seen any other versions and had only a vague idea about the story. But it was pretty obvious from the beginning where things were going, making for a rather depressing watch. More so as I found the title kind of misleading. It's not really a story about a star being born. It's the opposite. It's much more about Jack (Bradley Cooper) than it is about Ally (Lady Gaga). His character is the one with a back story and motivations and surprise revelations. Hers never quite gets developed. It didn't help that her initial rise seemed so improbable it felt inauthentic. Her club performance was appropriately amateur and awkward. Then suddenly she is on a huge stage in front of thousands of strangers and she is perfectly fine. Of course, you could say that at the club she was pretending to be someone else while in those performances she was singing her own songs in her own voice and language with her own hair and face. But still, to deliver a flawless duet without so much as a soundcheck, never mind a rehearsal - that's stuff out of fairy tales and this is decidedly not a fairy tale.<br/><br/>The movie still works thanks to two ingredients - impeccable acting across the board and the songs. More than anything, the lyrics that vividly express the characters' feelings - something that if spoken, would have sounded cheesy. There's also a wonderful symbolism in the way a song about leaving the shallow and going for the deep becomes ""Shallow"" towards the end. I just wish the movie didn't pop to the surface the moment the music would stop playing. I get it that perhaps they didn't want to ruin the poetry by spelling it out, but I wish they found a way to infuse the rest of the movie with more of the depth that was there in the songs.<br/><br/>And on a shallow note, I wish they washed Bradley Cooper's hair. It looked gross even when he wasn't supposed to be a dirty mess."
"hgopaul-13273","7","0","2","26 December 2018"," Something strange happened to me with this movie
","This movie is good, but could have been great. Some people found it dragged on, personally I feel that if it was 20-30 minutes longer it would have served well. I just didn't feel the incredible bond between the two characters. I felt there wasn't enough build. There wasn't enough build into the struggle or the backstory. It made the movie sort of shallow in that regard. Don't get me wrong, what was shown was enough to be good and the movie certainly did leave some sort of lasting emotional impression about me. It's been 4 days since I've seen it and I'm still thinking about it a lot. It did leave a lasting impression. But if there was more more time for that development to get really attached to the characters and involved in the story, this would be a movie I would love.<br/><br/>I really liked the movie and I've contemplated watching it again but I don't see myself doing so anytime soon."

","Orson Welles, needs no introduction, directs the greatest dramatic epic ever, ""Citizen Kane."" Alex Garland, novelist and screenwriter of ""28 Days Later,"" directs one of the most superb psychological sci-fi thrillers in recent memory, ""Ex Machina."" Kevin Costner, the iconic actor who starred in ""The Untouchables,"" directs the 1990 epic Western ""Dances with Wolves.""

Lately, world-shaking filmmakers as Christopher Nolan, Greta Gerwig, Jordan Peele, Paul Dano, Dan Trachtenberg, Chad Stahelski, Bo Burnham, Robert Eggers or Ari Aster shocked the film world by premiering ""Following,"" ""Lady Bird, """"Get Out,"" ""Wildlife,"" ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" ""John Wick,"" ""Eighth Grade,"" ""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"" and ""Hereditary,"" respectively.<br/><br/>But what do these names and feature films have in common? They're straightforwardly some of the most iconic, original and flawless directorial debuts from screenwriters, short film directors, stunt performers, actors, producers, composers and authors. The list keeps growing at an exponential rate with unique and not-so-unique first-time directors on both the small and big screen.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, a Philadelphia native, was popularly - and tragically - known as Phil from the ""Hangover"" trilogy, for voicing Rocket Raccoon in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and lending his voice in Bad Robot's ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" a few months ago; plus, he's been nominated for three Academy Awards for his acting in ""American Sniper,"" ""American Hustle"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Today and after a long odyssey, Cooper's first outing as a director, screenwriter and singer is a stellar debut, specifically, the fourth iteration of the 1937 Janet Gaynor and Fredric March-starred romantic film of the same name.<br/><br/>Being honest, it's my duty to acknowledge I haven't seen any of the previous three movies, my knowledge about them does not go beyond what I have had the pleasure of extracting from think pieces, interviews and critics' reviews. It's also my duty to acknowledge, due to the nature of this new movie, it's not a remake that gets inventiveness as greatest grip; Cooper's ""A Star Is Born"" does not conquer by raw innovation, but the suitability of the new takes and shifts that make it shines purposely with a force never seen before in the spate of remakes.<br/><br/>Will Fetters, Eric Roth y Cooper, based on William Wellman' and Robert Carson's story, have updated the material with such commitment and passion that not only is the most poignant big-studio star-crossed-romances since ""La La Land"" or the most powerful feature film on music since ""Whisplash"" came out, both of them directed by Damien Chazelle, but is one of the most wide-ranging, honest-to-goodness and resounding inspections on addiction, vice, aspiration, celebrity, entertainment industry and sacrifice in Hollywood. The script creates its own leitmotifs with respect, improves some others, dragging them into a new stylized ""world"" looking to set up a perfectly paced melodrama with overwhelming rhythm, with chiaroscuros making this complex romance drama as painfully as inspiring; A dreamy-yet-grounded portrait of dreams and showbiz, where as one star is born, another is flaming out.<br/><br/>Characters are slightly shifted and/or refined likewise, not only more relatable and true to the running entertainment scene, but to today's audiences. Jackson Maine, inspired by American musician, multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Eddie Vedder, is a country rocker star widely known for his musical talent, his old songs and his messy ""private"" life. Dipsomaniac, downhearted and unhappy - unless a guitar is present, - Jackson begins to catch the sense of dreams when he finds another person to make them come true; a way out that changes worlds, but not fates. Although his final decision could be debated forever, screenwriters are respectful to the original ending, making some fitting, enriching changes along the way, drawing a more holistic design for a man who feels his most beautiful song is gone.<br/><br/>Ally, the star of this show, is portrayed as a ""non-standard"" resigned singer and songwriter who works as a waitress by day and goes on-stage in a downtown drag bar one night per week. Ã‰dith Piaf's ""La Vie En Rose"" is the song she sets free her astounding vocal range and represents an idealized life where success is a sure thing with. In the right place at the right time, she gets a genie and three wishes: attainment, love, wisdom. Ally meteorically becomes what she always wanted to be, achieves to be where she always dreamed of, spends her days who she never imagined with; sa vie in rose, but the industry is knocking on her door.<br/><br/>Stefani Germanotta - winking at ""Machete Kills"" no hard feelings involved- makes her film acting debut as the star she's always been. After taking a tiny part in a couple of productions under her stage name and being a Golden Globe winner for her terrific work in FX's Ryan Murphy-created anthology (""Hotel""), Lady Gaga shines with a role that, unequivocally linked to her personal and professional life, gives her a golden opportunity to fulfill, in the biggest possible way, one more dream. She's electrifying performing her concert scenes, restrained and self-effacing at times, fierceful most of the time. There's a moment of sparkling, boundless power at the beginning of the second act: Gaga bringing out her experienced vocal level at the peak of ""Shallow"" is out of this world; the sensation running through my entire body every time I remember that magical moment is beyond words, a rush of anger and fear that, even in its equally overwhelming single trailer, speaks volumes about what the character and the actress are undergoing. It would be ridiculous to review her phenomenal scope as a singer keeping in mind such avant-garde, generational legacy; that being said, it's surprising the way Gaga owns the most personal scenes, clearly rooted in her soul, looking into her inner self, going through her fears, keeping distance from meat-dresses and martian-looks. Gaga's range packs a dramatic punch as sincere as priceless, sensitive and deeply real, clean in execution; her award-worthy performance turns detractors off, a powerhouse showcase as painful as life itself, a depiction of her biggest dream.<br/><br/>Cooper's Jackson Maine is no question the second best role of his entire career. The four-time Oscar nominee endows with diffuse dramatic depth and relatable characterization a character that would have been another boring archetype in the wrong hands. The actor-turned-director is also staggering everyone by pulling his singing stuff off with a heavy, credible country rock voice that never pales against Gaga's. Likewise, he undoubtedly gets into his character's rough life-of-excess final moments naturally, with such a personal commitment that will surely gain him nominations in both performance and direction categories among the upcoming awards season.<br/><br/>Sam Elliott, America's favorite cowboy, delivers one of the peak supporting-male performances of the 2018 as well. Bobby, Maine's older brother and manager at once, breaks his life in two and that process, embellished by a terrifying Elliott, is a tasteful delight enhanced by emotional bumps, jolts and simple-yet-meaningful lines. By any standard, the actor, scoring a time record on screen, has on his side a couple of nods, all because of his astonishing interpretative force tested, of course, in that (in)famous ""car scene.""<br/><br/>In a feature film crowded of accolades and kudos, Matthew Libatique is the one who must take much of the praise. Skipping from L.A. to California, Libatique encapsulates a vibe of melancholy and naturalness via pink sunsets, the illusion of natural lighting suffuses pictures of a dreamy spirit and the atmosphere of an annihilating stoicism and fluency. Director Darren Aronofsky's longtime collaborator converges lighting, control of form and vision with glorious prowess, the performance scenes shot at the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals and Saturday Night Live are organic and honest because of the fantastic camerawork, focusing entirely on the actors and impregnating intimacy and deprivation into Jackson and Ally's relationship.<br/><br/>Above the romance and drama, ""A Star Is Born"" is not a musical, is a film about music, therefore, this feature corresponds to and pushes forward the plot. The soundtrack isn't as catchy as ""La La Land""'s iconic and fadeless compositions; however, Lady Gaga' and Bradley Cooper's ""Shallow"" is a shoo-in for Best Original Song, a global phenomenon, a hit aimed by a meaningful, intense live performance amid the film. ""A Star Is Born"" has enjoyed a rapturous reception by tracks like ""Always Remember Us This Way,"" ""Maybe It's Time and ""Look What I Found.<br/><br/>""A Star Is Born"" by Bradley Cooper goes beyond a drama piece of loss and pleasure, fame and failure, hate and love, self-acceptance and selfishness; a fable of showbiz creatures designed in recording studios directed unflinchingly by Cooper and stylized by Libatique's keen visual eye, a meditation on Gaga's career, who delivers one of the performances of the year, shakes the music and film world up at the same time and leaves the viewer a bittersweet feeling, mirroring the true nature of dreaming.<br/><br/>This generation's ""A Star Is Born"" is a fierceful breakdown of the toxic excesses from success, a vÃ©ritÃ©-ish take on the false ""perfection"" of an artist's public persona, a grounded and raw commentary as for how music and entertainment industry works, a love letter to love itself, a downright unwavering and beautiful depiction of the little compatibility between dreams and relationships, a theatrical melodrama and, in the end, a vehicle of spiritual magnificence and emotional depth on what dreaming really involves: some stars are born as others just flame out."
"catebaum","7","0","1","23 December 2018"," Still implausible
","Although Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper both deserve acting and music nods at the Oscars for this film, with believable performances and a much improved screenplay to the Barbra Streisand version, it still remains an implausible premise. Firstly, there's nobody like Jackson Maine, no superstar who is his age and dresses like that who could walk into a drag bar and be instantly recognized. The closest is someone like Dave Navarro. Adam Levine, Steve Tyler, or Chris Cornell, but Cooper has made his character very old-fashioned, like Neil Young or Kris Kristofferson. Both of whom would not be recognized in a drag bar anyway. I feel like he should have been a rock n roller with eyeliner and rings etc. to be realistic for this generation. Secondly, it's implausible that his country fans would appreciate a woman they never saw before jumping up on stage the second song he performs to sing with him, and then take over! No promoter would agree to this! She could be the support act, but this takeover beggars belief. It just showed a lack of understanding of the music industry. The song she sings in the car park for two seconds he suddenly plays in front of 100,000 people and then she sings it with him, despite them never rehearsing. Also, why on earth would Ally agree to being the next Ariana Grande and whore it up? She was like Adele at the end! Very confusing. Although I suppose Lady Gaga herself took this route, although she was never as tacky and had art to her act. It doesn't add up. It also seems doubtful that Jackson Maine would still be pulling stadiums if he was that washed up. And the other problem, the music is just not epic enough. If he was such a superstar, he needed superstar tunes. He had none. This was also the issue with the previous version, but at least Kris K was actually a superstar in real life, so he seemed more realistic, whereas Barbra didn't. Talking of which, the final song is not a torch song and is pretty lame, so doesn't really work. I think this needs to be the last version of this movie ever because it's out of date and never worked as a music movie in the first place. Having said that, I think both Cooper and Gaga will get and deserve nods if not wins, and cue their duet at the musical interval. Sam Elliott should sweep a supporting actor role award. He was hands down fantastic."

","The third remake of the 1937 original (the other two made in 1954 and 1976): Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is an established country music star with various health problems including alcohol and drug addictions. He meets Ally (Lady Gaga), a waitress who sings at a drag bar on the side. As they become romantically involved, Jackson helps Ally establish a singing career while his alcoholism worsens.<br/><br/>Cooper the actor and Gaga the singer each take on each other's craft in this film and both do so fabulously. More importantly, each excels in their own well-established craft. Cooper also goes to the head of the class with great achievements as a first-time director.<br/><br/>The songs are amazing. The great Gaga shows exceptional talent throughout but especially in the final number, ""I'll Never Love Again"" which is a true knockout and in the same league as Barbra Streisand's conclusion to ""Funny Girl"" with ""My Man"". The sensation is phenomenal.<br/><br/>As a truly broken man with an unresolved past and the inability to take in the joy of fame, Cooper is a heart-breaker even when his character is truly annoying. This is most likely his best performance.<br/><br/>As Jackson's brother Bobby, Sam Elliott is good but he frequently mumbles and can be difficult to understand. Unfortunately, Cooper also occasionally mumbles in his scenes with him. This is not to discount Elliott as an actor. He gave a great, under-rated performance in ""Grandma"" in 2015.<br/><br/>The movie begins very well. Cooper and Gaga have great screen chemistry together in addition to giving great individual performances. The middle part is rather good though sometimes less interesting than the beginning. But this is all a build-up to a brilliant, emotionally powerful final half-hour that makes it all worthwhile culminating in ""I'll Never Love Again"" as mentioned above.<br/><br/>As Ally's record producer, Rafi Gavron comes off as a rancid piece of slime. At first thought, the characterization seemed under-developed. On second thought, it probably confirms many notorious stories of past record producers.<br/><br/>Overall, a truly enjoyable film."
"stefstars","6","0","1","18 December 2018"," It was alright
","Bradley Cooper was phenomenal, credit must be given where it's due. I just wish he had a different leading lady, one that would compliment him and his character muuccchhh better. I'm not denying that Gaga can act, she can ! Of course the woman can sing and write catchy tunes but I think she was a poor casting decision. Gaga can't help but be Gaga, I didn't see no Ally here just Gaga. It was Jackson and Gaga, who loved herself and that's it. Not once did I believe this Ally was really in love with Jackson and that has a lot to do with the acting. I mean if the script called for an Ally that's self loving and unconvincing at caring about others then sure, guess she was great. The whole time before I saw this I refused to listen to the soundtracks so that nothing could be spoiled, while the lyrics for each were lovely its nothing I'll be listening to again. Every other actor in this film was great, Ally's father and his friends, her best friend, the evil manager dude, Dave Chapelle... just Gaga. It's a shame cos this really could've been as great as everyone is making it out to be had Gaga just become Ally and not stayed her self obsessed self or if someone else had played this character. She's not even convincing when she's still a non famous Ally and telling Jackson how she doesn't think she could handle that amount of fame. She couldn't even deliver that line in a believable way, seemed so forced."

Ok when I FIRST HEARD about this FILM I was in NO rush to go see this FILM WHY???
Because I am NOT A BIG FAN OF LADY GAGA (Ally) in the FILM. Or Andrew Dice Clay that Played her FATHER in the FILM. I figured how Good good couple IT be. Come on Andrew Dice Clay in the FILM. HE SUCKED IN THE 80s LOL.
But went to see it because Bradley Cooper was in the FILM and Loved ALL HIS MOVIES.
In this FILM Lady Gaga and Andrew Dice Clay BOTH BLEW ME AWAY IN THE FILM.
I DIDN'T KNOW Lady Gaga can Act and I Didn't even Notice Andrew at FIRST. But he did pretty good being DAD as well. AND Bradley Cooper WOW THAT MAN CAN SING. I ALSO LOVED HOW THEY KEPT IT REALLY OPEN TO THE GAY BAR'S. THAT WAS VERY COOL HOW HE WALKED IN AND DIDN'T ACT LIKE A JERK OR ANYTHING. JUST SAT BACK AND ENJOYED THE SHOW. HE GOT HIT ON AND SEEMED TO INJOY THE NIGHT OUT. HE EVEN SIGNED THE CHEST FOR THE ONE GUY. ALSO TOOK THE ONE MAN'S GUITAR AND PERFORMED A SONG FOR HIM. WHY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO. LOL EVEN THO HE JUST DID A BIG CONCERT. IT WAS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY. THE ENDING HAD ME IN TEARS. THAT WOMEN REALLY DID LOVE HIM ALOT. VERY GOOD MOVIE I LOVED IT. THE ENDING REALLY SURPRISED ME.

I thought the performances were mainly excellent, especially Lady Ga Ga, considering this was her first big starring role as an actor. The whole thing was too loud, but then I don't like rock & roll music at the best of times, although I suppose this was more country?

"asifahsankhan","8","0","2","13 December 2018"," Apart from a rush ending, this is probably the best remake of the classic flick
","This is the third remake of a classic flick, the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga film is an impressive spectacle that hits most of the emotional highs and lows audiences want from a movie that promises to take you on a melodramatic journey.<br/><br/>Not melodramatic in a bad way, melodramatic in that everything is heightened - the triumphs are soaring, the tragedies are crushing. Musicals are not subtle beasts.<br/><br/>Is it perfect, the most amazing movie you'll see this year? No, but it is pretty great.<br/><br/>It's an electric experience, with Cooper borrowing filming and editing techniques from concert films, filling the frame with an undeniable energy. When Ally hits those first notes, you are completely with her. Her joy is your joy - that emotional transference from screen to spectator is seamless.<br/><br/>Their chemistry is palpable - Cooper and Gaga are clearly on the same wavelength and they're able to have you invest in Ally and Jack's relationship immediately.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen any of the three previous versions, starring Janet Gaynor (1937), Judy Garland (1954) and Barbra Streisand (1976), will no doubt remember how it ends. But even for those who haven't, it's a familiar trajectory.<br/><br/>The idea is that there are only so many stars - one must move aside for another. So the story isn't just about Ally's journey to the top of the charts and acclaim, it's also about Jack's descent and increasing irrelevance.<br/><br/>Telling the downfall story requires more finesse than A Star Is Born is able to manage - the Garland version does this very well and it's inevitable that this version will always be compared to the ones before it.<br/><br/>Cooper's performance as the sad and struggling Jack is brilliantly calibrated, and consistent throughout - he even nailed the physicality of it, from that leathered, fake-tanned face to the lower octave voice and the constant, sweaty sheen of an alcoholic.<br/><br/>As a director, Cooper is exacting and meticulous with every detail - it's a real achievement for a first-timer.<br/><br/>Sam Elliot as Jack's older half-brother and manager brings another level of humanity to the film while Dave Chappelle is always welcome in a dramatic role.<br/><br/>The Garland version was able to tap into the dehumanizing side of the Hollywood studio system and the trappings of fame, but Cooper's A Star Is Born is more ambivalent about the music business.<br/><br/>A Star Is Born is a satisfying and emotionally evocative epic, nevertheless. And perhaps the ""best film"" this year."

Every character was believable to me, and I cared to see what the story held for them as the film went on. A Star is Born pulls no punches, and there are equal amounts of joy and pain, love and loss.<br/><br/>As to my favorite moment, let's just say, when I saw the evolution of Ally's emotions as she finally gained the courage to take the stage and then explode into her higher register, tears rolled down my face. I couldn't help it. Make sure to watch this film in a good commercial theater or with a high quality home theater system, as you need that sense of audio dynamics to ""get"" this film."

","Those who have rated this film anything below a 7/10, or are rating it low due to dislike towards the film's main actress Lady Gaga truly have no idea about the cinema. The cinematography in A Star is Born incorporates wild colouration and editing. Moreover, being a directorial debut for Bradley Cooper, the film extends face value and has more cinematic meaning than anything else. The film is not dependent on the storyline or actors, but how they play a part in the construction of the film. Gaga does an amazing job at capturing insecurity and admiration in her performance as Ally, while Cooper depicts heartbreak and overconfidence in a way that makes it look believable. A Star is Born is what 2018 needed to maintain what the cinema truly is; an artform that records and constructs reality for entertainment purpose. The film does not have an original storyline (being a remake of a remake of a remake), but the way Cooper transformed a classic story into a modernized version is perfection. Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Sam Elliot, and Dave Chapelle... well done."

","I was actually sooo damn hyped for this movie that I didn't listen to the soundtrack in full (only some of the music videos), nor did I watch any of the old movies (although, I was about to watch the '50s one before seeing this, but decided to watch it after, so as to not spoil it for myself). SORT OF SPOILER ALERT - I'm so glad that I didn't do either one of those, so the ending was a raw shocker (in a way), for me.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying, performance wise, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, nailed it. I loved their chemistry & I especially loved Bradley's ability to act like a seasoned musician, all while being an alcoholic & addict, behind the scenes. I really felt Jackson's emotions. Gaga also did splendid for her first feature film acting gig. It's safe to say that I was very invested by the end of the film in their story arcs.<br/><br/>Music wise, this has hands down, one of the best OSTs I've ever heard. Every track is amazing (i'll say even Ally's super poppy tracks, lol). Again, kudos to them both for doing the singing live, cause it definitely paid off, and damn boy, can they both sing. In my opinion, they make an amazing duo. I would honestly pay to see Bradley and Gaga, or Jackson and Ally, more rather, perform this darn soundtrack live in concert. I have had the soundtrack on repeat since seeing the movie. It's just too damn amazing. It's no wonder 'Shallow' and the 'A Star is Born Soundtrack', are number #1 on the (Australian) iTunes charts (and have been, for some time). With other tracks present in the top 10-20.<br/><br/>Bradley, as a director also did exceptionally well. I heard the cast really, really, entrusted him and his vision. I also loved that he paid tribute to the previous films, while also keeping it adapted for modern audiences. Furthemore, hearing Bradley in interviews talk about the symbolism and meaning behind his choices. Such as for the color grading, the sound and even the direction with his camera shots, makes me appreciate this movie even more. This movie is definitely worth watching on the big screen in cinemas, especially if they have Dolby Atmos. it definitely makes this more than a movie and enhances the experience, as if you were at a concert.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an amazing movie and it is definitely up there with some of my all time favourites.<br/><br/>SEEN: 31 October 2018 @ Event Cinemas in Vmax w/ Atmos.<br/><br/><ul><li>10/10.</li></ul>"

"dpnel","9","0","5","6 December 2018"," Breathtaking
","Cooper does a fantastic job of telling the well understood claim that fame is temporary and always comes at a personal cost. The visceral direction, timely track and epic performances give both a grandiose and nuance to the emotions portrayed on screen.<br/><br/>What worked:<br/><br/>The acting
Gaga's performance has received much critical acclaim of which she is deserving. Her range and honesty is believable and sincere in every scene and shines through in particular moments (bathtub scene and final song). It is unequivocal to suggest she deserves recognition from the academy in the form of an Oscar nomination.
The real star here however is Cooper. His performance is monumental and empathetic, erratic and subtle, triumphant and full of pain. His portrayal of alcoholism is so gripping that the viewer is immediately placed into a milleu of tragedy and internal turmoil from the first shot, an emotion that is sustained until the final moments of the film. Such bravery and brilliance Cooper has put on his best performance yet.<br/><br/>The music
The music is integral to the narrative itself but also serves to guide the viewers emotions throughout the film. I'm the beginning rock anthems are belted out, the music is intoxicating and bold much like the initial relationship between Gaga and Cooper. Subtlety and nuance accompanied the grandiose as the intimacy of their relationship is conveyed. The film then moves to pop and it's various distortions and delusions, climaxing in operatic purity and celebration. I can't see how the track won't take home a few Oscars.<br/><br/>The plot
I won't spoil it, but it is absolutely genius. Heartbreaking, triumphant and captivating the story has really set itself apart from the previous 'A Star is Born' films.<br/><br/>The visual metaphors
Lighting is carefully constructed to represent the various characters. Red symbolisies Cooper and his bygone era whil blue and green symbolism Gaga's rise to fame. The red blur of Coopers house during the climax is particular powerful.<br/><br/>What didn't work<br/><br/>The majority do the film was a breeze to watch, with very little breaks or mishaps narrative wise. The majority of the shots were fine, although their being a small cliche during the wedding and proposal sequence. The biggest flaw has to be the lack of supporting characters, although Rockwell's performance is fantastic, Cooper and Gaga rarely share screen time with other actors.<br/><br/>Conclusion
An epic, an instant classic and a must see. The finest Rimance I've ever had the proven age of seeing, competing with the likes of Hone with the wind and Casablanca, Cooper has really outdone himself."

","Very surprising movie. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. First of all Bradley's performance is stunning and gives us a cool but warm performance. However Lady Gaga is absolutely a great discovery. I've seen her in small cameo's or parts before but she really hits home in this movie. The chemistey between the two is believable and I wouldn't be surprised if they got the hots for each other in real life. However I think achilles heel of the movie is its director, Bradley himself. The movie suffers especially in the last half of the movie from choppy editing, in your face close ups of emotions, que tear que zoom in situations and sometimes the moments that Lady Gaga starts singing feel very unnatural. However for an early movie of his, it's fine! You can see that he has the talent but still needs some refinement."
"ThatGuyReviews","8","0","1","27 November 2018"," A Modernized Musical
","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut is a stunning achievement navigating the tricky genre of musical movies which is so often butchered. To see the acclaimed actor break from form by directing, writing, and singing in this picture, and to see it done so well, is a tremendous feat. Lady Gaga as well proves her range as both a vocalist and now as an actress, again railing against expectations. If we can expect more of this quality from the pair in the future, that should garner much excitement.
This is not the first time that the story of an aspiring performer pairing up with an industry star has been delivered to the silver screen, in fact, it is the third remake of the spectacular 1937 winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Cooper's reimagining of the story as a modern tale of an alcoholic musician and his talented protégé is a faithful retelling that builds upon those that came before it. Little in this movie stands out as necessarily ""bad,"" but the soundtrack outshines everything with incredible strength in everything from the writing to the mixing to the delivery. Every song is effectively integrated into the story and themes of the film on whole. There were, however, some confusing editing choices that come off as if they were not entirely intentional or drag out particular scenes (a certain one about a ring comes to mind), but the movie completely enamors its audience with the performances, helping to distract from overbearing dramatics hammering foreshadowing far enough into your skull to cause brain damage. In addition, the realistic appearance of the sets and costumes helps the viewer believe that everything on screen could really happen, appearing genuine at all times and only having these ""on-the-nose"" moments with the symbolism briefly. The largest complaint I have is that the film often rushes or glosses over certain moments in order to fit a theatrical run-time, though it still manages to deliver on its intentions. Overall, the end result is a moving experience that manages to blend movie and musical seamlessly.<br/><br/>A Star is Born Letter Grade: B+"
"dromasca","9","0","1","27 November 2018"," art of the remake
","I find it quite funny when film critics or fans lament the 'lack of originality and creativity' of the contemporary movie makers using as an example the relative high number of remakes at Hollywood or big studios in other countries. After all cinematography is not the only art where the use of the same theme, characters, and sometimes of the same text or musical score is current practice. It is certainly used in theater or music which recycle the classical repertory of plays or symphonic compositions, completely new works being the exception rather than the rule. So I have no problems with remakes in cinema. Having said this I would also add that it's no easy task to make an interesting remake on topics or with characters and action that are well known to the broad audiences. New scripts and stories have the advantages of the surprise and of the thrill of the unknown. For a remake to be successful it needs to bring a fresh perspective and to add value to the existing familiar theme, it needs to figure out how to trigger new emotions in the hearts and minds of the viewers who 'already know how it ends'. All these conditions are in my opinion met by the latest version of 'A Star Is Born' the debut as director of Bradley Cooper who also cast himself in the lead role with pop superstar Lady Gaga as partner.<br/><br/>The 21st century version of 'A Star Is Born' adds to the well known story a couple of dimensions related to the music industry which changed so much since the previous remake in the 70s. The already famous musician is a rock star, his life as an artist takes place on the scenes of the never ending tours circuit, his excesses and the roots of his down-spiraling life track can be found not only in his own soul but also in the style of life full with excesses that is shared by so many rock stars, to the point where it becomes almost a condition for success. She is not only an aspiring artist singing in bars while not even daring to dream to a musical career, but also a talent which soon after gleaming in the public eyes is targeted to embark on a commercial pop rather than a rocker career. In this remake of the known story, not only are the two careers on crossing paths (her ascending, his descending) but they also go on divergent artistic roads - classic rock vs. commercial pop. Do both tracks allow for success as well as for artistic accomplishment? The lessons about 'be yourself and say what you need to say in order to become an artist' seems obvious in the first part, but seems to enter in conflict with the destiny of the two musicians as the story develops. The very decisive stand taken by the script writers and the director seems obvious to me, but it's not really the accepted vision in the industry nowadays, and one could say that even the career of Lady Gaga can be seen as a counter-example to the destiny of the character that she incarnates on the big scene.<br/><br/>I must confess my pleasure and emotion in watching the story of two artists and of their relationship. The rock concert scenes in the first 30 minutes of so of the movie are among the best I can remember. Bradley Cooper does what most great actors do when they first cross the line and seat behind the camera - he directs his actors with a clear concept of what he wants to receive from them while allowing for the degree of freedom that makes each of them happy to be on screen in his film. The result is a very coherent and vibrating gallery of supporting characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have a fantastic chemistry on screen. It's not easy to play a role that was previously acted byJudy Garland and Barbra Streisand and Lady Gaga succeeds not only to create a new character but also to all but efface the older versions from our memories. As a film director Bradley Cooper seems to have followed the advice his hero gives in the film: kook inside yourself to seek for what you have to say, the most important thing as an artist is to be true to his own emotions. The result is a film which is deeply moving and a pleasure to watch and listen to."

","The film has been made in the past and brings with it a fresh and modern twist which does touch on ideologies not only close to Lady Gaga's heart but never would have been mentioned in the past. It's because of this, it can be considered raw and real. You might need tissues as well.<br/><br/>It begins with the writing talents of Eric Roth with Academy recognitions in the past with Munich and Benjamin Button, and a win with Forrest Gump, he brings you into the struggle of alcohol and drugs with the everyday which is life.<br/><br/>Cooper himself highlights the above with a touching and heavy performance. The story though of course centres around Ally (Lady Gaga) and she was exemplary, just fantastic, and ending with a climactic performance.

I was a big fan of the originals.. but this, has added it's own surprising element to it, with Lady Gaga, and Bradley Cooper staring, directing and even writing the screenplay.. Just wow, what an epic feat. The most impressive part, goes to Lady Gaga tho, wow, she should do more movies! 10 /10 and I don't give 10s easily. She falls so hard into the character, she could not remove herself from Ally, and it shows in the movie. The sad thing too, is that her best friend in real life passed away during the filming of the last scene, but she kept going, and you can visibly see the real grief on her face. It's unlikely we will see her star again."
"El-Dod","7","0","1","23 November 2018"," One of the good musical romance films and a great directional debut for Bradley Cooper.
","The movie is based on and is most powerful at tremendous moving music written and the beautiful songs that of course is winning an Oscar this year no doubt. The story is solid and Bradley really had a great and well studied vision of it with great effort and lots of singing and one hell of a performance among with Gaga who did a great job for her debut as an actress with the chemistry between both which was amazing too and how the screenplay matched with some line that happened in the ending scenes and how all was leading to the end and Bradley gently did the scenes with no trauma but were shocking including the end. However, the story's side of drugs and addiction wasn't much powerful and could say I have seen a lot similar but not performed as good as this one that despite being an important plot for the film It separates me from seeing it as a unique picture and hoped it was another thing and plot. The rhythm of the film decreased towards the end and from what I saw I didn't find a reason for the shocking ending though it seems appropriate for the conditon of Jack but how suddenly the love wasn't a factor in split of a second and what he fought for. Also Ally's rising was fast for me and wasn't clarified much and thought with a movie like that that cared about details should haven't made it as other films when you see the other person standing on stage winning an award. The film devolved into a melodrama so quickly in the end with their fast relationship and felt like it lost the whole thing and just focused on ""Music"" The live singing was so powerful and good. The cinematography was good too. But I lost it with the whole matter near the end and felt it was weaker than the beginning until the end arrived.Can't understand much love and overrating and can't understand much hate. I understand that you shouldn't miss the film. 7.5/10"

If you don't expect this movie to be happy then you will have a much better attitude than me. It wasn't a bad movie it just wasn't what I expected. The whole time I wanted to yell at the characters for making such bad choices. The guy was a jerk to her and only good thing from her was her career. I felt sorry for the guy that he couldn't he help. This movie was very depressing and traumatic. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that alcoholism is a serious disease not to be taken lightly and also if you're going to marry a musician know what you're getting into.

At least Bradley's songs had some gut's to them which were forgettable but none the less still rocked.

I felt like 90% of this movie was filmed with the camera in everyone's faces. Just huge faces everywhere taking up the whole screen. The script was strange at parts, with awkwardly long pauses and unnecessary melodrama. A lot of the story was underdeveloped, with Ally going from hating Jackson one minute to being madly in love with him the next. Some characters just pop in and out of nowhere, with no history or closure (Dave Chappelle is somehow one of Jackson's closest friends, yet we have no idea who he is, and aren't given a chance to find out).<br/><br/>Unfortunately Bradley Cooper's directing abilities may just lose the Oscar, but I really want it to win, as Gaga was phenomenal."

Jack character was too little star to believe. It had been rather heavy drinking idol which was visible in all possible ways as being trash. Lady Gaga... Her story starts well. She syncs with Jack playing, song writing. They have this common complement sense of music. The lift of Ally as solo changes her from sensible rock artist to glam pop performer. And she just glides with it, doesn't notice it is not her anymore. It is not the person she was found. And that element is missing in film. Dissonance between Jack and Ally. That was something underexposed.
Songs, outmost fine. Shallow had been certain hit. But the final concert scene song... Could it be more than Whitney Huston - like? The whole melody line, Gaga's singing - it was like copycat. By the purpose? Bow to Whitney and her sunset if life? Somehow, it was annoying. I had the feeling as it was written for another film, another actor, another singer. Beyonce on the scene?"

","A Star is Born begins with a superbly shot and superbly loud music performance, and similar scenes are scattered throughout the movie. Bradley Cooper is great in his directorial debut as a deep-voiced alcoholic rockstar, who is supported by another set of best in the business pipes in Sam Elliott, Lady Gaga on the other hand is frustratingly wooden which is probably the main reason I couldn't fully get into the movie and liked it less than I thought I would.<br/><br/>I liked the film's ponderings about fame - it takes a look of people behind their celebrity characters, and in that sense Lady Gaga was an intriguing choice to play Ally as she comes out as a bit of an enigma herself (if only she could act a normal person...). Cooper will always have a soft spot in my heart as I've followed his career already since Alias (2001-2006) when he wasn't a household name yet - it was great to see him hit big with The Hangover (2009) and after that he's really shown his versatility as a drama-actor. As an essay on success in show business, I could see A Star is Born being a particularly personal project for him. It's a well directed, yet somewhat unsurprising film, which is brought down by one bad performance.<br/><br/>Fun random facts:
<ul><li>Lady Gaga's first acting credit is from Sopranos (1999-2007)</li><li>The film has performances from three former Alias actors: Cooper, Ron Rifkin and Greg Grunberg</li></ul><br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","If you´re hoping for some innovative story lines, don´t hold your breath. However, the fact that the plot is clichéd is not a problem for me. The main issue though is 1. the flatness of the characters that do not evolve throughout the whole movie, 2. the fact that the movie does not leave any room for you to think/feel anything - it is extremely literal, especially the finale. I mean, Jackson´s suicide and the last scene? I couldn´t help but think whether the creators were serious. Don´t get me wrong, I can see the craft behind the movie, I think the production was quite meticulous; unfortunately, it just doesn´t work. And I didn´t notice much of the supposed chemistry between B. Cooper and Lady Gaga.
All in all - it is watchable, but it´s a Coelho of movies - trying hard to look deep (fooling the majority of people in doing so), but in fact being very shallow."

","There are films that become classics and there are films that just try to mimic the classics. This film comes in second category for me. To begin with it is a musical drama and my issue with this film isn't its music, (yes, it has some really good songs, but isn't it expected given that we have lady gaga in lead role?) my issues are the drama and plot.<br/><br/>For most of the part, nothing happens in this film. In the middle, I was so bored of repeatedly seeing the couple making out, that I actually was thinking of walking out on this movie. Then, there is the story: which we have already seen in so many other movies and it offers absolutely nothing new. To top it off, this film doesn't even try to present that part in a proper way. For example: there are no twists at all. There is a scene where Bradley Cooper walks towards Lady Gaga in bathtub while carrying glass of drink and we know they are going to fight. Their fights, mind you, don't even last longer. They fight and then come together a couple of scenes later. There are no bridging sequences in between.<br/><br/>Bradley cooper portrays the self-destructive protagonist decently, but at a time comes off as an emotionless jerk who has no romantic feelings for his lady love, until we reach the climax. On the other hand, Lady Gaga comes off as selfish and dumb protagonist who is too dumb to figure out that her manager is a jerk.<br/><br/>Climax although is pretty decently written and last half an hour of the movie is decent.<br/><br/>Introduction of the humor through lady protagonist's dad was totally unnecessary. We are told to accept the backstory of Bradley Cooper through his manager without actually giving decent screen time to his father. It felt like that part was totally forced.<br/><br/>If you are a lady gaga fan or want to see Bradley cooper doing half-decent job, go watch this movie. Otherwise, you can listen to songs on Spotify or YouTube."

","REVIEW - A STAR IS BORN <br/><br/>The film starring Ga Ga or whatever her name is (Pink?) is out and to start things off I will apologise now. <br/><br/>I'm apologising because I know a lot of people have commented on how good this film is and I do agree in parts (the singing and performances) it is but the over the top love story tipped the scales (pun intended) the wrong way for me.<br/><br/>Now please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but the story has always been the passage from an unknown to a professional performer and the life troubles encountered on the way, not a contrived love story which concentrates more on Bradley Coopers character than the star of the title. <br/><br/>So I'm apologising because I know this rating will be controversial but as I'm not linked to any studio or publication I can be independent and.........<br/><br/>Rating 5 out of 10"

","Watch it for beautiful Bradley Cooper. What a lovely performance. And lady Gagan was such a surprise. So simple. Not much of a problem outside but just a demon within. Simple story. Simply told. Gorgeously visualise."
"jacobnunnally","6","0","1","15 October 2018"," One specific thing
","Saw this over the weekend with a hot date, she loved it but I thought it was okay. <br/><br/>The thing about this for me was how natural and fresh Lady Gaga's acting was compared to the overcooked, labored performance of Bradley Cooper. The former seemed so natural, so real. The latter seemed like he was trying too hard, like he knew he had ground to make up and was desperately trying to do so. <br/><br/>For starters, no one talks how Cooper does in the movie. I found it to be unnatural and odd from the outset. I thought that was really strange. ""Why is he talking like that? Why doesn't he speak more like a normal person?"" I kept asking myself. <br/><br/>Then I thought ""Well...why is the director and producer okay with this? I'd think they would tell him 'Hey, dial it back a little bit. Or a lot. It will make your performance better.'"" And then the credits told me! He himself directed and produced. Answers that question. <br/><br/>Anyway, go see it for Lady Gaga, she's really wonderful in it."
"alvesmarceloalves-73751","7","0","1","15 October 2018"," A cute and tacky fairy tale
","""A star is born"" is a fairy tale. A fairy tale a bit more modern and with a much more interesting ending than the traditional ones, but a story that does not differ much from that Cinderellas we know.<br/><br/>Like every fairy tale, It's cheesy. And it goes back to the easy crying and the programmed tears to leave at certain points of the film to bring to the viewer the feeling of emotion, enchantment and tightness in the heart.<br/><br/>Everything has its value, but if you do not fall into the fairy tale, there is not much to get out of the movie other than to consider it cute. After all, it's cute to see a story of overcoming and love between two handsome and talented young people, but each with its unresolved problems and frustrations in therapy.<br/><br/>On one side we have Jackson Maine lived with talent by a Bradley Cooper emulating Jeff Bridges in ""Crazy Heart"" (2009). Maine is a famous singer who has serious drinking problems, an inheritance of the alcoholic father who died when he was 13 years old.<br/><br/>On the other we have Ally lived by a Lady Gaga who performs satisfactorily as an actress. Ally is an aspiring singer with a rare talent but always rejected by the industry for her asymmetrical appearance.<br/><br/>When these two souls meet at a drag queens bar, an improbable encounter was not Maine's addiction to alcohol, there's a crack, a phosphorus scrawl that will bring two unique talents together to complement each other in their own way.<br/><br/>Maine brings light to Ally's career, spear to the crowd, while he plunges himself deep into the darkness of alcohol in a process that seems irreversible. Their trajectory is of opposites, ascending and descending, which cross each other in the happiest moment of the couple, but create friction when both follow opposite paths. Ally, more and more a pop star, Maine increasingly a decadent, depressed and impaired singer.<br/><br/>But it's a fairy tale. The love between them is very strong. Especially Ally, who never feels the career impaired even in the most embarrassing moments of it caused by him. All Ally wants is to do Jack the same thing he did for her while she was a mere restaurant clerk who used to be a singer in corner bars. Such is love. Although things may not always turn out like the dream.<br/><br/>""A star is born"" is the third remake of the version originally released in 1937 and starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The difference for the original movie is the setting. There, it was the movie industry here, that of music. But the plot is the same.<br/><br/>The current movie has good songs, and at the very least, it must receive Oscar nominations for the musical categories. The presence of Lady Gaga singing on the screen gives an even greater weight, since she is not an actress struggling to sing, but someone whose talent in this art is more than recognized. These are the scenes in which, of course, she is more at ease. Although that innocent look of one who is not understanding what goes on in life but is struggling to act has worked very well for her role. On the whole, Gaga is doing well.<br/><br/>As there are several elements that Oscar loves as a story of overcoming, drama, love and tragedy, I would not be surprised if ""A star is born"" also earn some Oscar nominations in other categories. However, it's a movie that does not go beyond the cute little thing done right."

Well, ""Look What I Found""-
Two soulful performances, 
Cooper's deft debut! <br/><br/>Not ""Shallow"" or showy; 
Non-sober sobering film- 
Maybe too subdued? <br/><br/>""Music To My Eyes""- 
But choppy/unbalanced tale; 
Most songs lack panache. <br/><br/>Cooper and Gaga- 
""I Don't Know What Love Is"" but 
They have chemistry! <br/><br/>Will ""Heal Me"" but not hook me,

","I know there have been multiple incarnations of A Star is Born but I've only seen the Judy Garland version. I didn't think it was anything amazing but I was game with a modern retelling of the basic story. This one was swimming around in production for a while and then we finally got Bradley Cooper starring and directing his first film ever. The more interesting aspect was Lady Gaga getting the lead role as well. I liked the trailers for this quite a bit and was hyped for it. Overall, its a good film not sure it matches the praise I read for it but its definitely a very solid film.<br/><br/>The film is about an alcoholic singer songwriter and the relationship he sparks up with a waitress who moonlights as a singer at a drag bar. He realizes her talent in singing and songwriting and eventually brings her out to perform with him at one of his shows. She blows up, and then must deal with the fame and the failing relationship with her drunk partner, whose condition worsens each day. The film also enlists the talents of Sam Elliot and Dave Chappelle (although the later is a very brief appearance).<br/><br/>First thing's first. The music in this film is very good. Its well thought out and you get the feel of a genuine and raw live performance each time you see the duo on stage. It does a good job of mimicking the life and work of two real musicians. This is definitely the best performance of both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's career. Gaga once again shows she has a natural talent for acting and singing and the role allows her to flourish in both. The film is also a good portrayal of mental health, the damaging effects addiction has on an individual, and its loved ones. Its somber but absolutely true. The cinematography is also excellent.<br/><br/>I thought the film was long and absolutely felt its length. Its easy to get sidetracked and feel like parts in the final hour drag. It doesn't detract so much from the films quality because everything else is still really good. Music lovers and general film lovers will have a field day with this film. I would not be surprised at all if this film is up there in the mix for all the major Oscars of the year, although its still very early to tell.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Lady Gaga is the movie, the rest accompanies, but without it it would be impossible for it to work as it does, since in the rest of the aspects it hobbles and at times it becomes boring.<br/><br/>And the oscar goes to... Lady Gaga."
"pamma09","10","0","1","10 October 2018"," No spoilers for me
","I have now seen the three remakes of A Star is Born -and this one is fantastic. Kudos to Bradley Cooper for an amazing success in directing, writing and starring in this movie. His talent is incredible and shown so well in this film. I so appreciated his use of the closeup filming - right in the actors faces and making it so intimate for the audience. The concert scenes were so fun - made you feel you were there.
Lady Gaga - a new film star and hopefully Oscar nominee. Besides her voice being a huge part of the film, she has developed great acting skills. Her emotions were right on through out the film.
Sam Elliott - so much fun to see him in this role - and no matter your age he is a pleasure to see and listen too.
This is one of the best films of the year and I really hope those who worked on it get the honors they deserve."

"IsraelZavala767","10","0","1","9 October 2018"," Beautifully Acted, Splendidly Directed, Lady Gaga is a true star!
","Coming into this film seeing the massive positive reception from critics i knew i was going to love it , Lady Gaga shines her performance is spectacular, her voice is stellar and really made this role her own. As for Cooper his direction was amazing my only gripe with this film is the lack of insight into his character. His inner demons are sort of generalized and his character takes a back seat once Ally become the true star of the show. The entire second and 3rd act the reins are pretty much handed to Gaga to carry the film and she does so with grace and as the film comes to a close the final performance left me with tears in my eyes. It was beautiful."
"jbaird-69485","7","0","4","8 October 2018"," Lady Gaga fabulous, Bradley Cooper not so much.
","I probably would have given this movie a 9 or 10 if Bradley Cooper's performance had made more sense. Cooper has been such a strong force in every film I have seen him in but his portrayal of Jack as a mumbling moron, barely able to speak intelligibly even when sober just didn't ring true. It's not logical that such a sophomoric personality would have risen to stardom and convinced a sensible woman to marry him. Its like he was trying to channel Kris Kristofferson, a truly limited actor in every way.
Lady Gaga has made me a fan. Perhaps Cooper should stick to roles under the direction of others."

","After what has been a pretty average year so far for movies, we get this fabulous shining light. I've always held these two stars in high regard for their own areas of expertise, but here we see a brilliant acting performance from 'Stefani', and not a bad singing performance from Mr. Cooper either.
