"fmagnet","10","470","595","15 October 2007"," And I don't like horror movies...
","Let me begin by saying I DON'T like horror movies. I don't enjoy jumping in my seat. I don't like being afraid of the dark for the next 2 days, and I usually HATE Spanish movies. So usually I only see the big horror classics, and that is because I've read enough spoilers to confront the movie in a laid-back way.<br/><br/>Having said this, I was dragged to see this movie against my will. And I was right! I have never, EVER, been more uneasy, uncomfortable on any movie, from the Exorcist to the Prophecy, from Psycho to Halloween. The story seems obvious; the cliché-horror themes are there, and while I saw them coming, I was comfortable enough. But then comes the movie, the script, the score, the acting, all in perfect harmony... and you jump, and you chill and you shout and you wish you had never entered that dammed cinema.<br/><br/>It is good. It is great.It is moving and horrifying. It does not need CGI, sound effects or unreal characters. Its there. Its real. Its haunting. It WILL be a classic.<br/><br/>Chapeau!"
"jmsnjms","10","328","412","29 August 2007"," absolutely incredible
","I saw this at the Frightfest and its AMAZING, did the previous reviewer even see it? No real shocks!!, I've never seen a cinema jump like the audience at Frightfest for this film. I'm kind of tempted to name the shocks but I wont. Its such a stunningly made film, creepy, atmospheric, shocking, great story, beautifully directed, the main woman is incredible. I was never really sure if it was supernatural or psychological, but as it reveals...wow, its excellent. Its so well done I cant write more without giving stuff away, but go and see it. I was expecting a low rent "" pan's Labyrinth "" but I think it might be even better than PL, though very different. Best film i've seen in ages"
"nonsequitur247","Null","110","134","8 December 2007"," A satisfying thriller on one hand; an equally rich emotional journey on the other
","I went into a screening of this today knowing only that it was about a woman who buys the home she lived in as an orphaned child, planning to open it to other orphans, that it mixed fantasy and reality, and that Guillermo del Toro of 'Pan's Labyrinth' had a hand in it. I didn't have any expectations. Even if I did, I certainly not have expected what I got. 'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface, and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.<br/><br/>When Laura (the marvelous Belén Rueda) moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl, she is thirty-seven, married, and she and her husband have adopted a son - Simón, a little boy with HIV who doesn't know that he's terminally ill or adopted. Simón is wildly creative - he has several imaginary friends and a penchant for treasure hunts, mind games, and the story of Peter Pan. One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and Simón's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness, Simón disappears. The rest of the film follows Laura's desperate search for her son as she comes to terms with her loss and her own past as well.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez does a masterful job of balancing the thriller with the drama. Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching, though slightly psychologically twisted. The acting is strong, and the directing, editing, cinematography, and music all work together well. Some of the sound effects - the constant creaking, wind blowing, etc. - got wearisome as the film went on, and some of the thrills were a little cheap - I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them - though, admittedly, they were effective all the same. The story dragged a little towards the end and during the scene with the medium - cutting it just a little shorter might have been equally as effective and easier on the viewer.<br/><br/>Bottom line: even if you don't like ""scary"" movies (like me), you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects. If you're a horror flick buff, you'll probably find some of the thriller elements a little tired and overdone. Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well."

","The Orphanage is a slick and quietly chilling piece of work based around (what else?) an orphanage. A woman named Laura returns to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, with the intention of opening it up again as a home for children with disabilities. Together with her husband and adopted son Simon, Laura tries to make the huge old building ready to receive it's first new residents, but all is not quiet in the dusty rooms and grounds, and gradually she starts to feel sinister presences from the past making themselves known.<br/><br/>The film strings out quite a good story, blending traditional scares (bumping noises heard through walls and doors, silently appearing children in masks) with modern touches (Simon is HIV positive). Although most of the actual frights are on the soft side, the film does have quite away with sudden shocks, especially one great sequence involving the death of a sinister secondary character...you'll know when you see it! But mostly, things stay pretty calm, and there were times when I was wishing for something more visceral to actually happen, as many of the very well built tension sequences fade away without any cinematic pay-off, such as a very tense séance sequence, and in most of the (many) scenes of Laura alone in the orphanage, she being almost too subtly menaced for things to get really scary, which I think is a shame. However there are certain moments when you WILL jump!<br/><br/>However, The Orphanage still stands up as a strong piece of work. The backbone of the film is undoubtedly the strong performance by Belén Rueda as Laura, who carries the entire film admirably. The film looks great, with stunning photography and very elegant sets and a gorgeous building standing in for the orphanage itself. Sound and music work very well too, and the film succeeds in working many small elements together (such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end), so all in all, the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing, although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome."

","Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound ""The Orphanage"" nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.<br/><br/>Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas ""Pan's Labyrinth"" took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, ""The Orphanage"" is closer to the classic haunted house themes of ""The Others"" as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned, ""The Orphanage"" is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.<br/><br/>Working from refined ""less is more"" psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done ""Peter Pan"" as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create ""gotcha!"" moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a séance. And there will be a twist at the end.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. ""The Orphanage"" offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment."

","Attended the first commercial screening of The Orphanage (El Orfanato) last night at FrightFest, London. <br/><br/>Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez have delivered something really special for their first feature. <br/><br/>I have never jumped out of my seat like I did last night, nor my partner, nor most of the audience it seemed. Apart from the terrific scares, there are solid performances from the whole cast, stunning cinematography, and the editing is flawless. If I had to criticise one element, it is that the music swells just a little too much a couple of times, but it is a good score nonetheless.<br/><br/>See this one at the cinema."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","73","98","14 April 2008"," Wonderfully crafted ghost story.
","Laura returns with her family to the orphanage she grew up in as a child, she reopens it for handicapped children and all is going to plan until her son starts communicating with an invisible friend...<br/><br/>Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona & produced by Guillermo del Toro, this Spanish picture is a delightful antidote to the ream of gore for gore sake movies flooding the market on a seemingly daily basis. This is not a horror movie as such, this is one of those pictures that oozes old fashioned values as regards telling a grand old ghost story with mysterious undertones. The setting is perfect, the orphanage of the piece is a ghostly monolithic structure that has all those perfectly shadowy rooms that are hiding secrets, expansive gardens perfectly framed in aura by Bayona's willingness to let the setting be an integral part of the story. The story is a creepy one, and there is always an added air of unease when children are the focal point of the piece in question, and sure enough this central concept of troubled children and troubled childhoods gets the maximum amount of emotion from the viewing public.<br/><br/>It's hard to write anymore than I have without delving deeper into the story and it's significant turn of events, suffice to say I feel this is a wonderful creepy, and at times beautiful, film that prospective viewers would be better off going into devoid of any prior knowledge. Belén Rueda plays Laura and it's a marvellous performance from her, full of emotion and guts, she carries the film with skillful ease. Bayona directs carefully, and it's evident that he is benefiting from the guiding hands of his gifted producer, but his marker is here and I'll be keeping an eye out for future efforts from the young Spaniard.<br/><br/>A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure. 9/10"
"Coventry","5","17","21","12 January 2009"," Admirable atmosphere & setting.
","I pretty much knew with relative certainty and from beforehand that ""The Orphanage"" wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Slow-brooding ghost stories almost never appeal to me and I didn't even care for producer Guillermo Del Toro's own and critically acclaimed ""The Devil's Backbone"". But, considering the hugely positive internet buzz as well as the endless amount of praising reviews on this website, I  being a devoted horror fanatic  simply couldn't afford to ignore this Spanish instant classic entirely. Well, the only thing I can conclude after seeing the film is that ""The Orphanage"" is exactly what you expect from a relatively soft, mainstream and overall ethically correct modern day horror production; whether it's made in Spain, Japan or elsewhere in the world. Obviously it's an extremely professionally made film, with a handful of memorable style elements and effective jump moments, but in the end it really isn't much more than just another derivative and predictable 'ghosts from the past coming back to haunt us' tale that lack the courage to go very far. Undoubtedly the qualitatively greatest aspect about ""The Orphanage"" is the naturally sinister setting. The events take place in an old and remote orphanage  duh  located near a quiet beach with an inactive lighthouse and a wide network of sinister caves. Laura, who spend her childhood here, returns with her husband and 7-year-old son and intends to re-open the orphanage specifically for orphans with a mental and/or physical handicap. On the day of the opening, however, Laura's own son Simon  who's also adopted and chronically ill  mysteriously disappears without a trace. Months go by without a sign of life and Laura understandably starts to get desperate. Was Simon kidnapped by the uncanny lady who arrived at the orphanage and posed as a social assistant shortly before his disappearance? Or perhaps Laura should have listened more to her son's stories about the invisible friends he made, as they seem to know an awful lot of accurate details about the orphanage's dark past. Somewhat to my anticipated frustration, ""The Orphanage"" contains all the clichés and stereotypes the sub genre of ghost stories has to offer. There's the overly fanatic mother versus the rational father, the eccentric and somewhat flamboyant spiritual medium, the morbid old lady that may or may not be real and of course a wide collection of pity-evoking long dead children whose souls are restless. The young and relatively inexperienced director J.A. Bayona does an impressive job maintaining the macabre ambiance all the way from start to finish, but sadly it isn't enough to qualify as a masterpiece in the genre. There's only just ONE that really made me jump towards the edge for my seat for a little while, namely the second confrontation with the elderly lady in the middle of a busy street. Although this is unquestionably a truly masterful sequence, it's nearly not enough as far as I'm concerned. Many fans glorify the finale, but the whole third act actually just confirmed to me that ""The Orphanage"" rather wanted to be a sentimental melodrama about the true values of family and motherly love. When it comes to (Spanish) ghost stories of the past 10 to 20 years, Amenábar's unique and already classic ""The Others"" is still the norm and ""The Orphanage"" is not likely to change that."
"jaredmobarak","9","20","27","12 January 2008"," One, two, three, knock on the wallEl Orfanato
","There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers, giving away their secret with subtitles, someone like me, knowing it's foreign, is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else). I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.<br/><br/>Bayona creates a mood and tone that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats, anticipating the scares that they know will shortly be coming. I was actually surprised how slow the introduction was and how carefully laid out all the story pieces were. We are led into this world, discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children. Like The Others, the spirits involved here are not necessarily violent or demonic. They have an agenda, for sure, but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind. The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game. By taking something you love, a scavenger hunt is begun. Following the clues is the only way the game can end and if successful, the children will grant you one wish. The rules are simple, except the circumstances are far from easily accessible. One must believe that the game can happen before he/she can truly take part. Without the belief that the spirits are in control, success can never be achieved.<br/><br/>The cast is led by a remarkable performance from Belén Ruedawho, as it turns out, had a wonderful turn in Amenábar's latest Mar adentro. Her composure and beauty is shattered as she finds her son has been lost. Trying to keep herself together, taking in what the police, her husband, and the mediums enlisted to help on the paranormal aspect tell her, she is given the task to figure out for herself how far she is willing to go to find her son. Always captivating and never out of her element, Rueda carries the story and never looks back. The supporting players around her are all portrayed nicely as well. Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true; Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game; and young Roger Príncep plays the child Simón with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.<br/><br/>Bayona never goes for the cheap thrills either as he builds up the tension with sounds and visuals. His use of the closing doors and the moving merry-go-round add a sense of foreboding that ends up being more important than you may initially guess. Stylistically too, the transition between the house's current state of duress with the way it shone by the glow of the adjacent lighthouse from the past is expertly handled. There were numerous instances where the film could have gone off the rails to tragic effect, but he holds it steady throughout. More psychological than visceral, the scares are few, but effective. Even when the grotesque rears its head, it is to enhance the story, not to shock for shock alone. The sound work is utilized to the fullest too. What seems to be jarring and loud for the purpose to scare our lead and us is actually very important to the tale at hand. Nothing is shown or heard here that doesn't have absolute relevance to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The final third of the film comes quick and fully envelopes you into the proceedings. You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage. Whereas a film from Hollywoodof late usually being a remake from a better horror film in Japanwould use this tension in order to hide the flimsy and lackluster conclusion it tacks on so as not to alienate those viewers who enjoy leaving the theatre with a smile, Bayona knows how to effectively end his tale the way it should. I was blown away by the handling of the final scene and the way he used the rules of the game to transition us from one reality to another. It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally, but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face. Whether you exit the theatre with your eyes moistened or not, you will not forget the beauty and perfection for which it concludes. The tagline is correct, for while it is a story of horror, it is above all else a tale of love."
"jprn55","9","94","150","20 October 2007"," A great suspense film
","I'm a little bit tired of horror and suspense films. I had to get to the cinema because I could not say no to my girlfriend. Now I do not regret the wonderful evening I spent. This film achieved what others did not- I could not release my girlfriend's hand all over the time, and when the story finished I discovered there was nothing unexplained. A great suspense film I recommend. Belén Rueda, is a completely credible character and the place where the story has been shot helps make it realistic or, at least, the viewer gets into the environment created. The rest of actors are good and Geraldine Chaplin's scene is one of the most creepy I've ever seen"

","The former orphan Laura (Belén Rueda) raises her adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive and tells Laura that he has five invisible friends, and she believes they are fruit of his imagination. Laura decides to reopen an orphanage for handicapped children in the location and during the opening party, Simón calls her to show the little cabin of his friend Tomás. The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and Simón vanishes. Laura feels the presence of other persons in the house and months later, the desperate Laura invites a team of parapsychologists to try to unravel the mystery.<br/><br/>""El Orfanato"" is a creepy and spooky ghost story with a dark and very sad atmosphere. The screenplay, direction, acting and cinematography are great, disclosing a dramatic and sensitive plot that explores the disappearance of a young boy with touches of supernatural in the despair of his mother. However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot). My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Orfanato"" (""The Orphanage"")<br/><br/>Note: On 25 January 2015 I saw this movie again on Blu-Ray."
"blackburnj-1","9","12","16","4 April 2008"," An exciting directorial debut
","18 months back, or so, the world was astonished as three Mexican directors produced three exceptional and successful films. One of those three, Alfonso Cuáron, said in an interview last year that the trio (himself, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu & Guillermo del Toro) considered themselves to be nothing in comparison to ""what is to come"".<br/><br/>With ""The Orphanage"", executive produced by del Toro, we get to see some work from the first of the new Hispanic wave, namely the Spaniard Juan Antonio Bayona. Although del Toro's name is plastered all over the posters, this is undeniably Bayona's film who, with stylish photography, effective design and confident direction, makes this a fantastically gripping and moving piece of work.<br/><br/>It is a staggeringly bold and extremely exciting feature debut by this director. From the very first shot, the audience can see that this director has style and an eye for striking images. But he also knows how to manipulate an audience. The early scenes grip the audience as Bayona builds up a tense atmosphere, filled with the sort of menace that Hitchcock created in so many films.<br/><br/>Then, when the supernatural plot gets going, he fills the film with enough memorable visual touches and ""crash, bang, wallop"" moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. A number of scenes excel, especially one where a medium is used in the eponymous orphanage and wanders the apparently empty corridors, viewed in the eerie green of night vision. It is a magnificent, thrilling scene and, although it sounds clichéd, it is fresh, inventive and spine-chilling.<br/><br/>But this film is so much more than a nuts and bolts ghost story. The film ends with a wonderful, moving twist that is at once heart-breaking and utterly uplifting. This is an engrossing and thrilling film and a triumph of superior direction but it is the film's intelligent and philosophical side that stays with you, long after your spine has stopped tingling."
"refresh_daemon","7","22","35","30 December 2007"," Pretty decent, though not particularly scary, supernatural mystery/drama
","This film is less like a traditional horror movie and more of a drama/mystery with strong supernatural elements. The setup is that Laura, who once lived at an orphanage, returns to the orphanage with her husband and son to start it up again as a place for special needs children. Of course, it all seems simple, but there are mysteries abound in this story and the revelations trickle in over the course of the tale.<br/><br/>The film isn't particularly frightening, although it has a couple of jumpy moments. Rather than focusing on creating an atmosphere of fear, instead it works on drawing up sympathy for Laura's plight as events transpire against her and her family and the past comes back to haunt her. It's an interesting meditation on loss as well that had a wonderful potential to straddle the line between real-world and supernatural (but don't worry folks, it doesn't--it's firmly supernatural and you know it from early on). Nonetheless, that you could imagine this film working even if the supernatural elements were just in Laura's mind and that's a pretty good thing for the drama.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are all sound (although I noticed a couple of background gaffs, but I think you'd have to look for them), with clear direction, capable lensing and design. The actors all do a good job of rendering their characters (children fare believably enough) and Belen Rueda carries the film well as the central protagonist. The story itself doesn't reach any great depths, but unraveling the mystery with the film is enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's nothing stunning, but in the world of horror films, it easily stands a shoulder above the regular flotsam that the genre tends to churn out. At that, it's no terrible film and could be recommended if you're looking for a relatively intelligent and well composed supernatural horror-type film. Just don't expect bloodbaths and constant shocks. 7/10."
"plkldf","9","16","25","7 January 2008"," Loved it -- and I don't like horror films
","I am not much on horror movies. In fact, I'm known as El Pollo (The Chicken) when it comes to movies. For example, I hate movies which revel in violence: I would no more see ""No Country for Old Men"" than I would go quail ""hunting"" with Dick Cheney. Will I see ""Sweeney Todd?"" Sure I will -- just as soon as pigs fly out my rear end whistling the ""Colonel Bogey March."" <br/><br/>But I went to see ""El Orfanato"" because I gathered that it was more of a ghost story than a horror film, and that it was more of a thoughtful reflection on The Unseen World, like ""Don't Look Now,"" or ""The Sixth Sense,"" than a movie whose main purpose was to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.<br/><br/>And so it turned out to be. Which isn't to say that it didn't scare the bejabbers out of the audience! Several times.<br/><br/>The film comes from Spain, and stars Spanish TV star Belen Rueda as Laura. We learn that Laura was an inmate of an orphanage, that she was adopted away from the orphanage, and that she has, at the present time, returned to the old property with her husband and adopted child to create a home for neglected children.<br/><br/>This movie, like ""Sixth Sense"" (one of my all-time favorite films) is about love and death. In fact, I think they both share the same message, that is, that helping those most in need of help gives life meaning. <br/><br/>I enjoyed ""The Orphanage,"" and I think you will too. If you just plain don't like being frightened in movies, then stay away. But there's no glorified violence and -- you know how the music builds and builds, more and more ominous, and the thing which is about to attack gets closer and closer? There is some of that, but mostly it's used as exposition -- it's when you're not really expecting anything that the director pushes the bejabbers button, leaving the audience chuckling -- like, ""whoo -- THAT was a GOOD one!""<br/><br/>I think folks who like a good haunted house story will like this, and people who like a good love story will like it as well."
"daryl-subra","9","8","11","24 March 2008"," Dark, brooding, fantastic!
","I decided to watch this movie after the reviews I had read on IMDb and boy did it not disappoint! The film starts off slowly enough, average everyday story about a close-knit, presumably well-off family who are just in the process of converting an old orphanage into their new home. However after a visit from a ghastly-looking social worker, things start taking a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>The acting by the lead lady (Belén Rueda) is one of the best performances in a film of this sort I have witnessed for a long time. Her natural, everyday look is comforting and her reaction to the situations she finds herself completely understandable. The husband (Fernando Cayo), although only playing a comparatively minor role, draws sympathy as someone who is troubled by his subconscious attempts to normalise what is going on around him.<br/><br/>This is not just a horror/thriller movie but a film about the beauty of family dynamics and what happens when something comes along that tries to disrupt them. Several reviewers claim to have cried at the end and I am not surprised.<br/><br/>There are no flashy special effects, just a good old-fashioned ghost story in The Sixth Sense and The Others mould. There are a few jumps here and there (including one daylight scene which must go down as one of the biggest in cinema history!!) but that is not what the film is about. There are some genuinely nightmarish scenes which will etch long in the memory.<br/><br/>My only quip was a period in the middle of the film when things slow down a bit too much for my own liking. There is also some ambiguity in certain scenes although perhaps this assists in surrounding the film with a certain mysticism.<br/><br/>Overall I can't recommend this film highly enough. Much scarier than a lot of the horror 'classics' out there and very much a slap in the face to those who say horror is dead! <br/><br/>Rating 9/10"
"aztrshbyz","4","10","15","3 August 2017"," Very slow moving mystery/suspense story with supernatural elements
","The Orphanage concerns a former resident who ultimately is adopted and returns to the abandoned institution as an adult to open a home for disabled children. Prior to the opening, her son, who is also adopted, disappears. Most of the plot involves the mystery of what happened to her child and her friends at the orphanage. <br/><br/>I have to say that for most of this movie I was bored out of my mind due to the slow pace. The concept itself was okay and the story is all tied up in a tidy bundle by the end, but getting there was quite tedious at times.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, but bordered on the melodramatic in certain parts. However, the mom's desperation and frustration over the loss of her son is appropriate. I think the characters did okay overall with the lines they had been given considering the slow pace. I just wish the film would have had more oomph. Some of the sets and cinematography were quite nice and interesting as well and the orphanage itself has quite the creepy feel to it. The film has a fair amount of atmosphere.<br/><br/>IMHO, this film had the horror equivalent of Crimson Peak, a movie that I actually did like. The horror element in The Orphanage is quite tame, so if you are looking for thrills and chills, I don't know that this film will do it for you. I don't know that it will do for a hardened horror fan either. Mystery, suspense and drama fans might like it if they don't mind the supernatural elements and the snail's pace."
"flamingyouth76","9","14","23","11 November 2007"," One of the best horror films of 2007
","I happened to be in Denver on business and the Denver film festival was in full swing. When I found out this film was playing at midnight on my last night in Denver, I jumped at the chance to walk 20 blocks one way (and in November) to see it. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I was not impressed in the beginning because the film seemed a bit derivative to me. I mean, just how many ghost stories concerning children are there? And with imaginary friends, too? I was thinking ""Amityville Horror"", ""The Shining"", ""Wicked Little Things"", et al ad nauseum. But, boy was I wrong! There are entire sequences that are reminiscent of classic fright films: of course the boy with imaginary friends, as mentioned above; but also a psychic and her entourage right out of ""Poltergeist""; there's a death I've seen before as well, I think out of one of the ""Final Destination"" films; and of course, the general outline--a ghost story set in an orphanage--is vaguely reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's own ""The Devil's Backbone"". All the ghostly trappings we have come to expect from classic fright films are there as well, from mysterious noises and bangings to ghostly visions. I'm not saying that this film ripped off any other film; on the contrary, it was great fun recognizing all these classic fright moments, and they weren't done in an homage type of way--they stood on their own.<br/><br/>I can't tell you the last time a film made me jump. It has been a long while since I've attended a film that made the entire audience jump. This one does it not once, not twice, not thrice, but several times. It is spooky and atmospheric in places, it has some jump scares, but it also has some out-and-out scares that are guaranteed to get to you, no matter how hard-core you think you may be.<br/><br/>I do have to say that I guessed early on what happened in the end. I didn't know exactly why or how, but I did guess the cause of the haunting. I don't think it mattered, I don't think it was being hidden. I think it was obvious that the orphanage was haunted because of some terrible past event involving children (why else would you call it ""The Orpanage""?!). But the reason behind the event was solid and the way the protagonist finds the information is cool. Besides, wasn't it Alfred Hitchcock who said that it isn't the bomb under the table that makes the scene scary, it's the fact that you don't know when it's going to blow up that creates the tension. So it didn't matter that I understood early on WHAT had caused the haunting.<br/><br/>And finally, the ending is bittersweet. It isn't a typical American ending in that everything is wrapped up and presented to the audience with a bow. It isn't a sanitized ending, and it isn't necessarily a perfectly happy ending. I like that. It seems more real to me. I hate the fact that we Americans tend to want a sugary sweet ending so we can walk out and smile about the film without any more thought given. In fact, the last American film I can think of that didn't deliver the sappy ending was Sandra Bullock's ""Premonition"", and it flopped at the theater.<br/><br/>Another film that I would draw comparisons to is Kevin Costner's ""Dragonfly"". It is similar in theme in that it is pretty creepy and scary until the end when you have some resolution for the protagonist, but not a typically happy American ending--a bittersweet ending, much like ""The Orphanage"".<br/><br/>Overall, I truly enjoyed this film. It was spooky, it made me jump, it was fun, and it had a good ending. I hope the director makes more like this."
"Atreyu_II","10","7","10","29 September 2011"," Very intriguing
","The key to this movie's success is on the proverbial simplicity. More than a terror film, it is more of a drama, a sad and devastating story that can impress. The terror is masterfully used here, not only because it really frightens when it's meant to but also because the terror is genuine, avoiding the use of cheap terror and sophisticated digital tricks.<br/><br/>There have been comparisons with ""The Changeling"" (1980) and ""Poltergeist"" (1982). This and ""The Changeling"" have slight similarities in details, but nothing major. As for ""Poltergeist"", frankly I don't see much where to compare them. Yes, they are both about ghosts, but I can't say they are similar just because they have ghosts.<br/><br/>""El Orfanato"" is a great movie on its own. It is clearly one of the best movies of the year 2007 and one of the best from the 2000-2009 decade. Considering that this generation brought some but very few really good movies, I highly doubt the current decade will bring many worthy films, although we can always give the benefit of doubt.<br/><br/>I got to know that Hollywood plans to remake this valuable Spanish piece of cinema. Can't say that I'm surprised. Hollywood stubbornly insists on remaking films. Stealing the others's works must give them pleasure, so that they can claim it as their own when we who know the truth know what the truth is.<br/><br/>This should definitely be on Top 250."

","If Jack Nicholson in AS GOOD AS IT GETS can avow that Helen Hunt makes him want to be a better person, I can tell you that this film made me want to learn Spanish. I grew up on horror films, I saw Living Dead in a theatre first-run, I saw FREAKS in an art house, I watched the Wolfman go all medieval on poor Frankenstein, and in fact I believe I have seen almost every major horror film made until about 2010 (at which point I began to notice that the real horror was geopolitics). This one blew me away. No one thing stands out. The story is as good as the acting is as good as the direction is as good as the cinematography. And listening to Belén Rueda, I felt the film would be even more fun if I actually understood what she was saying. The scene where she tries to contact the children by re-enacting the kids game of Hide-n-Seek is especially memorable. One doesn't merely ""recommend"" this film. If you want to see one of the creepiest yet most entertaining horror films of all time, this is your first stop."
"Tombraiderdude","8","11","18","21 January 2008"," ""The Orphanage"" may be in Spanish, but it scares in all languages
","Recent horror films seem more inclined to thrill than to chill. Such hits like ""Dawn of Dead"" and ""I am Legend"" are great movies, but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread. However, there have been a few good chillers out there, such as ""The Others"" and ""The Ring."" And now, ""The Orphanage,"" from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Laura, a woman who buys her childhood home in hopes of starting an orphanage for handicapped children with her husband Carlos. But soon their son Simón starts communicating with the orphans who used to live there. Thus, many spooky-doins' begin. And boy are they spooky. ""The Orphanage"" is certainly not the first film to use the ""creepy kids"" angle, but screenwriter Sergio Sánchez made the story original and engrossing enough to be wholly enjoyable.<br/><br/>One of the creepiest factors of ""The Orphanage"" is its sound design. The house contains plentiful creaks and groans, which seem to come standard in all haunted houses, but the real frights come from the music. As well as being ambrosial to the ears, it has the power to induce an assortment of emotions. It can bring a tear to your eye, or make you cramp up in your seat from suspense.<br/><br/>But the real enjoyment comes from the acting. Horror films are known for having some of the campiest acting out of all the film genres, but ""The Orphanage"" is one of those rare gems where the actors are so great they make you think, ""Yeah, maybe they really are experiencing supernatural phenomena."" And Kudos to Belén Rueda (Laura) for having the most range and believability in the entire movie. Her performance transcends the language barrier and makes you forget you're reading subtitles.<br/><br/>To round out the film is the cinematography, and if Guillermo del Toro is involved, you know it will be stylish to the max. The manor-like orphanage is not the typical run-down creepy haunted house. It isn't so much haunting as it is hauntingly beautiful. And each of the places around it follow, suit such as the beach and the playground. Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.<br/><br/>Of course, ""The Orphanage"" isn't perfect. One of its weakest points is that it is a bit cliché. There are a bunch or creepy kids, there is a medium that contacts the dead, and, gosh, does that house ever shut-up? But with all that aside, ""The Orphanage"" is still a classy and mysterious haunted house movie that will keep you guessing (and screaming) until the end. Do yourself a favor and go see this film despite the subtitles."
"The_Void","5","17","31","12 October 2008"," Runs short on ideas and lacks atmosphere and suspense.
","To say I'm disappointed with this film would be putting it lightly. For the last few months I've heard nothing but praise for The Orphanage and thus went into expecting to see something special, but what I got instead was just another slow burning ghost story without much in the way of interest. Guillermo del Toro has a production credit on this film; and it's a real shame that some of his creativity didn't rub off on director Juan Antonio Bayona, because The Orphanage has nothing on 2001's orphanage-set ghost story 'The Devil's Backbone'. As the title suggests, the bulk of this film takes place in an orphanage. Laura was raised there as an orphan, and has taken her husband and adopted son Simón to live in the orphanage where she grew up. The boy is HIV positive and has found himself five imaginary friends. Laura has decided to reopen the orphanage specifically for disabled children; but the opening day turns sour when her son begs his adopted mother to see something, but ends up being ignored <br/><br/>On the technical side, there's really nothing wrong with this film. It's very well shot and the directing is sound; it also features a capable (if slightly clichéd) lead performance from Belén Rueda. The problems are in the plot and execution as the simple fact is that it's just not interesting enough. Similar stories to this one have been told many times and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre is liable to have seen at least one comparable film. The film has practically no atmosphere either; the central house is too drab to be a horror location and we are never given the idea that any of the lead characters are in any sort of danger, which ensures that the film lacks suspense also. The Orphanage is not very visceral; although that shouldn't be a problem as it's to be expected in a ghost story; but that's not made up for in any way. The ghosts themselves bring a little atmosphere when they appear, but they're not 'horrific' and the film can hardly even be considered horror. Overall, The Orphanage is a big disappointment and anyone thinking of seeing it should think about not wasting their time and seeing The Devil's Backbone instead."
"albert-wayne","2","37","79","13 March 2008"," Boring, Insipid Mess.
","The uninspired movie for people who think they are cool and hip by liking foreign movies. This movie is a bad tasting stew made with ingredients from far superior movies, and every once in a while while watching this boring turd, I kept thinking ""I wish I were seeing one of those instead"".<br/><br/>First, to all ignorants out there, this film was not directed by Guillermo del Toro, who has not that many credits under his belt to pull a Spielberg. The act of good will of acting as Executive Prducer by using you name to push the movie of a lesser known director with talent is a feat reserved to few film makers, and del Toro is not yet one of them.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by first time Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, and his firts film is flawed to the brim. I don't see why, or no, let me rephrase, I do see why he needed del Toro's name to sell this movie, cause without the name, I don't think any distributor would have bought it.<br/><br/>The main flaw with this movie is the flaw of most, if not all scary movies of today, it's a classic case of ""been there, done that, and a million times better"". Every single concept handled in the movie has been handled before, in far superior movies like Poltergeist, which was written by Spielberg, or The Sixth Sense by M. Nigh Shyamalan, and The Others by Alejandro Amenabar. Hell, the movie even rips off Friday the 13th, and even goes to the point of ripping off Peter Pan, this movie has Poltergeists, a Jason, children ghosts that only one person can see, you name the scary movie, The Orphanage found some weird cheap way to package it, then adds very similar elements of Pan's Labyrinth at the end, and hopes everyone will be too much of an idiot to be sucked into the cheap thrill moments. The movie relies on the shock, high modulated surprise music cue way too much, a thing that pisses me off tremendously, cause once you've used it, no matter how much depth of field shots you can include, the energy is out, and the movie is running on fumes. Not even Jaws, a classic of the thrilling genre uses the high pitch music cue in it's big thrill moment where Roy Scheider is ""gonna need a bigger boat"".<br/><br/>The sort of 1+1=2 method of this movie gets so boring that, within 15 or 20 minutes of film, you pretty much figure out the entire thing, and you have to sit through until it unfolds slowly in a very boring fashion. I hate when thrillers become predictable, cause they stop being thrilling, and that is the case of The Orphanage, cause it is predictable by doing everything that has been done in movies about haunted houses and children, only with less flare, less style, and certainly less greatness.<br/><br/>The movie is terribly written, terribly directed, and also, does some pretty stupid casting choices. I mean, I love Edgar Vivar, I think that as every person of Latin America born from 1965 onwards, we count El Chavo as one of our most important childhood programs, and Vivar as Senor Barriga was funny as hell, but when he is supposed to be a guru of the occult, that just doesn't work, when he started talking about the ghosts everyone laughs, cause it just doesn't work at all, and getting Geraldine Chaplin to pull the trick of using a funny person as the séance, just like Zelda Rubinstein's Tangina in Poltergeist was flat down boring, you kept thinking, why is Mrs. Chaplin trying to copy Zelda Rubinstein? The end of the movie also leaves something to be desired, the movie, no matter how much it tried to trick the audience into thinking it was a serious movie, they just could not stick with the sad ending, they had to give a positive, cheerful note at the end, just in case people get too disturbed, let's kill the little dark overtone of having a boy with AIDS, I can see the producers and Bayona, ""let's give it a Pan's Labyrinth touch, that worked last year right?"" The movie also makes the stupid cliché of having the protagonist discover the most retched, scary places imaginable, and well, obviously, she is going to go in, alone, with out a flashlight, cause if she doesn't, the movie can't be scary, and just when it gets too scary, someone walks in and saves the day, just at the nick of time, well sure, cause if no one saved the protagonist from a heart attack, the movie would be over, an that is too much to hope for.<br/><br/>Not to mention some incoherent elements like a woman mistaking red haired little girls for her brunette boy, and a mysterious and tool like character that makes no sense, has no beginning, and no end, and only works for comedy and terror and to tie in a plot hole.<br/><br/>Aside from creating a convincing looking set, the movie really has nothing worth mentioning, or remembering, cause I already could mention and already remembered all the things that happened on this movie, from other, better movies.<br/><br/>This is the epitome of uninspired cinema, and it's a shame that just cause del Toro put his name in it, distributors and audiences were suckered in on it."
"caste78","9","20","39","20 October 2007"," fantastic!!!
","I have two words for describing this film, completely awesome!. I can't believe how two genres can be very different talking about Spanish productions. Definitely the Spanish comedian productions are a piece of garbage, however, el orfanato is a clear example how to make a excellent thriller material. Spanish cinema is going to become one of the best creator of this kind of genre. This film has a different style of mystery, not the same we see in most of the horror/suspense movies in which the overact curiosity of the characters carry to cross the creepy door where are killed in the next shot with the axe or the saw, no..., this time the bad guy isn't the ghost. The plot throughout the film is excellent during which you couldn't imagine the final until you see it."
"bob the moo","Null","5","7","29 May 2008"," Effective chiller that builds the scares on the base of a strong story
","As a child Laura was in an orphanage until she was adopted young. Years later she has returned to the building with her husband and adopted child Simón with the aim of making it both their home and also a place for the care of special children.. Simón has his own challenges, one of which is his reliance on imaginary friends, but when he claims to have met one in particular, Tomás, things take a very dark turn for the worse.<br/><br/>After a few weeks of listening to mark Kermode praising this film, I got myself along to a cinema to see it. What I found was not the amazing, earth-shattering film that some had claimed  but this is a common thing for good foreign films, they tend to be extra praised because they are foreign. Don't let my sentences put you off though because this is a very effective and enjoyable ghost story. Director Bayona uses the devices that you'll have seen other films of the same ilk using but the thing is he does it really well. The creeping camera is used several times without a related payoff, producing a constant air of tension that is almost a relief (in a perverse way) when a proper scare does come. As many others have said it is very unnerving rather than gory, with slow movement replacing jump scares and so on, all to good effect.<br/><br/>The story is no slouch either and it is built on the desperation of Laura and the loss of her treasure. This puts a very human heart to the ghost story, engaging the viewer and making it easier for scepticism to be put to one side, even if only for a few hours. The narrative carries a satisfying arch that is ultimately as tragic as it is ""happy"" and as relatable as it fantastic. To put it another way, when a specific scare was not happening/about to happen, I was still interested in what was happening and boredom never occurred. The cast deliver well too. Rueda is the heart of the film and she is convincing throughout. Cayo's Carlos is a lot less important but he plays his character well. Príncep's Simón is the right kid for the job as his matter-of-fact lack of fear adds to the story. The rest of the child cast are weaker but mostly their creepy silent presence is all that is required.<br/><br/>The Orphanage is not anything new or brilliant then but it is very efficient and effective. The story is a strong base for a consistently creepy air that is expertly delivered by Bayona, who makes it all look easy."
"boehmchadwick","9","9","15","26 November 2007"," All Ghost's Aside
","While the door to Horror is always open and sometimes all too inviting, many falling to the depths of its dark abyss, it is refreshing to see a new face conquer the fear head on. J.A. Bavona is already leaving the first circle of Hell unscathed, prevailing at the box office in Spain, while having already been blessed by the god that is Guillermo Del Toro. ""The Orphanage"" at first sight may seem all too easy to categorize as a ghost story with supernatural tendencies, but as any viewer will certainly see, character development and acting make a splash in this debut feature.<br/><br/>Just as Mr. Del Toro did in ""The Devil's Backbone"" a ghost(s) frightens the unsuspecting, because who really expects to see a pale hologram of a person, with a vendetta or maybe just in need of some help. Of course Laura (Belen Rueda from ""The Sea Inside"") is hesitant to believe that her son, Simon, played by the curly haired wunderkind Roger Princep, has ""upgraded"" his imaginary friends for those of the departed. This happens of course after the family moves into a house that was once used as an orphanage and where Laura spent some of her childhood.<br/><br/>Needless to say, after Simon goes missing during a party at the new house, Laura must now believe. What follows is so deliberate and well paced that even the most suspecting viewer will feel chills. Mr. Bavona throws a little Hitchcock at you, rubs your nose in Polanski, while creating depth that De Palma wishes he could possess."

"HorrorQueen17","8","6","9","2 October 2011"," Stunning, heartfelt horror
","Achingly sad is a term I have never used before to describe a horror movie, but it captures 'El Orfanato' perfectly. <br/><br/>This tale revolves around a young family who move into an orphanage where the mother resided as a child. They intend to re-open it as a home for disabled children, but as we get to know them the realisation dawns that they are not alone in the house.<br/><br/>What starts with the premise of being a classic haunted house tale, including the new vogue for stories of this kind – i.e. creepy children, is actually transformed into something which takes it from a standard horror to something much more powerful. With powerful emotional performances, especially from the lead actress x (as mother Laura), who was sensational in her portrayal of grief, this ghost story transcended its genre and turned into a touching, desperate account of a mother driven mad by the disappearance of her son. <br/><br/>The audience couldn't fail to be moved almost to tears as we follow what essentially becomes Laura's story, and the Spanish language made it somehow more realistic for me. I do hope this film doesn't get an English-language remake. It is so unique for a horror film to move me close to tears, alongside providing a wonderfully built up, tense and creepy atmosphere, and this is where El Orfanato comes into its own. There is a slow-burning build up to the emotionally-wrought finale, and the direction, acting and score (which is quite impressive on its own, especially the end credit music) each add something to this brilliantly atmospheric piece. Indeed, the creation and sustaining of the atmosphere is probably the films highest point, because it build in you a classic horror tension, whilst letting you into the personal grief and sadness of Laura at the same time.<br/><br/>There are some shock moments, and jumps hidden amongst the twists and turns of the plot, but this is not a film to see if you are looking to be scared witless by your horror. More, this is an entirely different film which is seeking to add depth and something more to the horror genre than cheap thrills and moments that make might make you jump but ultimately add nothing to the story. <br/><br/>Each part of the film was well made, acted and directed and all go to making this film one of the most unique horrors I have come across. 8/10"

The character development is superb in this film as the acting is right on and you feel you can develop a bond with each character. The storyline itself is well written and it keeps you guessing and I particularly enjoyed the conclusion of this film very much. It was very emotional and uplifting even though this is a horror film. The only downside to this film was that it is only available in Spanish so reading the subtitles is required if you're like me and can only read English. But the hardly damaged the overall experience of this movie as it was just as horrifying, emotional, and suspenseful as if this movie was in English.

Once there, her son's imagination is reawakened by the home, but his childhood fantasies and games become sinister when his ""imaginary"" friends may not be so imaginary after all. Unlike many modern horror films, Juan Antonio Bayona does not wash the cinema screen with explicit torture candy, but rather skilfully weaves cinematic shocks through intrigue and suspense. His movie is all the more terrifying for what it does not show than for what it actually reveals. And there are at least four big moments that will leave you trembling in your seat, if you have not already jumped out of it."

"luke-346","9","7","11","24 March 2008"," Back to the routes of horror!!
","The Orphanage is a very well made, good old fashioned horror. It tells of a woman called Laura (Belen Rueda) that returns to the abandoned orphanage where she was raised, with the hope of re-opening it for a new generation of children. During the course of the film Laura's child goes missing and she is forced to shelve her plans of re-opening. The event compels Laura to spend more time in the house hoping that her child will return and results in her confronting her sanity. In sticking to an old fashioned premise the films employs a various amount of techniques and methods commonly attributed to films of this genre. The highlights being the big old house, creepy visitors, strange occurrences and things that go bump in the night.<br/><br/>It is quite conceivable to think that any film that utilises such clichés and generic scare tactics is doing nothing new and can be dismissed as being unoriginal and possibly unimaginative. To the contrary, in bravely addressing the very routes of the genre the director, and writer, have produced a masterpiece in contemporary horror. The film is an excellent rendition of the classic bedtime horror story, told with atmospheric direction and brilliantly placed plot occurrences. It is an emotional film that reaches to the very heart of fear whilst re-establishing the genre in the minds of contemporary cinema goers. The Orphanage is film that is intelligently made and will go on to become a definitive horror film, much in the same way as Jacobs Ladder, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Sixth Sense – all films that carry similar themes.<br/><br/>Those that aren't familiar with those previous films or wish to have their thrills in the form of Saw or Hostel will no doubt find The Orphanage tame and those that get their kicks from Asian horror (Gin gwai, Ringu etc) could also feel begrudged. In a disagreement with these films The Orphanage doesn't allow itself to be drawn into using one scare technique and continuously exploiting it throughout, nor does it prey on teenage anxieties or irrational fears. Instead the film embarks on a much more intellectual (and bold) approach and investigates one of the most basic primeval fears, that of losing a child. In exploring such a fear it is only fitting that all the characters be played well, and they are. Their fall from grace and their reaction to the events are brilliantly complemented by the well directed and paced plot. The timing of the scares and the execution of them are also done to perfection. All of these qualities add up to the film being a refreshing experience that, consequentially, sticks two fingers up to the recent and predictably made horror films churned out by Hollywood (1408, Vacancy etc).<br/><br/>Ultimately The Orphanage is an encouraging debut feature from the director Juan Antonia Bayona and shows a lot of potential. The film is dark, mysterious and harrowing like Guillermo del Toro's Pans Labyrinth - which also has child at the heart of the film. Both films also drive home the extreme capabilities of imagination and dissolution.The film is presented by del Toro and, in much the same way Tarantino presented Hostel, there is no real direct evidence of his efforts on the screen. Instead The Orphanage is more of a continuation of the style and characteristics associated with his film-making. Those that, like me, have been pining for a classical contemporary horror should look no further than The Orphanage."
"funkyfry","9","7","11","22 January 2008"," A deeply disturbing film experience
","Rarely do I go into the darkened cinema really expecting -- or even necessarily wanting -- to be truly scared by the movie I'm about to watch. There's every type of ""horror movie"" experience out there, and I personally tend to prefer the kind where I really don't take anything too seriously, where I can wait for the next person to be killed by the monsters and laugh at the ridiculous way that it all happens. But ""El Orfanato"" is not that type of horror movie. It is about people who you'd want to care about and even though the subject matter is supernatural at times there's a very real feeling about all the proceedings that put the film on another level from the typical scare-fest. I'm not going to say that the characters were completely compelling for me or that it was a great drama, but I would say that I got so wrapped up in the story and the suspense that watching the film eventually became a somewhat unpleasant experience. I'm a smoker and I've hardly ever felt so much like stepping out to calm my nerves in the middle of a movie, yet I didn't want to miss anything. Off the top of my head the only kind of experience I could compare this to was seeing ""Poltergeist"" as a little kid in the theater, when the characters were kids exactly like me and their fears were the same as my own. There's also a sad quality to this film that reminds me of George Sluizer's ""Spoorloos"" (aka ""The Vanishing"").<br/><br/>I won't go too deeply into the story, but it's a haunted house type of deal about a woman named Laura (Belen Rueda) who used to be a ward of a defunct orphanage which she and her husband (Fernando Cayo) decide to fix up to use as a home for children with special needs. Unbeknownst to himself, their own young son Simon (Roger Princep) is such a child, in his case he has been diagnosed with HIV at birth. Simon has imaginary friends who he plays with (like Danny in ""The Shining"", the parents don't take it too seriously at first) and when he suddenly disappears without a trace Laura becomes convinced that his most recent ""friend"" might be a ghost from the orphanage's past who has come back to haunt them.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with all the performances and with the technical aspects of the film as well. The conclusion was very disturbing even if it doesn't make complete logical sense. I felt that the director did such a good job of establishing the mood of the setting that he was able to accomplish pretty much everything he set out to do as far as the suspense aspects of the film. There's a couple moments of out and out terror but for the most part it's the type of horror that fans of atmospheric horror will enjoy. There's even a theme of fantasy running through the film, a Peter Pan motif. So on the whole I enjoyed it but it sure isn't going to make anybody's lists of the feel-good films of 2008. In its more serious or personal aspects it's a meditation on the cruelty that we inflict on each other and through the medium of the supernatural it explores the ways in which we can deal with pain and suffering.<br/><br/>A very effective horror film, one of the best I've seen in many years."

Well, maybe not, but if you're like me you will! All I really knew going into this movie was that it was Spanish, and that that kid with the sack on his head scared the crap out of me! So I was pretty prepared for the scary stuff, but didn't think the movie would be so moving as well. In a way, it's not so much a horror movie, as it is a movie about dealing with loss. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of creepy moments in the movie...just not as much as your average everyday horror movie. Most the scary moments are due to atmosphere and tension as opposed to jump scares. So if you like the monsters popping out at you, you'll be bummed out. But if a sense of impending dread is something you enjoy, I think you'll dig the movie.<br/><br/>The movie's basic plot is this; A woman was an orphan, and moves back into her childhood orphanage as an adult in hopes to reopen it. Her husband and son move in as well, and her son begins to gain more and more imaginary friends. Where it goes from there, I will not say, but it's not always what you expect. I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that the son goes missing, and from there the movie become much more of a psychological study of loss...and a rather good one at that.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the movie wasn't quite what I expected, but that's a good thing. The Orphanage is really a beautiful take of the classic Peter Pan story, and a movie I look forward to visiting again!<br/><br/>A"

This film is equal parts dark-fantasy and ghost-story, a parable for the beloved kid's tale Peter Pan as well as a tale of spectral children. Very suspenseful, this film does a wonderful job luring you into genuine jump moments hook, line and sinker, and at the same time crafts a beautiful story.<br/><br/>Our characters are developed with care, whether living or dead. We are slowly brought into a world where we find conflicting emotions and motivations, as nothing happens without a reason or a message. These are ghosts that will scare you and keep you jumping, but they are real characters as opposed to the monsters waiting in the dark.<br/><br/>This film is an archetypal hero's journey, where our protagonist is drawn into a world of mystery at a careful pace, shuddering at times to leave us guessing, and rolling along at a terrifying clip at others. There is always a lot going on, leaving viewers to wonder who can see what, or more importantly, who can understand the dark world around them.<br/><br/>There is enough intrigue, suspense, terror, and real emotion in ""The Orphanage"" to leave it on a short list of damn near perfect movies.

I could have forgive the story's lack of originality if its narrative or pace would have been good... But they weren't. However, there's no reason to panic because even if the script is bad, at least the characters and dialogue are very well done, right? WRONG. They are dull and very poorly developed.

I don't know if that will keep being useful for me. I mean... Boy, I expected way, way more of this one. It really doesn't deserve all the good treatment that has received here.<br/><br/>The only two reasons for the stars I'm giving are the fine cinematography and the leading lady, who actually did a decent job with a bad material (well, at some moments).

","""El Orfanato"" (or ""The Orphanage"", in its English title) is a horror film that centers on Laura (Belen Rueda), a woman who was raised in a large orphanage where she spent her childhood. With fond memories of the place, she moves back with her husband Carlos, and adopted son, Simon, with plans to open an orphanage for disabled children of her own. But strange things begin to plague Laura - a mysterious social worker after her son stalks the grounds, and Simon has gained some bizarre imaginary friends. And during the celebration of the orphanage's opening, Simon disappears into thin air, and Laura finds herself desperate to put the pieces together and find her son. What ensues is a dark journey into the house's past and a mystery involving the children that lived there over 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Highly praised and longly awaited, ""The Orphanage"" is a horror movie that pleases on nearly all levels. The rave for this movie was fairly large, and my expectations were high going in, and thankfully, they were met. From my brief synopsis, this may sound like something you have see a dozen times, and I'm not going to lie - ""The Orphanage"" borrows many ideas and uses set-ups we have seen before - but the reason it is such an excellent movie is because of a number of factors. First of all, the script is well-written. The story is well-told and the central mystery at the core of the plot is fantastic. Not only that, but the story has a heart. It's got feeling and emotion, something rare in many horror films. It's at times quite touching, especially toward the end (but I won't go there), but still manages to balance the drama with enough shocks and scares to earn it it's horror label.<br/><br/>Through its entire running time, this movie only contains one bit of violence, with lasts no more than fifteen seconds, but it still manages to evoke chills through it's atmosphere and story, which is rare in American horror cinema, which has been clogged with explicitly-violent ""horror"" movies that really lack any value. While it's been stated many times, violence does not make a movie scary - sure, it can accompany a solid story and that isn't bad, but when an entire movie is just gratuitous violence, there is nothing frightening about it, it's just there for the shock factor, and I enjoy films like ""The Orphanage"" that avoid that and actually make an effort to get a genuine fright out of the audience.<br/><br/>The suspense is wonderful, and it tightens slowly as the movie builds toward its climax, peppering plenty of scary moments and eerie scenes throughout, all while doing a sufficient job at clearly presenting the story. The production design enhances the spookiness, the house itself is menacing and very Gothic and old-fashioned, sometimes reminiscent of films like ""The Others"", and ""Darkness"" (both being foreign-produced movies, both in Spain as well). Orphanages are potentially eerie places to begin with, and while the ""ghost"" children are rarely seen, they are menacing nonetheless. The sheer sight of Simon's friend Tomas (with his hack-sack mask with a buttoned eye) is downright terrifying, especially when he is first seen by the Laura character in the hallway - that scene sticks out in my mind and probably will for days. <br/><br/>Acting-wise, this film is also quite successful. Belen Rueda carries the movie and is brilliant in her performance. The rest of the cast performs well, but honestly, most of them are overshadowed by Rueda's performance - she was really excellent in her role, and, even despite the language barrier, her acting still comes through. The twist-ending was one of the biggest and most upsetting shocks of the movie, and I found myself with my jaw nearly dropped to the floor. But, the movie ended on a pleasant, very uplifting and touching note - another horror rarity. The heart-felt moments and very 'human' elements are what would make me say that this a 'horror' movie that people who despise horror movies would probably enjoy. It's frightening, but the story and themes are relate-able.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Orphanage"" is an exceptional horror film that treads common ground, but manages to keep it interesting and tell an intelligent, engrossing, and scary story. The style is unique as well, and the entire film is extremely well-crafted, with a really heart-warming conclusion. Again, do not let the language barrier put you off from seeing it, reading subtitles is not that difficult, and you will miss out on a great horror movie. ""The Orphanage"" is a large cut above most to horror movies to come out in the recent past, and is heaps better than most of the horror garbage that is carted out of Hollywood. Well worth seeing if it's showing near you, I saw it with a large group downtown and everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy it. 9/10."

","I really enjoyed this film. To be honest I didn't find it to be the masterpiece that people are professing it to be but as a ghost story, it's definitely up there with the likes of 'The Innocents' and 'The Others', especially with regards to atmosphere and overall eeriness.<br/><br/>I thought it was brilliantly filmed, from the opening credits, which were great, to the closing scenes and found myself really engrossed by the story. I personally find ghost films to be the scariest kind of horror in that they rely on suspense and atmosphere to frighten as opposed to loud sound effects and jump scares and in that regard, 'The Orphanage' really delivered.<br/><br/>My only complaint was that there were scenes in the film that really built up the suspense but then fell flat and left me wanting more but overall, I was impressed.

There are something I cannot understand well. Why doesn't the mother show up at the end, instead of only the father? And who is Lara? When the mother insists to staying in the home alone for another two days, the father don't want to accompany her. So we can see love from mother can be more hard to vanish then it from the father. And still some of the dialogs are excellent. For example, when Shimon expresses his will to sleep with mother, the mother answers ""You are not old enough."". It is very unexpected, and funny!"
"jmbwithcats","8","5","8","9 April 2008"," Beautifully Tragic
","While Orfanato is reminiscent of other films, The Dark for example, Orfanato ends on a note reminiscent of Japan's original Dark Water. Where a mother must make the ultimate sacrifice to care for the lost children, who are not just lost to this life, but this world. And while Dark Water is an exceptional film in this regard, it is a daughter ultimately who is left behind and not a husband. But either way, the heart wrenching remains, and magnificently does it echo long after the curtain falls.<br/><br/>Orfanato is a little slow, but it is a spectacular film for those willing to immerse themselves in the story as it unfolds.<br/><br/>At one point we might imagine that the boy had hidden away in the secret room in the closet, only to get locked in by the mother's own hand when returning the metal supports which propped against the secret door, the ghostly knockings being the son trying to get it, ultimately to die there in what became his tomb. At the moment the mother finds the hidden passage, and the body of Simon and screams out, it seems in a flashback it occurs to her what happened to her son who had been missing for so long.<br/><br/>And yet so many other strange happenings suggest something dark and treacherous is going on as well but are they really or is it all perception? We have the medium who comes to the house, we see the children in the end, and so we are left with 2 possible outcomes to the story.<br/><br/>One in which the son gets accidentally locked under the stairs and dies, only to be found much later by mom who realizing what she did, takes pills to commit suicide and throws herself into the ocean.<br/><br/>Or two, she slips into the other world to care for the children beyond this life.<br/><br/>Whichever way you choose to look at it, this movie was fantastic. Comepelling, beautiful, haunting, not all that scary mind you, but enticing enough to keep you wondering, and a very nicely developed story."

A consistent plot concentrating on the characters and events rather than trying to distract the viewer with red herrings and tricks led to an exceptional, although possibly not surprising, conclusion.<br/><br/>Acting was fine from all the ensemble cast and it has been a while since I have been unnerved by anything I have seen in the cinema. Subtitles were also bold but not invasive and did not distract from the films beauty and excellent camera work. Music was used to great effect as well.<br/><br/>I felt the final scene was unnecessary however as the scene prior to this allowed the viewer (a'la Taxi Driver) to make their own minds up about the end.<br/><br/>This is a minor comment on a wholly excellent film and I will be looking out for the directors subsequent works.<br/><br/>As a small aside I saw this during a school holiday and a large number of 15 year olds had come to see the film and were disappointed by the subtitles but - to the films credit - they all stayed to the end and I definitely saw some jumps and cries from them during the movie."

","If you've ventured into cinemas watching a horror movie as of late, you've probably been treated with a few screams and shocks, but after leaving the theater, the experience is over. And while you enjoyed the film's fear factor, you probably talk about how 2 dimensional the films protagonists are and how you're glad they died in the 2nd reel.<br/><br/>If you remember watching some of the best horror films in recent memory, then you might remember a time when a film sent shivers down your spine and lingered with you well after the closing credits. The Orphanage is a classic ghost story that stays with you. The story is fairly straightforward, but the combination of fear and emotion cause the audience to experience the fear of our heroine, Laura.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film is in the beginning, where we see a young Laura playing with the other children at the orphanage just before she is to be adopted out. It's a simple scene that is very short, but provides a great setup for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Years later, an adult Laura comes back to the orphanage with her husband and her adopted son, Simon. She has the intention of opening it to service children with special needs. Simon has alleged imaginary friends that play with him. When he mysteriously disappears, Laura starts questioning if these friends are imaginary or if they are indeed ghosts.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is the genuine fear felt by the viewer. So often in modern horror movies, we are treated with false shocks and teases of something frightening that isn't really there. These types of shocks have become formulaic and predictable. In ""The Orphanage,"" you often know something is coming. You're just terrified of what it might be.<br/><br/>I also like this film's relationship with the supernatural. When Laura starts to feel that Simon's imaginary friends might be real, she has interesting interaction with the alleged ghosts. This is one of those films that sets forth its rules quite clearly about how the dead function.<br/><br/>What I love above all is the human nature in this film. There is a reason Guillermo Del Toro's name is lent as executive producer to this film. His two well known Spanish films, Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, deal with injustices towards children. While this is more of a traditional horror tale, it's still easy to see a few similarities between this and his work, notably the Devil's Backbone.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say this is the horror movie to end all horror movies, but it's certainly far better than Hollywood horror yarn that usually triumphs at the box office. It's smart, well acted, and has a heart. At the end, it lingers with you for a long while. I seriously haven't felt this way after leaving a horror film since the 6th Sense, to which this film owes a little dept."

Mind you, I don't mind watching foreign movies all that much, I usually make exceptions for horror movies, but this was blah. The suspense building up to the end was good though, but makes me wonder if it really was worth it. I am not going to give the ending away but, I would no recommend this unless if you absolutely wanted to see this movie. Unlike the rest of Del Toro's movies, this one just missed something that usually knows how to do so well. Though the scariest part of the movie was the sack kid, that reminded me of Michael Myers in a way, but he wasn't around enough to make his presence feel scary. <br/><br/>A disappointment highly!"

","I went to see this film not expecting too much and was therefore unmoved by the end credits. This is a film in the horror category that plays on atmosphere, camera style and storyline rather than sheer gore. To that end it's a decent enough effort. Yes it does deliver a hefty chunk of chilling atmosphere and the film is heavily influenced by such films as The Others, The Haunting and even The Grudge. The acting is fine too but I found many of the scenes overlong and predictable. Apart from two moments which will jolt you out of your seat, there is a distinct lack of scariness here simply because the key scenes are not convincing enough and there is a distinct lack of creepiness, director Bayona obviously preferring tension and pseudo-suspense - the latter of which is misplaced in a number of scenes. I can understand perfectly some people being drawn convincingly into the story by simple virtue of it's claustrophobic feel and the way it's all played out, but that is not enough to save it from being at times laborious. Instead of it being one of Spain's best it simply creates a level to which others might aspire to do better. A good effort but nonetheless disappointing."

He beats the door because he's been locked in the basement, but never says nothing. No cries, no yells. Only beats, because that's convenient for the story."

Cleverly plotted, it dares to take its time to create the required atmosphere rather than prematurely rushing into scaring its audience like so many horror films do nowadays.<br/><br/>The Orphanage concerns Laura; a former orphan who returns with her husband & son back to her childhood home which used to be an orphanage for handicapped children, which she hopes to reopen again.

","Beautifully conceived on all fronts, ""The Orphanage"" creates a powerful sense of uneasiness, and is surprisingly moving at times. This elegant ghost story ignores genre conventions, and delivers a touching tale of motherhood, love, and what may or may not lie on the other side. Already with his first feature, Juan Antonio Bayona has displayed a visual grace and with an elegant compositional sense, and a true understanding of which shot to use in order to create the proper mood or emotion. The film builds suspense and terror in classical fashion as the intricate storyline unfolds. ""The Orphanage"" takes a modern style of filmmaking, and then matches it with your traditional horror concerns. <br/><br/>Set in a crumbling children's home recently reopened by ex-resident Laura (Belén Rueda), this Spanish haunted house movie begins its assault after Laura's son Simón (Roger Príncep) vanishes on a sunny afternoon. Simón has an elaborate fantasy life, or so his parents think. He keeps telling them about imaginary friends, and his circle of imaginary friends keeps expanding. It's only later that Mom begins to catch on that maybe those imaginary friends aren't imaginary, just unseen. Just who they are and what they want make up the story of the movie. Convinced Simón's stories about his imaginary friends in the spooky building, Laura embarks on a quest to retrieve him, which will push her to the limit of sanity.<br/><br/>As with most ghost stories, this one is more unsettling than genuinely frightening, without any real violence or gore. The chills generally come from strange noises from behind the walls, and undistinguished images appearing in the distance. This movie heavily relies on its Neo-Gothic style set in a dense, suffocating atmosphere. The tension and mystery slowly builds, as the possibility that supernatural forces that may be at work, is how it achieves its storytelling power. The spell it casts early on does not evaporate until the very end, when the epilogue has finished."

","The Orphanage (2007) - directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced and introduced by Guillermo del Torro whose ghosts films El Espinazo del diablo and Pan's Labyrinth most certainly were the inspiration for the first time director. The films ""The Others"" and ""The Stir of Echoes"" also come to mind, as perhaps, Friday the 13 and the story of Peter Pan which may be the main inspiration for the film that looks at the story of the boy who never grew up and stayed in Neverland from the point of view of his mother. The orphanage is unsettling, scary, very moving and intelligent. It does not show the monsters, it implies. It makes us to identify with its main heroine, the orphan herself who after many years comes back to the very house she used to share with her childhood friends, also orphans and where she wants to open the house for the handicapped children. Little did she know that the old house has deep and horrifying secrets that may affect her life, sanity, and the lives of the dearest and closest to her. Very good film, creepy, and heartbreaking.

","This film far exceeded my expectations and the descriptions written by critics. One of the oddest things said about it was that it was one of the Scariest films made in years - there was nothing overtly frightening about it. There was however a sad and eerie mood from start to finish and was so engrossing that I forgot that I was reading subtitles! The mood was haunting and evoked great emotion. If I find any flaw in it at all I have to say it was the ending, so incredibility similar to Pan's Labyrinth that I felt somewhat disappointed at the ambiguity of the conclusion. Both films leave one with the jarring question of whether or not the obvious end was real or imagined on the part of the characters. I am sure the intention was to blur the line between reality and fantasy, but that sort of ending leaves me wondering - not a state of mind I expect to have after investing my time and emotions in a story."

","The Orphanage is not a horror film and it is not directed by Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>These two common misconceptions have followed the film around since it's release. The former can perhaps be dismissed as semantics but the latter bears some semblance to the belief several years ago that Quentin Tarantino had directed Hero(2002). The major difference is that del Toro is a genuinely talented director and Tarantino is an over-rated adolescent. But that's another rant for another day.<br/><br/>The Orphanage was actually directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, in his feature film debut, though it could easily be mistaken for del Toro's work. Best known for his comic book movies Blade II (2002) and Hellboy (2004), The Orphanage is more tonally similar to some of his Spanish language work, particularly The Devil's Backbone (2001) and elements of Pan's Labyrinth (2006). However indebted Bayona is to films of this type he still manages to carve out a niche for himself with a suspenseful, emotional and technically accomplished ghost story.<br/><br/>I mentioned before that I did not consider The Orphanage to be a horror film and I stand by that assertion. Although the horror genre has always been difficult to define I would rather refer to this movie as an exercise in suspense mixed with a good old-fashioned ghost story. This does not mean that the film is not scary, far from it. There are jump scares and horror clichés aplenty but the film is smart enough to play with these conventions in a number of smart ways.<br/><br/>A married couple with an ailing, adopted son move to a mansion in the country with the intention of setting up a care home for disabled children. The title of the film refers to the fact that the mother was also an orphan and the house is the orphanage where she spent her youth. An initial flashback to this time shows us that Laura was happy here and she clearly wants to help other young children now. Her son, Simon, seems content in the new house, especially as he finds a number of new invisible playmates. He and his new friends play games, including a frantic treasure hunt, and his parents are generally tolerant of his childish delusions. The initial pacing of the film is gentle, coming to a head with Simon's sudden disappearance and Laura's desperate attempts to find him. She is willing to go to any lengths to be reunited with her son. The events which make up the latter half of the film are sometimes shocking, often intensely creepy and move at a fast pace towards the inevitable but heart-wrenching conclusion. It ticks all the stereotypical boxes for this kind of film - old dark house, creepy children, loud noises, even a surprisingly elaborate sequence involving a medium - but manages to feel fresh through a number of unique twists. The use of children's games is especially effective, with one memorable moment employing just the right mixture of tension and outright fear.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous but unobtrusive, certain shots are stunning when taken on their own but do not detract from the flow of the film. The use of cg within the film is subtle, something which non-American productions seem much better at. Visual effects are used to add to a scene rather than overpower it, except in the strangely cg-heavy title sequence. It is an anachronism in an otherwise technically sparse film and was most likely tacked on late in the game. The performances are likewise terse. Most notable is Belén Rueda as Laura; managing to play the distraught mother with commendable subtlety rather than the usual perfunctory hysterics. The performances of children are more difficult to critique. Suffice it to say that most of the young cast are blissfully silent and the son, Thomas (Roger Princep) does a fine job with some challenging material.<br/><br/>And there is yet another element which sets this film apart from its' contemporaries. It is in Spanish and, perhaps unfairly, this only adds to the overall sense of mystery. Even with subtitles, there is a more active engagement when we are viewing something that is not in our native language. We are not as focused on what the characters are saying, instead we really see them, their interactions with their environment and each other. I genuinely believe that this linguistic divide makes the film more effective and scarier. And make no mistake, this film is scary. True it has more in common with the short, sharp shocks of The Others (2001) than the hysteria-inducing gore and violence of Haute Tension (2003) but the insidious intrusion of the supernatural into the domestic is truly chilling.<br/><br/>The Orphanage is a highly effective ghost story with some interesting twists on the sub-genre that manages to maintain a constant level of dread and suspense. The resolution is shocking but also manages to retain an element of hope, as well as an insight into a possible view of the afterlife. I would strongly recommend this film for anyone who is tired of the assembly line abattoir of American horror  where tanned teens' barely one-dimensional lives are ended in a spray of (usually off-screen) viscera. If you have any brain-cells functioning after being subjected to such films, The Orphanage may give you a few sleepless nights but, after all, isn't that what a good ghost story is for..."

","Ooooh, a good old fashioned ghost story! With Del Toro producing you say? Sold! This is the kind of movie that Hollywood very rarely gets right, which might explain why they're so intent on remaking other people's films. This isn't about hand on the shoulder/cat in the cupboard jump scares or masked men with knives spraying blood all over the set, this is quality honest to goodness suspense and creaking dread, with an atmosphere that'll linger with you longer than any of that decapitato-porn people keep insisting is scary. It's never terrifying, but the constant sense of unease is masterful, making this a treat of sustained suspense.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, there's some moments which could have been a lot creepier if handled slightly differently, but for the most part the restraint on show is admirable, and it's shot in a way that imbues the orphanage itself with a sinister character of it's own. Well worth a watch for fans of the supernatural or just fans of good cinema in general."

Even thought you pretty much know what is going to happen throughout the film, the ending was different to all the typical thrillers that leave you with a feeling that evil prevails. It has a very sweet ending! Funny thing is, I watched the film one evening on my own, so after I went to bed and was reading a book... when my bedside lamp went out...I was so scared in the dark, I thought something was going to happen to me...nothing did...but the film did manage to get my heart pumping!"

","It surprised me how high the rating was for this movie after seeing it. Maybe it's because it is one of very few horror movies that deliver any kind of human story. It seems like Del Toro was conflicted over whether he wanted it to be a horror movie or not. On one hand, the kids from Laura's childhood did not have malicious intent, but on the other hand the story plays out in a way that is definitely intended to induce fear and suspense. Nothing about the nature of the story or characters called for most of the horror elements that were included. There was no story reason for Tomas' mask to look creepy, or for him to hurt Lauren. There were other small things that seemed to have only been done for jump scare and suspense purposes, like when the ghost kids smash closed the window to respond to Laura or Simon muttering mysteriously in the cave instead of being more playful with his ""friends"". The scene with the medium was also made very suspenseful, but really didn't need to be. These things aren't necessarily bad, but I don't think they really helped to tell the story. The only horror genre motivated thing that was entirely bad was Beninga getting hit by the ambulance; it was actually really funny because of how ridiculous it was.<br/><br/>The story itself is fairly standard and formulaic, but it doesn't have any evident holes or issues. It's adequate and nothing more, not making any statements or offering anything that unique. The characters are similarly flat, which makes sense because the focus is more on the situations they are in rather than their actions. I found that this made for flat scenes and a flat movie overall, but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. I suppose it's well directed and is definitely made to look visually appealing. There was a lot done with the lighting and angles. From what I have observed, horror and thriller movies seem to be great outlets for production specialists to really have fun and get inventive, particularly directors of photography. They may not feature the greatest writing, but they are excellent examples of visual storytelling and using certain kinds of shot combinations to create the right mood.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend that you go out looking to watch this movie, but if it's showing in your Spanish class or on a bus trip or something it may keep your interest. If you don't like jump scares and gore, you'll be okay. There are very few of either, and the first twenty minutes or so are not scary or suspenseful at all. Actually, the movie is really more of a fantasy story than anything, and was just infused with horror elements to increase drama. Overall Rating: 6.3/10."
"deltaop","9","4","6","23 August 2014"," Not your average ghost story
","The scripts of most ghost stories nowadays are mostly focused on cheap thrills and shocks; a little gore here, a hideous face there. The story and scares are not in synergy that is why it feels like you are being frightened in all too predictable ways. To clarify, I am not arguing against jump-scenes but rather their substance and contribution to the film.<br/><br/>For a refreshing change, El Orfanato is a horror flick where the jump-scenes play a critical, almost essential role in the film. They are not there for some cheap skip-a-beats but rather are well-worked into the story of the film.<br/><br/>Also, El Orfanato pulls at all the right emotional strings with its secondary theme of a mother's love. Belen Rueda plays the role of a tormented mother excessively well. It was almost too believable.<br/><br/>Although, some may argue that the film sometimes loses track with slow-burning scenes but I believe that these scenes were essential in shedding light on the story and were required for the great character development achieved by this film.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a dumbed-down ghost story but rather an intricate tale of love, pain and redemption. The film's ending sums these remarks up superbly."

","This film is very pretty, subdued, and haunting, like everyone else says, but it has a major plot flaw that spoiled it for me.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS HERE: The mother was supposedly raised in this orphanage, right? And those 5 children were her playmates. Yet, she doesn't remember her playmates all suddenly VANISHING, while they were still children? Wouldn't there have been a big scandal or mystery as to where the children went? And that woman that poisoned them - the mother doesn't even remember her working at the orphanage (she is told that the woman only worked there a short time.) Gee, wouldn't somebody have wondered why this woman suddenly left, after 5 children vanished? It seems to me the mother would have said, when her child vanished, ""Gosh,this is just like when I was a child - 5 of my playmates suddenly vanished from this orphanage!"" We know the children were not believed to have died, or died from natural causes, because the woman Benigna took the bodies, hid them, and sealed them up. But no mention is made of anyone ever having even noticed they were gone. And I am sure the mother, at least would have been traumatized by losing so many friends at once.<br/><br/>There are people that remember the little boy, Tomas, drowning in the cave when the other children took his mask. But nobody remembers the other children vanishing? Did I miss something here? There are seemingly hundreds of rave reviews for this movie, and nobody seems to have noticed this gaping hole in the plot but me?

"Chris Knipp","7","10","20","29 September 2007"," Uneasy beginnings
","Juan Antonio Bayona's first film 'El Orfanato' has the formidable sponsorship of Guillermo del Toro. He's also found US distribution for it by Picturehouse, who handled his celebrated 'Pan's Labyrinth.' The latter shares certain elements with the screenplay by Sergio G. Sanchez, another first-timer. It concerns a couple living in a former orphanage whose adopted seven-year-old tragically disappears, causing the mother to resort to mediums and séances and seek communion with the dead through reliving her own hidden past. Del Toro not only produced 'The Orphanage,' he has chosen to personally promote the film. And since it is a premiere effort for much of the film-making team (except the actors), its polish is impressive; moreover the story is a sophisticated one. But both story and treatment wind up being little more than a high class horror moviewithout the gore of the current crop, but with a lot of loud sound effects designed to jerk you out of your socksnot to mention the usual crumbling corpses, hideous masks, and doors suddenly shut behind innocent victims. One step forward for some young filmmakers in Spain; but another step backwardand no competition, needless to say, for 'Pan's Labyrinth.' This is another sign of FSLC and New York Film Festival director Richard Pena's admirable support of Spanish language films, but it is not the brightest gem in the festival's crown this year.<br/><br/>An opening flashback shows young Laura playing with five companions at an orphanage in a big old house thirty years ago, just before Laura is to be adopted. Flash forward, and a 37-year-old Laura (Belen Rueda) and her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) with seven-year-old son Simon have moved back into the very same old orphanage, unused now, preparing to renovate it to house a small number of mentally and physically handicapped children.<br/><br/>Simon (Roger Princep) seems uneasy in the new location. He doesn't sleep well, and has dreamed up some imaginary friends. Various signs suggest he's somehow connecting with Laura's childhood. Once a scary fake ""social worker"" (Montserrat Carulla)an old lady with thick glassesworks her way briefly into the house to give Laura a threatening interview, things turn permanently bad. Simon mysteriously is led to find out two things about himself Laura and Carlos weren't going to tell him till later: he's adopted, and he's HIV-positive. During an initial reception for the new home, Simon refuses to come downstairs, and shortly later he disappears. This reception sequence seemed to me the most creepy and memorable of the film, its use of handicapped children in scary masks eerily reminiscent of the photographs of Diane Arbus.<br/><br/>Laura carries out a desperate and hopeless search for the missing boy. After six months she arranges through a specialist in parapsychology to have a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) come to the house with a team of observers. The result of this episode, which involves night-vision imaging, TV monitors, and other tech devices, is that Aurora thinks Simon is somehow connected now with the orphans who lived in the building thirty years agoLaura's contemporaries and pals. Actually, we knew that; the elaborate business is absorbing, and Chaplin delivers a stark, haunting turn, but it adds nothing new and from here on in some sense the screenplay gets tangled in its own complications.<br/><br/>Earlier discussions with Simon about Peter Pan (he announces he's never going to grow up) introduced themes of regression and eternal childhood. They flow in and out of the film hereafter. Carlos is of the opinion that the former orphanage has bad vibes and they need to leave, or at least take a break from being there. But Laura refuses to go, so Carlos leaves her by herself. Thereafter things get very complicated and the screen belongs to Rueda, whose emotional intensity and sensitive face carry us through a series of sequences involving reenactments of childhood games and other physical experiments by Laura to communicate with her pals from the past and find out what happened to Simon. The film flows in and out of reality and sanity and, frankly, lost me at some point here, so that whether the ending is satisfying or not isn't something I'm prepared to say.<br/><br/>Thematically this is an interesting screenplay, but the use of very conventional, if slick, horror film shock devices would tend to alienate the fan of straightforward drama. 'Pan's Labyrinth,' with its richer canvas and constant shifts back and forth from a child's fantasy (or supernatural) world to a grim present political reality provide a far more satisfying and complex experience. Excellent performance by Belen (who previously co-starred in 'The Sea Inside'), and a promising debut for Bayona, Sanchez, and their team. The sound design is effective, but over-the-top."

","I've always been a fan of foreign language films. And, I've also been a fan of horror films. So I was really looking forward to The Orphanage as I felt that the film had the potential to be a great thrill fest.<br/><br/>But despite this, I was left thinking what might have been and slightly baffled as to why this film was such a let down. Directed by Spanish first timer Juan Antonio Bayona, the film see's Laura, who grew up an orphan herself, raising her adopted son Simón with her husband Carlos in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive, and both parents hope that the boy can settle in well to his new surroundings. All seems to be going well until Simon tells Laura that he has five invisible friends. Taking on her husbands advice that their son is only trying to escape boredom by inventing these 'friends', Laura laughs off her sons comment and seems happy to play along with it. But in true horror movie style, things start to go 'bump in the night', and Laura begins to wonder if in fact, they are alone. And on the day that she officially re-opens the orphanage for disabled children, Simon is kidnapped, which leads his parents and the police on to a wild goose chase in the hope of his safe return. It all sounds like a great premise to a good movie, and while the Orphanage isn't all that bad, there are quite simply not enough big moments in the film to warrant it a five star rating. Many of the supposed edge of your seat scenes are a let down, the creepy old woman, who for some reason feels that she would be useful with a shovel, is just annoying, and the film goes for long sequences that produce absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>I do have to give credit where it's due though. Belena Rueda, who plays Laura, is terrific throughout, and some of the cinematography is excellent, but folks, if you want a good spooky story about a haunted house, go rent The Others again."

Although uncredited, the exec producer Guillermo del Toro plays the doctor at the Emergency Ward who tends to Laura after she injures her leg. Juan Antonio Bayona wanted the film to hark back in tone to 1970s Spanish cinema , hence the casting of Geraldine Chaplin who had starred in two successful films from that period, Ana and the wolves and Cria Cuervos. The orphanage was an old colonial house in the town of Llanes , Asturias , as a lot of Juan Antonio Bayona's cinematic plans were impossible to achieve on location, several parts of the house had to be recreated on a soundstage , in fact , over 80% of the film was shot in a studio .

Thrilling as well sensible musical score by Fernando Velazquez .<br/><br/>Juan Antonio Bayona's affecting debut feature and was premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where it received a 10 minute standing ovation.

"johnnyboyz","5","6","11","10 October 2008"," The Orphanage is no orphan, in fact it's actually related and linked to several other recent films.
","In a way, I feel sorry for El Orfanato director Juan Antonio Bayona, a man who has had a lot of studio backing from a lot of different companies, all of which pop up at the beginning of the film; a man who is under a lot of pressure to perform following the backing of said studios and a certain Guillermo del Toro whose 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth is clearly an inspiration for this piece; and I feel sorry for the director in the sense the film has come off as rather a dud, recycling old material and presenting us with few freights on top of a hollow film viewing experience.<br/><br/>I mentioned Guillermo del Toro just a second ago; the aesthetic of this film and obvious visual inspiration from Pan's Labyrinth is clear, making El Orfanato come across as an attempt to cash in on said film's recent US and European success by way of quickly churning out another Spanish language film; with del Toro's name splashed all over it; that falls into the genre of horror but perhaps ambiguously so and recreating the exact same mood and visual image. For Spain but maybe more so for Mexico, Pan's Labyrinth now comes across as these two nation's golden ticket  their Spielberg's 'Jaws' if you like; a film that if marketed correctly, with the right names all over it and one that falls into an array of genres, it'll draw in the crowds and the money.<br/><br/>I for one loved Pan's Labyrinth, but when it is used to be manipulated into an excuse for further films that carry the same look and feel and 'presented' (whatever that means) by the same man who directed the film that started it all, it saddens me. The Orphanage, to give it its English title, comes across as one long procession; grinding us through scenes set in big 'spooky' houses with kids that see things that perhaps aren't really there as everyone runs around trying to find 'the truth'. Primarily the film borrows too much from Pan's Labyrinth and 2001 Alejandro Amenábar film The Others, another film with a dark look about a woman stuck in a large old house trying to figure out why her kids can see things she can't.<br/><br/>Like Pan's Labyrinth and The Others, The Orphanage places its child character in a situation that threatens them physically. In The Others, the kids had an illness that would see them react harmfully to sunlight whereas in Pan's Labyrinth, the protagonist was under constant threat from the war around her and was placed in a number of 'imaginary' situations that could've caused her harm. Here, young boy Simón (Príncep) is HIV positive and it acts as his psychical 'scar' if you like, following an adoption by couple Carlos (Cayo) and Laura (Rueda).<br/><br/>Then the film has the audacity to take one of the most effective scenes from The Others and recycle it for its own gain. I may not have liked The Others as much as everyone else did but my favourite scene from that film was when Kidman's character came across her daughter's drawings of her imaginary friends. This worked brilliantly because Kidman, as do the audience, sees what we're all supposed to be wary or afraid of through a child's sketch which is of course filtered through its own memory anyway. We got this rather than an out and out shot of one of them or a glimpse of one of them which would have acted as a gimmicky 'jump' scene. In The Others, we are given a crayon drawing we must take in, absorb and think about  it was chilling and quite effective. The Orphanage pillages this scene by having Simón draw a young kid wearing that ridiculous mask that's on all the promotional posters and the cover of the film anyway. It's not spooky and it's not effective and if any of us have memories that go back beyond seven years then it's not clever either.<br/><br/>So if the film is a bit of a rip off, is it as enjoyable anyway on its own merit? Well, not really. After a bit of chin scratching; head scratching and behind the scenes bank balance checking, the film peels off and becomes a story told purely from Laura's point of view following a scene in which she (as do we) catches a glimpse of one of Simón's 'friends'. From here, The Orphanage banks on the old psychological horror trick; the 'am I going crazy?' routine and what follows is a series of scenes dedicated to finding clues, running about the house and gardens and pulling dramatic faces while panting once or twice all during which the audience must endure necessary set ups and non-existent payoffs.<br/><br/>It's easy to knock a film for its logic if you look hard enough but on this occasion it's worth asking would Laura really be left alone in the house if people were aware of her possible fragile mental state? I doubt it. She'd already assumed to have spotted people she's supposedly seen before in the street and she admits to seeing someone else who wasn't really there one time on a beach so would it be right to leave her home alone? Probably not. The Orphanage has some interesting ideas even if they're borrowed and one scene much nearer the end that revolves around a game in which you look away and try to catch people sneaking up on you is effective enough to make you shuffle in your seat but I hope too many people aren't fooled by this copycat horror film in the long run."

Well, for me it's been a big disappointing: for start, you cannot sympathize with such an annoying and arrogant child. So, when he's gone, you're thinking ""what a loss"".<br/><br/>Anyway, after that the movie is just another repetition of the theme ""spirits in haunted places"", because they suffered some tremendous destiny here, of course, with all the consequences. We're not spared either the parapsychological babble, or the mother considered nuts by anyone with a stable mind, that naturally will find the deep truth. Bore, bore, bore.<br/><br/>And the worst thing is that they want it to be taken seriously...

","I won't include a synopsis. I will say this film was great. From a seemingly innocent start, the suspense built quite steadily, and I was often thinking ""oh no, what's going to happen?"" - and what did happen was quite refreshing, as it didn't tow the usual 'hollywood suspense/spook film' party line. The characterisation worked well. It was easy to become involved with the main players. Their situation/surrounding was very believable, and this was helped by the fine acting throughout, particularly Belen Rueda-'Laura', and Roger Princep-'Simon'. Special mention to Geraldine Chaplin for a fantastic (short) portrayal of a clairvoyant. That scene had me holding my breath. Although I sort of guessed what was coming towards the end, it didn't detract at all from the enjoyment. I was able to relax a little after all the tension, unlike my two companions - my girlfriend was hiding behind my shoulder, and our friend was hiding behind her hands most of the movie. Terrific."

","Greetings again from the darkness. We are blessed with so few horror movies for grown-ups because it is a nearly impossible genre to succeed in. There is such a fine line between suspense and stupidity, and to succeed there must be an air of believability. This film manages to walk the high wire and maintain the balance ... to the point of a few good scares and more than enough suspense! <br/><br/>Produced by the great Guillermo del Toro and directed by Spain's new hot shot director, Juan Antonio Bayona, the film has some very basic, even cliché, story lines and premises. Still the quality is so high and the acting so strong that it does suck the viewer right into this world. The simplistic approach is what makes it work. The house creaks, clanks and other noises are extraordinarily creepy and not over the top. The best moments are the ""little"" things and I really enjoyed Geraldine Chaplin's time as the medium.<br/><br/>OK, it is a horror movie, but this is a very good performance from Bolen Rueda, who was so memorable in ""The Sea Inside"". Ms. Rueda is Laura, who wants to set up a house for a few needy kids in the same house in which she lived as an orphan when she was a kid. Guess what? There is more to the story than that! Laura's own adopted son is played by the extraordinarily cute Roger Princep as Simon. Big eyes and bushy hair, he is like a living (or maybe not) doll.<br/><br/>It is so difficult for these films to find an audience, especially when released in the U.S. with sub-titles, but this one deserves attention to anyone who enjoys a little suspense and a few good darkened theatre jumps in the seat!"

","If you're looking for an excellently crafted and engaging psychologically suspenseful thriller or chiller that consistently tests your emotional senses, this is an amazingly clever, artistically horrifying and spooky flick to see. For me, this film does bring back the haunting memories of films like The Devil's Backbone, The Haunting, The Sixth Sense, The Others, Pan's Labyrinth, and Tideland. Stylistically detailed in the film-making art, from the beginning to its end, this film does keep the audience's imagination running wild almost as if they have put themselves in the shoes of Belén Rueda's Laura. <br/><br/>The themes of motherhood, fear, memories, fantasy, loss and death, jotting from frame to frame, are the film's vital elements that subject the audience to their interactions with all the characters, and to consistently sink them into fuzzy and unsettling imagination as well as profound panic. Indeed, this film has a very creative and unique way of dealing with fear, loss and death. Every piece of setting, background, and location is captivating and does keep the themes alive, playing and tugging at the viewers' emotions. Is this film a ghost story or is it about a mother's unwillingness to face up to reality? It's the sort of film that has no straight answers. Fortunately, this is not a film that applies cheesy shock-inducing tactics for the testing of the audience's reflex actions. <br/><br/>Great script, great art direction, fabulously interesting and unique characters, and phenomenal performances! The characters do command the audience's compassion and attention throughout the film, And the audience will feel continuously trapped by forms of mysterious forces that are taking them on an unpredictable and creepy roller coaster ride in their attempt to distinguish between what's real or what's fantasy. And the music score? Masterfully accompanying the scenes to bring out suspense. Oh yes, this film does spooks and Laura's plight is so visually emotional to follow. The stunningly creepy scenes do persistently plague and play tricks to one's imagination. There are abundance of cool twists and turns and when the film ends, it would leave the audience eager for discussions. <br/><br/>I was very surprised to learn that this wonderful masterpiece is the debut film of Director Bayona and Screenwriter Sanchez They absolutely bring so many brain-prodding and unforgettable moments to the story. An absolutely engaging and unforgettable film and my favorite foreign-language film of 2007!"

","I'm a big fan of horror movies, so I have seen quite a bunch of horror movies from different countries, and let me tell you that this movie is just beyond every other thing you've seen so far. While the story is not really original (It revolves around ghosts and death), the script, the directing and the acting takes the movie to another level. This isn't about scary creatures, unrealistic monsters or creeps, it's all about scary thoughts. The use of light and shadow was so well done and the atmosphere was so dark and eerie that I jumped from my seat a couple of times. I don't want to give spoilers but go to watch it mentally prepared and expecting the unexpected...you'll still get scared."

","I don't understand why everyone is saying this is a ""triumph for the horror genre"" and one newspaper reviewer described it as ""the scariest horror since The Shining"". I am sorry but I must disagree. There were a few ""jumpy bits"" but I thought the overall story was not only very predictable but also common. Why is it every horror writer insists on making the ghosts ""good"" ghosts in the end? It alway turns out the ghosts are doing what they are doing for a good reason for instance Gothika, The Ring, and crap horror films like that. Why can't there just be some bad-ass ghosts doing what they are doing because they are really actually scary and not all nice and sugar-coated in the end. One horror film that has done this recently was Dead Silence albeit that wasn't very good but at least a step in the right direction. I would not recommend this to anyone. Not scary again, and now I must continue my quest for a horror film that genuinely frightens me."

Yes creepy houses can be scary - think of 'The Shining' with Jack Nicolson, and the sense of menace without all the trickery of this film. The hideous figures in 'Pan's Labyrinth was really scary but hideous masks here were sick rather than scary. Yes there were the shocks that made you react physically but they were so contrived. Yes the female actor was terrific but all the other characters were hammy or stilted. What about the farce of the medium? The husband particularly had a nothing role. The music at the end was corny too. Not a success for me at all."

"bts1984","9","5","9","29 September 2011"," Authentic, a modern legend.
","Even though we look at this movie and can tell it's perfectly recent, at the same it oozes a certain old-fashioned feeling, which is good. Indeed, it is something of a return to the classic horror stories: simple, deep and intense, has soul, atmosphere (it transmits a cold and solitary atmosphere), film-making of quality, gorgeous cinematography, a beautiful musical score by Fernando Velázquez and expertly done and realistic scares instead of cheap terror and special effects.<br/><br/>On a first impression it is a little tricky to understand. It's a great deal of information to ""digest"" in just once and sometimes it happens very fast. But the fact that it is complex makes it all the more interesting and distinguish. At least it sets apart from others in a time when movies keep getting increasingly similar to each other. Plus, it gets easier to understand the more you watch it.<br/><br/>This is a touching, depressing and tragic story. Certain parts are truly scary. No kidding, they are! Certain events are so sudden, they happen so fast - it's hard to explain, but they catch you by surprise when you less expect. Some of the content is strong and disturbing. I wouldn't recommend this for hyper-sensitive people.<br/><br/>The orphanage is enormous and its architecture is very beautiful. Although ""only"" an orphanage, it definitely has that creepy, spooky atmosphere perfect for a superior ghost story. It's like a big, sinister shadowy house. The settings too are wonderful.<br/><br/>The actors are generally very competent, both the adults and the children. Among the adults, the beautiful Bélen Rueda steals the show with her acting. Among the children, the best performance belongs to Roger Príncep, although each child is rightfully chosen for their role.<br/><br/>Clearly a very good movie and a breath of fresh air in the recent history of cinema. Although still fairly recent, it's not too soon to consider it what it is: one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>Of course, Hollywood wasted no time and (already!) in 2007 bought the rights to remake it. What is it with Americans that they have to remake everything? Instead of remaking, why don't they start developing their own ideas and leave the other movies as they are? And if they remake, then they should only remake films that are bad or certain films that are too old and awfully dated (crying for a remake). And I don't think this wicked movie is bad, so I do not approve a remake.<br/><br/>I can understand J. A. Bayona's disappointment, to which he famously said «The Americans have all the money in the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money» and «The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits».<br/><br/>Title in Portugal: 'O Orfanato'."

","Mild spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>In these days of J-horror and K-horror and torture porn and zombie comedies, it is wonderful to come across something as classic as this. This is about as artfully made a horror movie you are going to find. Which doesn't mean it skimps on the scares. In fact, there's a scene involving an old lady pushing a baby carriage that made me jump right out of my seat -- twice! The movie opens in what is obviously the most cheerful orphanage in the history of the world. Girls are playing and giggling in bright sunshine. The building is a beautiful manor. That's when we learn that one of the girls, red-headed Laura, is about to be adopted. What unfolds is Laura's story.<br/><br/>After the orphanage scene, we cut straight to Laura at age 37. She's married to a doctor and they have an adopted son, age 7. The three of them are all back at the orphanage, now abandoned. The family has acquired the manor (which still looks pretty good) with the intent of reopening it as a home for disabled children.<br/><br/>Simon, their son, has two imaginary friends, something which his parents tolerate. Suddenly, after moving to the orphanage, he announces he has five additional made-up friends, one of whom seems to live in a cave on the beach (the manor is at the sea shore).<br/><br/>When the disabled children show up for a welcoming lawn party, the kids are given masks to wear (purchased, by the way, at the Deeply Disturbing Mask Store). Inside the house, Laura and her son have a loud argument and she slaps him.<br/><br/>Shortly afterward, Laura is attacked by a masked child wearing one of the old-fashioned orphan dresses. The child runs off. It is then that we learn that Simon has disappeared.<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie is the search for Simon, who Laura is convinced is still in the house. There is a seance in which a horrifying moment in the orphanage's history is revealed. Clues are dropped. Strange dolls turn up. Doors slam shut. What does this doorknob laying on the floor open? Laura's husband becomes exasperated by her behavior and insists they leave. Laura begs for more time. He says two days, then he leaves.<br/><br/>With Laura now alone in the house, the movie kicks into overdrive.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough about Belen Rueda as Laura, who is on screen 90 percent of the movie. She has huge expressive eyes that show love, fear, passion and determination. An incredible performance.<br/><br/>I also want to call attention to the use of foreshadowing in this movie. If any movie cries out to be watched twice, this is one. Little things happen early that you could miss, but which pay off huge later on.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending. It took a while to dawn on me what was actually happening, but once it did my heart was in my throat and I was on the verge of tears. The husband has the final scene and it's incredibly elegant and touching.<br/><br/>This is, of course, a Spanish movie and some posts I read here advise that orphanages have a deep resonance in Spanish culture. They were filled up with the children of parents that had been imprisoned or shot for being opposed to Dictator Franco. They were not, as you might imagine, nurturing places for children.<br/><br/>This movie is for all time."

But when the movie continued, I wasn't realizing anymore that I was watching to a movie: I was there, and I was very scared. The movie made me even cry at the ending, and though it's not a very 'scary' movie with shocks and the like, but a thrilling movie, with recurring effects. It doesn't need blood, special effects etc. And I must confess: at the ending the film made me cry that the tears rolled over my cheeks, I have never been that moved by a movie."

","""One, two, three, knock on the wall."".never before have such innocent lines from a children's game of hide and seek carried so much foreboding as they do in Juan Antonio Bayona's The Orphanage (El Orfanato). In fact, I can't recall ever watching a movie that so creeped me out and yet left me emotionally drained at the end, to the point where I was moved to tears. Such is the mastery of this film.<br/><br/>Marketed heavily on the name of Guillermo del Toro, the masterful director of Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone (and you thought he was best known for that Hellboy crap), who served as Producer, The Orphanage is really the achievement of writer Sergio G. Sánchez, for whom this marks only his third of five screenplays, and director Bayona helming his first theatrical film.<br/><br/>One of the best ghost story fables to come along since 2001's The Others, the movie tells the story of Laura who, along with her husband Carlos, purchase the vacant orphanage in which she spent her childhood. The couple plan to covert it into their residence and home for disabled children. Everything appears to be going swimmingly until their adopted son Simon, who already has a couple of imaginary friends, begins to see the mysterious figure of Tomas, a young boy whose face is ominously hidden by a burlap sack. The boundaries between reality and fantasy become blurred when Laura also begins seeing the child, and become all the more heightened when tragedy strikes the young family in the form of Simon's sudden disappearance.<br/><br/>In an attempt to find their son, the couple employ the services of a medium and team of parapsychologists with hair-raising results. Bayona masterfully ratchets up the creep factor by having Laura conclude that the only way she can uncover clues to Simon's disappearance is by spending two days alone in the orphanage and trying to summon the ghosts of the children that walk its halls. All of which leads to a terrifying and emotionally draining end.<br/><br/>Thanks to del Toro, The Orphanage carries much of the look and feel of Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone, two films equally obsessed with the plight of children in harms way. And, like both del Toro films, you can expect to find yourself left in awe at the brilliantly crafted story The Orphanage tells."

Lots of bumps and loud noises in the dark accompanied with suspenseful music. Most of these sequences lead up to absolutely nothing, which really takes away from the purpose of the suspense. I didn't care for any of the characters and there were only a few bits of interesting dialogue. Generally speaking this movie didn't have a whole lot of original material. The whole concept of the little kid having imaginary friends in a haunted house has been done in so many different movies I felt like I had already seen most of what this movie had to offer."
"larkspur-24011","4","4","7","4 December 2019"," Well-crafted, but a boring unoriginal story makes this a boring unenjoyable film
","While I have rated this film 4/10, I want to make clear that Bayona's directorial skill in his debut is actually excellent. This is a quality-made film. The direction, cinematography, set-design, editing and acting are all excellent. The problem with the overall film is that the story is completely unoriginal, paper-thin and simply not enjoyable.<br/><br/>I do not rate films based on their marketing. But it is important to say that this is not a horror movie. Nor is it a thriller. This film is best described as a tragic supernatural drama with a creepy setting and a few jump-scares.<br/><br/>The Good: Bayona uses a lot of slow and sometimes shaky camera pans. When coupled with the dark, creepy sets, and long, patient scenes, they are effective at creating fleeting moments of suspense. At times this film is reminiscent of The Others. However, these moments are very few and far between, mostly coming in the very short build-up to the film's easily predicted climax. Luckily Belén Rueda's passionate, over-the-top, but believable performance as a grieving, desperate mother helps to carry this film's creepy tone throughout.<br/><br/>The Bad: There is nothing original in the story and it borrows everything it brings from other successful films. The Devil's Backbone, The Others, Poltergeist, The Sixth Sense, and even The Shining are all drawn-from in the creation of this story. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (those are each excellent films) except that this film has so little substance of plot that it's hard to even make a comparison. The plot is so thin, you could write it out in two sentences. Aside from the main character Laura, each character is as cliche and thin as the plot.<br/><br/>Summary: This film is a credit to Bayona's directing ability. He's taken tired ghost story cliches and a lackluster script and managed to create a successful film that is praised by critics. For me, however, great direction, great acting, and quality film-making were not enough to save this sad, depressing, thin story and plodding, lackluster script from descending into forgettable obscurity. I love this genre, but found myself thoroughly bored during the film and disappointed by the lack of originality. For fans of actual supernatural thrillers who watch this - go in with low expectations and try to appreciate the quality of the film-making... because the story is completely drab.<br/><br/>Acting 8/10 Excellent, slightly over-the-top performance by Belén Rueda
Direction 8/10 Excellent debut for J.A. Bayona
Production Quality 8/10 Excellent cinematography, production design, editing.
Screenwriting 5/10 Average, but lackluster screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez

In the end, a search inside the house was the minimum necessary for the woman to find the deceased body of her boy and the movie would last even less without the illogical things that succeed: how did the kid went to the basement if the door that leads there was closed years ago with wallpaper covering it?

The most impressive element of this movie is the lighthouse, the symbol of guidance and safety. The plot is not focusing on it too much, but if you pay attention to some events, you will understand that the lighthouse offers a felling of safety, something that I never seen before to a horror movie.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was very special, I shed some tears.

","I've never been a real fan of horror films, I've only liked the odd one now and then just to be frightened; but this film, this underrated gem, has made me value the genre even more whilst terrifying me not with cheap scares but with atmosphere, cinematography and lighting, and also leaving me with a tear in my eye upon its conclusion. Never has a horror film done that to me.<br/><br/>J.A. Bayona's The Orphanage (El Orfanato) was a Spanish horror film released back in 2007 to critical acclaim from both western and native audiences and critics, and personally I agree. The film maintains a slow pace whilst establishing the narrative and its setting, focusing on the eerie atmosphere the titular orphanage exhibits. The film relies wholly on its setting and subject matter to deliver its horror with only the odd jump scare here and there, and this worked extremely well. It was unnerving whenever Laura explores the orphanage, as the films excellent sound design and lighting made it a place of fear and horror.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT Although the narrative isn't wholly original, it is a perfect re-imagining of the classic ghost story; tying a narrative about loss and a mother's love with the presence of ghosts from the buildings past. It was only at the end of the film when I truly understood Laura's determination and love for Simon, being how she was willing to die in order to be reunited with her son after accidentally causing his death, that I became emotional towards the film. Given how she committed suicide to be with her son, and in turn take care of the ghost children upon learning of their horrific demise, I was surprisingly moved by this revelation so much that I was nearly drawn to tears. Never have I seen a horror film with a heart and moving ending such as this, and it has all the more encouraged me to explore the horror genre not with the intention of being scared but with being moved.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, particularly that of Laura's portrayer, which aided the film in its goal of telling a moving story about a mother's love and loss in the form of a horror film. This film has me excited not only for JA Bayona as a filmmaker but for the horror genre becoming a means of exploring complex emotional issues that we humans endure in life. And for that I award this film 10 out of 10, or 5 out of 5, a must see foreign film for both true fans of the horror genre and film buffs."

","A well made film that benefits from the believable acting of the entire cast; especially the lead actress who elegantly held the entire film together with a restrained and effective performance that endeared her to the viewer.<br/><br/>The lovely location did not hurt either; however..<br/><br/>As a horror or ghost film I did not find that it worked and I also sometimes had the impression that it was originally a 3-part serial that had been put together as a film.<br/><br/>Essentially, the film was not creepy or atmospheric enough to set my spine a-tingling as a ghost film nor did it deliver enough shocks or 'gore' as a horror film (I am ignoring the one scene with the social worker, but that has been done may times before; though I did feel queasy at the thought of the mouth-to-mouth).<br/><br/>The film sets up scenes where waves of tension should be crashing over the viewer (e.g. the medium); but any tension or expectation ebbs away with the low key approach taken, allowing the film to drift gently along for another 20-minutes of nothing really happening. The director should perhaps have watched similar films, e.g. 'The Innocents', to get an idea on how to generate mounting fright and spine-tingling tension, as he certainly had the actors to achieve this.<br/><br/>The whole film was just too flat to be frightening and I am glad I watched in on DVD at home rather than at the cinema as I had to curb my impatience sometimes with a cup of tea. Still it is interesting how different people react to films; some found this film frightening and others found it little more than a quirky thriller or mystery. Perhaps the ones who found it frightening have more imagination (I do not really mean that!)."
"fwomp","6","4","7","18 July 2008"," Not Really A Horror Film, Per Se
","THE ORPHANAGE is a tough film to review, as it had some really good points but some really low ones, too.<br/><br/>The highest point comes from Guillermo del Toro's association with it. For those unaware, del Toro was the genius behind such films as HELLBOY, the new HELLBOY II and the exquisite PAN'S LABYRINTH. Visually wondrous and stark, del Toro has a discerning eye for what does and does not work, and one can easily see his input (as a producer this time) within The Orphange. Although he had a hands-off approach for this film, you can see it is distinctly del Toro in nature, with heavy shadows, complex film shots, and a movie that lets the images speak rather than a visceral score (which was minimal).<br/><br/>Spanish stage-star-turned-film-actress Belén Rueda pulls in a fantastic performance as a returning woman to the orphanage she once inhabited as a child, but this time as owner of the failing building. Her pouty eyes, ruffled hair, and slumped shoulders gave her just the right mixture of attractiveness and cookyness that such a role demanded. When Laura's (Belén Rueda) adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) goes missing from a party at the house/orphanage, Laura obviously does everything to try and locate him. Her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) also tries for many months but soon loses faith in ever finding the boy alive. He's probably right, too, since the boy was sick and needed daily medications. But Laura refuses to give up. She ""feels"" something in the house, just as Simón had before he disappeared. Simón kept referring to invisible friends who wanted him to stay and play with them. Laura and Carlos, of course, just assumed the boy to have an active imagination.<br/><br/>But Laura begins awakening to memories of her time at the orphanage, and with this comes a flood of troubled remembrances. When a group of paranormal researchers are called in to see if they can find out what happened to Simón, Laura's suspicions are aroused further, but cause a rift to grow between she and her husband. Carlos soon leaves but Laura stays, and she starts ""playing the game"" that these memories tell her to (including a game of hide and seek that results in some of the film's scarier moments, ""1 ...2 ...3...Knock on the wall."") Although the performances and filming were done with great care, the script itself was not. Deus ex machina rules the ending (just think of the movie THE OTHERS and you'll be real close). That this film has horror elements is undeniable, but genre-wise it doesn't quite fit. Although I don't think shoe-horning a film into a specific genre is a good thing, it does give the viewer a sense of what to expect and how the story will unfold. Not so here. The ending makes it a bit too sweet. Okay, so that might not be fair if you compare Pan's Labyrinth's ending and this one (true, they are similar). But Pan's Labyrinth had a much more cohesive story that came at you from a child's perspective. With The Orphanage, it is through Laura's eyes that we see this world, and she's a grown up with grown up ideals. Plus the brutality of Pan's Labyrinth was horrifically pulled off by the evil protagonist, while in The Orphange, it really had none other than its own circumstances.<br/><br/>But if you're in the mood for something visually appealing, this one will stimulate that portion of your brain. Just don't expect a smashing success ...or a horror film."
"Robert_Woodward","9","4","7","6 May 2008"," Frighteningly tense and devastatingly sad: this is much more than a horror film
","Director Juan Antonio Bayona's debut feature, the Orphanage, is a classic ghost story, frighteningly tense and hauntingly beautiful. Laura (Belen Rueda), a former inhabitant of the eponymous seaside orphanage, returns as an adult to her childhood home. Accompanied by her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and her young son, Simon (Roger Princep), she intends to re-open the old building as a care home for sick children. Soon, however, it appears that the former residents of the orphanage are haunting the building and the surrounding coastline. Simon claims to have made six new friends: the former residents of the orphanage. Then, suddenly, he vanishes without a trace.<br/><br/>In her desperation, Laura tries to unearth the murky history of the orphanage. She is drawn increasingly into the world of make-believe inhabited by her vanished son. The strands of the natural and the supernatural are expertly woven together in this film. As with Pan's Labyrinth (directed by Guillermo del Toro, the producer of the Orphanage), it is difficult to tell what is real and what exists only in the mind of the protagonist. Here, however, the mystery is greater still, as it is not only the child but also the adult who delves into the supernatural world.<br/><br/>Laura's belief in the supernatural nature of her son's disappearance is offset by the scepticism of her husband. This is most evident when she resorts to the aid of a spirit medium to try and her find her son. In an electrifyingly tense scene, the spirit medium, played by Geraldine Chaplin, attempts to contact the spirits within the orphanage; this is one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Although billed as a horror film, The Orphanage contains only one truly grisly scene; it is the mystery and suspense which make this film such a frightening experience. The refusal to resort to cheap shock tactics and gore allows the human tragedy to come to the fore. Laura and Carlos's suffering is deeply moving and the final scenes are devastatingly sad.<br/><br/>The use of sound in The Orphanage is superb: the cooing of pigeons and the lapping of the sea are in stark contrast to the malevolent creaking of the old house and the disturbing echo of disembodied voices. Much of the soundtrack is suitably brooding, but the occasional surge encroaches on moments of human drama. The cinematography, on the other hand, is consistently excellent, capturing both the beauty of the shoreline setting, with its lighthouse and cliffs, and the imposing presence of the orphanage, looming into the sky.<br/><br/>The Orphanage is in many ways very close to The Others and Pan's Labyrinth, which are both excellent films. Despite the familiar elements, this is a distinctive work, and so far one of the finest films of 2008."

It's slow-paced, but when the climaxes come, they are riveting.<br/><br/>The film is about parent/child relationships and how far a parent would go to save their child. It's about the spirit world and its relationship with the living world. It's about overcoming your fears and facing your past.<br/><br/>It's haunting. It's the type of film that will stay with you long after you've left the cinema. It's a great example of how much fear you can create without having to show too much."

","Part of what some are describing as a new wave of Spanish Horror (as influenced by last years superb Pans Labyrinth), The Orphanage sees director Juan Antonio Bayona take over duties from Guillermo del Toro, who is wearing the producers hat this time round. The result sees one of the most beautifully filmed and yet utterly terrifying films to grace the cinema screens in recent years.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a woman called Laura, who has bought the orphanage she grew up in, intending to reopen it as a special school. She has moved in with her husband and son, who soon begins to open some of the mysteries of the past...<br/><br/>To go in to any further detail would do this film a disservice. This film has been lovingly shot and edited in the style of old ghost stories. What scares there are - and believe me there are some - are shown with subtlety and atmosphere, which makes it all the more terrifying when they happens. The atmosphere is tense and creepy throughout - a far cry from other recent horror films, and all the better for it.<br/><br/>The film echoes Pans Labyrinth in terms of style and (in a loose sense) plot. Del Toro may have been producer, but you can see his handywork on screen. However, this is not a bad thing, and Bayona should have a good career ahead of him. A strong (and gut-wrenching) ending ties the film up nicely, and the film will remain with you for a good long while after you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Guillermo Del Toro has uncovered a real talent in director Juan Antonio Bayona. El Orfanto is easily the best film I've seen this year. It's so good that it is up there with Del Toro's best - The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. Belén Rueda puts in an excellent central performance as Laura, who moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl, along with her husband and adopted son, Simon. The acting and cinematography are excellent and the sound effects are outstanding, really bringing the old house to life. It's not often that a film can make me jump nowadays but one scene in particular nearly had me on the ceiling (you'll know the one I mean). Scary, sad and at the same time quite uplifting, I loved this film and would wholeheartedly recommend it. 10/10."

"Polaris_DiB","7","4","7","23 January 2008"," Are we returning to good old fashioned horror stories finally?
","This movie has already been compared to way too many classic and well-known contemporary horror films. That's because it's a classic story. A woman moves into the haunted house of her memories, discovers ghosts and a mystery, starts working it all out while a cynical husband states that it can't be real, and eventually resolves the pained past of what causes the haunting in the first place, thus leading to transcendence. There are creepy children, bumps in the night, and an old woman with shady motivations. It literally couldn't go wrong.<br/><br/>And it doesn't. J.A. Bayona gets the help of famed Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro to float, move, and explore his way through dusty rooms, hidden basements, and creepy hallways. Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes. Creepy ghost children play hide-and-seek and treasure-hunt games, ultimately leading to a compelling twist. This movie is carefully designed and even holds a few surprises.<br/><br/>Whereas it may not be the most original movie out there, it certainly has its place for an audience craving a good old fashioned horror movie themed around something other than idiots trapped in a room full of intricate torture devices. It's a very nice return to form, and it's probably something you should see before the grubby Hollywood execs put their dirty paws on it and turn it into a CUTITSACAT! glurge-o-mania.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","El Orfanato was presented as something different in the horror genre: enough with the sudden sounds and scary monsters that you can see coming miles ahead. This was going to be a horror movie that was surprising in style and thrilling down to the end.<br/><br/>Within about ten minutes the movie proved to be everything promotion had promised it not to be. Completely predictable, the classical horror concept that had stopped being inventive many years ago, this time, in some Spanish orphanage. I cannot spoil the end because I have no clue how it ends. El Orfanato was the second movie in my life that I could not watch down to the end. I always give movies a fair chance but this one (and Return Of The Killer Tomatoes, which was the first movie I didn't finish) was an utter waste of time. Me and my friends left the cinema, and soon after just about all of the other guests left too. Do not go and see this film, it is a waste of time."

","I've enjoyed original horror and suspense thrillers over the decades but this, disappointingly, isn't one of them. Acting and quality is what you'd expect with this producer but it doesn't go much further than that. The story and scenes were too familiar which wouldn't have been so bad if there had at least been something unique in the plot other than... kid sees invisible friends / mom believes / no one else does / scary dead kid with mask / they bring in the psychic / you get the idea. There's a couple of semi-shocking scenes but obsolutely nothing chilling about the plot unless you've been living under a rock for the past 30 years and the last horror movie you've seen is the exorcist (in which case you'd still never compare this movie to that one). See Pan's Labyrinth if you want to be freaked out by this guy. I loved Pan's Labyrinth but this movie did not do for the horror genre what his earlier movie did for fantasy, not by a long run."
"annabates","6","5","10","24 February 2008"," not ""just another ghost story""
","To a seasoned American horror fan like myself, the film lacks originality. At first I thought it was a Spanish remake of House on Haunted Hill (1959). The theme of a psychologically unbalanced woman tormented by the ghosts of abused, institutionalized children is hardly new. That said, the film is well worth seeing. It's setting in on the Spanish coast, and its distinctive European rhythm and flavor make the scary parts -- and there are some good ones -- quite delectable. Belen Rueda's acting alone is worth the price of a theater ticket. This is not a film for viewers who do not like or understand how to appreciate horror. Far more than ""just another ghost story,"" this film will leave you jolting at bumps in the night. The tag line for William Castle's 1959 classic applies here ... ""see it with someone with warm hands."""

","THE ORPHANAGE, produced by Guillermo del Toro, is a clever, creepy and surprisingly poignant psychological horror film about parents' relationships to their children and the loss of a child. The story is about Laura, who grew up in an orphanage, but now has decided to return with her husband and adopted child, Simon, to run it as a home for disabled children. However, things begin to get a little weird when Simon starts to tell her about his imaginary friends who live inside the house. Then Simon goes missing, and Laura and her husband, Carlos, do everything in their power to find him.<br/><br/>Aside from the genuinely unnerving atmosphere created in the film, the performances from the cast were all outstanding. Even the child actor who played Simon did a great job at showing a range of emotions. Still, the film belongs to Laura and her heartbreaking performance is the film's emotional core. There were a number of scenes that reveal information in a subtle way that is never manipulative and only adds to depth of the film. Only in the last act does it really succumb to the usual jump scares and a score that leads you by the hand towards the conclusion it wants you to reach. Even still, the setup was strong enough that this didn't really bother me that much.<br/><br/>Also, even though the horror was mostly of a psychological nature, there were some other elements there that worked and one that I felt was unneeded. There was precious little gore, but what grisly images they did show served the story and were potent enough that they didn't need to linger on them for too long. There's also some haunted house tropes peppered throughout, which is understandable considering the setting. Still, it didn't exclusively rely on these which was admirable. The one thing I thought was unnecessary was a middle sequence in which Laura and Carlos seek out a medium to figure out what might have happened in the house a long time ago. Up until this point, everything was treated in a mostly realistic way, but this paranormal detour just didn't fit to me. It was well-done, but ultimately unneeded, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall, THE ORPHANAGE was an excellently done horror film with some good scares and a tragic undercurrent that might make you well up with tears. It certainly had that effect on me. The performances were excellent and the atmosphere is palpable throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys psychological horror films, although you might want to be careful if you're a parent with children."

Extra credits go to Belén Rueda who carries the movie with her fantastic acting and Fernando Velázquez for his excellent music that is by turns chilling and heart-felt. Don't expect shocks and gore.

"Hey_Sweden","8","3","5","13 October 2013"," One of those horror films that genuinely moves you.
","As scripted by Sergio G. Sanchez and directed by J.A. Bayona, ""El Orfanato"" a.k.a. ""The Orphanage"" is a haunting, beautiful, and poetic horror tale. It derives its impact from being so utterly rich in emotion and for drenching it in genuine atmosphere rather going for the purely visceral impact - or relying too heavily on the jump scare. The performances, the writing, and the directing are very sensitive and you can completely get on the side of the lead character. And you're discovering things with her rather than being one step ahead the entire time. This is one film that could very well be described as a journey. And when it's all over, it will definitely stay with you.<br/><br/>Gorgeous Belen Rueda stars as Laura, a young woman who lives with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in what used to be the orphanage where she dwelled as a child. They seem to have a happy life with adopted son Simon (adorable Roger Princep), but haven't actually told the truth to the kid, either that he's sick (he's HIV positive) or that they're his adoptive parents and not his biological ones. She's concerned because of his association with imaginary friends, but things take an even darker one when the boy disappears from a costume party. It's up to Laura to find Simon and to probe the mysteries of this orphanage.<br/><br/>Enhanced by a lovely score by Fernando Velazquez, ""El Orfanato"" is deliberately paced but rewarding for patient viewers. It entirely hinges on the acting and the mood and in fact doesn't feature that much in the way of visual effects. There is a real sense of sadness throughout, and despair, and one can completely sympathize with Laura and Simon. The film is reasonably spooky, especially when paranormal experts and a medium (played by guest star Geraldine Chaplin) try to get in contact with the restless spirits of the piece; instead of making us see with our eyes what she is describing, it forces us to use our imagination. The final act is all about Laura as she isolates herself and attempts to recreate the past in order to unlock its secrets.<br/><br/>Ultimately a satisfying experience, ""El Orfanato"" would come highly recommended to those genre fans wishing for films more in the mold of ""The Haunting"" (1963) and ""The Others"".<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Right out at the start: this is still one of my absolute favourites from the recent years. Everything about it is just right, story, script, editing, photography, acting. Concerning the latter, about half the movie is Belen Rueda, almost tangible up there on the screen. Without her, one reckons, the movie would still be superb, but having watched it it's very hard to imagine it with another lead actress. It's her face, her voice, her character that stays before all. Don't just expect another ghost story. You'll walk into an engaging drama, and also the exhibit of how to make every single take count. Every film is a manipulation of emotions, this one knows how to play the chords, and the result is a symphony of beauty, shivers, tragedy and suggestion that might get you to multiple viewings; for me it was the 5th time last night. And once again it was a Spanish production that mounted a master piece. I marked this review as spoiler-containing, and here's the spoiler: after watching it, and in case you didn't get it fully, ask yourself who in fact locked Laura in the bathroom..."

","When I was a young boy, I recall sneaking downstairs and turning the TV on late at night, and watching shows that absolutely terrified me. 'The Orphanage' made me feel like that terrified little kid again. I watched it in 2007, and it scared me more than any other movie I've seen since. <br/><br/>One of the more intelligent horror films I've seen - its story driven, requires that non-Spanish speakers read subtitles, and wasn't created around CGI effects. This is all contrary to what people have come to expect from horror movies these days. The genre has sadly been supported by little more than ultra-gore, weak remakes of 70's and 80's films, tired CGI tricks, and the super fast clip editing that's been used to portray nearly every single film ghost in the last 15 years. <br/><br/>This is true psychological horror, intertwined with mystery, drama, suspense, and old school scary-as-hell ghost story."

This movie, in my opinion, also can carry that same praise. This was the very first time I have ever seen a film cross genuinely frightening scenes at one point with sheer tear jerking, beautiful scenes at another, and not falling short on either end. If you have not yet seen it then I definitely recommend it. The words I just wrote will make more sense after you've watched it.

","This movie was absolutely fantastic. The acting was top notch, the set ups for the scary parts was almost torture in how slow and meticulous it set everything up. It even had a couple jump scares that actually worked as well. The ending was also heart wrenching and overall satisfying. The problems I hear people having are that it's to slow and that it turns into a drama at the end rather then a horror movie. To me these complaints are just from people who probably like the slasher kill them all movies as opposed to horror movies that take their time and let you try to figure out what's happening and why. The ending again is very emotional and is very dramatic. If you like the slower paced movies then this is definitely worth checking out if you haven't you will not be disappointed."

","The movie will scare you but will leave your heart deeply touched. We generally do not expect such an end to a horror movie. For most part I was not sure what genre the movie belonged to and that helped. I just read the short description of the plot and downloaded it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a horror movie in particular, then the movie may disappoint you. If, however, you are a lover of a decent variety of cinema then this amalgamation of horror with drama is beautiful indeed. The character of the mother was realistically written, was a strong character and justice has been done to it by the acting of Belén Rueda. Others did not really have a significant role. Her acting made me empathize and relate to her deeply, something that I seek from characters of movies often. The mix of three things - the desire for the child to be found + curiosity of a horror film + the appeal of realistic cinema made it a fresh and interesting piece. I do not want to bring in any spoilers so I won't go deeper into it. There is something new that I have not seen earlier.<br/><br/>The cruelty committed on children was not explained in the movie - who was responsible for it and how? That was a disappointment. The exorcist angle was fresh. I do not agree to some of the reviews that say that it is a sad movie. It was an intense movie with a very strong character at the center in a very realistic setup. The conversations between the mother and her child were touching. Mother's conviction to find her son was moving too. The movie was rich with emotion.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","3","5","28 December 2009"," Born of inspiration
","South American literature has a tradition for 'magical realism'... in which supernatural occurrences mesh with day-to-day life in a way we aren't otherwise used to. This is one of the examples of such. You can either believe that everything you see actually happens, or that the most fantastic are products of the imagination; like in works of Edgar Allen Poe. At its core, this is something as relatable as a mother losing her son. It is also one of the best ghost stories I've ever seen. The plot is excellent and compelling from start to finish. Every acting performance is spot-on... the main kid is incredible, completely convincing. All of the characters are well-developed and credible, and Laura is a strong female lead, which is always nice to see in something like this. This is psychological horror, based upon build-up of atmosphere and creepiness. While there are jump-scares, every single one is a ""proper"" one, no cats jumping out of closets, etc. There are unforgettable sequences in this, and the mystery is genuinely intriguing. The editing and cinematography are amazing. A lot of what makes this terrifying is also the astonishing sound design. The lighting is subtle. There is gore and blood(but not excessive, and they are used effectively), as well as an abundance of disturbing content in this. The DVD holds several featurettes, a couple of deleted scenes(including alternate ending and opening) with director's commentary, an audition tape of Príncep(the boy), animatics, storyboards, a trailer and a teaser. I recommend this to every fan of unsettling films. 8/10"
"rowiko","5","3","5","10 February 2009"," Had expected more
","What drew me to this movie was the comparison that was made in a newspaper article to ""The Others"" starring Nicole Kidman. Having seen that film and absolutely loved it, and being forewarned in the write-up that the viewer could expect even more from ""The Orphanage"", my expectations were accordingly high. Too high, perhaps. Granted, it does seem to have all the ingredients of a superb horror-mystery: There is the old house in the remote countryside, with its dark past, there are the strange going-ons that keep the viewer guessing whether there are beings from another dimension at work, or whether it is all in the characters' imagination. There are in fact many parallels to ""The Others"". All in all, however, there was hardly a moment where I felt chained to my seat, scared even to look over my shoulder, like I did when watching ""The Others"". I admit, there were a few scenes that sent a short jolt through my body, but that was about it. I was missing the ongoing tension, the suspense of not knowing what awaited me around the next corner. It all felt a bit predictable to me, a bit flat. All a bit ""been there, done that"". To sum it up, in my view it does not live up to the expectations raised by the comparison made to ""The Others"", and it seems to prove how difficult it is to make a horror film that doesn't need special effects and blood, but offers nail-biting suspense from beginning to end. Few movies I have seen over the years were able to provide that, and this is, unfortunately, not one of them."

","I saw an ad for this movie and decided to check it out while it was still in theaters awhile ago. Since then I've seen it on DVD two more times. So let's talk about what makes this movie so good, shall we? First of all, it is a legitimately scary movie filled with suspense. This movie graciously delivers us from the dark pit that we were cast into by ""horror movies"" like Saw, Turistas, Hostel, Wolf Creek, and others that are all essentially the same, and rely solely on gore and gross-out techniques rather than creating creepy atmospheres, having compelling stories, or any other things that typically would make a movie interesting. It is a refreshing change to see a horror movie put out that isn't a glorified snuff film.<br/><br/>Indeed, this movie is more reminiscent of films like The Shining, films with brilliant cinematography and acting that play on our fears, rather than our revulsions, to incite terror in the viewer.<br/><br/>Of course there will be the people who refuse to see this movie because all of the dialog is in Spanish. Their loss, I guess.<br/><br/>Another brilliant thing about this movie is that at the end, the viewer has no questions left unanswered. Everything is explained, yet the movie is still open to the viewer's own interpretations.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that people looking for a good scary movie, but aren't into ""torture porn"" flicks, check out The Orphanage/El Orfanato.<br/><br/>9/10"

However over the years I've developed a love for horror films and because of this love I feel that horror films no longer make me jump out of my seat like they use to. <br/><br/>However when I first watched the trailer to the orphanage I knew that this film was going to be different from all the other ghostly horror films. The child alone with the sake over his face sent chills down my spine, so naturally I had to see this film of course I couldn't go see this film alone so I dragged my girl friend along to witness this new ghost thriller. <br/><br/>the last time I jumped in the cinema because of a film was the time I went to go see White Noise . the orphanage however managed to do this but also caused me to spill my own popcorn as well which in itself shows how well this film can scare. <br/><br/>The orphanage is set in a Spanish country next to a beautiful beach where a large house lays looking over the beach, this grand house use to be an orphanage. And now a women, who once lived there, and her husband have come to buy it and re-open it for another orphanage for young disabled children. However things aren't quite what they seem and the plot thickens as her young child Thomas, disappears. <br/><br/>the great thing about this film is the timing much like the timing on alien, we are giving the time to get to know and be brought closer to the characters so when things do start to go wrong we almost feel for them. nothing terrifying happens to about roughly 20 minutes into the film, which is great because you are constantly wondering when something is about to happen and the film lets no indication to when it does. <br/><br/>Overall this is a great spooky film that'll keep you on the edge of your seats liturgy and will keep you guessing to which direction the plot will turn next. However if you easily get annoyed by subtitles than sadly you will not be able to enjoy this film for the whole film is set and spoken in Spanish by real Spanish actors. <br/><br/>But if you don't subtitles or your even know Spanish and are looking for a horror film with a great story than this is the film for you."

","The Orphanage does many things which have been around Hollywood for some time. Like Hostel, it slaps a big-shot director's name all over the movie, even though Del Toro did not direct it. In this case, that technique is a ploy to get you to see the film. It's a needed ploy, because the film isn't good enough to carry itself.<br/><br/>I stray away from comprehensive plot reviews, but basically the movie involves a wife and her husband who movie to a building that used to be an orphanage with their son. Without going into too much detail, the son goes missing after an interaction with his imaginary (or are they?) friends. The trailer tries to give a good idea of what the film will be like, but ultimately shows you the ideas for the film you wish would have been made. <br/><br/>There were a few scary parts in the movie, but they were few and far between. I was more bored than in suspense during the movie. While I was watching it, I was just reminded of scenes and ideas from better (read better, not even necessarily good) movies. I'd say watch Hide and Seek, The Shining, or The Omen (original, remake is completely worthless) before going to see this film.<br/><br/>The worst part is that this film toys with you. There are some twists, but not in a ""I can't believe they did that!"" way but in a way that just leaves you feeling cheated. Sometimes films are just for a certain type of person. I just don't know who I'd recommend to go see this."

But just wait a minute here, you mean to tell me they brought the police, searched the surroundings extensively, brought in spiritual mediums, posted signs everywhere, accused old ladies of murder etc, during several months, and they didn't bother to check the basement of their own house to see if he had hidden there? Not even after they heard noises from the room? I'm sorry but that's just stupid, I ain't buying that."

","This is a Spanish horror film that manages to transcend the genre. I generally hate horror films, but this one is much deeper and well made than a typical film. And, on top of that, it's more intelligently made and doesn't insult the audience with cheap thrills or manipulation.<br/><br/>The film begins at an orphanage back in the 1970s. Then, after the credits roll, it's the present day. A couple and their young adopted son have just moved in to the same building that used to be the orphanage. The little boy is an odd kid and talks about having invisible friends. The problem is that after a while, it looks like he might be right.<br/><br/>During a party, the mother sees an odd child wearing a bag over his head--looking a lot like a little scarecrow. This is the same invisible friend her son had talked about and drawn in his pictures. However, when she tries to talk to the bag boy, he attacks her with extraordinary force. She is injured and upon getting up, looks for her son--who has vanished. Months pass and there is still no trace of the kid.<br/><br/>The rest of the story is told through odd clues--coming in bits and pieces. As a result, there are LOTS of creepy little images and scenes--that all eventually fill in the pieces to the puzzle. And, it seems that some of these puzzle pieces are being provided by the missing boy, as it's like a game he and his invisible friends used to play together! I could easily say more about the film's plot, but frankly this would ruin the suspense--and with this sort of film, that would be a big mistake. However, rest assured that the film's ending is both satisfying and touching.<br/><br/>The film was masterfully directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, but you can also see some of the influence of executive-producer Guillermo del Toro, as the story has many similarities to del Toro's earlier film, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE. Both are set at orphanages and both involve unresolved murders and the undying spirits of the victims. In fact, if you've seen one of these films, you should definitely see the other. Both, by the way, are pretty intense and are probably NOT good films for younger audience members.<br/><br/>Also, in a small role in the about the middle of the film is a segment with Geraldine Chaplin (daughter of Charlie). I was surprised at her fluency in Spanish--not realizing she was in real life married to a Spanish man."
"rdrotar","5","4","8","17 July 2008"," I'm not impressed
","First off, i would like to say that this film is made by a very talented director who did a good job with the story and made it very difficult to figure out the final twist early that being said let me tell you abut the movie itself.<br/><br/>This film has been written a hundred times, it is a moderately scary film where real life collides with the supernatural. A film that builds up suspense about 5 times during the film and about every fourth time follows through with the build up. This story is unoriginal, and was not worth being made into a movie. If i wanted to watch a formula supernatural thriller i would just watch the Omen and be done with it. Because at least the Omen (either version) is less predictable and has a more original plot line. lets be honest with ourselves about the plot, an old house where sounds of creaky wooden boards mixed with music that builds up suspense in the audiences stomach, and a female lead that has n chance of defending herself if the spooky ghost does decide to show itself has been done many times. If you enjoyed this movie, i advise you to go rent the Haunting, the House of a Thousand Corpses, and Clue, for comic relief equal to the amount of fear these films will make you feel.<br/><br/>As always if you have something to add i always appreciate discussing my opinion further so please don't hesitate t email me your opinion of the film or of my review."

","I had read many fab reviews of this film and thought I'd give it a whirl – even though I am not a big fan of the horror genre. It really didn't pan out for me. The acting is OK and the cinematography lavish. The story quickly becomes a series of over-used scary cliché's – don't go in the room, why in heaven's name are you opening the door, why are you going outside - alone – at night-time .that type of stuff. There are endless searches and sounds in the overly big horror-house<br/><br/>There are many things that simply don't make much sense. They have a reception for new orphans in the house but there was no follow-up to this. Was it just there to make their adopted son conveniently disappear? Near the end of the film skeletal remains are found, but no police follow-up? It's overly lengthy. I found the ending a let-down with an unbelievably happy resolution."

","""The Orphanage"" had me cowering in my seat for 80% of this movie! It's not a slasher film (there's only one scene that I can remember with any blood). It's horror comes more from what you don't see, or what you only see glimpses of. I found the story to be so heartbreaking at the end, which is rare to feel in a horror movie. This movie is like what horror movies used to be like; you had to work for it rather than having all the corpses pile up on your lap. The tension in this movie is thick. The mood even thicker. The acting was superb. The real jewel of this movie though is the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and consider it to be one of the best I've seen."

","This horror-drama (produced by Guillermo del Toro) was OK, but nothing extraordinary. The direction was measured, without resorting to any excessive stylistic fiddling, apart from some color filtering (mild saturation mainly), and from the grotesque masks (a cliché) at the guest party. The storyline kept you on your seat, even though you probably guess what's going on, and even though it doesn't resist a few cheap horror moments (the car crash, for example). Overall, the implied overtone is of the heroine revisiting the repressed ""ghosts"" of the past and making peace with them, but at a cost, since the ghosts ""engulf"" her (which is why they were repressed in the first place)."

","First of all, I love foreign movies and do not have a problem with following subtitles, I can focus on both the subs and what is happening on screen at the same time, secondly, I love Italian horror movies, Suspiria is in my top five horror movies list, thirdly I do not have a problem with horror movies that have no gore, some of my favourite gore-less horror movies are The Innocents, The Haunting, The Changeling etc etc. Now to The Orphanage, I feel that the rave reviews on this one are due to the film having something to do with the director of Pan's Labyrinth (another seriously overrated movie which looks clever on the surface but when you delve deeper is less than cerebral) I have news for those reviewers, Del Toro did not direct this, he merely gave his name to it so the film would garner more attention. Now to the performances and the plot of the movie itself, the main actress is really irritating as the mother of the missing child, she just comes across as a hysterical neurotic. The son is one dimensional and the fact that he is HIV positive seems to be an effort by the scriptwriters to lend the film a contemporary sympathetic edge, it does not work with me. Why did he have to have Aids? Why not Cancer? I will leave that up to you to decide. Now people are saying this movie is scary, if you find watching Bugs Bunny cartoons scary then yes this movie will be scary to you. The whole film is a mishmash of generic ""scary"" music playing in the background, shots of dark murky corners and damp basements, the hysterical mother walking around with a melancholic expression, echoes of children's voices, dark figures of children flitting past the camera lens and thats it, yes, that's all folks. Zero character development and as for the ending, the word is pathetic, it turns out the son has been alive all this time, after days and days of his mother's searching, what has he been doing? it seems he has been hanging around in a dark dungeon all this time without making any attempt to get out of there and contact his mother, how has he been feeding himself? To top it off, it turns out that the ghosts were friendly after all and happen to be the childhood friends of the son's mother, as they crowd round the tearful mother and her son at the end manipulative ""emotional"" music plays in a pathetic attempt to get to the the heart strings of the probably gullible audience.<br/><br/>These days if I look at a review on IMDb of a newly released film and it has any more than 6 stars I usually know it will turn out to be a 1 star film in reality."

"dbborroughs","8","3","6","18 October 2008"," Scary and creepy story over comes a couple lapses of internal logic to be a winning film
","Guillermo del Torro presents The Orphanage. he had nothing really to do with the film, but its appropriate considering that many have tagged this as a sibling to his Pan's Labyrinth (which I think for plot points rather than it being an updated fairy tale- I don't see Peter Pan as a fairy tale) The story has Laura, her son and husband returning to the orphanage where she grew up in order to turn it into a home for special needs kids. Her son has two invisible friends, a number that increases once they move in. It rapidly unfolds that they are not alone in the house and that strange things are going on.<br/><br/>There is much more to the story, which pretty much everyone has been closed mouth about so I will do the same as well. Actually I won't do it out of deference to the lack of discussion, rather because this is a film that is best discovered on its own. The plot turns, which often resemble other films, do propel the film in its own way.(Its like comparing cars they all have similar things but that doesn't mean they are the same car). At times the film is rather deliberately constructed, hitting certain plot points as if on a check list (at least for Spanish or Euro-horror), however there are other times when the film bends what you think is going to happen into something else (the medium's walk through the house is chilling). Actually the film gets better as it goes on with a moment about half way into the film when you suddenly realize that the film has really cranked you up.<br/><br/>I really liked the film a great deal. Its so nice to have many people tell me I need to see a movie and then have it turn around and have them be right. Friends and reviewers were right to say that this is a solid little horror film. Its nice to have a film hold you and keep you interested from start to finish. Its even nicer to have a horror film crank up the tension is such away that you never saw it coming, and then keep it tight until the very end.<br/><br/>If there are any real problems with the film its that there are a couple of times when the film struggles to have you believe its own internal logic. A couple of things happened that made me wonder why no one noticed them before, or if people (husband) behaved a certain way to keep the plot moving. The film wins out in the end but its the difference between a mostly satisfying film and a completely satisfying film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. about 8 out of 10."
"thebluebasil","9","3","6","6 May 2008"," Hauntingly beautiful in every respect
","Movies like El Orfanato are few and far in between. My tastes in movies are tragically mainstream and yet I found myself entirely immersed in the genius that is Juan Antonio Bayona's pièce de résistance.<br/><br/>Every single element of the movie culminates in an organic whole. Laura (played by the brilliant Belén Rueda) returns to the architecturally stunning mansion that she was once housed in as an orphaned child. As the story progresses she becomes acquainted with the poignant concept of 'historical baggage'.<br/><br/>I personally wouldn't classify this as a horror movie, because unlike typical Hollywood Ra-Ras, this film dares to tell a story. The plot is a sublime masterpiece and everyone was left gasping at the revelation of the plot. Another noteworthy aspect of the film is the prudent use of music to create mood; you become one with the mansion in front of you, and Rueda's phenomenal acting draws you in, whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>Highly, highly recommended. A gripping film for the whole family."

","In my opinion this film has not received the recognition that it should. The feeling I had during this film I can only relate to one other movie, which would be ""The Changeling""; a feeling where you are tense and somewhat frightened throughout the entire movie, yet you are impelled to see how the story unfolds (I enjoyed this more so than The Changeling though). I am a horror film addict and I have instantly put this at the top of my list. In fact if someone asked me I wouldn't even say it is a ""horror"" film but rather a mix of horror, drama, suspense and mystery. I am anxiously waiting to show this film to some friends so I can watch it again just to recap and view it with a different attitude (knowing the secret to the mystery).<br/><br/>I think many horror films today have fallen victim to the Hollywood disease of ""lets put as many jump-out-at-you moments as possible and make the cast full of hot blondes that really can't act but are well endowed"". Not that I mind the latter. Then again this is not an American film which further emphasizes my disappointment in recent American horror films. In any case, I loved this film and encourage anyone that loves a great suspenseful story to watch this. Stop reading reviews to see if you should rent/buy it. Just go and do so."

What are the messages that the lost ones leave to the ones who still breathe? Are we willing to decipher them? Do we have the bravery to play a treasure hunt game that might lead you to an unknown place and time that probably you wouldn't be able to return? Guillermo Del Toro, one of the most successful Mexican directors, wants us to explore those deep stories behind the curtains of time and forgetfulness producing El Orfanato, a story placed in an unknown rocky beach in Spain, where an old house, once an orphanage 30 years ago, becomes the home of Laura (Belén Rueda), a former member of the aforementioned orphanage, along with her, her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son, Simón (Roger Príncep). It's common that sometimes children create imaginary friends... but Simón have met new friends in this house, friends that want to play Treasure Hunt with him, and they say that if you win, you can ask a wish.<br/><br/>Laura, after losing the most treasured thing for her decides to play Treasure Hunt as well, in a trail that makes her confront the hidden secrets and horrors that the orphanage had just after she left. Will she able to solve the mystery that the fogs of oblivion are covering? Can she fight the fear and the sorrow that could take her sanity or even her own life to reach the end of the game? The direction of this film was in charge of Juan Antonio Bayona, a Spanish young director with a masterful vision. Screenplay was in charge of Sergio Sanchez and the astonishing and frightening photography was performed by Oscar Faura.<br/><br/>This is a film that has 26 wins and 26 nominations, masterfully performed, thrilling, like one of those ghost stories you used to hear when you were a kid. Horror film enthusiast (like yours truly) would find it very satisfying.<br/><br/>There's no better environment like the one I'm right now to watch it... and not even better moment to review it.

It's refreshing seeing good foreign films, instead of just the usual crap that Hollywood has been showing down our throats for the last couple of years. Although not ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""El Orfanato"" is a decent thriller. Plus it shares Pan's amazing cinematography and mysterious air.<br/><br/>The film is about a mother (Laura) who moves into an abandoned house, that used to be the orphanage she grew up in, with her son and husband. The son, like most young kids, brings his imaginary friends with him. The son begins to accumulate new ""imaginary"" friends once they settle in and starts playing treasure hunt games. One day her son goes missing and Laura spends the rest of the movie searching for him. Let's just say that this is a good ghost story with a twist.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I walked into this thinking it was a horror movie, but it is more a thriller than anything else. The movie has very few ""jump"" moments, but instead offers a creepiness that pervades the entire film. The only qualms I have with the movie are that the story is a bit slow moving at the beginning and it leans a bit more toward the fantastic than I would have liked.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable movie if you liked ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""The Others"" or other similar suspense thriller movies.

","Within ten minutes THE ORPHANAGE tells us its going to be standard fare with standard devices: Return to a childhood haunt with issues, child to perceive ghosts adults cannot, spooky old person; we've seen it a gazillion times, The ensuing story, plot, etc., is done well enough, with appropriate scares, shots, etc., and is at times entertaining (the seance scenes, however, too loaded with dialog manure). On the other hand there's nothing particularly new or note worthy. THE ORPHANAGE might otherwise get a passing grade except...........<br/><br/>The Spanish woman cast in the lead role was an awful choice. Her character admits to being 37, her IMDb bio has her at 42 but she doesn't look a day less than 50, which still might be okay except.........her maternal skills are cold fish. In the scenes with her ""son"" I see a woman who doesn't like and/or is unfamiliar with kids. Robin Williams would have been better placed in the role.<br/><br/>The creepy old lady's role is ill defined and makes little sense. In the past the heroine and hag are at most 20 years apart but later it looks like this age difference has doubled. Apparently decades ago the hag was able to poison five kids and stuff their bodies away without anyone missing them at the time. Hag inexplicitly then develops a need to recover the bodies for some reason (Hag must have seen THE ORPHANAGE before it was made and learned heroine would develop the psychic skills to find the remains).<br/><br/>PAN'S WHATCHAMACALLIT was good work. THE ORPHANAGE is not."
"ElijahCSkuggs","8","4","10","11 January 2008"," Very good film with a pair of distractions.
","When I first saw that Del Toro's name was attached to the movie I got a little nervous. I'm a very big fan of Mr. Del Toro's work...all of his work. So when hearing this, I got nervous, thinking that he may turn into the next Eli Roth or Tarantino. But thankfully, The Orphanage is a movie any director should be proud to relate himself to.<br/><br/>The Orphange is about a mother trying to figure out how and why her little boy has disappeared. Strange events are taking place, but instead of taking off and leaving the spooky house, Mama Laura bucks up and stays strong on course to figure out what happened to her child.<br/><br/>The Orphanage is a incredibly well shot and directed film. There are many, many creative uses of cinematography. And with a smart mix of cinematography and direction, the movie truly shines when the eerie and powerful music takes hold. The acting itself is pretty good, not anything truly award-winning, but mostly very believable. One scene in particular, the scene with Laura running on the beach panicking, that was not impressive on any account. It was shaky camera, and just a weird jumbled ""mess"". They may have been going for a true panicky situation, but it really just felt silly and over-played. Besides the fantastic production values and respectable acting, the movie moved at a quick pace and had some truly creepy and tense filled moments. One thing I applaud the movie is the way they use the tension and scares. They take the scenes of tension and build them up to pretty great levels, but there really isn't a ""payoff"". It's mostly just a lot of big build ups. This is not a bad thing. Today's horror films all use very cheap means to scare the audience. I, for one, am completely sick of films that use scenes of cheap tricks to jolt the audience. Incredibly fast shots mixed with very loud sounds is all that is I see these days. For example, in the previews for this movie, they showed Jessica Alba's new movie. It's the American remake of The Eye. The final scene of the trailer is exactly what I'm talking about. A film with genuine tension and build up is rare these days, and this a film with it. One other film that uses this technique well is the somewhat underrated The Abandoned. Films like The Changeling, Suspiria and An American Werewolf in London, they all happen to use build-up and true horror tension rather than cheap technical bullsh!t.<br/><br/>ONE other thing! Or should I say TWO. The mother, her breasts. To this day, I haven't stared at a pair of tits more in my entire life. For a homely, motherly wife, she had the fakest pair of tits around. The woman was gorgeous already, and when she's bouncing around in those tight shirts, it seriously became a distraction for me. Gorgeous, gorgeous woman, with a fantastic pair of fake breasts. Not really a problem for me overall, but hell, they WERE distracting for a large part of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, there are plenty of things to complain about with this movie. But in the big scheme of things horror related, this is a breath of fresh air. It's beautiful, chilling and entertaining. If you enjoy horror/mysteries ala Devil's Backbone, this will be right up your alley."

Its a pity that films like Captivity or Disturbia will be see more than this film. If you like to watch one of the best films of this year, you should go to cinema to see this. Very beautiful picture! Good work. And I recommend other films like All About My Mother, Mar Adentro, Abre ls Ojos, REC, Salvador etc. This film should be in 250 best films of history in this web. See you!!"

","One of the best horror movies, I've ever seen...just loved the performance of the kids and the bone chilling climax..which led me both into shock and tears..truly a horror masterpiece.The role of simon was especially wonderful..how cute that kid is! just loved the performance of Laura .the orphanage building and its location has a strange charm and spooky feel to it...This movie truly deserves to be made in English and other languages for an international audience.Also appreciable is the fast stroy line which keeps you on your toes and whodunit approach works really well. This movie truly deserves an academy award. Would like to congratulate the director and the cast for this outstanding feat."

","Okay, so maybe not, but I have to say, there's something terribly wrong when you rent what should be a spooky horror movie and find yourself bawling hysterically, not with fear but with genuine sympathy and despair. I'd seen Pan's Labyrinth and found it to be beautiful and scary enough that I was trying to wake up my sleeping husband so I didn't feel so alone in my bedroom. So, when I saw there was another movie out by the same guy, I had to see it plus, I'm a sucker for a good horror movie. It blew me away. With a genuine creepy atmosphere, this movie had me sitting on the edge of my bed but that wasn't what won me over. The actors were well cast, each one portraying their character so that you ached and shivered with them. The storyline was perhaps a bit unoriginal but let's face it, in this day and age, what storyline is original, and the actual script was well done. I found myself cursing at Laura when she didn't figure out what the hell was going on from the beginning, if she'd been paying attention, it would have been painfully obvious but being a mother myself, I don't know if I'd have my wits around me enough to pick up on the clues. Then ending had me sobbing, seriously, and swearing that I was not going to watch another movie that gave me chills but left me in tears. Evil movies. This is a fantastic movie and if I had the patience to read subtitles every time I watched it, I would own it."

In fact I don't even know how to categorize it because nothing stuck out. There are a few build ups to get you saying ""ok this is going to get creepy"" then you realize you were wrong. I do not know what else to say about this movie other than it wasn't what I was expecting. So many people have said its really scary, more like almost scary. This is a good movie if you know what to expect or if you dislike horror movies. I would say this is up there with something like ""What Lies Beneath"" (only I liked that movie better)."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","3","7","14 April 2008"," For a debut film, this is stunning
","Juan Antonio Bayona's 'The Orphanage' is an amazing and creepy debut film that is wonderfully told and very, very tragic. Written by first-timer Sergio G. Sánchez, 'The Orphanage' tells the tale of Laura (Belén Rueda} who brings her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) to her childhood home; an orphanage. She plans to reopen it as a home for children with disabilities. However, when her son befriends an invisible child, things soon begin to spiral out of control.<br/><br/>What truly makes this film unique is its blend of slow, brooding frights and a touching and beautiful story of a mother's devotion and love for her son. It has been awhile since a movie has scared me as much as this one. This is aided by a chilling score which is a great mood-setter. Furthermore, the film looks magnificent, with some lovely scenery and sweeping shots of the orphanage keeping the feel of the movie just right.<br/><br/>Belén Rueda gives a strong performance as the lead, given that most of the movie revolves around her. All the other actors are great, though. Guillermo Del Toro has rightly supported this fascinating, dark, tragic and brooding tale of loss and discovered a new Spanish director to look out for; Juan Antonio Bayona. Much like Del Toro's 'The Devil's Backbone' and 'Pan's Labyrinth,' 'The Orphanage' is a much more sinister type of fairytale horror based around children.<br/><br/>For those who like their horror scary, tense and masterfully made, then this film is for you. 5/5"
"rusty442","10","3","7","8 April 2008"," The bone-chilling, emotionally exhausting horror film has long disappeared...until now.
","I must admit, I had been waiting to see this film for a long time. Usually this 'over-enthused' approach leaves me unfulfilled and disappointed. This however was not the case after I left the cinema following 'The Orphange'. It was haunting, unnerving and essentially outstanding. <br/><br/>On the same tone I do not want to 'over-sell' it so that your expectations are huge... well actually I do not believe this to be possible because the film is brilliant, intimidating, beautiful and a new 'lease of life' for the dying breed of really simple and 'spine-chilling' horror flick that has, for many years been ridiculed drivel (and remakes- snore!) that are regurgitated time and time again.<br/><br/>I do not want to give anything away. All I want to say is that this film was terrifying and unnerving. At times my heart was racing as I squirmed in my seat. But the truly outstanding thing about this film was that it was inherently a love story- portraying pain, passion and determination to overcome the obstacles no matter what. Your emotions will twist and turn during this expertly delivered film. <br/><br/>I left absolutely shaken, having been on a 'rollercoaster ride' which left me chilled to the core. I wanted to talk about it, but couldn't, reliving this draining and chilling experience walking home through (and I'm not kidding!!!) a cemetery would have been unwise to say the least. This is a distinction, though (through reasons i do not wish to spoil) I left surprisingly at ease and content.<br/><br/>All I can say is if you LOVE horror films of a classic, Gothic nature- go and see this film. If you can endure a lot of nerve-rattling- go and see this film. Or if you have any appreciation for the true art of just really fantastic filming and directing- GO AND SEE THIS FILM."

","The Orphanage tells the story of Laura, who as a young girl lived there until she was adopted. Years later, she returns with her husband and adopted son to re-open the orphanage, but this time as a place for disabled children. However when her son Simon disappears, Laura begins to uncover the tragic and horrifying events of the past...<br/><br/>Written by Sergio G. Sanchez and directed by Juan Antonio Bayona, The Orphanage is a brilliant and more importantly scary movie. The reason for this is that the script and direction take their time in slowly building the atmosphere and revealing it's story, so when the end comes it's almost a relief. Along the way there are some impressive scenes, my own favorite being the sequence with a medium in the house. As befits a good ghost story, it has the right and proper ending too, instead of some kind of cop-out. Again it deserves credit for that.<br/><br/>The cast led by Belen Rueda as Laura are all very good. The music by Fernando Velazquez adds to the atmosphere of the movie, without resorting to typical loud music to remind you that you should be scared now. <br/><br/>In a time when horror movies have forgotten how to be atmospheric and scary, The Orphanage shows you it can be done right. Hollywood should take notes. But I fear they'll only try and remake it instead.<br/><br/>See it before they do that. It's worth it."

","Now this is downright rude: Orfanato, El 2007 (The Orphanage) is an outstanding film. Yet, I hesitate to recommend it and that galls me. Hollywood offers what I consider to be uber-violent trash. Anyway you Saw it, even on Friday the 13th, a Hostel is just another Chainsaw Massacre in Texas. Some imported flicks are equally violent and sadly waste good story and/or characters for heaps of blood, guts, gore, etc. <br/><br/>""The Orphanage"" is mild by comparison but it presents troubling themes  harm to children and suicide. <br/><br/>Director Juan Antonio Bayona subtly leads, letting viewers observe an old orphanage and some of its inhabitants. Ah: the house, the outdoors and sky are wonderfully black, gray and white. A small item of plot arrives courtesy of an observer. The film moves to modern day where the deliciously Gothic building now belongs to a former occupant, her husband and their adopted little boy. A beautiful abandoned lighthouse peers over its realm from atop a nearby suitably rocky cliff. The surf of this coastal setting crashes menacingly, lapping at the entrance to a cave to be explored. A party honors special needs children similar to those to be given haven in this restored house but the festivities are interrupted by the beginning of a delicious ghost story. From there to the imminently satisfying last scene, the tension mounts, the protagonist suffers a loss and the filmic journey suffers not one misstep. Director Bayona, the photographers and production designers combine classic horror items and throw in a few quirks. Some incidental items are strongly colored amidst all the gray. Ominous skies and sound design immerse in atmosphere. Actress Belin Rueda is Laura, a woman wanting to honor her childhood by helping other children. She is a quiet presence able to convey much with just a gesture, a flash of eye or a mouth movement. The rest of the cast ably supports Sra Rueda. How wonderful it is that the screenplay from Sergio Sanchez receives such professional treatment. Somehow no Hollywood committee, marketer or focus group befoul the flick. We owe Producer and Presenter Guillermo del Toro a debt of gratitude for bringing this Spanish wonder to the states. ""The Orphanage"" is a sad story of loss and betrayal deliciously presented and offered to anyone willing to brave the premise. This is a first class cinematic horror story."

","I watch a lot of horror films, ""The Shining"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" being on the top tier of my list. After hearing very good reviews about this, I was surprised that I did not get scared throughout the entire movie. The film was all over the place, with every trick in the book, certainly not a classic. It was very obvious that the director was not very organized, the script was sloppy, and the actors, even the lead actress was not very believable. The story seemed very long and some deus ex machina, like the granny getting run over by the bus?? Gore effects in there for just gore, but not that realistic. The ending was not very satisfying and very cheesy for an adult audience. Maybe if you were a little girl, this might scare you."

"DanDyXD","5","2","4","13 October 2013"," A disturbing twist with a sorrowful performance from Belén Rueda can't make up for the mediocre story and lack of scares
","I was somewhat looking forward to this film as it had great reviews from critics and audience members alike even though the trailers weren't anything special I went in watching this movie with an open mind.<br/><br/>The plot is a grown up orphan Laura buys her old orphanage with her husband and adopted son so she can foster orphaned disabled children but her son who after making an new imaginary friend and leading him back to the orphanage goes missing.<br/><br/>What really got me interested in the film is its apparent lack of cheep scares like jump scares (I'm guessing)... This is not true their are plenty of jump scares but most of them are done badly for example (this is hardly a spoiler as it happens in the first 10 minutes) Our main character Laura goes into the shed because she can her something and in the shot he see someone clearly in the background, that person then drops something and creep revealing plays as if to try and scare you and make you jump because the sound effect for the item dropping is stupidly loud and that's pretty much it but i don't understand how this is meant to be scary we know theirs someone behind her, we know she's not alone so why act like its a huge surprise when she knocks something over.<br/><br/>And that's the biggest problem with the film it's not scary unless you find loud noises, unrealistic gore and a child with a sack over his head (who is in every trailer and every poster for the film) scary then by all means snatch this one up on Blu-ray and turn up the surround sound so you eardrums explode every time a door, window or wall slams and enjoy.<br/><br/>I don't mind jump scares sometimes like they can be really inventive like the lawn mower scene from Sinister and anybody who has seen that film they know what I'm talking about but here it's just so badly done or pointless.<br/><br/>The film at first is a bit slow at building suspense but as it progresses it keeps you involved wanting to know what happens even if you are waiting a long time for something to happen and their are a few inventive scenes while not really scary are clever and have build up to them but the bad thing is it usually builds up to something not scary or hardly anything at all.<br/><br/>After an hour and 26 minutes I was just kind of hoping for it to end as nothing was really scaring me or surprising me and I thought was a bit silly then this amazing twist that I didn't expect just comes out of no where and I was still pretty annoyed that it took this long for the film to make me scared, disturbed, sad more for that matter any emotion then anger and disappointment it totally took me by surprise and made me fully invested in those 5 minuets but then is ruined by trying to make a happy ending out of it when I could not see that working because we know nothing of the orphans other then they did something really unlikeable and the adopted son is just annoying and unlikeable as he does things or finds out things about himself that he knows are clearly a big deal and covers them up as a game only for his mother to find out then blame her for not telling him these things which I know hardly makes sense because I'm trying not to put any spoilers in this review but just think about it.<br/><br/>The only good things I can say is the cinematography is good at establishing mood and unsettlement while looking beautiful and the acting and direction of the actors is good the best performance being of the Belén Rueda who gives it her all and is so emotional distraught by her sons disappearance and its only really because of her strong performance that the movie doesn't stop head in its tracks.<br/><br/>The films musical score is also good and can be creepy at times but because nothing really scary is going on in the film it's pretty much wasted and feels out of place.<br/><br/>This really is the most disappointing horror I've seen this year nothing at all scared me, the movie for the most part does rely on jump scares until the end, and the story has confusing characters that are hard to feel for and I'm sure their are plenty of horror film with out jump scares that are terrifying the only one I can think of at the top of my head being The Shining which created a surreal, scary world that squeezed the audience the refused to let go until the final credit. This film didn't and is hardly a horror and if you expecting to be scared out of you mind or at least creeped out a bit don't watch this, if you want to see a supernatural family drama with a good twist I guess in those standards it might be worth a watch."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","4","28 May 2011"," The Haunted Orphanage
","Right from the lighting, cinematography, art direction, script, sound effect to the acting and direction, everything comes in harmony in Juan Antonio Bayona's 'El Orfanato'. As chilling and suspenseful as it is, the story itself is haunting and intricately layered. From the very beginning, Bayona grabs your attention and holds it until the closing credits have rolled. He sets a dark tone creating a cool atmosphere. The slightly washed out colours, use of light and sound and music contribute excellently.<br/><br/>The director does use some of the usual elements of horror films like strange sounds happening and jump moments but 'El Orfanato' is much more than that. The orphanage (that plays the title role) is a character of its own. Even though Laura and Carlos have renovated its interiors the viewer can sense a dark presence even before the 'strange things' start to happen. The mix of paranormal psychology, history and horror is skillfully done.<br/><br/>Montserrat Carulla and Geraldine Chaplin provide good support. Fernando Cayo does a fine job as the concerned husband who loves his wife without a doubt. Belén Rueda delivers a transcendent performance as she easily carries the film. She's been an underrated actress for a long time and its finally good to see her get her due.<br/><br/>There are a few minor quibbles in the writing. Laura is shown as a good loving mother and I found it odd that she'd let her son wander off inside a dark cave while she looks at sea-shells. Then there's another sequence where she is running outside in the rain with her HIV positive son. Knowing that the son is extremely vulnerable to any illness, I found it strange that she would take the risk. Perhaps the director wanted to depict that she was caught in the enthusiasm of the game.<br/><br/>However, these are only minor and they hardly ruin this chilling gem. 'El Orfanato' is a must watch for people who love to watch dark layered movies."

Add some disturbed and some disturbing kids, a mother that comes into contact with supernatural forces and her rationale husband that doubths her. It feels like I've seen all that a HUNDRED times over.<br/><br/>I still like its slow tempo and its atmosphere, this is a film that really saviors its scary parts for the right moments, and i do like its conclusion, before then though, its derative nature had worn me out."

","Plot:<br/><br/>Laura (Rueda) returns to the orphanage that was once her home with the intention of reopening it, taking with her, her adopted son Símon (Príncep) and husband Carlos (Cayo). Shortly after a few sleepless nights in a new house that warrants comfort, Símon (Príncep) finds an imaginary friend who once lived in the same Orphanage prior to its closure; the funny thing is: the number of imaginary friends starts to grow...<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>One thing to point out is that Guillermo Del Toro did lend a hand in this pictures creation yet as a producer; the directorial debut is given to Juan Antonio Bayona, credited as J. A. Bayona. However those familiar with Del Toro's work will be aware and should be aware of his presence throughout the film, that nostalgic sepia tone elements to the camera imagery that can be traced to 'Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone'. <br/><br/>Very astute is the idea that both Director/Producer Del Toro and J. A. Bayona have a great matching affinity for the tautly woven and darkly mingled fantasy 'slash' horror. J. A. Bayona may be considered as Del Toro's prodigy or quick understudy that shows even why with the help of Del Toro; Bayona will never be out of work.<br/><br/>The new found director learns the basic skills from his mentor, in a platonic sense of the same layout; a good scripted, great acted and a well-told story before the multitude of shocks, blood, and that sense of unease that Del Toro gives unlike Hollywood horror directors of recent films like 'Saw' or 'The Others'. <br/><br/>The film doesn't have anything new to give to scare the audience today; instead he takes his stand stead to the classical shock treatment through the use of making a murder mystery/thriller with the loose elements of horror. The location, the Orphanage itself plays like something that has occurred in the nuance of Hollywood horror before many times before, however the take (however common) feels new and fresh, even with the orphanage have the complete range of gimmicks and prickly on-goings like a groaning staircases and a squeaky outside carousel that moves to appear caught in a heavy winds grasp when anyone looks out the window. When the settings and the basic story is established, Bayona settles into telling his story, working through the finely tuned elements of fear that are unforeseen. <br/><br/>Belén Rueda's character' past life is revealed as a young resident of the orphanage, one of the few without obvious disability and so the only one to find a new family. She comes back to the place of her many disowned friends and homely stand stead either to rekindle the life she had and make it a home for other kids as a act of kindness or too help her understand her own inner dealings now passed down to her adopted son. Of which is apparent when the past of her son's life, Símon, is revealed through the friendship with an 'imaginary' lad who likes to hide in caves on the beach and play games with intravenous knowledge of Símon and his family. <br/><br/>Laura ends up in a desperate situation that takes her further into contact with the ghosts of her past, both literally and figuratively. The story plays out more through the use of a horrific sack mask covering that opens up old wounds and provides the steps towards traditional scares. <br/><br/>The brink of emotional degradation of Belén Rueda's persona is paraphrased with the ghost story and crime proceeding and is what makes her performance incredible, a desperate mother looking for her son though she doesn't really go round looking for him, she doesn't run outside with pictures to give to the public, she very much believes that the ghosts of the past of this old orphanage hold the key to finding Símon and begins to question if they mean any harm? Like most ghosts, are they trying to tell us something? <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>A calmly placed horror/thriller that provides the jumps through the mystery of finding a missing child, a brutal and emotionally sad ending that works to startling effect. 8.5/10."

I was never impressed with Del Toro and I guess his protégés are no different as El Orfanato offers little to raise your heart rates. Much of the film is spent setting up tension that goes nowhere; a fact that attempts to hide behind an overbearing score. The demon/monster ""tomas"" is revealed way too early, which would have been almost acceptable except we never see him again in the flesh until the overly anti-climatic betraying ending where any ounce of bloodlust has disappeared. Instead, there are several flatly written scenes that cut away before the audience can emotionally digest what is happening. <br/><br/>I'm not one for gore for the sake of gore, but come on, if you're going to make a horror film, don't be scared to throw around some blood and limbs more than a few times."
"cesarberrios80","1","15","68","13 January 2008"," Bone chilling...
","...coldness coming out of my seat as I sat back and almost fell asleep for this poorly constructed, horribly directed and edited film.<br/><br/>Set in a mansion overlooking a bluff on the southern coast of Spain, The Orphanage had the potential to be a genuinely scary and moving film, yet J.A. Bayona settles for trite suspense and shock. Every time the audience jumps it isn't because of their fear of what is shown on screen, they jump rather because of a loud noise that interrupts the relative silence of the film. This is the equivalent of a kid sneaking up behind you and shocking you while you are entranced reading something. This is just the tip of the ice-berg. Let me illuminate you as to the many shortcomings of this film and why I would prefer a movie like The 6th sense, which while not the best, really gets the suspense and horror right. <br/><br/>I really have no idea where JA Bayona got his film training but I'm willing to bet some $$ that he either got it from working on TV or going to a dime a dozen film school where he just learned the basics of directing, which he then applied to this film basically making it look like a bad thesis film (for an amazing thesis film look at Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep). From the opening scene, which is completely distended from the rest of the film by the tittle sequence, I knew this film smelled like trouble. Who's idea was this?! It is an amateurs job to open a film this way! The opening scene is THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENE OF A FILM! Having it distended in such a way clearly shows a director's lack of talent and inability to master the cinematic medium. To add insult to injury the editing of the film is atrocious! Bayona is absolutely clueless as to the importance of editing to make a film flow properly. His scenes are so distended from each other that watching this film feels like watching a sitcom sans commercials. Clearly mister Bayona you should: a)go back to school and study the works of Eisenstein or b)give up on the idea that you can be a good director because clearly you are not. How can you seriously open scene after scene with the same exterior shot of the house?! And once you got tired of using those shots you started relying on blank screens! Tsk Tsk Tsk, shame on you Bayona! I realize most people will not realize this because they are accustomed to TV style editing and this is a huge problem in today's films. FOR CHRIST'S SAKE FILM IS NOT TV! STOP MAKING FILMS LOOK LIKE TV! And even though some people might argue for this point they fail to realize the inherent difference in both mediums. TV shows need the editing they have in order to fit into the alloted times, but film is not restricted by those limits and thus makes it different. If you relate film to a narrative medium (which it is only in visual terms and not written terms) the editing of the film could be seen as the tying together of ideas from paragraph to paragraph as you would when you're writing an essay. This film does a horrible job at this thus making it an excruciating experience. His use of children's suffering (which I though would have made for a compelling film) fails to deliver the goods and ends up looking exploitative. The finding of the children's remains in the orphanages kiln ovens are just footnotes in what becomes a bloated exploration of a woman's hysteria (Freud would rejoice if he could watch this film!). Instead we are treated to inane and ridiculous scenes ripping at the seams with cinematic clichés. In a particularly ridiculous scene where a group of paranormal investigators enter the house to try and find the whereabouts of the missing boy (Simon) Bayona uses the screams of suffering children as an a prop to create suspense and horror. And just when you think the voice of reason will prevail, the husband is dismissed as a skeptic of a bunch of hooligans with mics and hidden cameras. If only the ending of the film would save the rest of it...NO! Bayona relies on cheap sentimentality to try and make the film into a profound experience and exploration of a mother's love for her child. Cue the music and the suffering children and you get a sloppy mess of dishonest feelings.

","We truly lucked into seeing this. The hype was about horror and scariness, which is not at all the real subject matter of this movie. I don't regularly attend such films, but there was something about it that attracted our interest.<br/><br/>I won't bother reiterating the details already covered. I'm simply here to tell you that when the opportunity arises, go see it.<br/><br/>As the film began, it seemed as though the music and theme were drawing us into yet another ""fright fest"". Old house, unusual history, a little boy with ""imaginary friends"". It appeared almost formulaic in its initial presentation. Unfortunately, that colored my first impressions. As the film developed and the story unfolded, we realized that this was indeed a quality work that some nameless distributor decided would get better attendance if a horror spin was put on the promotion.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled."

","As a summary, this movie is incredibly predictable and the performance of Belen Rueda is the worst I have seen, even the doors acted better than the former ""Los Serrano"" star, at least they looked like doors. But Ms. Rueda is not convincing in her role of an obsessive mother (maybe she could have passed as a door). The main idea of the plot it's not that bad, but it takes a terribly boring amount of time until things start to happen. Until then, you have to watch Belen Rueda pretending to act, Fernando Cayo trying not to be as bad as his partner, and a poor boy, who I thinks have no future in interpretation, just having fun.<br/><br/>It's clear that in Spain we have no good actors since the demise of Pepe Isbert. What an opportunity lost!!!<br/><br/>I can't believe Guillermo del Toro has something to do with this."

","Between a bunch of bad horror remakes and some new but not so good stories, we must be thankful for this movie. Maybe its not the most original but it is very interesting, it has a lot of suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat, it has that kind of psychological terror that will make you jump when you least expect it. Although it isn't directed by Guillermo Del Toro, its clearly that his style is all over this film. It has a slow rhythm but the movie never turns tiresome. Its dark and creepy setting fits really good. The performances from the cast are wonderful, Belen Rueda's is excellent and convincing, you really can feel her desperation and Geraldine Chaplin deserves a mention apart for her special appearance. This is one of the best movies I've seen on the year, really a must see for everyone."
"aharmas","10","3","8","27 January 2008"," Hitchcock would have been proud of this one
","Rarely we are treated to a film that lavishes so many riches upon us: here is a movie with a range of emotions that one never finds for more than a few seconds in Hollywood productions. ""The Orphanage"" sustains the suspense, terror, anguish, thrills, jolts, rawness of its subject matter for its near two hours. It never cheats us with a dollop of special effects that usually ""enhance"" the lack of talent and creativity in most contemporary films. This movie has such a powerful grip that the audience catches themselves holding their breath as the story unfolds, and the mystery grows stronger as the mother searches for her missing boy.<br/><br/>Gorgeously photographed, with an exquisite score, and one of the best editing turns in recent memory, we follow the travails of a woman who is ready to succumb to despair as she can't figure what happened to her sick son. With some rudimentary detective skills and the assistance of some psychic amateurs she puts more and more clues together, but it's her own child's games that might allow her to succeed.<br/><br/>There is much to praise in a movie that defies conventions because it is so beautifully made, here is a movie that gives a new twist to a genre that many consider creatively dead, as we have grown accustomed to expect very little from a new wave of directors that rely too heavily on CGI and sketchy screenplays, and an over-dependency on sequels and tired ideas. On the other hand, ""The Orphanage"" explores the emotional impact of tragic events on human beings, and the importance of family bonds. It rescues us from apathy and involves us as we start caring for the characters on the screen.<br/><br/>Nothing in this film is accidental, with its many references to ""Peter Pan"" and some biblical figures. It is a very satisfying film that demands more than one viewing, one film that will creep you out for the right reasons, and that shows maybe one drop of blood in the entire film, an event that should be celebrated as horror is reborn in a grand way."
"lpas220","10","3","8","15 January 2008"," A smart, suspenseful, yet touching horror film
","Directed by J. A. Bayona, El Orfanato stars Belen Rueda as Laura, a woman who now owns the orphanage in which she grew up. She and her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), plan to utilize it as a home for special kids. Their adopted son, Simon, adorably played by Roger Princep, has imaginary friends, a great personality, and, tragically, HIV. Simon's two starter imaginary friends, Pepe and Walton, get replaced by Tomas and five other children. His parents are slightly concerned, but, hey...imaginative kid...no harm. Simon disappears one day while Laura and Carlos are hosting a welcoming party for their special kids' families. He's missing for quite some time, and now their home is creaking, doors are slamming, and a small boy in a sack mask keeps showing up in the hallways. Obviously, Laura will stop at nothing to find Simon - posters, support groups, mediums/paranormal experts (....ten times freakier than Poltergeist's!). This movie is so suspenseful, you won't want to tear your eyes away. The tie-ins to literature and Laura's childhood are extremely touching and the movie's resolution just makes the film an experience. I won't give away which piece of literature is utilized here, but as Pan's Labyrinth used Alice in Wonderland, this other classic is used just as wonderfully. I don't often leave suspense/horror films with the feeling of elation and wonder that I did tonight. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is close-to, if not completely, perfect."

It's so wonderful to have a movie where there are no stupid slasher-like shocks or quick dramatic ""scares"" that are purely there for shock value. (well.. maybe one or two, but I assure you they are very well done) This movie's fear factor creeps up on you slowly.. full of suspense. It builds it up and builds it up to the point where you don't even want to blink, but every hair on your entire body is standing straight up and you almost don't even want to look.<br/><br/>Some parts, I was squeezing my hands together so tightly that they hurt.<br/><br/>So yes...

"Quebec_Dragon","7","2","5","17 March 2012"," Ordinary name for unorthodox film
","I watched it not quite knowing what to expect. It's not conventional horror. I would describe it as a mix of family drama and psychological supernatural suspense. The closest movie it made me think of was The Others with Nicole Kidman, but it's suitably different. It also reminded me a bit of M. Night Shymalyan's early films. In short, an orphan girl adopted at young age, goes back to live at her old orphanage, recently purchased, with her husband and son. Her memories there are happy, and she plans to start a new life taking care of handicapped kids in that place. Her son has imaginary friends, but he starts making new ones once he arrives at the new house. He plays strange games, a creepy little kid with a cloth bag on his head starts appearing, and then eventually the son vanishes.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is mostly the desperate quest of her mother to find him, while also discovering secrets of her own about the orphanage. I thought the film had pretty good tense moments without relying on cheap jump scares. The directing doesn't draw much attention to itself, but I thought it was nicely done and visually stimulating, even in the several moments where nothing much seemed to happen, moments that could have been boring in a less-talented directors's hands. It's a slow-boiler though and the things you don't see can be the creepiest. Memorable moments include a discussion in bed and a children's game variation on hide and seek. In fact, the discoveries and unmasking of the truth were always highlights.<br/><br/>I liked how things were not always obvious and how it made me think. The clever ending was surprising and memorable, as well as open to interpretation depending on how optimistic or somber you are. The acting by the female lead was believable, you could feel her anguish, and she didn't look like the typical, perfect Hollywood actress, in fact she looked older than her actual age. I could see afterwards why Guillermo Del Toro was interested in the project. It's right up the alley of what interests him with seemingly innocent kids, the power of imagination, wondrous moments, mysteries and a dash of scariness. I think it's worth watching provided you don't expect straight standard horror.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10 (Very good)"
"Chiyonosake23","7","2","5","22 June 2011"," An unexpected gem, but its far from perfect
","I was looking for some horror to watch, to turn off my brain for a hour and a half, and I heard nothing about this one so far, I figured, I give a try. Well, I haven't cried because of a movie since Wall-E almost had me in tears, and before that...I don't even remember. Maybe Requiem for a Dream. My point is, this movie is not a horror this is a drama. There was maybe one scary scene, the ghosts are friendly, and all the murders either happen because of an accident, or already happened in the past. But it is as emotional as it gets. I never saw a movie this cruel and yet this tender at once. The sad fate of the little orphan kids, their tragic and meaningless death, the struggle of the couple, who lost their adopted child, and the search for him is really heart-warming/-breaking. I hated that Benigna character with a passion, I understand, she lost her child because of the prank of the other orphans, but they meant no harm (unlike the ones in Friday the 13th but more on that later...), and killing them made her a disgusting character, it was a real pleasure seeing her get run over by a truck and die. And yes it was so predictable that she murdered the kids, I already know it when she got run over, however it was a good 30 minutes before the movie admitted that she killed the kids. In fact I think even the makers of the movie knew the bigger half of the audience will already know she was the killer of the orphans by the point when she will be killed, because there is only one scene, which has gore in it, and it is her death. Why kill her in a gruesome and cruel manner and show her face torn apart, if the audience still believes she is innocent, and if it is otherwise out of the character of the movie? But if we only care about the emotional side, the drama, this movie should be 10/10. But as a movie it is far from perfect because of three little facts: - the first part should have been scarier in my opinion, because it was too easy to find out, that these ghosts mean no harm, and it killed the later scenes, which tried to be suspenseful. Why worry, if I know, that the ghosts of the children mean no harm? - the whole story of Thomas was a huge rip-off of Jason and the Friday 13th movies. A challenged kid, with a disfigured face (even looking VERY similar than the young Jason) dies because of the prank of other children and his mother kills the ones who are responsible. Sounds familiar eh? - the ending was a rip-off of The Others. Strange fact, that the Others were directed by a Spanish director too. And in the end of both, the mother realizes the ghosts were friendly (but in the others there is a way more scary build-up to this revelation), she and her kid/kids are dead, and she decides to stay in the house, with the other ghosts. Heck, it even turns out in both, that the kid/kids died because of the mother... But rest these things aside, this is a very emotional and good movie. I recommend it to everyone who like drama."
"BaronBl00d","9","2","5","5 September 2010"," Stark and Fantastical Horror from Spain
","As a young girl Laura lived at an orphanage with a handful of other kids only to come back to that orphanage years later as a new owner and desiring to provide comfort and a place of being for some new kids. But Laura, along with her doctor husband and their seven year old adopted son Simon soon discover the orphanage has some dark secrets within. That is, in a proverbial nutshell, the basic premise behind this film, and director Juan Antonio Bayona and producer Guillermo del Toro take that basic premise and weave a haunting, fantastical, beautifully filmed vision to the screen that is at moments breathtaking to the eye and chest-grabbing to the heart. Eeerie images abound, strange noises can be overheard throughout as Laura soon loses her son Simon to the secrets within and must find some way to fill the void of Simon's absence. We get a paranormal investigation, ghostly games, and a hideous secret that has been figuratively(and literally) buried in the orphanage for years. This film has more style than many other films in its genre and is for all purposes one of the best and most stylish horror films I have seen made within the last ten or fifteen years. You can definitely see del Toro's hands involved. The acting by a primarily Spanish cast is first-rate with beautiful Belen Rueda as Laura giving a fine compassionate and chilling performance as Laura - a woman obsessed with finding her lost son at all costs. Geraldine Chaplin, speaking Spanish in a ""perfecto"" manner has a nice small role as a medium. Every time I see her I see her father's doleful eyes and that beautifully simple face. The real star of this film; however, it the director's artistic vision. The film shows virtually no blood or bloodletting, yet it delivers scare after scare with sights and sounds. The mask of the child and the doll are just two of those sights which conjure a myriad of emotions. The Orphange is not a straight and traditional horror film as you will discover by film's end, but it packs a wallop of a punch and has quite a bite in it. It is thankfully subtitled and not dubbed. I forgot after ten minutes or so the film was in a foreign language(to me it is foreign at least)and was mesmerized with what was on screen. If you have never tried a foreign subtitled film, this one might be a good introduction to you."

","The old, old stone mansion that once was an orphanage sits isolated within its ill-kempt gardens and grounds. The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon. <br/><br/>Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. ""I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,"" he tells his mother. ""Will you be like Peter Pan?"" Laura asks. ""Like my new friends,"" Simon says. ""There's more than one?"" ""Six."" ""They won't grow up either?"" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. ""They can't,"" he says <br/><br/>Simon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. ""You're not my mother!"" Simon screams at Laura. ""Who told you that?"" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. ""My friend told me,"" Simon says. ""What friend?"" ""Tomas,"" Simon yells, crying and defiant. ""Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die."" <br/><br/>Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left. <br/><br/>So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting? <br/><br/>""Horror"" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion. <br/><br/>All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense ""acting,"" distraught ""acting,"" tearful ""acting."" Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screen writing, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie."

The fact is that it's been done and I haven't been especially impressed since The Shining. However, the movie propelled itself passed my expectations. It wasn't so much that it was particularly frightening in the traditional sense, granted it had its moments, but the thing that got me was the use of innocent things like a child's imaginary friends or games that became corrupt and sinister.

What about KING KONG (in any version, including the often laughable De Laurentis entry)? Recently, of course, movies like 28 DAYS LATER, THIRTY DAYS OF NIGHT and THE MIST (among others) have proved emotionally powerful and dramatically satisfying. Now comes THE ORPHANAGE, with one of the saddest of happy endings I've ever seen in my life. I don't think I've cried this much since I saw THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD (which, for my money, is hands-down the greatest love story ever made). What a directorial debut!

","Having enjoyed Guillermo Del Toro's Spanish language films Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone I looked forward to this even though he only produced it. I was not disappointed although it is fairly different in tone to those two films.<br/><br/>Set in present day Spain; Laura, her husband and their young son Simon move into the abandoned orphanage that Laura lived in as a child. They are a little concerned that Simon's only friends are imaginary but hope that will change when they reopen the orphanage as home for disabled children. Things don't go according to plan though when Laura is attacked by a strange masked child on the day the children arrive, at the same time her son disappears and the remainder of the film covers her desperate search for him.<br/><br/>If you are looking for gore and violence in a horror film this might not be for you, however if you want something that is genuinely creepy and has a few good scares then I'd strongly recommend this. The acting seemed good although I had to rely on the subtitles as I don't speak Spanish. Throughout the film there is a very creepy atmosphere that kept me on edge the whole time. There is also an interesting subplot concerning an ex-employee of the orphanage and sinister things that happened there in the past."

Skillfully directed? Check. Fantastic performances from the lead actors? Check. Unbelievably morbid? You have no idea - but that morbidity only enhances how truly moving the end of the film is.

"ThreeSadTigers","Null","2","5","28 July 2008"," Not what you might expect; approach with an open mind and an open heart
","Although based on a fairly well-worn supernatural premise, The Orphanage (2007) ultimately has a deeper, more interesting theme rooted in the ideas of grief and psychological turmoil; which for me, makes the experience a more rewarding one. Arguably, it can still be approached as a conventional ghost story - what with its great atmosphere and a handful of effectively creepy sequences recalling the characteristics of recent supernatural thrillers from Japan and North Korea - but ultimately I feel that the central premise - pertaining to loss and emotional disconnection - is the one that is most interesting and ultimately more satisfying; especially when it comes to tying together some of the film's more distracting, thematic loose ends. Certainly, for many viewers it will be considered a flawed film - one that occasionally collapses under any kind of close narrative scrutiny - but again, I think these flaws can be overlooked if you approach the film with the right kind of attitude and the right frame of mind.<br/><br/>For me, The Orphanage is a film that works best in the early hours of the morning; post-midnight if possible, when your imagination is more flexible and the potential to be stirred by the film's creeping mystery and evocative atmosphere will be at its absolute strongest. Again, as with many of the recent horror films coming out of Asian, such as The Ring (1998) and Premonition (2005), The Orphanage takes ideas that focus on the notions of morality, guilt and religious belief, and applies them to a supernatural concept that is then further adapted to a narrative of investigation. We can see a similar idea in the recent Kilometre 31 (2006), in which the audience are involved alongside the characters in attempting to work out the true cause of this seemingly inexplicable horror. It works fantastically well, with the director really instilling the film with the most amazing atmosphere that seems pitched somewhere between the floating ambiance of the Lucile Hadzihalilovic film Innocence (2004), the reflective melancholy of Victor Erice's masterpiece The Spirit of the Beehive (1973) and executive producer Guillermo del Toro's own great film, The Devil's Backbone (2001); drawing us into the story and compelling us, much like the central character, to get to the bottom of this enigmatic mystery.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW However, halfway through the film we begin to get the impression that The Orphanage isn't going to be a conventional horror film in the Hollywood sense (and why should it be?); with the emphasis on the character of Laura and her adopted son Simón suggesting something that goes beyond the more conventional haunted house approach of films like The Haunting (1963) or The Others (2001). The presentation of grief and the mirroring between Laura and the mysterious old woman who turns up on her doorstep suggests an interesting duality on the notion of motherhood, and in particular, of mothers pushed to extreme lengths for the preservations of their sons. Alongside this notion, we also have a self-aware reliance on references to Peter Pan; with the boy that will never grow old and the girl that returns as a much older character, trying to recapture that magic and the sense of imagination that she had put behind her so many years before. This is an important part of the film, as it implies that Laura could have avoided the tragedy if only she'd been able to see through Simón's childlike abstractions for what they truly were.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if we pick apart the plot, the film can be seen to have no such supernatural elements. Everything is explained, with Laura's continual slip into psychological delusions and her eventual reliance on prescription drugs to help her overcome the grief of losing her child allowing the ghosts of the past to manifest themselves in the midst of her imagination. We never see any ghosts in the film, and the lengthy sequence with the team of psychic investigators is most likely a ruse created to dupe both the character and the audience into believing that there is something else to the mystery beyond the psychological breakdown of our central protagonist. Likewise, the ending of the film certainly isn't a twist as some viewers might suggest, with the eventual revelation being hinted at throughout, even spelling things out explicitly towards the very end; with the true ""horror"" of the film being the suggestion that the mother herself in responsible for the death of her son, sending the film off into the realms of imagined fantasy during the final ten to fifteen minutes. In fact, I'd go as far to say that The Orphanage is perhaps the greatest film ever made on the subject of grief and an absolute masterpiece when viewed within this more persona and psychological concept.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS Regardless of any such personal interpretations, the film works simply because it refuses to attach itself to either explanation; so it could be supernatural or merely psychological. The film remains enigmatic enough that the audience can draw their own conclusions, though for me, it still works best at the level described above. The film won't be to all tastes, with many allowing classifications of genre or the spectre of popular opinion to sway them in the expectation of something that the film could never realistically guarantee; while many will simply balk at the more illogical or inscrutable elements that seem to work on a more emotional level, again, pertaining to the central character. It is also worth mentioning that the lead performance from Belén Rueda is an absolute revelation - and far beyond what we might normally expect from a performance in a supernatural film - as she instills Laura with an entirely believable pain and desperation that sees her spiral into the more imaginative and enigmatic moments of the film's final act."

","I didn't figure that any movie could equal ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but ""El orfanato"" - ""The Orphanage"" in English - comes close. When a family moves into a former orphanage in which the mother (Belen Rueda) grew up, the adopted son starts making imaginary friends and feeling very detached from his parents. And then, he just disappears. But that's not all...<br/><br/>A major surprise as the movie progresses is the appearance of Geraldine Chaplin as a woman hired to try to help find the son. Ms. Chaplin certainly has a connection to orphanages, as her father spent part of his childhood in one. Although in reality, I don't know whether or not that influenced her decision to star in this.<br/><br/>All in all, a really good one. Also starring Fernando Cayo."

","The Orphanage is not a horror film at all, if your looking for a rip their heads off film you will be disappointed. Sure there are scenes that are genuinely scary but they are few in number and not worth the wait. This film is for anyone who likes a good supernatural mystery, a film that comes to mind is Dragonfly (2002). The fun of the breadcrumb clues and puzzle solving will have to be enough for the audience to sit through the whole film, which it is if you like that stuff. The cinematography and location are incredible. It is the directors first feature film, which I think is unnoticeable, it is very well crafted. As you probably know Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth) produced this film and with good reason, it screams his style, his feeling of story telling; eerie and mystical with a hint of danger. So if you like a good supernatural mystery/thriller that has more emotion and drive than your typical horror film you will enjoy The Orphanage. If your just looking for a good horror movie scare, you wont get it; but you might get more out of the film than you think."

","I consider horror my favorite genre of film. This being said, there are far too many horrible scary movies compared to the numbers of worthy horror films. ""The Orphanage"" is the best horror film I have ever seen. Period. The mood; the feel; the atmosphere. It is all here in a film that will stay with you long after viewing it. The scenes with Geraldine Chaplin are frightening. The female lead is absolutely wonderful. The little boy is precious to behold on screen. Even if you aren't a horror buff, go see this film with an open mind. It will amaze you and have you leaving the theater saying ""This is what going to the movie theater should be like."" The frights are genuine thrills. The score subdued but effective. I have watched it three times already and cannot wait to view it again. One helluva good movie."
"ramsri81","9","2","5","15 April 2008"," Excellent Thriller from the Spanish Team...
","This movie is more a intelligent thriller with some scary scenes. The story revolves around a former inmate at a Orphanage comes back to her roots and buys that property planning to convert into a place for special children. The trouble starts when her son starts conversing with a invisible friend who brings just more than trouble. The rest of the story is very suspenseful and will turn out to be a very good thriller (with more European Flair) with a few scary scenes. I am very impressed with the recent horror flicks from Spain. They are high on quality, acting and likability index.This movie is definitely for people looking at a alternate story telling for a horror/thriller flick with a spooky house. The characters play their part well and location of the Orphanage itself plays out like an other character in the movie."

"simonparker1990","10","2","5","10 April 2008"," Scary, beautiful, breathtaking!
","Two years ago Guillermo Del Toro unleashed one of my all time favourite films, Pan's Labyrinth. Pan's Labyrinth is an original, beautifully told, beautifully acted grown up fairy tale set in war. It was shockingly original yet heart touchingly beautiful, Del Toro created a true masterpiece. Ever since that movie I vowed to see every single one of his movies. While The Orphanage might not be a Del Toro movie, but it has his finger prints all over it. The superb revelation of this movie definitely has to be its director, Juan Antonio Bayona. Bayona was pretty much mentored by Del Toro, and this film unveils a director who might just be as brilliant as Del Toro. The Orpahange you see to be blunt is a masterpiece, it has its flaws, but it is still undoubtedly a masterpiece. The film is the finest, and damned scariest, horror movie that I have seen in many a year. But to call this movie a strict horror movie does not really compliment the movie, its more a horror/drama, a powerful piece of cinema where you genuinely care for the characters and yet are absolutely terrified. Bayona takes time in intensifying the scares and doesn't really overly rely on jump scares. Sure I jumped twice (the second being a huge jump) but I preferred watching the creepier moments. These moments are made better by the superb performances and the fact that you genuinely care for the lead character. The story might not be overly original, and some plot points not really as explained as much as I would have liked, but to take notice of these flaws is to overlook the sheer brilliance of this superb movie.<br/><br/>The lead actress of this movie is perhaps the second largest revelation from this movie. Belen Rueda plays the lead, Laura. The mother who takes over the orphanage and whom these creepy events start to unfold around. Laura is a truly realistic character, and that is something very refreshing. She isn't some blonde bimbo who goes running round screaming, she isn't a cliché of a horror character. She seems like a genuinely interesting woman, a mother desperate to find out what has happened to her child, a mother perhaps on the verge of a mental breakdown. So many issues are touched on with her that it makes the storyline so much more intriguing. Rueda plays her perfectly, every emotion conveyed so perfectly. As the movie reaches its terrifying climax Rueda's performance just gets better and better, one of her final sequences is superbly acted. Fernando Cayo does a great job as the husband, a man desperate to find his son, but worrying about how increasingly paranoid is wife has become. Cayo is pretty much the voice of reason in the movie, his character admittedly never is explored all too well but the performance is still great. Geraldine Chaplin is by far my favourite actress in the movie, but her character is sadly barely in the film so we never see her enough. She plays a psychic who goes into the house to help, I won't ruin any more but she is definitely in the best sequence of the movie. The child stars are also extremely noteworthy.<br/><br/>So let me talk more about the scares of The Orphanage. The Orphanage is a scary movie, however it depends what you want from a horror. If you want yet another Japanese horror movies remake with thousands of jump scares but no lingering scares then this will not work for you. This movie slowly terrifies. The jump scares are few and far between and the movie takes at least half an hour for any scares to truly begin. But there are three sequences here that are just hard to watch they are so tense. My favourite of which involves a night camera sequence, the sequence isn't jumpy, but the scene gets gradually more and more tense, much like a coiled spring. I guarantee that sequence will make your heart thump. The film is also an emotional roller-coaster, the last ten minutes are amongst the most emotional I have seen in some time. The movie goes through several plot twists, some obvious, some not at all obvious, and leads to an ending that Hollywood executives would have a fit over. Its a highly original and dark movie, yet oddly touching and beautiful. As I mentioned the ending doesn't quite deal with every plot point, some points are left hanging in the air completely. Thankfully what the ending does deliver is a series of different ways to interpret the movie. At first it seems like one straightforward ending, yet once I got home and started thinking I realised just how layered the movie was.<br/><br/>The Orphanage might not be as good as Pan's Labyrinth, but it is still a movie to relish. The film is scary yet beautiful at the same time, the film lingers in your mind long after you leave the cinema and is a film I cannot wait to get on DVD. I urge you watch this movie as soon as you can."

"KatieWoodmore","10","2","5","22 March 2008"," Chilling and tearful
","I had read only one article about The Orphanage before going to the cinema (so as not to spoil it), and I knew straight away that it was going to exceed my expectations. I'm certainly not someone who loves horror movies and see them just to be scared. I like them to have depth and meaning,which this film had in bucket loads. As most great horror movies have had in the past, this is rooted in deep sadness, and the tears were rolling down my cheeks by the end of the film. I also think I have never jumped and shouted out loud in a public place so much while watching this. There is a slight element of The Others about this film, and also Pan's Labyrinth, reflecting the fact it was produced by the masterful Del Toro, but I feel the accolades should be handed to it's wonderful director, Juan Antonio Bayona, someone who Del Toro saw great potential in. On a side note, my experience of this film was severely destroyed by the fact that I was seated in front of some very stupid, immature, teenage girls who were trying to describe the film to their friend, over the phone, completely ruining the atmosphere..."
"rowman2222","8","2","5","2 March 2008"," Excellent for the genera, Truly the best Ghost Story of 2007
","This is the best Horror film of the year. I use the term Horror to encompass a broad range of films including supernatural to gore. The reality is that this film is a ghost story. Possibly the best ghost story I have ever seen. I feel this way because the lead characters makes real choices. They are very well developed people and you can understand their motivations, their desires, their fears, and their purpose; and this is rare in any genera nd almost unheard of in horror; in my opinion.<br/><br/>The depth of development for the character of Laura is phenomenal. Her emotions can truly be felt by the viewer and her obsessions, which to the casual observer might seem mad, are understood in a way that only great film makers and actors, can achieve. The viewer is made to want what she wants. You do not become a casual observer to her plight as much as you become a willing participant. And it breaks you apart, not with terror, but sadness;unavoidable anguish and hurt.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. The scope of the shots, the color saturation, the picturesque landscape of the villa, really gives the eyes a feast. There are no weak performances from any cast member, everyone is exactly whom you believe them to be.<br/><br/>My only problems with the film have to do with the lack of decent back story. There is no explanation of how Laura was brought up, very little explanation of why she has had this desire to reopen the Orphanage, and very little to say of why she and her husband decided to adopt. I would like to have seen more explanation for the events that led then back to the orphanage. That and the creepy social worker woman who seems almost creepy for creepys sake. And she was creepy.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film."
"abigailsea11","9","2","5","22 February 2008"," Really creepy!!
","I saw this movie recently in theaters and thought it really built up so well toward the ending...all the pieces click into place which is not easy to do with a thriller like this. The cinematography was beautiful and Belén Rueda (Laura) is so much the face and emotional current of the movie, that I would think it would be hard to keep us engaged for so long. She does though. I love movies like this because I think they are in that creepy thriller genre that can really going wrong but has the potential to go incredibly right if the suspense and tension is handled perfectly. Like in The Sixth Sense, El Orfanato pulls it off with precision. Great movie!!!"
"fertilecelluloid","8","2","5","21 February 2008"," A creepy, unsettling film that surprised me
","I don't care for supernatural mumbo-jumbo, so my interest in ""The Orphanage"" wasn't very high. I went to see it, anyway, hoping I'd be surprised. Luckily, I was. It has an unsettling quality that grabbed my attention. The setting is an old orphanage on the Spanish coast. There is a lighthouse and a dark secret. A couple with a son have plans for the orphanage -- plans that don't quite materialize. That's where the horror comes in, of course. I was happy to discover that ""The Orphanage"" is filled with bizarre and grotesque imagery. One of the film's focal points is a little boy with a face that is a cross between John Merrick, The Elephant Man, and Johnny Handsome (from Walter Hill's film of the same name). Director Juan Antonio Bayona does a good job creating some intense sequences and steering the horror away from the clichéd. The orphanage interior reminded me of the house in Augustin Villaronga's ""In A Glass Cage"" -- especially the way in which Bayona tracks and dollies down corridors and through ancient archways; the score has echoes of Villaronga's film also. When the film's mystery is revealed, it is a solid revelation that was worth waiting for. Not a gory film or a particularly violent film, it is a creepy film with solid production values and extremely effective performances. Its affection for the freakish is much appreciated."

"sgbreton77","9","2","5","2 February 2008"," True suspense horror gem
","A true gem. This Spanish suspense horror film is one of the best in 2007 and certainly one of the finest in the genre. Brilliant well crafted script, excellent direction, very well acted: Belen Rueda steals the show. A story that keeps you constantly guessing and interested, and a very satisfying finalé, that makes perfect sense to everything that is presented along the ride. Everything fits at the end, nothing is out of place, enough thrills but there are no cheap non-sense gore scenes that usually appear in this type of movies. El Orfanato was the best Spanish movie in Spain at the box office in 2007. Well deserved."

","Don't be fooled by other reviewers throwing out these 10 out of 10s; this film is decent and easily passes the time - but it adds nothing new to the genre. Alas, it is full of all those typical horror clichés we've seen throughout the years; i.e., things that go 'bump' in the night, shock cuts, etc. On the plus side, there's no denying the production values, including the acting. The one thing that's kind of mysterious (or a letdown if you will) is when we realize that Laura is dead, and has joined her son and the other children on the other side. We don't know exactly when she died; we assume it's down in the basement - where Tomas used to be kept. The Innocents (1961) is STILL the best horror film ever made - SEE IT!"

"Mokosh","10","3","10","8 March 2008"," Not necessarily a horror, but an eye opener to the vital nature of the human spirit
","-----Possible Spoiler(s)----- ""Why are you wearing that stupid man-suit?"" was a brilliant quote by Frank from the movie ""Donnie Darko"", which is a quote that treads on the path of ""The Orphanage"". The movie ""The Orphanage"" has been a delightful surprise, which is to say that the movie, looking beyond the surface, is a delightful tale seeking to elevate the importance of the human spirit.<br/><br/>It will be worthwhile to mention that the movie uses very effective strategies to convey its archaic message. One of the most powerful would be that of heart-throbbing emotion. Second to that would be the tone.<br/><br/>It is almost immediately after the introduction of the movie that we are introduced to Laura and her adopted son Simon. We see the engaging motherly love by Laura and the innocent love displayed by Simon and are, thusly, conveyed the powerful relationship between the two. Throughout the movie we see series of examples of affection between Laura and Simon, which concretely establishes the viewer's affinity towards these two characters.<br/><br/>The movie, then, begins to investigate a curious tone when the viewer learns that the boy, Simon, sees entities from the spiritual realm. Numerous times, Simon clearly shows his excitement for being able to interact with these beings, but, on the contrary, Laura is desperate to find out the meaning of all of this. Since the viewer's perspective is almost always hidden from that of the boy, we are left with that of Laura. The viewer here feels the same desperate and acute situation of Laura. Once normally unexplainable events start to happen and the gravity of the situation reaches the climax, the viewer especially identifies with Laura's emotions.<br/><br/>It is important to mention the movie's overarching message. The movie seeks to denounce almost any importance on the material and to shine light on the spiritual. In fact, throughout the movie, we see no special material importance, but are constantly bombarded by spiritual factors whether that is the love between Laura and Simon or the deceased children of the Orphanage, spiritually the movie is opulent. As Frank from ""Donnie Darko"" would say, the human body is a cage for the human spirit.<br/><br/>Once Laura decided to commit suicide in order to be with her son, we enter the spiritual realm. The movie's depiction of the spiritual world is arbitrary, of course, and all the creators could do is to teleport the viewer to the past when the light tower was still working. All of this is sufficient to bring the viewer to tears by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>We realize the importance of the golden rule and the effect of it upon the human spirit. Above all else, we should love each other unconditionally. We ought not separate, hate, fear, and agonize ourselves, but love, because all of this will carry on to the spiritual.<br/><br/>""Whereas the body is nothing, the soul is everything."" - Seiojih"

Anyways, i know i might be a minority over here but frankly i was very disappointed with The Orphanage. Expected a lot more. Its heavily over rated film. But as i said, i felt it this way. You might not. Acting is top notch, and the child artist is brilliant. Cinematography is breath taking at times. As for the script, its as confusing as the child's mother in the film.

","My summary is accurate BUT not how I really should describe this excellent drama.<br/><br/>Guilleremo Del Toro the producer/director of Pan's Labrynth is the producer of THE ORPHANAGE, but I am sure he was looking over this film like a legendary producer of the past( David O.Selznick)used to do.<br/><br/>The directorial reigns were handed to first time director Juan Berona. Mr. Berona did an excellent job for his first full feature .<br/><br/>Setting is a very large old house which was at one time an orphanage.<br/><br/>It just happens to be the new home of a nice married couple & there adorable 7 year old son. It turns out that said wife grew up in this place & has happy memories (we do see her last day as a child here in the opening scene. The young 7 year old seems to have imaginary friends that he finds in this house.. A while later at a party the lad just seems to have disappeared. The rest of the film is about the mothers search for her missing son amongst other things in her once happy secure life.<br/><br/>Belon Rueda is the fine Spanish actress who portrays this women. I personally feel she was cheated out of an Oscar nomination for her superb performance. The entire cast is excellent as well. Geraldine Chaplin has a brief role & is excellent.<br/><br/>As I said in my summary (above) there is next to no violence & no bloody gore or zombies like you find in other generic horror films.At times this film is very spooky & even scary, & there was a point I said out loud 'dont go down the stairs''<br/><br/>All the production credits are first rate.Many of the craft technicians were first times like the director. Obviously the producer Mr.Del Toro supervised in fine fashion. ( ala the legendary Selznick--for those who do not know he produced Gone With The Wind & Duel in the Sun---2 classic movies.)<br/><br/>I do not recommend this for small children or for those who want gore & more gore.<br/><br/>Ratings **** (out of 4) 98 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)"

"Macabro","10","2","6","19 February 2008"," A Brilliant and Stylish Horror Film
","In a few short and simple words, El Orfanato is a disturbing, frightening and very eerie film... It's a simple movie with strong character development, excellent acting, a very creepy atmosphere and a very well executed story with an intelligent script. All the actors in the film give outstanding performances and every scene is done magnificently.<br/><br/>There are many horror films in the world being made nowadays, not sure how many, but it must be a number somewhere in the thousands per year, but a very high percentage of those films are garbage. Bad scripts, bad acting, bad ideas, movies stealing from other movies and the worst Japanese remakes.<br/><br/>Where any other movie fails, El Orfanato emerges victoriously. I have stated this before in some of my other reviews: ""Horror is a genre that needs to be handled with care"" because If it is overdone, then it falls into ridicule. If it is too light, then it is not scary. If it is too gory then, it is too graphic and most critics kill it, and this list goes on and on<br/><br/>El Orfanato does none of the above; it stays loyal to the genre and does it with elegance and style. There are no monsters, no creatures, no gore, no torture, and no grotesque scenes. No need for any of these, with such a brilliant script, musical score and direction. The film grabs the audience from start to finish.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. A+"

"david_rudy_lee","10","1","2","31 January 2020"," Haunting and Bleak Tale
","This was a film that I remember coming out while I was in college, but I didn't get around to seeing it in theaters. Part of it was I'm not sure if played by me and if it did, I went through some weird phases where I would see things in theater and sometimes I wouldn't. It was one I always planned on seeing, but never got around to until now when it actually played at the Gateway Film Center on 35mm. The synopsis here is a woman brings her family back to her childhood home, which used to be an orphanage for handicapped children. Before long, her son communicates with an invisible new friend.<br/><br/>We start this with a bunch of children playing a game that is very similar to 'Red Light'. We see that other children are approaching her until she is tagged. It turns out that one of the girls, Laura, has been adopted and going to be leaving the orphanage.<br/><br/>It then shifts to present day where Laura is Belén Rueda. She is moving into her former home with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their son Simón (Roger Príncep). Their plan is to reopen this place as a school for children that have disabilities. Through some interactions we learn that Simón is adopted and HIV positive. He also has a vivid imagination in that he has a bunch of imaginary friends. His parents are concerned, but hoping that when the other children move in, he'll grow out of it.<br/><br/>Things get a bit weird though when Simón and Laura go to the beach together. There is a nearby cave and inside, Simón meets a new imaginary friend Tomás. This ends up turning into six new friends. Laura and Carlos just believe it is still him being lonely, but weird things start to happen around their new house.<br/><br/>It gets even scarier when Benigna (Montserrat Carulla) shows up. She claims to be a social worker with a file on Simón. Laura also starts to see a boy in a mask that she thinks is Tomás. When Simón goes missing at a party they're throwing to convince parents to bring their children there, the nightmare really begins.<br/><br/>If I'm going to be perfectly honest, I'm mad at myself for waiting this long to see the film. I have seen director J.A. Bayona's films after this and I can actually see where his talents started. I was listening to a podcast about this film and I something that struck me is when we think about Spain, we think of beaches, sun and bright colors. Bayona does a great job at making this film look ominous, overcast and just cold. That really fits the tone as well as the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Something else is that the Spanish have a rich religious history. I personally was raised Christian through my grandmother, a friend and my parents. My parents really didn't push it the older I got. Plus the more science made sense to me and I turned to atheism. I only bring this up because this film has you wondering if there are ghosts or not. It presents it that there are, but for the most part, the people aren't terrified of them. Sure Tomás has some scenes where he is, but it's not necessarily the driving force. The ghosts seem to be helpful. Carlos is a doctor, so he doesn't necessarily seem to think they are real where Laura does.<br/><br/>There is also a way to read this they aren't real. I won't spoil this film, but I do believe that one game that is played, you could say that Simón set it all up. There's no actual proof that a ghost did. There are a lot of things that can be explained away, but I love the ambiguity to allow the viewer to see and believe what they want. I personally believe that they are ghosts here though, to just throw out my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover is that the writing of this film is excellent. There are little things that play into the film later and I love when a movie can do this as well as we see here. There are certain noises and things that happen. Going farther than that, I love how ingrained in this Laura and others are in the past of this place. There's also a moment where Simón is reading Peter Pan and I love how this also ties back in. This is interesting as Guillermo del Toro helped produce, as it does carry that dark fairy tale feel he brings.<br/><br/>That moves me to the pacing of the film, which I think is really good. The movie runs about 105 minutes, but it really doesn't feel like it. It does a really good job at introducing us to characters in the original time period and then into the present. From there the mystery starts and it just gets darker as things are learned as well. This film is also quite depressing, which I tend to enjoy. The ending is bleak, but it also can be seen as happy in a sense as well.<br/><br/>For the acting, I don't really have anything negative to say. Rueda is excellent here. We can see that she loves her child, but it is a lot of work with his condition and getting everything ready. She looks exhausted. On top of that though, she is also trying to open up this orphanage to help children as well. It is really a noble effort, especially since those children have disabilities. Cayo is kind of a jerk, but I also fell like he's a rock for Laura. Príncep is an interesting child and I think he fit his role just fine. Carulla was quite creepy if I'm honest as well as Óscar Casas who is Tomás. The latter's creepiness though is from the mask. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what is needed.<br/><br/>That moves me next to the effects, which if I remember correct there's not really any. The look of the mask that Tomás is creepy and it is sad, because the reason he wears it is shown. He can't help that and I didn't find him scary there. It did look real just I can appreciate. I would have to say that the film is shot beautifully. They did well with the setting to make it look almost gothic which is in line with the ghost story aspect here.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. For the most part it really did fit the scenes for what was needed. There were times that it really does help to build the tension. I really want to commend though on the sound design. There are times where we hear bumps and things in the old house that makes you wonder, is it just the house shifting or something else. That gets under my skin if I'm honest.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film is one that I'm mad at myself for not having seen until now. It is beautiful and haunting at the same time. It really had a sad ending, but it really is kind of happy as well. I really like how it is established and it never really wastes time there. The acting is good across the board and even though there's not really much in the way of effects, the look of Tomás is eerie. It definitely is shot beautifully which really builds the atmosphere and the setting helps there. I also think that the soundtrack and design also helps in building the tension. I really liked this film, but I will warn you, it is from Spain so I had to watch it with subtitles on. If that is an issue, you might be able to find a dub or just avoid it all together. It is really good though so I wouldn't recommend the latter."

","El Orfanato is a good movie, worthwhile for its cast's performances, direction and story.<br/><br/>Belen Rueda is terrific, with all her motherhood character and savior.

It didn't scare me as other mainstream horror movies do, but yes, it is a thriller with a story so appealing, you may even cry at the end. It shows a mother's love no matter what the circumstances.

","First let me say this movie was a treat to watch. And now I feel the need to say something about ""foreign"" language films. At least foreign to those of us born and bred in the U.S. I'm applying this to myself but I am sure many can relate to this. In the past I invariably passed over watching a film if it wasn't in English, even if it had high ratings, interesting subject matter, and great reviews because I was of the feeling if it wasn't in English it wasn't worth watching, and I was/am lazy. I didn't want to put forth the effort of reading subtitles and maybe learning something about a different culture, peoples, and language. Very narrow-minded. I feel like such a putz for thinking that if it wasn't in English it wasn't worth my time. So I've recently made a special effort to watch foreign films like this one and have been rewarded greatly. OK, I've castigated myself and have repented of my sins. The Orphanage is creepy, like Pan's Labyrinth, also by Guillermo del Toro. So I'm off on an adventure into foreign lands..."
"ivanzcarrillo","8","1","2","19 July 2012"," Good movie even if you are fan or not to this genre.
","The thing about this movie is that based on a good script and a fabulous performance by Belén Rueda we get an excellent combination of drama and thriller that really keep us into our seats during the whole movie. At the start this film expose the well intentioned behavior of a couple that wants to help kids with special conditions. With their son Simón (Roger Príncep) Laura (Belén Rueda) and Carlos (Fernando Cayo) are going to experience the consequences of living in a house that used to be an orphan that has a lot of memories. The things start to get complicated to the family when Simón meets some ""imaginary"" friends and the macabre games start. The waiting for the character of Carlos to really get involved into his family problem is overshadowed by the strong character of a mother that does not know what is real and is ready to do whatever it takes to find the truth about what is happening in her house and that becomes the most remarkable thing in this movie, and with a good direction of Bayona that never lets the film loses its intensity, although in some parts the sense that the movie is about to get stocked is inevitable Bayona makes the film keeps moving without making it hard to follow. <br/><br/>In the film are from imaginary friends to extravagant medium (extraordinary played by Geraldine Chaplin) so this movie becomes a good option for people who enjoy good doses of stress and suspense, mixed with great actors performances and a script that has nothing to envy to other films of the genre."
"Esther-Coleman","7","1","2","6 May 2012"," Like ""The Others"", but better
","I don't make a habit of learning too much about a movie before I watch it, so I really wasn't sure what kind of movie to expect of The Orphanage. My best guess would probably have been your average creepy child movie, akin to Orphan or The Children. What I got was one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Yes, it has its creepy elements, and a few jump scenes to keep the mood intact. However, if you're not a fan of scary movies, sit tight anyways. The movie does drag a little during the middle (as most movies do), but it never becomes truly uninteresting. The plot shares many common elements with The Others, but The Orphanage not only presents a much better cast of characters, but also includes, in my opinion, a far more satisfying and unpredictable result. I rarely cry during movies, but in the last ten or so minutes of this one, I was near sobbing. I usually like to think I'm good at guessing twist endings before they're revealed, but I didn't see this one coming. And I certainly didn't expect such an emotional, heartwarming, and heartbreaking ending to what, at first glance, seemed like a Poltergeist-like ghost story.<br/><br/>So, in summary, if you're looking for a horror movie, look elsewhere (may I suggest Shutter Island for a fairly similar, but more horrifying film?). If you're looking for a ghost story, go ahead, but prepare some tissues. If you're looking for an emotional masterpiece, watch it, but bring a few blankets to hide under. Overall, don't miss this movie. Just don't."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","26 October 2011"," A really well made genre film.
","This is one greatly directed and wonderful looking movie but I really wouldn't go as far to call this movie a great one as well.<br/><br/>It's a movie that builds- and relies heavily on its atmosphere. And with its build-up and atmosphere this movie surely doesn't disappoint. It's a wonderful looking movie, with wonderful cinematography and use of light, to help build up the movie its tension, mystery and atmosphere. Credit for this of course also needs to go to director Juan Antonio Bayona, who did a great job with it all and provided the movie with some great moments.<br/><br/>So what's the problem you might wonder. Well, unfortunately once you start analyzing it- and thinking back about it, the story just isn't really all that great or special. To be honest, it really isn't all that original and something I have seen done a lot before, in the recent past. Of course it's not like the story is bad all together but it's just that the movie didn't really offered anything new or surprising to me, no matter how creatively it all got told and shot at times.<br/><br/>You also need to know what to expect when watching this movie. It's often being advertised as an horror but is it an horror really? I guess you could classify it as one, though supernatural thriller would perhaps be a better way to describe it. It has some scare moments in it and some other typical horror ingredients, as well as style but overall story-wise the movie has way more thriller, mystery and drama elements in it. This movie in fact definitely works better as a mystery than an horror really, so know what to expect when watching this movie.<br/><br/>Producer's Guillermo del Toro touch is definitely notable throughout the movie. Like lots of other movies he was involved with, this one feels and can be seen as a dark fairytale, for adults. This is something I often really love about del Toro's movies and the one element that for me really stood out about it and made it still an original enough one, within its genre.<br/><br/>I guess that those who aren't really into these sort of dark mystery thrillers, told in an horror style, will still end up really loving this movie and might end up being surprised by all of its twists and developments as well. For me personally it however was offering far too little new story-wise but I obviously still could really appreciate this movie, for the way it got made and looked.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"KnightsofNi11","8","1","2","21 April 2011"," Surprisingly good
","I have to say, I really enjoy films that can do what this film does in its combination of genres. When it is executed poorly it absolutely ruins a film through a complete loss of direction or motivation. But a film like The Orphanage combines the genres of horror, drama, and romance very well. It is difficult to say any one of those three genres stands out as the most prominent in this tale of love and story of horror (that line, courtesy of the film's tagline). The Orphanage, or El orfanato as it is known by its Spanish title, tells the story of a woman, Laura, who reopens her childhood home as an orphanage for disabled children. Everything appears like it is going to work out wonderfully until Laura's son Simon starts talking to imaginary friends. On opening day Simon begins acting very strange until he suddenly goes missing. Laura is convinced it has to do with ghosts in the house, so she begins an investigation with the help of parapsychologists to find her missing son. The story takes all kinds of turns that you never see coming, and it is overall very unique, as well as very suspenseful.<br/><br/>This is a movie that truly makes you feel. It is a movie where you can get behind the characters and really become engulfed in the story. There are so many strange yet interesting things going on in this film that will surely catch ones attention. A great mystery unfolds in this film, and you are constantly wanting to know more. The film is set up very well in that Simon's disappearance feels so sudden and out of place that the audience has very few clues to figure out the ending beforehand. Thus we feel we know the exact same amount of information as Laura, making our search to figure out the film as desperate as Laura's search for her son.<br/><br/>The film is also backed by a great script with fantastic acting. This is just one of those very sincere films that knows exactly what it has set out to do, and doesn't detract from the main focus. It has some minor flaws in the storyline, as do most films, but everything is fairly excusable. The film also has some peculiar direction which I can't decide detracts or helps the films main point. The Orphanage is directed with a very low key visual eye, and it is not frantic or rushed in any way. The film is slow and almost majestic at times. In a way I felt like this film was almost too clean and too polished at times. Other times the sincerity of the direction was just right and at the perfect balance of horror and beauty. It is something that makes more sense in context, but hopefully the point I am trying to get across makes sense.<br/><br/>The Orphanage was a surprisingly good film, overall. It's not perfect but what movie is? I can give plenty of credit to a film that begins and ends very well. It definitely drags towards the middle and I wasn't sure if I was even going to rate this high or not before the films climax. But then the very end is absolutely incredible, and it is a very beautiful scene that really picked the whole film back up on its feet. Unfortunately the last thirty seconds the film decided to throw one last scene in that I felt the film could have done without, but it didn't ruin the ending by any means. This is a great film and there is a whole lot to be enjoyed here, even if you aren't a fan of horror."

(The black cat jumping from off screen gag) This is a genuine feel of dread while watching. I mean the camera angles and cinematography are all done so masterful that you can not help but feel the director ready to go.. ""Boo!""

","I was really not intending to watch The Orphanage, just because it looked so similar to other films of it's kind, most notably The Others. However, I am glad I did watch it, because although it does have similar aspects, it remains a beautiful and very moving film. As a horror film it succeeds, and as a drama it succeeds as well. It is genuinely creepy, with one of the scariest scenes of the last decade (guess which it is, but I am sure everyone will know I am talking about the 'medium' scene). The screenplay is very, very strong, not one major flaw. The performances are brilliant, and first-time director Juan Antonio Bayona might really have a bright future ahead of him. The suspense is at times dreadfully mysterious, and the cinematography is surreal and beautiful. The music score gives the film a classical feel to it, and is very effective. Overall, I think it is a great film, and ultimately has better execution and more suspense than The Others. This will not disappoint you!"

The cast are good, especially Rueda in the lead role. There is also a good, sinister performance by Montserrat Carulla as Benigna. Good scenes include a game where Laura knocks 3 times on the wall before turning around to see if anyone is there and there is that moment that happens in all scary films where you shout out ""Nooo. Don't go down into the basement!"" The only silly part of the film is the husband's unwillingness to stick with her at the end and the way in which Laura seems to be going through everything without her husband going through it with her at the same time.

The whole sequence is set up so brilliantly and leaves the viewer completely breathless basically without showing them a single thing. It is this technique that is carried out throughout the entire film that is, as I see it, they key to the movies brilliance.

","I recently went to see Paranormal Activity which has been dubbed 'the scariest film ever'. It was a massive disappointment, a boring film with only a good ending as a saving grace. Most modern American horror films are either remakes, gorno or simply poor efforts, long gone are the days with great horror films like The Shinning, The Exorcist and The Omen. The best hope for good horror films have been foreign cinema, with entries from Asia like A Tale of Two Sisters and the Ring following the right rules towards horror cinema. The Spanish are also getting in on the act, with the excellent fantasy Pan's Labyrinth and now the ghost thriller the Orphanage.<br/><br/>Set on the coast of Spain, Laura (Belén Rueda) buys the orphanage she grew up in when she was a child. She is married to Carlos (Fernando Cayo), a doctor and have an adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep). Laura wants to reopen the orphanage as a care centre for special needs children. Simón is a lonely child and has a couple of imagery friends. Laura and Carlos believes that it's just a phase. When in a cave he makes a new 'friend' and tells Laura of the game he plays, taking away something you love and leaving clues to help you find it. Tensions with Simón start to grow when he discovers he is adopted and HIV positive. One the day when centre is about to open Simón disappears and Laura is attacked by child wearing a sack mask. After months with Simón missing Laura still senses Simón is alive and that there is a strange present in the house. She does everything she can to find her son.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro was a producer for The Orphanage, which helped with the film's marketing, but he does also have a good eye for film. There is trusty name reconization.<br/><br/>The Orphanage follows the most important rule of horror cinema, have compelling characters, and Laura is a character you can sympathise with. You have to care about what happens to her. There is also a strong underlining theme/fear, the lost of a child. The acting in this film is excellent, especially Belén Rueda and it helped you believe in the characters.<br/><br/>There is a good script by Sergio G. Sánchez who focuses on the family drama as well as the ghostly elements. He tells a compelling story and keeps you guessing. This story has a few similarities with The Sixth Sense and A Tale of Two Sisters (namely the plot twists). He references a few popular cultural items like The Shinning and Peter Pan. The direction by Juan Antonio Bayona is subtle and understand, which gives the scares more of an impact. Despite it's supernatural story, Bayona keeps the film fairly grounded, he crosses the direction William Friedkin of the Exorcist and Ji-woon Kim of A Tale of Two Sisters. He makes the film both a horror and a thriller.<br/><br/>Worth watching."

It is refreshing to see a modern ghost story which doesn't rely on buckets of blood to tell its tale. The cinematography is excellent, the script is well thought out and beautifully executed. The acting is great. Director Juan Antonio Bayona gets fine performances from the entire cast, especially the lead Belén Rueda as Laura.

The entire mystery is portrayed through the eyes of Rueda and she does the job superbly as a protagonist. For a film involving spirits and ghosts I was expecting a lot of off the wall scenes.

"Vovion","8","1","2","8 July 2009"," A haunted house film that finally works.
","Horror films are few and far between these days; in fact it's almost a dead genre in the west. Gore and torture pornography centred films like Saw and Hostel seem to have stole the foundations of horror and instead of focusing on truly scaring people through suspense, meticulous direction and script, these films focus solely on shocking people. Now, I'm all for shocking people in horror films; it kind of comes with the territory, but this is not solely what horror is. I usually regard a horror film as successful when a certain feeling or scene stays with me for a day after seeing it, if it can indent the terror, maybe even play with your mind after viewing it, the film has done its job. Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare. However, with the release of The Orphanage it appears I should also keep my eye on Spain. When first looking at The Orphanage's plot outline I was less than enthralled, in fact I almost didn't watch it. I've never liked haunted house films, even The Shining failed to impress me, which is seen as one of the best horror films of all time by most people. Due to this I almost passed this film up, but I'm glad I didn't because I've finally found a haunted house film that I not only liked but also could sincerely call horror. After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't. <br/><br/>The plot has been done many times before and many of the characteristics of previous films find their way into this one. It tells the tale of a woman named Laura, who as a child lived in an orphanage for a number of years before being adopted. At thirty seven she brings her family back to her childhood home in hopes to turn the now abandoned house into an orphanage for the handicapped. Her son's innocent games with imaginary friends soon develop into something more serious and disturbing and everything starts going a bit strange Have you heard this one before? I'm sure you have, as you probably guessed the story involves strange paranormal happenings, ghosts, creeks in the floorboards and numerous other elements seen before. But even though you realise this while watching it, the knowledge that your watching a 'haunted house' film washes away and the film completely draws you into its story and world. This is done by taking everything about the genre that works well and simply focusing on making these elements the best they can possibly be without complicating things too much. For this the first time director Juan Antonio Bayona should be given huge credit. The film is perfectly paced, with the exact right amount of time spent at the beginning introducing the characters and making sure the audience is firmly rooted in Laura's character so that we experience everything with her as the film progresses. Due to this fine beginning everything in the film works much better for it, the scares have greater impact because we care what's happening to Laura and unlike some films they don't come at you in rapid succession. Like in a comedy where the joke is built up to the punch line, the scare is given enough support before scream moment and even though a lot of them have been done before, these ones actually genuinely scare. With there only being one location really used in the film, it appears the filmmakers had the time and resources to focus on using the house to create a natural atmosphere. Instead of showing off clever CGI effects and as much of the horror as possible, they opted for the subtle approach; creating suspense with excellent lighting and diverse camera work. This gives the film a more mysterious, realist feeling that helps make the film world that much more believable. One film you could quite rightly compare The Orphanage to is 2001's The Others. It has a very similar plot and almost the exact same setting, but for some reason it never affected me. This could be down to many reasons, but after watching The Orphanage I think the acting had a lot to do with it. Belén Rueda's performance as Laura is quite simply excellent. Like the direction she displays all the normal characteristics of a character, wrapped up in a surreal story during the course of the film; bewilderment, fear, insanity and all the other emotions a character must go though. But the reason why you care about her and feel so connected to her throughout the film is because she plays a mother perfectly. There is nothing more important to her than her son and she displays this so convincingly that when the end of the film hits, the affect of the conclusion resonates that much more because you feel the emotions that Laura feels. <br/><br/>All in all The Orphanage is one of the best horror films of recent memory; it takes the 'haunted house' device and uses it in a way I don't think any other film in recent memory has. The directing is a triumph and has great help from superb acting by Belén Rueda and a mature understanding of how to craft a horror film. The only real negative of the film is its complete lack of originally, which is unfortunate, but it does give you a top quality representation of what it borrows from. Therefore if you can get passed this flaw and you want an atmospherically rich, well-paced, scary horror film then this is you best bet for modern cinema."

""El orfanato"" (2007) is a picture successfully playing with this matter, putting it into focus.<br/><br/>While watching it you'll start to wonder... will there be some real explanation... or something else. Is the protagonist losing her mind... or is she right. What happened... and why ! Are you willing to believe in ghosts ? Or are you seeking for the real ? Either way you'll be able to experience this interesting Spanish/Mexican picture by J.A. Bayona in a different way !<br/><br/>The second fascinating thing to strike me in a positive way was the terrific interplay of sound, music and images. A frightening fusion. Music suddenly stops...voices appear...sounds... after a while I wasn't all too sure any more whether the sound was coming from the movie... or from outside... not a nice experience during a movie like this one ;).<br/><br/>So after all I clearly recommend ""El orfanato"". It's a wonderfully written, acted, visualized and directed deeply frightening horror drama. Perhaps one of the best of its kind and if you enjoyed ""The Others"" I'm guessing you'll enjoy that one too !"
"Hasnover","10","1","2","24 May 2009"," Best film in a long time.
","This was probably the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was definitely a psychological thrill. Everything was perfectly crafted, and all tied together in the most fantastic way. A movie done similarly could be The Ring, or One Missed Call. Each ties all the little seemingly meaningless details together into a beautifully crafted horror movie. Most horror is pop out scares, or slashers, but this movie is among the few that is genuinely creepy. The characters are deep and come to life on a screen, they all have their own psyche state, and this movie is very believable. Currently I have been on a Stephen King movie rampage, and while they are creepy, I haven't come across one where all the details tie together as masterfully. They are definitely scary, due to SK's exquisite writing, and ideas, but most of them have less of psychological ramifications, that a movie like the orphanage. I absolutely loved The Orphanage. Appologies if some of this isn't coherent, I am watching 1408 while typing this submission."

","Well,i watched this movie first reading on IMDb as to what a masterpiece it it.and i must say Am not Disappointed at all but inundated by the amount of effort put in to make such a classy piece of cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The movie talks about woman coming back to the orphanage where she has stayed,to recreate an environment for needy kids.her son is affected by a terrible disease,his son keeps telling about the invisible friends of his??but who are they??what do they want???you must watch the movie for that??don't wanna spoil it for you!!though it would seem the movie is inspired from greats like poltergeist etc.but there is something different which leave you in awe.<br/><br/>Take my word you must watch this won't be disappointed at all for people who like atmospheric horror rather than the gory kinds!"

","There isn't much to say about this film, you MUST see it!<br/><br/>If you, like me, loved El Laberinto del Fauno this is an awesome choice!<br/><br/>It was chilly as hell and really good script! I must admit though I didn't get any chocks but I didn't get that either when I saw the Exorcist so don't be surprised if you get scared! The story told is generally about a mother losing her child and her fight to retrieve him. You come to see some extreme situations that she is going through (some of them almost suicidal or might drive one crazy) in the belief that her son is still alive and that there is a way of getting him back.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm not going to spoil this masterpiece of Spanish horror so GO SEE IT!!! It must not be missed! It's B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!<br/><br/>enjoy the magic of the orphanage..."
"blackbahumut","9","1","2","19 February 2009"," An incredible movie and a good first impression on a new director
","I just recently saw this movie last night, and from my first time watching this movie, I'm glad to say that it is one of the better movie I have seen in a long time. My friend actually picked up this movie & we had no idea it was a gem until we saw it.<br/><br/>First off: i hate gory horror films. Those ones like Halloween and house of 1000 corpses (I'm looking at you Rob Zombie) just aren't inspiring at all. they're gross, not scary. El Orfanato is not one of those, and its great that they chose it to be that way. It's also not one of those movies with the stereotypical little girl crying blood or relieving themselves on the floor (RE: Silent Hill and the hills have eyes). So they did a good job on keeping the plot secretive until the end. horror flicks haven't had as much fun screwing with peoples minds since the original Saw.<br/><br/>the acting is great too. It never feels over the top, and the were no cheesy lines that are found in a typical movie. You really connect with the mother, you really want to know what happened to Simon but you can't. You really want to know what happened in the past, but YOU CAN'T. thats what I love about these movies. There's nothing you can do but watch and learn.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this movie is some of the little plot gaps, that don't really come into effect or just are not clear at all. For example, we realize that yes, all the children die except for Laura, but why? we figure out benigna poisoned them, but it never really explains why she did so, and why Laura was killed. I just went under the assumption that Laura was adopted, yet her foster parents play no role in the movie. And also Benigna looks way older that Laura. In the past, she may have looked like 15 years older than Laura (at the most), but in the present, Laura describes her in her ""70's"". I mean, this isn't a huge issue, but if this was explained in some more detail, like in some deleted scenes, it probably would have been good information to go by. but it doesn't hurt the plot.<br/><br/>as an IMDb score, 7.7 is a little bit lower than I would have wanted it to be. i would have given it a 8.3 or something. In terms of the movies I have seen, I would definitely give this a 9/10. It only loses the 1 point for the small plot pieces that weren't there.<br/><br/>so to sum this up: Plot (8) - good story, right down to the very end. I made a few assumptions to get the most out of the plot.<br/><br/>Acting (9) - You really connect with Rueda's character, and Cayo who plays Laura's husband, is a pretty good actor too.<br/><br/>Directing (10) - Expect Bayona to make more great movies. The fact he's friends with with del Toro makes him my hero. Plus it is his FIRST. well done Overall (not an average) : (9) Review by Justin Soucie, 2009"
"Foobarman","9","1","2","20 January 2009"," My favorite foreign movie!
","This is one of few movies I have watched from a different language - relying totally on English subtitles. i usually dislike movies in another language.<br/><br/>But this movie was GREAT. It was an excellent horror film which certainly deserves the 9/10 rating I gave it. The whole movie was great and the little boy with the mask was a great horror film 'scary character'.<br/><br/>I read about it in a magazine and instantly new it was a movie I had to watch. The plot, the setting and the acting was great. The movie had plenty of frights but the movie was still very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The ending was sad - but that didn't take away at all from the movie. It is certainly one of the best horror films of 2007. I didn't watch it in cinema so that probably made it less scary (cinema's play the movie very loud so you really get a fright at some parts of horror movies).<br/><br/>I strongly recommend you to watch this movie even if you don't like foreign films."
"mirwais-orbit","9","1","2","23 September 2008"," Another magnificent Spanish production
","The Orphanage fulfills what it promises. As well said, it is terrifying and beautiful.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of films, but I know few things about Spanish movies. Maybe that's why Spanish productions are surprising me a lot, because they always run away from some clichés that make Hollywood productions not as exciting as it should. The Orphanage is the truly example because the clichés of horror movies are present all the time, but the way these clichés are used throughout story is exactly what makes this movie out of what seems predictable.<br/><br/>It is difficult to talk about this movie without breaking surprises, so I will only say that this is already a classic of the genre in which it fits, even being difficult to fit it in a unique genre since the film is a blast of sensations: the audience laugh, cry, feel fear, compassion, anger, despair...<br/><br/>Unlike Pan's Labirynth - which is also a Spanish production that also mix intense feelings - it's not a movie for all kind of ages. Although the film looks beautiful in some parts, it's something only for adult audiences. The way story goes is kinda slow, but no tiring. If people pay attention for the details, they can understand the story as long before it reaches the end. The direction is quite efficient, and the performances - especially Belen Rueda - is magnificent throughout the film.<br/><br/>With no doubt, is a film that should have had a better promotion, and it should be seen by all movie lovers."
"Absyrd","9","1","2","15 July 2008"," Among the finest horror films of the decade
","The Orphanage is a film that should've been released years ago, because its plot and ghostly themes are so heavy-handed and overdone now, that not many of its genuine scares or innovative structure techniques come off as achieving. It certainly is the best film about creepy kids and haunted houses that I've seen, but after so many failures and low-brow ghost stories, the film comes across as a more polished version of those stories, than its own unique, intelligent movie, which is certainly would've felt like otherwise.<br/><br/>The film centers around Laura (played wonderfully by Belen Rueda), who has just moved into an old orphanage she grew up in with her adopted, ill son Simon, and faithful husband Carlos. Yes, Simon sees dead people. And plays with them. His concerned parents put up with his consistent ramblings about imaginary friends and treasure hunts. Laura and her husband privately discuss his physical and possibly mental illness, and their hopes for the future. After the ghosts reveal to Simon his illness (or did he overhear one of his parents conversations?), he disappears, and the couple descends into grief, but not without hope of finding him one day.<br/><br/>Laura then begins to see ghosts, but is she really seeing ghosts, or has she gone batsh-t insane? Are they trying to tell her something? Are they trying to frighten, confuse, relieve, or dispose of her? Did her son ever really exist? Does she exist? Does her husband exist? Really, the film doesn't resolve every one of its parallax or contradictory themes, it allows its viewer to interpret Laura's state of mind, to distinguish reality from insanity, and even to decide if some essential characters exist or not. I'd call it a fault if a film left absolutely everything up to the audience, but this film shows us both the paranoic/realistic and fantasy elements, and doesn't adopt either as its main viewpoint, but allows us to decide it all.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is masterwork. It's cinematography, pacing, structure, atmosphere, performances, all belong in tier 1 of film-making. There's one specific scene (One, Two, Three, Knock on the Wall) that is so perfectly shot and executed, it actually boosts up my entire rating by a point. Despite a mostly straightforward plot outline, it dives into more intricate plot elements, with simultaneously Peter-Pan-and-Thirteen-Ghosts-esquire themes, without diffusing or muddling either of them.<br/><br/>Overall, Del Toro has expertly made a very satisfying, chilling, and progressive horror story. Maybe not an inventive masterpiece, but a perfectly-executed version of what's recently become the same old cheap scares: creepy kids. And ghosts."
"Arenarocker05","9","1","2","10 July 2008"," A Well-Executed Ghost Story
","The Orphanage, presented by Guillermo Del Toro (not directed), is the most chilling and well-crafted ghost film I have seen in a very long time. The last great ghost film I saw was ""The Fog"" (The original by John Carpenter) and that was back in 1980. The story focuses on a family of three who move into an old orphanage that had once been the home of Laura, the mother. It becomes their new residence and for child who are mentally disabled. However during a party, Simon (the son of Laura) runs off into a mysterious cave and believes to have made a new friend that doesn't exist. After his conversations with the spirit become more crucial, strange events start to happen and secrets begin to unfold inside the haunted orphanage.<br/><br/>There was nothing about this film I didn't like. The acting, the thrills, the cinematography, the story, and the atmosphere. Everything was not short of sheer brilliance. The chilling moments freaked me out several times, which I'm glad they did. That was what I wanted out of this film, but I was offered so much in return. Since I knew Guillermo Del Toro was involved with this project, I had a feeling it would be good. I just didn't think it would be THIS good. It was also very heart-warming, which was something I did not expect. The bond that Laura, Simon, and Carlos (the father) shared is very sensitive and is carried out well throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those horror films you should see more than once. The horror films you see nowadays are weak, not scary, and most of all; not worth your time. This one is WORTH the time. Believe me, his film has absolutely everything you need to know on how to make a well-executed ghost story and more."
"commandercool88","8","1","2","8 July 2008"," A tale of love. A story of horror.
","A methodical and immensely creepy debut film from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, 'The Orphanage' is a unique brand of horror that has much more to offer than that which goes bump in the night. Though not without its fair share of convention, this nightmarish tale will give you a hair-raising jolt that feels all too rare these days.<br/><br/>Produced by the visionary Guillermo del Toro, newcomer Bayona and screenwriter Sergio Sanchez follow in Guillermo's footsteps as they mix in elements of the supernatural in order to tell a deeply human story of love and loss. 'The Orphanage' follows a woman who returns to the orphanage she grew up in to reopen it to a new set of kids who need special attention. Yet after her own child begins to make imaginary friends of his own, what starts out as a seemingly innocent fantasy becomes an all too real and hellish nightmare for one mother.<br/><br/>All that you've heard about this spooky ghost story is probably true. It is at times so intense and terrifying that you will be paralyzed with fear. But like so many other films of the genre that place cheap thrills above all else, 'The Orphanage' is deliberate in the way it gradually sets the mood and builds tension. The atmosphere becomes overwhelmingly thick with dread and anticipation. The orphanage, which during the day breathes with life and coziness, transforms into a dark and menacing being once the darkness takes over. These wonderful set designs and brooding cinematography help build the atmosphere and sense of fear so that when 'The Orphanage' does deliver the goods, it's all you can do to keep yourself from screaming in fright.<br/><br/>Beyond the thrills and threatening aura, there's an undeniably tragic and heartbreaking story about a desperate mother who will stop at nothing to find her son. When others around her persuade her to think rationally, the wonderful Belen Rueda embraces the fantastic and supernatural. It is these leaps of faith that provides some of the film's most climactic and spine-tingling moments, and it's clear that Bayona cares deeply for these film's characters. And although many elements of the story are familiar, there's an air of unpredictably that will keep you guessing into the very end. And when that finale arrives in a very unconventional fashion, you'll gasp.<br/><br/>This isn't a light movie to be forgotten, it's hard-hitting to the core. Thick with thrills and deep with human emotion, 'The Orphanage' will intoxicate you with so many disturbing elements coming at you from all directions. A great directorial debut and wonderfully poignant tale of cope.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"sergepesic","9","1","2","2 July 2008"," Love, grief and loss
","There are not very many good ghost stories these days. That seems to be a thing of the past. Movie makers of today are more prone to blowing things up or ripping body parts, like that really scares anybody. Every day on the news is more disturbing then any horror movie in our theaters. This beautiful movie is an exception. Filmed in warm, hazy shapes, with realistic characters that everyone can relate to. It doesn't scare you in obvious ways of less talented directors. "" The Orphanage"" grabs you and makes your heart flutter. And in the same time wraps you in a blanket of sadness.Love, grief and an incredible loss, three faithful companions. Lovely, touching movie that gets you under its spell."
"lagriff05","9","1","2","26 June 2008"," A ghost story for the mature.
","Such sophistication in ghost stories is rarely heard of, but Guillermo Del Toro manages to pull it off time and time again, and somehow he even managed to inject his magic into this one, which he only produced - as this very much plays out like one of his own films. Not to discredit Mr. Bayona, though, for he has done a fine job. This is a dark, powerful, and moving masterpiece that both adheres to convention and brings some new, more artistic elements to the table in the direction and storytelling.<br/><br/>One thing I like about this one (and Del Toro's previous masterpiece The Devil's Backbone) is that it takes horror-esquire plot lines and twist them into something much, much greater than a simple ghost/horror story. This has style and class all the way through, and every bit of it is tailored to a polished sheen. There is an emotional impact to this that you wouldn't expect in movies of its kind - usually in a ghost story, the emotional layer is pretty thin, but here it runs as deep as blood. Well written character dialogue only adds to the reasons why this is so good.<br/><br/>People will call this a generic ghost story, but those people aren't watching hard enough. The Orphanage may not pack as many jumpy, jittery moments as movies like The Ring, but it's not supposed to - this is a ghost story for the mature."

"dfle3","6","1","2","20 June 2008"," Interesting Spanish ""haunted house"" story...
","This is a Spanish language ""haunted house"" movie with some creepy moments. Belén Rueda plays Laura, who buys as a home with her husband, the orphanage which she used to live in, for a while, as a child. With her is her young son Simón, played by Roger Príncep. Simón has ""the shining"", if I can phrase it that way (a reference to another haunted house movie, ""The Shining"", which I've reviewed here too). What this means is that Simón seems to be able to perceive ghosts. Of course, the old orphanage has some dark secrets which hang darkly over Laura's new home. When Simón goes missing, you wonder how much credence to give the supernatural overtones of the movie.<br/><br/>There is some intellectual stimulation to be had in this movie...the mystery of the orphanage's dark secrets and the fate of Laura's boy. However, I did find myself not really connecting on an emotional level with the story. If you've ever watched the British sketch show ""The fast show"", you'll be familiar with the machine gun delivery of the Spanish language. Fortunately, the subtitles are a bit easier to follow!<br/><br/>Whether you are a sceptic or a believer in the paranormal, there is bound to be some redeeming features in this movie. I especially liked the 'pay off' at the end, re the eventual fate of Simón. The film is a bit enigmatic and will provide some fat to chew over after the ending. And that ain't bad.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a gore fest-it's more a psychological drama, and it has a 'slow burn' pacing to it, so bear that in mind if you see it. Creepy at times, and intriguing."

","This was a rather appropriate film to see on Friday the 13th! 'The Orphanage' centers around a mother, Laura, who moves in to an old disused orphanage, with her husband Carlos and young son Simon, to renovate it and hopefully use it to take care of sick and disabled children . Laura was partly raised in the orphanage but was adopted out at a young age. This is all I should tell you about the film as there is much to be uncovered and quite a few surprises in the course of the story. There were many times during the course of the film I felt a tense and tingling fear creep through my body and the film moves from creepy to macabre to horrifying. The performances are splendid, particularly from Belen Rueda who plays Laura. And it was a pleasure to see the great (and unfortunately rarely seen) Geraldine Chaplin playing a psychic in one of the film's best scenes. Go see this film if you dare!"

","A few months ago, I had heard little things here and there about The Orphanage, how it was a new scary movie by the famous presenter Guillermo del Toro who also directed Hellboy and Pans Labyrith. So you know there's going to be death and scary kids in the movie. Seeing this movie however, wasn't so easy, one of my co-workers saw the movie and said that it was really good, unfortunately I couldn't find it in any local theater, so I had to wait for the rental, which I got this week and watched The Orphanage today, this was truly a great ghost story. It was definitely more original than most, considering it wasn't relying on the jumps to get you screaming, it was noise, the surroundings, the actors, the story, it just gets you all up in your nerves.<br/><br/>Laura grew up in an orphanage, but was adopted, she later in life takes over the orphanage with her husband and adopted son, Simon. She plans to re-open the place and offer it to other children. But when Simon tells Laura that he's made some new friends, friends that she assumes are imaginary are actually ghosts that are haunting Simon, causing strange behavior and scary noises to occur in the house. But Simon and Laura get into a fight, when Laura goes to find Simon, he's completely disappeared and Laura must find clues to unlock the mystery of the orphanage.<br/><br/>This is not only one of the best foreign films I've seen, it's one of the better ghost stories. There is no Hollywood effects, this all takes back to when the writers cared and respected their audience enough to give them credit on their imagination. I just loved the ending, how it gave a different twist than what we are normally used too, you'll have to see what I mean because I totally recommend this movie to anyone. It's classy, well acted and presented, this is going to be a classic in the future.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Scarecrow-88","8","1","2","26 May 2008"," The Orphanage
","Laura's(Belén Rueda) beloved HIV positive adopted son, Simón(Roger Príncep) disappears and if she wishes to find him, will have to play a game with the ghosts of children she once knew as a little orphan girl, the victims of a secret tragedy. While those around her consider Laura's quest for the location of her son, through some idea that ghost children know where he's located, a lost cause, she will do whatever it takes to find him. Carlos(Fernando Cayo), a doctor, tries, to no avail, convincing his wife Laura to abandon a foolhardy search that so often yields few answers. Yet, as she pursues Simón's whereabouts, horrifying truths about those children she once knew surface. This film follows Laura through the clues the children leave behind. The setting is at an orphanage, the very one Laura once lived as a child, for which she hoped to raise mentally handicapped kids.<br/><br/>I guess the R-rating is for a minor few displays of disturbing images(..such as a key character's facial damage after being hit by a truck, a fingernail removal, & a broken bone protruding from the skin of Laura's leg)which is a shame because this is actually a rather harmless ghost story regarding a woman's endless search for the son she adores. Dogged and determined, despite how others try to convince her that the mission was fleeting, Laura's pursuit brings such an emotional depth to this, and kudos goes to the performance of Rueda as the mother. I think Rueda brings that key mixture of motherly paternal love and warmth definitely needed and it's important that we care about this search..the film hinges on our desire for her being rewarded. Although, the reward she receives may not be the way we would intend it to be, in the traditional sense, but it certainly packs an emotional wallop thanks in part to Rueda. Cayo, as the suffering husband who wishes to find their son, yet soon loses faith of ever finding him, while trying to heal, I think does a good job at pointing out how most of us, looking at the situation from a more grounded realistic view, would probably react to Laura's demand to continue. The film shows the influence of Guillermo del Toro as director Bayona obviously received a few pointers in the style because he has a visual command that beautifully swept me off my feet in how he photographs the film. This will try more impatient viewers because Bayona's film is a slow-burner, building the mystery, as layers are unpeeled. There's a creepy sequence with a medium, trying to find what is plaguing the orphanage, that I thought works really well, summoning the spirit of ""The Changeling"". Other than the orphanage itself, the director makes good use of a lighthouse and beach-front as well."

","""The Orphanage"" was less a horror film and more a dramatic thriller. There were only a few scary moments and the rest was a suspenseful drama dealing with some pretty serious subject matter. <br/><br/>Although it was very predictable, the eerie sense of dread lingering throughout the film kept me interested in how the story would unfold. The acting was above the current industry standard (which doesn't say much, really) but the film as a whole was really no better than any good Hollywood thriller like ""The Sixth Sense."" There were numerous holes in the plot, but I gave them their creative license and enjoyed the film for what it was worth. I felt as if it is getting such good reviews simply because it has subtitles which somehow legitimizes it.<br/><br/>I'm rating it with a high ""7"" because at least they didn't rely on unnecessary scare tactics to keep the audience placated.

"broncoboy7","2","2","8","2 November 2013"," One hour of tension that fell apart at the end...
","I watched this movie in a Film History class for Halloween, and while it was a fairly good movie, it did not live up to the hype of the 'use the facilities before you watch' or the 'this film is so scary...'. In my opinion, this film (as it stands) should be a drama, not a horror film. The number of scenes where I actually jumped in this movie can be counted on one hand, and I felt let down when I left, not terrified. The first half of the movie was mostly back-story and tension building, as expected, but the second half, instead of scaring the (expletive) out of me, dissipated then tension not with a murder or a huge scare, but with an uplifting, happy ending. <br/><br/>Short version of the second half: The mother (Laura) has been searching for her son for a year, and is beginning to believe in the ghosts that her son claimed to see. This drives the dad crazy, to the point of him leaving the house for 2 days, leaving her with the ghosts. She discovers that Benigna murdered all of the children after Tomas' death, and after playing ""One, Two, Three, Konck on the Wall"", the ghost children that she summons lead her to a secret door in the closet that leads to a stereotypical horror basement, flickering light and all. The viewer thinks: ""Major jump scare coming!"" or ""She is so dead..."", but instead, in Twilight Zone fashion, she believes she has found her son (alive), and after a dizzying camera sequence, realizing he is dead, and that she killed him by shifting the poles in the closet. At this point it appears that justice has been served, and you can almost hear Rod Serling's voice in the background, delivering a 'Twilight Zone' closing line. Instead, she carries the body to the orphans' room upstairs, where she screams for her son back, and she gets her wish. She commits 'implied' (not shown) suicide, and the lighthouse comes on, and all of the dead children join Laura and her son's spirits in the 'afterlife'. During this ordeal, she drops a necklace that her husband gave her. Cut to: future dad comes back to house with flowers for their grave, and decides to explore house. At this point, you think, ""Oh, that dad is dead, jump scare coming up!"", but no, the dad goes to the same room, and finds the dropped necklace, and the film goes to credits. <br/><br/>Feel let down, huh? You should. <br/><br/>This film didn't have enough jump scare to be a jump scare movie (i.e., Insidious, Paranormal Activity). It didn't have enough gore to be a bloody horror movie (The Cabin in the Woods). And, it ended on an uplifting note, preventing it from being a 'Twilight Zone""-y, psychological horror movie. All in all, I would have to say that it should be a drama with a couple 'spooky' bits. This categorization as a horror film is a mistake, and it costs the movie big time. If this were called a drama, then it would probably be 6-8 stars. The acting, writing, and directing aren't bad, and the subtitles are surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Summary: Not a terrible movie, just don't expect a horror film."

","Once again I've fallen in love with a Spanish Horror movie. Directed by Juan A. Bayona and produced by Guillermo Del Toro, The Orphanage impresses with its cold and gloomy atmosphere. Despite the fact there are ghosts included, the movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares but rather on its touching story and dark elements. Beautiful cinematography and a plot twist are only a few of many positives. A strong lead performance made me genuine feel for the the characters. The Orphanage is a prime example of less being more. Without a doubt a modern Horror classic. I would even recommend this movie to people who aren't that fond of the genre."

","I have seen many horror movies, but in this genre this will remain one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. To me it shares the same spot with pan's labyrinth on the top. On a wonderful story the acting from the cast is brilliant. The story starts to build slowly but it's the beauty that when you go inside the groove it becomes the different experience altogether. I like atmospheric movies and man the atmosphere of the movie is bone chilling and creepy yet beautiful. The colour of this movie is greyish which depicts the mood of the ordeal Laura was going through.There is nothing over the top in this movie. It's a sheer pleasure to watch it at any time. The ending in particular is awesome and it memory remains with you for a long time after this movie. This is the second time I have watched this movie and it still feels fresh. I could not believe that this is Bayona's directorial debut. If this is the start then I would like to see more films from him. Hats off to this movie. It will remain one of my all time favourite :)."

","Excellent movie! Amazing. I was really moved, touched, crying. This can easily be included in my best 10 movies of all time. No doubts. Interestingly that I was searching for a horror movie through various top horror movies reviews and found this to be watchable because it was made by makers of Labirinto del Fauno, which is another one great movie though a little bit different. I was expecting less satisfaction than from Pan's Labirynth because rarely someone creates two great movies in a row, but this was not the case. Everything is well done, well planed, well combined - acting, characters, music, scenes, visualizations. I would not say it's a horror movie, because it's more about dark sides of our life and an endless love.. a must see! You will like it to, if the world of your inner feelings can grab it."

","The Orphanage a horror/thriller/mystery film produced by Guillermo Del Toro, is about a woman named Laura who returns to the orphanage she grew up in to start a care home for disabled children herself with her husband and adopted child. However, on the visiting day for care home, her son, Simon, goes missing after she encountered a clash with a strange boy with a cotton mask on his head. Throughout the film she is determined to find her adopted son and comes across mysterious encounters across the way. The film's tense atmosphere throughout leaves you confused and wanting to find out the answer to this twisted mystery. Even though it gives of a tense and 'edge of your seat' atmosphere, the ending of the story is quite disappointing as the horror side of the genre isn't touched much leaving you left with more of a thriller/mystery genre film. Overall, the film has a well wrote story line wanting you to watch more however the horror aspect fails to impress the viewer."

","Bone chilling terrors with a hint of the fantastic await audiences who dare to enter The Orphanage. Produced by Guillermo Del Toro, The Orphanage continues the tradition the filmmaker started with films like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, by showing the darker sides of humanity through frightening fantasies. In many ways Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has applied Del Toro's own winning formula to The Orphanage and has made the most flawless film of this lineage. The bad point about the film was that it is in Spanish which makes you have to concentrate when you want to relax and watch it. The film has a very good, mysterious ending making it an all-round good film."

","Wow. I have waited a twenty-some years for another great ghost story. Ever since I saw THE CHANGLING (1980 - starring George C. Scott) I have longed for another movie that could make me feel the way that movie did. Some have come close, but THE ORPHANAGE is the first to really do it.<br/><br/>Clearly this is not a slash and gore film. No sex scenes, no half clothed twenty-somethings running through the woods/hallway/whatever until they fall and are slaughtered, no swearing; none of the cliché horror tactics (not to say this is all not fun in the right movie). This is classic and tasteful and will leave you both thinking about it and retaining feelings about it long after the movie ends."

"Buddy-51","8","1","3","13 October 2010"," top-notch Spanish horror film
","""The Orphanage"" offers proof positive that quality filmmaking can triumph over even the tritest of themes. In bare outline, it's really just the oldie about the family that moves into a creepy older establishment – in this case an abandoned orphanage with a very dark past – only to be hounded by the spirits of the people who died there under horrific circumstances. Laura (Belen Rueda) is a woman who was herself raised there as a child and who has now returned with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep), to open a home for disabled children. In no time flat, however, things begin going bump in the night, and Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances. Could the souls of the children who died there be trying to contact the living, and could they be using Simon as a means of achieving that end? <br/><br/>Anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of how such stories normally play themselves out should have no trouble divining the answers to those questions. But in his debut as a director, Juan Antonio Bayona demonstrates a real flair for the macabre, so that every haunted-house-movie cliché – every creaking door, every sudden apparition – that comes our way seems somehow new and fresh again. Perhaps it's the artful imagery, the fluid camera-work, or the highly effective soundtrack – or all three combined - that account for the movie's effectiveness. Whatever it is, Bayona is able to imbue even the most mundane object – a playground ride, a child's doll – with the utmost menace and dread.<br/><br/>At times, the film seems to be channeling some of the ""greats"" of the genre, namely ""The Innocents,"" ""The Omen,"" ""Poltergeist"" (especially with its high-tech ghost-hunters and creepy psychic played by Geraldine Chaplin), and the original version of ""The Haunting."" And because of the quality of the work here, the movie emerges more as an homage to those earlier classics than a slavish imitation of them.<br/><br/>People may be divided over the story's resolution – finding it either immensely satisfying or unnecessarily corny – but no one can deny that, for genuine thrills and suspense, ""The Orphanage"" is one of the better horror movies of the past several years."

It has a great story-line, beautifully acted with a few shocks and turns thrown in to keep you hooked and enthralled.

","A brief historical review: First there is Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. Despite knowing how it turns out it is still a film worthy of seeing numerous times because Hitchcock was the master at keeping his stories compelling and taut. Next comes 'The Sixth Sense' which was good once, but like the old but well-loved EC comics of the 50s, it wasn't absorbing enough to make an individual tolerate multiple viewings. Knowing the ending essentially jaded the rest of the film. Somewhere in between is 'The Orphange'. Although not quite as gripping as Hitchcock it does come very close. It's about a woman who buys the orphanage she lived in as an orphaned child, make it a home for her family (husband and adopted son), and to open it to other orphans. Along the way the spirits of the home are prodded and begin interacting. Despite my version being Spanish with subtitles, it was very easy to follow. In fact, that was what I appreciated most - it was a very well-written story. 'Intelligent' would be another choice word. It seems to remain a very strict haunted house tale at first then it slides slowly and quite pleasantly into a tear-jerking fantasy near the end. The twists and turns in the plot reveal themselves more clearly. You get a similar sense of revelation a la 'The Sixth Sense' but instead of groaning loudly at the surprise you will be more pleased. You may even say 'Wow'. You won't feel like you've been misdirected intentionally. You will be elated with the journey.<br/><br/>Warning: There are a few brief disturbing scenes that can make even veteran viewers of this genre wince. NOT FOR THE EASILY UPSET!<br/><br/>Bottomline: I've seen other films of Guillermo del Toro and found myself enjoying them. This one put his name on my map and I wait eagerly for future entries. Intelligent, definitely spooky, surprisingly tender and moving - many will find tears running down their face (their own of course) All of the elements - acting, music, cinematography, editing, music, etc. work. Even the tried-and-true standard creaks and bumps were effective. THUMBS UP!"

Here she has to deal with an adopted child who suddenly takes off during a birthday party.

Basically former orphan Laura (Belén Rueda) with husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) move into an old house, an abandoned orphanage where Laura herself was raised. Simón is HIV positive, and only has five invisible friends to comfort him, obviously Laura just sees them as a figment of her son's imagination. Laura decides to reopen the house as an orphanage for handicapped children, not paying much attention to Simón, until she sees a mysterious masked boy, and her son vanishes. Laura has been feeling an invisible presence in the house, and after months invites ghost experts to investigate, in hope to get her son back. When they and husband Carlos are out the way though, she realises the ghosts of the children are playing some sort of game, so she plays along, and it seems to work, she gets Simón back, only to die and have their names put on a memorial. Also starring Montserrat Carulla as Benigna, Geraldine Chaplin as Aurora, Mabel Rivera as Pilar, Andrés Gertrúdix as Enrique, Edgar Vivar as Prof. Leo Bálaban and Óscar Casas as Tomás. Even if this film was in English not Spanish, I don't think it would really jump out at me, it wasn't all that scary or thrilling, but I guess it an alright supernatural mystery. Worth watching!"

","Del Torro is a fine director, and having seen 'Pan's Labyrinth' recently, my expectations of 'The Orphanage' were high. It certainly did not disappoint. Although I would not describe it as an out an out horror film, it certainly has its 'jumpy' moments. The 'Final Destination'-esqe moment in particular made me swear out loud in shock. The story is beautiful and touching - the wife admitted to choking back the tears at the end. I read one negative review on here that compared the film unfavourably with 'The Others'. I personally found 'The Others' to be a terrible film, so predictable and unimaginative - I caused great consternation in the cinema when I loudly said 'well he's blatantly dead!' revealing the films mega-obvious twist long before it ever got round to spelling it out for the less perceptive viewers. In contrast, while 'The Orphanage' panned out more or less how I expected it to, there were still elements of the ending that were like the final pieces of a puzzle falling satisfyingly into place. The cinematography was aesthetically pleasing as you would expect, and the acting performances were of the highest quality. No doubt I could sit here and pick holes in the plot, but that would be pointless as any weak points did not detract from the overall impact of a highly recommended movie."
"gentendo","8","1","3","1 February 2009"," A Ghost Story for Peter Pan
","I really liked how writer Sergio G. Sanchez took the tale of Peter Pan and loosely adapted it around a ghost story about lost children. The way he paralleled the story of Pan to his own wasn't overt, but subtleas if it merely augmented a richer meaning behind the story of the lost boys. In the case of The Orphanage, the story is about lost childrenboth boys and girls. <br/><br/>In one aspect, the story's subtext is about piratesthose who search for buried treasure. Sanchez provides a series of clues (i.e. images/scenes) for the audience themselves to become pirates as they, too, piece together these cluesone by onein order to obtain the treasure of the overall story: its meaning. In other words, there is no seemingly pointless images/scenes/dialogue in this film. Everything is used as a clue to help the audience embark on a pirate's quest for buried treasure. <br/><br/>For example, the scene where Simon and Laura go on a treasure hunt to find Simon's coins sets up the story parallel between Peter Pan and the story that grew from itThe Orphanage. Simon tells his mother that his imaginary friends (e.g. the lost children) stole his coins and hid them. If he is successful in following the clues and retaining his coins, his friends will grant him a wish. She doesn't believe him but humors him anyway. It's interesting that Laura only begins to believe in her son's imaginary friends when something she holds precious (i.e. her son) is taken from her. It reminded me of how easy it is to lose the gift of believing when you become an adult. Adults typically have the tendency to treat most things with weary, skeptical eyes. <br/><br/>The challenge, then, is for adults to reclaim that sacred treasure of believing. Sadly, however, they usually have to be threatened with death before they start believing. In Laura's case, she must be threatened with the possibility that her son is dead before she starts a serious investigation to find her sonto find the qualities she used to possess as a child. Another example that helps the viewer become a pirate looking for treasure is when the orphans play the game of ""1, 2, 3, knock on the wall."" It seems like a somewhat arbitrary game to play, but it actually helps provide a clue that foreshadows a later scene when Laura attempts to summon the orphans back from the dead. She needs to talk to the orphans that haunt her house because she feels they can help lead her to her son. <br/><br/>The trick, though, is that in order for her to get what she wants, she has to help the orphans get what they wantand what they want is a mother to care for them. Laura is like Wendy of Peter Pan; a girl who left the Neverland orphanage when she was young, grew up, lost her child-like imagination and stopped believing in fantasies. When she left the orphanage, she left her friendsshe died (e.g. separated) from them. It's as if her friends are now haunting her because they're asking her to awaken herselfstart believing againbut most importantly, to be a mother to themlike Wendy of the lost boys. The only way they are able to make their plight strong enough for Laura to understand is by placing what she values most in jeopardy. Only then will she be prepared to accept the responsibility of caring for the lost children, because she would then know what it's like to lose a child. The lost children have lost a motherhave lost a person to care for them. It's really quite a profound story when you think about it. <br/><br/>It is the story of a person losing something as valuable as buried treasure; then going on a journey to reclaim that treasure by following clues along the way; gaining a deep sense of empathy in the process; finding that treasure in the end, and finally, taking on the role of Sheppardcaring for those around you who are currently lost and looking for treasure. Though the specifics of what we treasure may differ from person to person, I think it's safe to say that we all have taken this journey, and are yet currently in the process of searching for what we value most. Because of these things, The Orphanage is a story that is universally applicable to all."

OK there were a couple of slow parts in the film, but these were quickly overshadowed by the positives. Having your child kidnapped by the supernatural is a scary premise for a film and it really adds that uneasy feel to the movie. There are some beautifully touching moments in this film, and the desperation of the mother to find her son when nobody believes the ghost of the children have taken them makes compelling viewing.<br/><br/>This is rounded off by a beautiful ending, a happy / tragic compromise that admittedly did make me shed a tear.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A woman named Laura has returned, with her husband and child, Simon, to the house that was her home, an orphanage, when she was a little girl. She has restored it to be their home and a residence for disabled children. Her son, Simon, has an exuberant imagination and an unquenchable curiosity, and he has made his invisible friends a household presence for his parents. At their new, beautiful though isolated house, the kid seems to have found more invisible friends... or are they? Such is the starting point of ""El orfanato"", the new gem produced by Spanish cinema and Guillermo del Toro. It is categorized under the horror label, but, although it is horror, it is also so much more -it allows the viewer to enjoy an almost perfect ghost story, with the added leitmotiv of a superimposed story of a mother who would do anything for her child, led by an unconditional love. The story has it all: good scares, a creepy atmosphere, and great acting by the leading actors, with Belen Rueda shining at her best here. As far as the scary parts go, I can say that this movie has some of the scariest scenes I've seen in a long time, and that it will please fans of psychological and atmospheric horror rather than gore-lovers.<br/><br/>The ending is very satisfying -although I personally object to the kind of brief epilogue at the very end, which was, in my opinion, not only unnecessary but also demeaning of the value of the film- and many sides of the story will remain open to interpretation, although one reading is suggested by the movie, but if you are looking for a movie that will stick with you and make you look for answers, without necessarily being an impossible puzzle, this is a safe bet.<br/><br/>All in all, ""El orfanato"" doesn't tell anything very new or original, it doesn't really break any new grounds as far as the story goes, but its contribution is to tell it all with exquisite style and great manners, so that it tells you a good story in a superior way than other movies of the same subgenre."

","I'm not usually a big fan of scary movies but Spanish movie The Orphanage (El Orfanato) is so well made, such a classy movie, that I found myself riveted to my seat even as I was chilled. I saw it first in the theatre then rented the DVD later to see it again, not something I often do. This is a very good example of how to make a deeply disturbing film with barely a drop of blood and no gore. It's produced by Guillermo del Toro, director of Pan's Labrinth, and similar themes of childhood imagination are revisited. <br/><br/>Laura (Belen Rueda) spent her early years in The Orphanage, a large remote house near the beach in northern Spain, where she lived with a small group of other children and her caregivers. But she was adopted at quite a young age and left her friends behind, losing touch with them. As an adult, she moves back to the now unoccupied house with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son Simon (Roger Princep) with the intention of setting up a small care home for mentally disabled children. Simon is an only child and he lacks playmates so he invents imaginary friends, but soon after they move in to the house, strange things start to happen; an elderly lady masquerading as a social worker visits and is later found ransacking the storage shed, the house is filled with creepy noises, and Simon insists that he can see a group of children in the house, that his friends are not imaginary but real. Simon wants his mother to visit the 'little house' of his friend Tomas but she dismisses it as childhood fantasy. Then, at an open day for the new care home, Simon disappears completely. <br/><br/>Months and months go by but there is no sign of what happened to Simon. The police have no clues but the old lady who visited the house is run over in the street, and an investigation reveals that she once worked at the orphanage. Who was she and what happened to Laura's friends after she left the orphanage as a child, and most importantly, what happened to Simon? How can a child disappear without trace? Lacking police leads, Laura is drawn to a psychic in a desperate attempt to find Simon. Her husband is equally desperate but warier of being conned. The Orphanage shows the fine line between the supernatural and mundane reality; sometimes a creaking house is just that, a creaking house, and ghosts are all in the mind. But overwhelmed with despair, Laura, certain that something terrible has happened in the past, decides to try and recreate that past, in a last desperate attempt to communicate with her childhood friends and find her child. The ending is satisfactory although sad. <br/><br/>What makes The Orphanage work for this scary movie skeptic is the excellent standard of the performances and the atmospheric mood of the film. It is rarely 'jump out of your seat' type scary, more bone chillingly dark and moody, taking us back to a time when to be a disabled child often meant a lonely and unhappy life, rejected by society. Overall, very good."
"crey014","8","1","3","24 July 2008"," ...The film's comparison... (to) older brother ""El Fauno del Laberinto"" is unwarranted...""El Orfanato"" might be guilty of producing half-empty calories.
","Juan Antonio Bayona directs the above average ghost story ""El Orfanato"". Produced by creature-feature maestro Guillermo del Toro, picture derives a substantial amount from del Toro's previous work, specially its sense of dread and an ending that isn't far from the Oscar nominated ""El Fauno del Laberinto"". ""El Orfanato"" may not be as rich in themes and undertones as ""Labertino"", but audiences will be healthily rewarded by a horror story driven by plot and consequence.<br/><br/>Film focuses on Ofelia (Belen Rueda), a husband to Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and a mother to Simon (Roger Princep), as she ventures back to her old orphanage after being adopted an odd 30 years ago. Returning to start her own orphanage for special children, she slowly uncovers what happened to her friends (and discovers some more) when she left, and of course, complications arise when Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances. Film takes its time to tell the story and brazen enough to use suspense and not cheap frights to liven up the proceedings.<br/><br/>Directed with confidence, ""El Orfanato"" remains atmospheric until its very last shot. Bayona effortlessly steers clear from a run-in-the-mill horror story, but would rather line the film to movies like ""The Others"" and ""The Shining"", to tease the audience of the possible doom that may arise. This exercise pays dividends as tiny scenes from the first half of the movie eventually resurfaces at the last act to produce some truly sinister goings on. Creaky swing sets moving with the wind among others, further attribute to the what-might-be-out-there vibe the film possesses.<br/><br/>When the main protagonist becomes desperate and seeks out a clairvoyant to help with the search, the movie effortlessly screams terror  definitely one of the film's highlights. Basically begging for the audience to sit up and listen, it becomes a pivotal point in the story as it brings everything up to a boil and pushes the film to the worthy finale. Hints of skepticism from a police investigator and Carlos are especially welcome here.<br/><br/>Another movie that tries to erase the line between fantasy and reality, the film ends on a lighter note as we discover the function of the ghoulish apparitions. Del Toro needs to consider a patent with this technique as it is about one movie close to being cliché. It might even beg the question: what came first, the chicken or the egg? Gladly though, protagonist Ofelia is empathetic enough as the maternal figure, that an audience member weary of such ending would easily be forgiving. Final two scenes involving Carlos should definitely have been excised.<br/><br/>Wrapped in a more mainstream packaging even with a foreign language, ""El Orfanato"" delivers the goods as a ghost story. However, the film's comparison to the much more complicated, sophisticated and intelligent older brother ""El Fauno del Laberinto"" is unwarranted, as in contrast to that, ""El Orfanato"" might be guilty of producing half-empty calories. Nevertheless, the movie deserves attention as a well-crafted story about motherly instincts and its blurry altruistic boundaries."
"Red_Flag","8","1","3","27 April 2008"," Spanish chiller reminiscing to classics like the Haunting, truly outstanding.
","You wouldn't believe how refreshing it is to sit down a watch a horror movie that doesn't fully rely on gore to thrill. We are living in an age where this so called ""Gorno"" rules the horror genre and to be perfectly honest I'm pretty sick of it. Fortunately ""The Orphanage"" is set to end this vicious cycle once and for all. A genuinely terrifying thriller that knows its audience. Using the traditional ""ghost story"" plotting for its devilish games. The brilliant thing is that this is a horror movie that generates character sand raw emotion allowing its audience to be captivated by its powerful presence.<br/><br/>Unfairly dubbed as ""The new Pans Labyrinth"" giving it a lot to live up to. As far as far as I'm concerned this is a timeless horror classic. Filled with jump out of your skin moments and truly hair raising suspense. Not to mention the tear jerker of an ending that will have even the most stubborn of viewer trying to avoid crying. For such a typical and worn story it's a wonder how Juan crafted so many original plot twists and moments of shock when you would naturally think you know the tricks of the trade.<br/><br/>Rueda character Laura is not only fully relatable but also very human, far from your typical blond provided by most horror flicks our generation gives us. She is a late-thirty something who returns - along with her husband Carlos and adopted son Simon  to the rundown home for orphans she grew up in. She wants to re-open it as a home for kids with special needs, but she discovers her old friends might never have left as Simon is soon playing with new invisible friends.<br/><br/>After an unnerving visit from a gaunt old lady, and untimely revelation and argument with her son, Laura's plan gets suddenly knocked awry by his disappearance. It flows beautifully, though that just might be the British perception of foreign films, the language used almost makes the film seem like a poem. That and rather haunting imagery used throughout. I remember recently buying a Spanish film of a similar nature. Guillermo Del Toro's The Devils Backbone and after seeing this realizing how great a double bill would be. What the devils backbone lack in shocks The Orphanage provides. Visa versa with plot.<br/><br/>Therefore I do recommend you seeing The Devils Backbone before you view this only that way will you know whether you're going to like The Orphanage or not. My verdict is that if you were to miss this year's ""Pans Labyrinth"" then shame on you. Filled with unforgettable images and genuine horror.<br/><br/>This is for anyone who is sick of seeing the same old gore porn being produced each year. Don't Miss."

","It's a Spanish ghost story and whilst not a horror film in my opinion it certainly has creepy moments in it but there is also a lot of emotion, it's very sad. It lacks the imagination of either Pan's Labyrinth or The Devil's Backbone, Guillermo Del Toro ""presents"" it according to the credits and his influence is certainly there. Did i hear it was the director's first feature film? Impressive if it is. For me the story suffers from being too predictable - if there were any twists they didn't seem as such to me. Due to the emotion in the story though i think it's a film which will stay in your mind a long time. It will be interesting to see how the English language remake turns out, Del Toro is on board so hopefully it won't be spoilt. Go see this version if you can find it on anywhere, one cinema in the whole of West Yorkshire is currently showing it.... (sigh)."

","A woman and her family (husband and young son) buy an old disused orphanage. The woman lived there as a kid and wants to return the orphanage to its former glory by reopening it as a safe shelter for disabled children. As they are living there her sons imagination starts running wilder and wilder and by soon he has a number of imaginary friends. Soon after the trouble gets even worse and it is clear that there are more things happening than meet the eye.<br/><br/>Combining a touch of drama with a good bit of mystery and a hint of horror is a dangerous thing, but this film proves that it can be done and can be done with style. The scenery is great - a spooky old house, the waves crashing onto the beach, a broken down playground, etcetera - combine into a well designed image that make the effects of the film stronger. The touching on the grim reality inside orphanages in the past adds to this too.<br/><br/>The film asks a lot of questions and answers only a few of them. In the end one is left with one big one: what is real? And in reality it doesn't matter: either way you look at it it works out. And that is what makes the film so well, it has gone the distance and made a story and explanation that adds up for both the cynics and the believers.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 horrific events"

","""The Others"" was not a horror movie, and neither is this.<br/><br/>There were hardly any scary moments.

This ISN'T horror. It's just not.<br/><br/>I enjoy a movie like this, though. I'm not a huge fan of violence/gore, so I was glad that there was almost none of it in this film. It wasn't exactly suspenseful, but it *was* very atmospheric and, at times, creepy. The acting was top-notch, too.<br/><br/>A first-rate ghost story; definitely worth watching. You will not be disappointed if you're a fan of ghost movies/psychological thrillers, and if you liked ""The Others"".<br/><br/>But you *will* be disappointed if you expect gore/violence or scary/disturbing moments (like in Japanese horror movies) -- there's none of that here."
"davidtraversa-1","6","1","4","29 September 2012"," Quite enjoyable.
","I loved Belén Rueda in ""Los ojos de Julia"", being that the reason for my watching this movie, since she portrays the main character and in a way this movie is very similar to that one, having the same kind of dark atmosphere and somber photography.<br/><br/>The gloomy mansion and the Asturian climate with those rainy days and nights, the wild vegetation and night noises make a perfect envelope for this sad tale, where the child (Roger Príncep, adorable) will take center place as the motive for the development of the storyline.<br/><br/>Almost from the beginning this is a movie for believers in ghosts, apparitions, mediums, etc. If you don't believe in those issues, the whole thing becomes quite diluted and shallow, since in reality we only have a case with hard facts for the police news and very little else (unless, as I said before, if you believe in ghosts, it could be quite terrifying).<br/><br/>It's a very enjoyable movie, very well directed, played, and edited; the photography, excellent as the music, and there are a couple of hair raising scenes very well staged. I recommend it, specially to watch it alone at midnight in an empty house in the solitary countryside."

","This is one of those films that as you watch it you realise that it is pulling you in and keeping you glued to the screen. The story is a classic creepy ghost story that keeps you on edge waiting for something to happen. The acting is great and even though it is subtitled, you can feel and understand what each character is going through. Some people are put off films with subtitles and it is those people who miss out on some truly great films and end up seeing second rate American re-makes (think Ring etc). Do not make the mistake with this film. If you want a film where the story is told in a classic story telling way, with twists and turns, then this is it.

If Bayona does a work again, as I will definitely do, I fully advise you to try to see it without asking any questions as if it's good or not. Because it will definitely will be a great one! This film is amazing and its atmosphere reminded me Pan's Labyrinth. A world that based on children fantasies is always an interesting theme to use and show.

","I watched this one in the sneak preview, not too long ago. Ever since I'm telling everyone who wants to hear it, to watch this movie. Why? Well, first of because it's the very first time in like 11 years a movie managed to frighten me so much, I had to scream. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Asian horrors like Ringu and The Eye (SO I DO NOT MEAN THOSE TERRIBLE REMAKES!!!) because they are working in your mind. Unlike America, whose obviously trying to scare you with visual effects, Asian horror is crawling deep inside your psyche, making you nervous, like you feel the need to look over your shoulder constantly. They don't depend on make-up and let's be honest, can you really be scared by some zombie who's walking like 5 miles per hour, with the make-up falling from his face? I'm not scared one bit by them. So that's where Asian horror is far better than American horror. But then there's El Orfanato. This one doesn't depend on make-up either, nor does it depend on computer animation like many ghost stories of American origin do. So that's one big plus, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Then there's the music. They make very good use of music and timing, just like those freaky Asian dudes. So again: America has to watch and learn. Listen and learn. <br/><br/>And then there's this story. At first sight it doesn't look like much of a great story and in fact it isn't, it's the same old, same old, but even though it's not that great, they manage to work it out completely magnificent. The story in fact is kind of cliché and when you read it, I bet you don't have great expectations of this movie and I can't blame you, but once you've watched it to the end, I hope you'll agree with me and say: Wow! I'm totally blown away! It's just... well how do I say that? It's moving in a way I've never experienced in a ghost story before. Most of the ghost story movies I know of, are just meant to frighten you and that's it. El Orfanato isn't like that. It wants to frighten you and it did and it did good, but there's more to this movie than just superficial dark rooms and doors that opens and closes by themselves. It's moving, it's tragic, it's a mother with a terrible feeling of guilt and despair, and you're feeling with her. That's also because of the great way of acting, but the story does a lot too.<br/><br/>Well, I find it difficult to explain, especially because English isn't my main language, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. WATCH IT! Watch it and let it get to you. It's... yes it's beautiful."

","It has to be said - I'm never really scared. However, El Orfanato makes my heart pound in my chest, in sync with our heroines heart - but hardly more than that.<br/><br/>So why on earth would I give such a high grade to El Orfanato? The answer lies in my life-status so to speak - i.e. that I'm a father. 'cause, believe me, if you're reasonably young and don't have any children then this movie probably might not move you at all.<br/><br/>If you are a parent you will become completely emotionally involved and it's not impossible that your heart will be ripped to shreds.<br/><br/>The thing is - this isn't really a horror-movie. It's a movie about limitless, unconditional, love and the horrible agony that can raze your entire existence when the one you love is taken from you.<br/><br/>As you can probably understand I like this movie a lot. I like the fact that the main character is female (which is something Spanish films do often and well), I like that it takes it's time to build ambiance and unease. I even like the ending - in some strange way.<br/><br/>Go see this film - if you dare put your heart through it."

"rachael-a-lee","10","1","4","7 August 2008"," attempts to bridge the connections between the movie and ""Peter Pan""
","I think it's a shame that this movie is being considered solely as a horror movie and has been widely criticized for not delivering a ""horror movie ending"". The brilliance of this film lies in delicate allusion to the children's classic story ""Peter Pan"". The children of the orphanage, which were originally frightening, are not meant to be the classic scary, vicious children found in common and drawn out and dying horror films; in fact these children are not evil at all, as they attempt to help Laura in her quest for Simon. We are so used to generic, boring horror movies based solely upon the idea that the audience is either going to cover their eyes or jump in their seats, that we have failed to recognize true brilliance; the Orphanage is brilliant! These children simply were not horror movie children, they were Peter Pan's lost boys, or the ""lost children"" as Simon refers to them. This idea is constant throughout the film with the games and with the idea that the children are existing as children who are dead, and thus unable to grow up. In Never Never Land, you never grow old, and it is Never Never Land that they are waiting for.<br/><br/>And perhaps it is not too much of a stretch to suggest that Simon is Peter Pan, or a metaphor for Peter Pan. Or perhaps Thomas is Peter Pan, as he is the one that instigates the whole thing. Shortly after meeting Thomas, in fact, Simon asks Laura if she will go with him to Never Never Land. Laura says that she is too old to go, or too much detached from her childhood at the orphanage. At the end she becomes a part of them; she becomes the children's Wendy, or the gate to Never Never Land, which, in the end, is where they all end up, including Laura. However, since in the original story, Wendy is too old to return to Never Never Land, perhaps it is here that the director adds his own message: you are NEVER too old for Never Never Land."

","From it's impressive title sequence, in which children's' hands tear away layers of wallpaper to reveal the credits, to the amazingly haunting finalé which manages to be sad, happy, and thoroughly disturbing all at the same time, The Orphanage is another brilliant film that, along with recent unmissable efforts such as The Descent and À l'intérieur, suggests that Europe is finally attempting to reclaim its title as the reigning continent for original horror.<br/><br/>Busty Belén Rueda plays Laura, a woman who brings her family (husband Carlos and adopted son Simón) to live in her childhood home, 'The Orphanage' of the title, where they hope to set up a refuge for handicapped and needy orphaned children.<br/><br/>After a visit to a cave system at a nearby cove, Simón begins to communicate with a group of imaginary friends: six children who just might be the ghosts of Laura's old childhood playmates. When Simón mysteriously disappears, and a weird old woman comes calling at the house, Laura is plunged into a supernatural nightmare that forces her to consider the impossible as possible, and pushes her to the limits of her sanity.<br/><br/>Loaded with bags of atmosphere, and tons of good old fashioned 'scares' (but very little gorealthough there is one standout 'yuck!' moment!), The Orphanage is a classic ghostly yarn which, thanks to excellent direction from Juan Antonio Bayona and a great central performance from Rueda, manages to be a breath of fresh air in a genre that, lately, seems to have been rather clogged up with remakes and 'torture porn'.<br/><br/>And then there is the ending: so unexpected, so tragic, so effing brilliant, that it'll have you thinking about the film for days, poring over plot details and constantly re-evaluating what you have seen.<br/><br/>There are those who believe that The Orphanage is not a ghost story at all, with the seemingly supernatural events being a figment of Laura's imagination; then there are those who, like me, take the film at face value. Whatever your interpretation of the events portrayed, I can guarantee that The Orphanage will scare, shock, and surprise you like no other film has done for quite a while.<br/><br/>Now how long will it be before the inevitable Hollywood remake?"

","I should be happy about the right decision that I made since I didn't expect to see a nice film at the first place but it turned out to be a great one. After looking thru the screening list I decided to watch this one with my friend, thinking that all the rest films were little more than silly Hollywood clichés. After all, you couldn't expect much from a multiplex cinema which targets at teenagers. <br/><br/>But it proved to be a worthwhile experience. For the past few years we've seen Hispanic imagination in films like Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos, The Day of the Beast and The Other, this time we witnessed Juan Antonio Bayona's talent reflecting in this fantasy thriller. I wanna define this film just in the way the tag line does-a tale of love, a story of horror.<br/><br/>Basically,I consider this film has the following strengths: 1 .the way the plot develops. In fact, during the first 20 minutes or so the film appears to be rather ordinary and dull, as the pace is slow, the acting somehow reminds you of the typical family melodrama. Even if there's a few hints suggesting the mystics waiting to be revealed, they're easily to be taken as some unimaginative old tricks (thinking about Hide and Seek and the likes). However, the plot does develop and gradually shows something engrossing. It's never in a rush, which is a merit for the character-driven films like this, audiences will definitely be caught by the suspense it creates.<br/><br/>2. the balance between horror clichés and originality. It's obvious that quite a few horror iconography can be spotted in this film, most of them, such as the cave, invisible friends, scary noises etc. are already quite familiar to most of us, so it's not really possible to see their presence without secretly laughing at them, but fact is, they're not dominant in this film, rather, they service the theme. At some points, I tend to be preoccupied by the typical Hollywood story lines, thinking that after those ghost children take the revenge, all messes are gonna be wind up, and we will be told that all those horrible things are only insane illusions of Laura- a woman full of maternal love and is a bit obsessed with that. But the director didn't give me the chance to laugh about the silly plot, he handled it smartly and turned it into right direction each time it was about to 'go astray', thus leaving us something to guess and expect.<br/><br/>3. the cinematography. One thing that is noteworthy is the skilled use of camera-work and the great artistic feeling it yields. I can clearly remember the corridor/wash room scene in Laura's house where Thomas is shown as an evil and mysterious figure with his front full figure is pictured at first, and then switched to Laura's front figure, the last scene we could see is part of Thomas's scary mask through the washroom door. Another notable sequence is the one which Aurora acts as the exorcist. That sequence is basically shot from the point of view of the people watching at her via surveillance TV, however, when the camera shifts to Aurora's point of view, nothing is really revealed (partly due to the dark lighting), which pushes the suspense further and raises audiences' curiosity. Apart from these, many subjective shots are used to express Laura's anxiety, fear and determination.<br/><br/>4. the score- another outstanding element in this film. The use of music and sound strongly expresses characters' mentality. They're empathetic, prominent but never too much or too little. We do have some abrupt inharmonious sound giving us a 'heart-attack', we also got mellow and sad music from piano; we have some sequences full of upset noises, we also got scenes with barely any sound except the one of clock-ticking. All these varied types of music/sound adds to the mystic atmosphere of the whole film.<br/><br/>Besides the above points, some other things should be mentioned too. This film is presented by Guillermo Del Toro, a well-known contemporary horror/fantasy master from Mexico, so naturally it has some Toro-feeling in it, most obvious one is probably the theme of the story. Anyone who has watched Cronos would relate this film to that one (not only because we got another Aurora in this film), also, both of them are love stories in nature-they celebrate the power of trust and compassion between the adult and the children. This seems to be a topic constantly picked up by Toro. <br/><br/>All in all, I'll give this film a 7.5/10.It won't ever be an overestimation because it touches me and impresses me with its hybrid of horror style and a universal issue of human condition. And in fact, it even questions our belief about science's rationality-""Hear, but don't listen; people say seeing is believing,it's the other way around: believe, and you'll see."""

Even the girl with the dragon tattoo series made English versions, and i can honestly say i'm Very happy they did because its still a favorite series to this day. i love watching foreign movies because they have such creative, gory imaginations, and when they come in English that just makes it 10x better. I don't care that the original is in another language but at least convert it to English. I even found a french version over English which i was surprised about considering the worlds top three most spoken languages are Chinese, Spanish and English. So unfortunate and disappointing about this movie. No stars given, since i cant even watch it."

","This may be the only ""horror"" movie that has managed to both creep me out and make me weep openly.<br/><br/>Belén Rueda is incredible as Laura, the mother of Simon, the young boy who goes missing early on in the film.

The story, which is well crafted and compelling, will keep you on the edge of your seat right through to its haunting final act. Although classified as a thriller/horror film, the scares come more from the story itself and the atmospheric dread created by the old orphanage's setting. There are very few jump scares, contrary to the norm these days with this genre, as the film focuses more on creating a narrative that is scary enough all on its own. The film's conclusion had me in tears, which I must admit was rather unexpected. Highly recommended. Trust me, just go find this movie and watch it now!"

","The first time I saw this, frankly I was disappointed. I came to it fresh from viewing Japanese horrors of skinny, long-haired girls walking upside-down on ceilings, vengeful victims of abuse and slaughter. I was looking for more of the same. Of course, I didn't find it. The Orphanage is a quieter kind of horror. It has more in common with Jack Clayton's 1961 film, The Innocents, than most contemporary horror. Both films show a woman fighting to save a child from what she believes to be maleficent supernatural entities. Jack Clayton's film leaves us wondering if the monster was in the woman's own mind (and the film is none the worse for that); J A Bayona leaves us with no such ambiguity. And The Orphanage is a wonderful film.<br/><br/>But when I first watched it, yes, I was disappointed. I did want the screaming horrors of contemporary cinema, and this quietly acted drama didn't scare me. Now, about a decade later, I was able to let myself be drawn in. The weird setting of house and lighthouse, the compelling story and completely convincing acting, all worked their spell, and I was seriously creeped-out as the film reached its final act. Along with The Innocents, The Babadook and (possibly) The Others, The Orphanage has now become one of my all time favourite films."

Moreover, the absorbing story that's set up with utmost care and precision by Sergio G. Sanchez has a tragic element to it that in turn gives this film a considerable amount of depth and poignancy. Rueda's distraught, yet determined Laura makes for a strong and sympathetic protagonist whose need to make peace with her troubled past and desire to be reunited with her missing son Simon (well played with tremendous charm and vitality by Roger Princep) ensures that this movie packs a potent emotional punch. The ending manages to be both sad and uplifting in equal measure. Fernando Cayo lends sturdy support as Laura's concerned husband Carlos. Geraldine Chaplin likewise excels as helpful medium Aurora.

","This movie is a small pearl of horror movies and comes from the country next to me. It tells the story of a couple who went to live in a renovated orphanage and where, soon, their little son begins to see invisible children before disappearing. From then on, a tense supernatural story unfolds, holding us to the screen until the end. The script is simple but effective, the story is good and the permanent tension is gradually growing. Directed by Juan Antonio Baiona (a director I had never heard of), it is a film that comes in line with other works of the most recent Spanish cinema, by Guillermo del Toro or Alejandro Amenábar. The environments and scenarios have been carefully elaborated and the actors' work (highlighting Belén Rueda and Roger Príncep) is moving and convincing. This is undoubtedly a film that deserves much more visibility, ending up being harmed by its European origin and not having the same advertising machine as the great American works."
"masonmorgan-92917","8","0","2","5 February 2017"," A horror built on emotions
","J.A. Bayona and Guillermo del Toro's The Orphanage is a masterfully crafted piece of Spanish horror that transcends high above the relatively low bar set for the genre. While consistently suspenseful and dark, the story is told in a oddly beautiful way. This isn't the average horror film where the fear is generated from gory images or cheap scares, but rather it's atmosphere and emotional tension and eventual deterioration of our main character. The Orphanage is bold and takes many risks, most of which pay off, but what impressed me the most was the elegance and maturity showcased by Bayona in his debut feature. Guillermo del Toro's influence on the film is immediately noticeable as every aspect within the film is executed with a sense of macabre beauty, from the breathtaking shots to the excellently detailed setting.<br/><br/>The cast is fairly limited and the story strongly hinges on our emotional connection to our main character played by Belén Rueda. She was simply excellent as we witness her character slowly starts to lose her grip on everything she believes. She's a strong, determined female character who emits a confidence that is reflected not only in herself, but the entire film as a whole. <br/><br/>The Orphanage is a film for the patient and at times it seems more of a film for movie-lovers rather than actual horror fans. The atmosphere and tone drive the story forward, and while a few scares occur now and then, it's the unwavering sense of dread that makes the experience relentlessly suspenseful at times. And once we begin to uncover the truth behind the film's many mysteries, these moments of suspense intensify. While there are a few scenes of far-fetched violence that the director seems to indulge in, he never gets lost in it. <br/><br/>The main thing that sets The Orphanage apart from most other horror movies is the amount of heart the film features. The story is hauntingly sad, but once we begin to solve the film's mysteries, it only becomes even more heartbreaking. The use of child ghosts may seem eye-rolling at first, but the idea is never exploited and even adds to the emotional impact. The ending is really hit-or-miss for most people but I found it to be the perfect way to wrap up such a beautiful and emotional tale of love and loss. <br/><br/>It may not be endlessly re-watchable as the film does drag on at times, but if you can make it past some slow stretches, the payoff more than makes up for these moments. The Orphanage is a smart, elegant and sophisticated horror film. The cinematic and acting prowess from the cast and producers in unquestionable and in turn works to make the viewing experience all the more rich. While it can't be said for many of the genre, The Orphanage is a horror film built completely off the emotions of it's story, character's and the feelings it evokes from the audience. Where most horror films aim to make you faint, The Orphanage aims to make you cry."
"ThomasDrufke","7","0","2","7 January 2017"," Simple & Sophisticated
","Sometimes the best thing a horror film can do is simplify itself. The Orphanage benefits from having a strong and grounded performance from Belén Rueda, without overwhelming it's plot with supernatural clichés and jump scares.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain, J.A. Bayona is phenomenal director. I've heard great things about his upcoming 'A Monster Calls', 'The Impossible' is one of the most heart-wrenching films of all time, and The Orphanage kicked off his directing with a bang. But there's one thing all of those films have in common, they deal with a mother's relationship to her son. I've obviously never met Bayona, but he had to have a strong connection to his mother. And among other things, that was the most satisfying element to The Orphanage. Guillermo del Toro produced this, and as much as I love a lot of his films, sometimes his films are more about spectacle than they are about real human emotion. Luckily, Bayona gave plenty of that to The Orphanage.<br/><br/>Movies about disappearances or deaths of children are always very difficult to watch. Especially the films that take a horror approach, like The Orphanage. Kids are always creepy in horror-thrillers, there's just no two ways about it. But as long as Belén Rueda keeps her performance grounded, this movie stays afloat. <br/><br/>This movie certainly delves into some things that we have seen in horror films before, mostly having to do with supernatural ideas or dream-like people returning from the dead, but I never found myself all that invested in those scenes. I'm far more interested in seeing how a mother reacts to her child go missing. The film doesn't necessarily have as many layers as other horror-thrillers, but as a first time director, I couldn't have asked for more from Bayona. Hopefully 'A Monster Calls' and The Jurassic World sequel continue the string of great work from him.<br/><br/>+Mother-son relationship<br/><br/>+Stays relatively grounded<br/><br/>+Simple story<br/><br/>-Could have had a little bit more depth<br/><br/>7.7/10"

"Leofwine_draca","9","0","4","22 September 2016"," Understated and stylish Spanish ghost story
","THE ORPHANAGE is an excellent little modern-day ghost story and another example of Spanish genre cinema outclassing foreign competition. This flick has more imagination than a dozen US torture porn offerings or half a dozen Japanese female ghost jaunts. Although it clearly owes much to THE INNOCENTS and THE OTHERS, it stands in its own right as an effective ghost-story-cum-mystery as a couple move into an abandoned orphanage with their adopted son and soon find themselves menaced by sinister forces. The plot sounds familiar, but THE ORPHANAGE succeeds thanks to subtlety, originality, and the refusal to pander to the audience.<br/><br/>Those looking for CGI effects, action, or gore effects should go elsewhere because this film has none of them. There are a few jump shocks but even these are limited in favour of creepy atmosphere – this is without doubt a mood piece. It's not the most horrifying film I've seen and I wouldn't even class it as a 'horror' film per se – okay, yes, it is a ghost story but not a frightening one. Instead it's moving, poignant, nostalgic, and come the twist ending I don't mind admitting that I was crying my eyes out at the mixture of happiness and sadness it brought.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent location – a creepy old coastal orphanage, complete with secret rooms and passages – that would have been effective in the hands of an amateur, let alone the intelligent, mature director Juan Antonio Bayona. Guillermo del Toro was kind enough to put his name to it as producer to secure a wider audience and it was a good choice, as many people have discovered just how great a movie this is. Special mention goes to the entire cast for their performances, with obvious mention to Belen Rueda who has to act in a very difficult central role and comes away completely wonderful because of it."

","In ghost story terms, there's nothing particularly new about 'The Orphanage' – it follows the modern ghost story formula pretty well, i.e. family moves into new location, strange things happen, no one believes them, contact expert to clarify supernatural element and then climax. The Orphanage ticks all those boxes and in that order. However, just because its story isn't that original, doesn't mean it's bad.<br/><br/>It's Spanish, for a start. I don't know why I always give foreign films more leeway when it comes to acting terms. Maybe it's the subtitles that mean I can't really tell a 'good' foreign actor from a 'bad' one. But, the acting certainly seems well up there to me. It's about a couple who have adopted a young boy and move back into an old orphanage to refurbish it and open it up for taking on new children. However, things go more than a little wrong when their son starts developing 'imaginary' friends and then vanishes completely during the opening event and, no, they don't find that he's been taken into the TV, ala, Poltergeist.<br/><br/>See? Nothing particularly new there, but it's the film's overall tone, direction and acting which elevates it about the – literally – thousands of similar clones which infest DVD bargain buckets at your local petrol station. The setting is great and I've already mentioned the acting. But it's simply the foreboding feel of dream and despair that keeps you watching.<br/><br/>Basically, if you like your ghost stories slow-burning and creepy (and don't mind subtitles) then give this one a go. It moves slowly to a sensible ending and doesn't have any hordes of CGI monsters or major action sequences, so don't be expecting a horror marathon of epic proportions. Just expect something subtle and dark."

There must be layers of terror lurking underneath the shield of innocence, with each successive layer becoming more and more disturbing. The Orphanage gets it right.

Bayona crafts a healthy share of scares and suspense for sure, but not at the expense of presenting a compelling chronicle skillfully infused with drama and genuine human emotion. At it's heart a narrative of a mother's love for her child and the ferocious and limitless power embodied in such, Bayona's film also gives us a ghost story, summoning as it does so spirits both conjured and broken.<br/><br/>Belén Rueda is a relentless dynamo of raw strength and dogged determination as a parent who refuses to believe that her lost child has lost his life. Her extraordinary performance is intensely demanding and grueling, one rarely witnessed from any actress regardless of the role.

"aralith-1","7","0","2","11 January 2009"," A good movie with some weaknesses
","Well, after having heard much about this film, and after hearing that Guillermo del Toro was backing the project (even though he wasn't really involved with the production that much), I figured I would give it a watch. I have to say that I was quite pleased with it. There were no cheap thrills in the film. All of them stemmed from events happening in reality (or perceived reality). No dream sequences. No scary noises turning out to be a character just sneaking through the bushes.<br/><br/>The only thing that really detracted from the experience in any dramatic way was the ending. Whether Bayona meant to or not, it was very reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth, in that all of the hopes and dreams of the main character turned out to be false, until death ""freed"" them from reality (in a sense), and let those hopes and dreams become their afterlife. Not to mention it was just... too happy of an ending for such a dark film, where six disabled and/or disfigured orphans were murdered by one of their caretakers.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another weakness of this film. The character of Benigna. What was her motivation for murdering said orphans? How was it she got the papers on Simon in the first place? And why in the shed scene was she holding a shovel? Most of her scenes didn't make sense. Her only purpose in the film seemed to be to murder the orphans so that they could be ghosts later on, offering no explanation as to how or why it might have happened.<br/><br/>As for the thrills in the film itself, many people here have complained about how hardly any of it is original, and rather just borrows from old classic films such as Poltergeist and Rosemary's Baby. Okay, couple of things here. For one, it's a genre film. Cinema has been going on for an awfully long time, and almost any idea one could think of these days has already been used in the past. For two, when Sanchez first wrote the script, he INTENDED it to be a throwback to those types of films. It's hardly a criticism if it's something the author freely admits doing.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely fantastic. Belen Rueda did an especially good job as Laura. Her performance was both emotional and evocative. She played her part with great conviction. Cayo was good, but his character was given hardly anything to really do. Chaplin did a superb job as the medium, as well.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good film, and I would certainly recommend it, but there are definitely a couple of things that could have been done better."

","All I have to say is it is about time. It has been so long since a good horror film has been and The Orphanage is one of the few films to finally succeed. Recently a horror film is about how much blood and gore can be crammed into a 2-hour time slot. There is no mystery, nothing to be terrified about. Instead these films are meant to startle and disgust you. That is not horror. What happened to the films that just had a scary plot and did not depend of the gross and grotesque? <br/><br/>This is exactly wait The Orphanage is, a scary plot that leaves behind all the gore and blood and depends strictly on its story. The Orphanage is about a woman named Laura who returns to the orphanage where she grew up with her son and her husband to open it once again. The story heightens when her son Simon disappears after making a new imaginary friend.<br/><br/>Instead of relying on a CGI created bad guy, The Orphanage uses live action and an interesting plot to engulf the audience in its story. This is a nice refresher to other horror films. This film actually cares about the characters and their development. We see how Laura tries to deal with the loss of her child, while trying to figure out the mysteries behind Simon's invisible friend Tomas. Laura's journey is just as interesting as the mystery behind Simon's disappearance.<br/><br/>This film has everything that one could hope for in a good horror film. The soundtrack also assists the film in its supernatural feel, but the film is not dependent on the music alone. Through well-developed characters and plot The Orphanage is one of the best-done horror films in a long time.<br/><br/>While this horror film is not like most Hollywood horrors that allow you to sit back, turn off your brain, and watch the typical shock factors, The Orphanage forces you to think and drags you into the supernatural world that Laura has also been sucked into. This is one of the best horror films in a long time and I strongly recommend it."

","I’d heard a lot of good things about this Spanish ghost story produced by Guillermo del Toro; having finally caught up with it, I can say that its reputation is well deserved – since the generally subtle approach to the genre here puts to shame Hollywood’s current trend in visceral horror! The only real quibble I have with the film is that plotwise it offers relatively little that’s new – though the ending does obfuscate matters a bit by suggesting it may all have occurred merely in the protagonist’s mind! As ever with this type of effort, we have a restless soul from the beyond (usually, it’s a child – which is why they’re so unsettling, and the film’s most haunting image certainly involves the creepy kid with a sack over his head) who, by making contact with a living being, is able to unearth a concealed past crime – even if this came upon following his own ill-fated demise! <br/><br/>The film does get the eerie atmosphere centering around a vast, darkened and remote building absolutely right – with cinematography, score and sound being, as expected, carefully deployed; even so, the leading performance from Belen Rueda is notable and, as an added treat, we have a wizened Geraldine Chaplin playing a traditionally eccentric medium (more than the obvious POLTERGEIST [1982] or THE HAUNTING [1963], these scenes reminded of the classic British made-for-TV chiller THE STONE TAPE [1972] by Nigel Kneale). With respect to twists, we have the heroine being unwittingly responsible for her own child’s ghastly death as well as – equally coincidentally – that of the culprit of the old murders (complete with an unnecessarily weird shot of the woman’s dislocated jaw!). Still, the game which Rueda and her kid play – wherein a series of clues will lead to the discovery of some object – is cleverly developed into a motif, thus paving the way for the climactic revelation.<br/><br/>For the record, Del Toro had himself earlier delivered two notable efforts revolving around kids – the somewhat similar THE DEVIL’S BACKBONE (2001) and the more elaborate PAN’S LABYRINTH (2006). Incidentally, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE (1973) and CRIA CUERVOS (1975; also with Chaplin) are two other famous Spanish films about childhood – watching her here and Ana Torrent (who actually appears in both of them) in THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (2008) recently has made me yearn to pick up their Criterion 2-Disc editions which, until now, weren’t that much a priority for me…"
"Prof-Hieronymos-Grost","7","0","2","22 August 2008"," Moody slow burner
","Laura, a former orphan at a rural orphanage, buys her previous home and moves in with her husband and her adopted son. Pretty soon strange things begin to happen, her son Simon is talking about imaginary friends he has, they ignore this saying he will grow out of it. Simon goes missing during a fancy dress party and is never found, Laura believes a mysterious woman who claimed to be a social worker is responsible. Bavona'a film has all the hallmarks of a Del Toro film, it's a moody slow burner that is full of creepy moments rather than out and out scares. Its beautifully filmed, well acted but for me it was a big disappointment after all the hype. I can't really say why exactly, for me it just lacked something magical. Maybe a second viewing is required."
"hoitydoity","8","0","2","7 August 2008"," Frightening but with some flaws
","This movie had some really great shock moments and at times was very frightening indeed. You almost never had an idea what was bound to happen next. The only thing I found strange was that the disabled kids in the orphanage (around 1975 I believe that was), had really old fashoned looking braces. Looked more like from around 1900 to me. Also one of the disable children, Thomas, - being born in that period, they could easily have given him surgery. It seems a bit improbable to me that they would hide a child's face under a mask, like the elephant man, who lived from 1862- 1890. While this leaved me with a slight lost feeling, overall this was a very entertaining movie with a good pace and not to be watched after dark when you are alone!"
"alienisko","7","0","2","13 June 2008"," Bad ending....
","First, sorry for my English :) This could be a great movie for me. Same as fmagnet (look at his review) I don't like horror movies. This one was different.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this one. It was tense, scary drama/thriller with great acting.<br/><br/>But ending wasted everything. When Laura discovered that Simon died because of her it was the best moment to finish the movie, it was a dramatic, powerful, most thrilling moment in this movie. But no, they had to show her with her dead friends giving time to fell down the tense of this move. Last unnecessary scenes destroyed this movie!"
"zetes","7","0","3","25 May 2008"," Good, but not that good
","Good, but I was expecting better given the reviews. It's about at the same level as, say, The Others. Belén Rueda plays an adult orphan who now lives in her former orphanage with her husband and adopted son. Her son speaks of imaginary friends, which she and her husband find normal. But these imaginary friends, it starts to seem, may really be ghosts. One day, the son vanishes, and Rueda thinks the ghosts may have something to do with it. The film is quite spooky, but I think the eeriness is pretty much ruined by an overzealous musical score. This really needed to be more subtle. The script has a couple of great twists, but, in general, it's fairly poor. It contains scenes where characters sit around and spout out endless exposition. Home movies are discovered which provide endless clues to the mystery. The most annoying flaw is that police and detectives are brought in to solve the case, and they find nothing. Later on, Rueda discovers all kinds of obvious clues that police searching for a missing child wouldn't have left uncovered. The final twist, I think, is particularly brilliant, but the movie lost me again with a lousy, sentimental ending."
"subcommandante_chupacabr","8","0","2","22 May 2008"," Marvelous, beautiful - but the ending is illogical
","This is a superb piece of cinema that transcends genre but it just doesn't make sense to me that no one would have know about the ""secret room"" in the basement.<br/><br/>The ""psychic investigators"" had floor plans, wouldn't the police have had access to them as well? Wouldn't the remodeling contractors have known? If it was being reopened as a school, wouldn't the building inspectors have known? It is not a ""quibble"" since so much of the film's conclusion relies on Laura's discovery in the basement. This ""minor detail"" and the sentimentality of the ending keep The Orphanage from contending with the original ""The Haunting"" as being the best all-time haunted house film."
"anicerman","7","0","2","8 May 2008"," A bit overrated
","As a fan of horror films I expected more from this, considering its many awards and nominations. Yet it doesn't quite live up to my expectation.<br/><br/>Laura and Carlos live with their adopted son Simon in a house which used to be an orphanage. At first Simon claims to have two friends around whom Laura and Carlos consider as his imagination. After the Benigna's visit and the treasure hunt, Laura eventually realises that Simon's friends are more than imagination.<br/><br/>The first half of the story goes very well which leads us step-by-step to the truths. But the second half and especially the ending are a bit of an anti-climax. The writer and director make exactly the same mistake as Dark Water (both the English and Japanese versions). But not a bad job for people of their age.<br/><br/>This is basically a one-woman show and Rueda's performance is so great that it almost covers the mistakes of the plot (unfortunately just almost). The 'horrifying' music itself is very mundane and they put it in every single supposedly terrifying moment, which makes things worse. Yet other scores are pretty good.<br/><br/>Great acting, acceptable directing and less acceptable plot. I haven't watched any other Spanish films in the same year but this doesn't seem to deserve so many honours except for best actress. Anyway if you're fed up with the American kind of 'fake' horror movies, this one's worth your time."

","Following formulas always guaranties the ""double your money"" way of commercial movies. El Orfanato is no different; however, it is a nice treat for those who sympathize with Shyamalan and Del Toro's (exec.prod. on this one) work.<br/><br/>Screenplay is better than average and it holds tight all the way from the start.<br/><br/>In the end, the message is quiet clear for the ones who are aware of Karmas and catholic beliefs. The good thing is the association with those beliefs with social issues using universal feelings (somewhat lost nowadays).<br/><br/>A must ""feel"" movie!"
"DICK STEEL","7","0","3","15 March 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Orphanage
","I thought that the Orphanage had employed just about every clichéd premise out there in horrorland, where the first 5 minutes probably set up an inevitable series of events that you could have seen from 10 miles out. A creepy looking mansion which functions as an orphanage, children (who are popular characters in many horror movies), and the return to a place called home. To make things worse, the story took its time to unfold, with what I perceived as a nod toward Poltergeist and Dark Water combined.<br/><br/>However, you can't deny that The Orphanage was somewhat of a fresh breeze amongst recent horror releases. Sure I did not like the snail's pace, but I appreciate the technical details employed to craft mood and tension, without relying on the usual bag of tricks. So what you have are extremely atmospheric pieces, but don't go waiting out for cheap sound effects or sudden quick jumps to send thrills down your spine, or laughable attempts at that.<br/><br/>Belen Rueda plays Laura, an orphan from the Orphanage who returns to the same house many years later with husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and son Simon (Roger Princep) in tow. Standard horror movie rule #1 will say that things are expected to go bump in the night, and soon enough Simon starts to interact with what is brushed aside by his parents as imaginary friends borne out of his loneliness. Laura, during her childhood, got adopted and off she goes from her friends, and rule #2 will state that she'll soon find out what had happened to the rest, weaved together quite nicely when Simon starts to disappear.<br/><br/>I've come to casually notice that with horror movies, female protagonist are now standard fare. They will find inner strength to confront demons, believe the extraordinary and just never give up hope, whereas their male counterparts always seem whiny, disbelieving, and unsupportive. And that continues here as well. There are some nice touches here which I felt held up the plot development when it was going downhill, and that scene involving ""ghostbusters"" was certainly one of the best I've seen in a long while, where everything worked perfectly in providing crucial clues to further the story.<br/><br/>But don't go to The Orphanage expecting a lot. The story's rather cliché though cleverly multi-layered in its presentation. It has its moments in key scenes, and for a horror movie, it possesses technical merits in not wanting to be just another run off the mill production, but ultimately felt quite empty despite its very glossy veneer and its headline of having Guillermo del Toro's name attached to the project."
