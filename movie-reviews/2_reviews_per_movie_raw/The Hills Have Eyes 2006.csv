","Alexandre Aja, you have a new fan.<br/><br/>Before this movie was released in theaters, I made sure to watch Wes Craven's original endeavor. Let me just start out by saying that compared to today's standards and conventions, Craven's classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" seems almost mild when compared to Alexandre Aja's remake. However, purists too skeptic to check this movie out should rest assured that the film is very, VERY faithful to the original. The characters, story, and overall progression of events remain unchanged, however, the quality of all said elements has increased dramatically since the original 70s release. Furthermore, like any other quality remake, there are twists, there are surprises, and for people who think they're getting the same film with updated technology, think again.<br/><br/>The film starts out with the nuclear bomb test-radiation disclaimer, and from there, to those who've screened the original, the familiar New Mexico desert setting is presented for all to take in. Make no mistakes, though. Aja never misses a beat, and he makes sure to take advantage of any opportunity he can when it comes to scaring the living crap out of the audience.<br/><br/>After a very vivid and graphic opening, the film gets rolling, mixing elements of freshness with both nostalgia and familiarity. People who saw the original will know what they're looking at, however their eyes will also be glued to the screen due to the overall difference in presentation and cinematography. The familiar gas station attendant is shown to the audience, and soon after, the Carter family + in-law stroll in. From there, the real fun begins.<br/><br/>Aja and his fellow screenwriter did an amazing job adding depth and dimension to the family members, ensuring that throughout the course of the film, people in the audience would certainly be able to connect with or identify with at least one member of the Carter family. This is accentuated by very strong performances by all the actors. Recognizable, seasoned actors are chosen for the older family members, while younger, relatively lesser known actors are chosen for characters like Bobby and Brenda.<br/><br/>I really could not complain with any of the performances. With all the craziness and gruesome things happening to the family, the actors' reactions are all portrayed very realistically, with emotions dead-on with very few hiccups in line delivery. One performance that stood out in particular to me was definitely that of Aaron Stanford (Pyro, X2 and the upcoming X-Men 3). Despite the fact that Standford was merely a year old when the original 'Hills' was released, he more than proves his acting credibility and fits the role of Doug very well. He does the role justice, and fills the shoes of the protagonist very well. I could go on and on about the performances of the rest of the cast (which are all extremely solid), but you want to know more about the movie, right? One cannot help but compare this film to original. There are 3 reasons I feel Aja's remake tops Craven's original: 1) the emphasis Aja places on the Carters, 2) the make-up effects, 3) the excessive gore.<br/><br/>Whereas Craven gave the deformed family clan plenty of screen time in 1977, Aja opts to shroud them in mystery for much of the film's duration. In many ways, the family emphasis is almost reversed in either film. Aja makes sure to hide the deformed family members from the viewers until just the proper moment, while Craven made their names and personalities as clear as day. I personally think the less information there is about something, the scarier it becomes to the person dealing with it. Aja realized this, and presented it very well.<br/><br/>Speaking of presentation, one cannot help but watch in sheer awe and amazement at some of the deformities displayed by the irradiated family members. I personally have not seen such drastically deformed individuals first hand, and I'm not sure how accurate their portrayals were in 'Hills' '06, but one thing is for sure: they were damn gruesome. Do not be fooled, the little child shown in the commercially televised trailer is NOT representative of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And then there's the gore. Ah, the gore. Monsieur Aja, you are the brainchild of modern horror, and you definitely know how to ride with the best of them. No body part is taboo in this film, and for all you gore fanatics out there, there are no annoying instances where the camera ""looks away"" when someone or something is, say, struck with the menacing swing of a weapon. For all those who've said ""But I wanted to SEE what happened to him!"", rest assured, you will indeed see what happens to everything in this film.<br/><br/>The Hills '06 will satisfy your blood-lust. Alexandre Aja takes Craven's original film and builds on it in just about every way. Better acting, better visual effects, better make-up, better story presentation (i.e. no unanswered plot holes or abrupt ""halts""), and much, MUCH more gore. This film is not for the squeamish, and it is my opinion that it will suppress the doubts of any skeptics who, upon seeing this film, may have badmouthed horror movie remakes in the past.<br/><br/>Only thing that caused me to dock it a point were the questionable courses of action some of the characters took. Alas, such things may always fall into the category of ""typical horror movie no-no's."" Furthermore, I wasn't really horrified while watching this movie. A more accurate description would be that I was highly impressed and satisfied.<br/><br/>Horror movie fans: see this film as soon as you can. Non-horror movie fans: if you see this, prepare to have your world rocked.<br/><br/>See this movie people, it's pure gold."
"sebastianhennessy","7","63","84","18 November 2006"," Not bad , but still prefer the original by a mile
","What made early Wes Craven movies so special were these eary and daunting atmospheres he was so good in creating ; And this is what Hills Have Eyes 2006 totally lacked. Firstly the music through out the movie was awful and totally cliché and unfortunately diminished any depth that HHE was trying to show. I did like the nuclear mutant idea , but then seeing them reminded me on how the original HHE villains had way more presence on the screen and they had no make up !!<br/><br/>Now I did like the actors , they played their respective roles well The effects were good + I did like how they twisted the original script and added some new ideas instead a complete knock off of the original So my final word not a bad movie , but lacked atmosphere/suspense , which is so important in horror/slasher movies , shame !"
"mecha_meg","10","359","523","11 March 2006"," Finally, an excellent horror movie
","The Hills Have Eyes, although a remake of the original, was everything a horror movie should be. Typically, I'm not a fan of slasher flicks, but this movie had elements I like to see in a movie. I don't like to see the protagonists making stupid mistakes (the old ""curiosity killed the cat"" syndrome), I don't like being able to guess the villain 20 minutes into the movie (although this wasn't the scenario in this particular movie). I don't enjoy picking out who's going to do die first, and being correct. I don't think sex scenes have any place in horror movies. I like things to be important and advance the plot.<br/><br/>Although the movie had some ""MTV"" elements to it, it still adhered to the classic horror movie thrills. The thing I liked about this movie was the fact that they repeatedly ""crossed the line"", doing things that you wouldn't expect modern movies to do, nothing is off limits in this movie. Horrifying elements that made you, well, terrified. Lots of ""boo"" surprises, but also more complex and twisted than modern movies have allowed. I spent most of the movie with my mouth agape... It's not just the gore, although there is a lot of that. They didn't leave anything to the imagination, did not imply anything...they showed you everything.<br/><br/>It was admittedly a little slow at first, but then all of the sudden things began to take a turn for the wicked. One thing this movie did that most horror movies don't bother to do is go into character development. Not a lot, but more so than a typical thriller will bother to do.<br/><br/>This movie was so disturbing, I'm not sure I'd want to see it again. That ""Deliverance"" mentality...you see it once, you're glad you saw it, but so disgusting you're pretty sure you don't want to experience that again.<br/><br/>Any horror aficionado should see this movie."
"beckmen","8","220","324","14 March 2006"," Excellent Survival Horror Film
","I haven't seen the original, but I now want to because this movie rocked. The movie starts as a slow-boil suspense/horror movie, provides some decent jump-scares (at least in the theater) and spends some time building up character. The movie then switches gears and turns into a gritty, brutal horror movie more the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and further switches to gears to a action/revenge movie, but still with horror elements. It's scary, sick, nearly uncompromising (the unrated cut will undoubtedly be so) and disturbing, but also adrenaline-filled and riveting. Certainly NOT for the weak-stomached person. People were leaving the theater, and the IMDb boards are rife with people damning the movie for it's 'lack of moral substance' and 'taste'. This movie isn't for the average movie-goer. It's for the horror buffs. Alexendre Aja should be proud, and is 2-for-2 in my book having done this and High Tension."
"TheMovieMark","7","161","243","14 March 2006"," If you're in the mood for one of 2006's most brutal movies...
","Shocking. Disturbing. At times hard to watch. All words to describe the horror of being forced to watch Michael Moore take his shirt off. But these terms also accurately describe this brutally vicious upgrade on Wes Craven's 1977 low-budget horror classic.<br/><br/>What would you do if you were traveling through the desert and became stranded amongst a group of genetically-mutated freaks who were intent on killing you? You'd probably die. Granted, I would kick all sorts of genetically-mutated butt (not an easy accomplishment when said butt has a foot growing out of it kicking right back), but the average human would be in some major trouble, just like the Carter family.<br/><br/>The father looks like he could handle himself in a fair fight, after all he is a detective, but what are three girls, a boy, a cell phone-selling geek, and a pizza place (maybe two of you will get that lame joke) going to do against a bunch of unnaturally strong psychos? How will they survive? Will it be through might or strategy? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. And if you're squeamish then you'll most likely find yourself cringing in your seat and watching with your hands over your eyes. The Hills Have Eyes is a movie that knows exactly what it needs to do to satisfy its target audience, and it does it well.<br/><br/>Case in point... I'm not very vocal during movies. I usually don't clap and scream and hoot and holler like most the dorks sitting around me, but there were a couple of scenes where I literally said aloud, ""Ooooooooooh, crap!"" Of course, one of those instances was during a trailer for Phat Girlz, but one scene of violence left my mouth hanging open for about 30 seconds. Then I realized that my mouth was agape like some buffoon, so I quickly closed it.<br/><br/>It takes a lot to shock and disturb me these days, so congrats go to The Hills Have Eyes for accomplishing that. It comes at you fast and hard and isn't interested in sugar-coating the violence it's about to serve up. The intensity level starts high and never gives you an opportunity to take a bathroom break. I highly recommend you address any and all bladder issues before the movie begins.<br/><br/>For me, the main drawback of the movie was the ""hero."" You can argue that he was more of a ""regular guy"" and not a typical macho hero, but I felt he transitioned a little too quickly from a gun-hating wuss to an ax-wielding killing machine. My hat's off to the dog though; that canine rocked! Easily the coolest dog in a movie since the German Shepherd in The Lost Boys.<br/><br/>""I like horror movies, Johnny, but I liked to be creeped out more than being subjected to a lot of gore. Would I like this?"" It's very doubtful. I'll make this as blunt as possible: this is a movie that contains severed body parts, brutal shootings, axes to the head, a person biting off a bird's head and drinking its blood, and disturbing violence to helpless women.<br/><br/>If that description turns you off then you know to save your money. However, if that fits your style then the movie will succeed in giving you exactly what you want. But I have to say that if you think this sounds like fun for the entire family then I'll have to decline any invitations to sit down with you for a family dinner."
"HarryWarden","9","280","437","4 March 2006"," Scary and intense! A remake that beats the original!
","We've seen dozens of remakes in the past several years: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Ring, Dawn of the Dead, The Fog. None could hold a candle next to the original films.<br/><br/>Could it be? After all this time, do we finally found a remake that's actually superior? You're damn right! The Hills Have Eyes is not at all like the other remakes in this ungodly trend. It's not a cheap cash-in. It's a movie made with respect by horror filmmakers for horror fans.<br/><br/>Sure, it has its share of problems: There are too many cheesy false scares, they added a corny patriotic subtext, and it sticks so close to the original that fans will find little in the way of surprises. But it's a leaner, meaner animal than Wes Craven's original film. The characters are more believable, the mutants are scarier, and the whole thing is incredibly visceral! This is the first studio horror film in years that I've liked...mainly because it doesn't feel like a studio horror film.<br/><br/>Funny side note: A girl next to me in the theater was silently weeping through the last half of the movie. Guess it made an impression."

","My husband did not make it past the first hour of this movie. I had to watch the rest alone. It is psychologically terrifying...one of those movies that takes hold of you, makes you scream at the screen, and leaves you with a disturbed feeling for hours after the final credits roll. There was nothing profound about the premise, and nothing Oscar-worthy about the acting, but it was an all-around great horror film. The special effects were good...lots of gore and violence. It's suspenseful, dark, and is guaranteed to leave you with a creepy feeling that won't let you go to sleep right after watching it. I watched three hours of SEINFELD reruns, and had nightmares anyway. That's the way it should be! ;)"
"Coventry","9","105","171","18 March 2006"," The Hills are Alive with the Sounds of ... SLAUGHTER!!
","I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"", to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project ""Haute Tension"" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies...<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of. Much more than the overrated Eli Roth, this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror. Strictly talking in terms of cinema, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is also a more than decent production. The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original. By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family, as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled. Altering the background of the desert-people into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja, though. Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsive-looking bastards, these people are basically a sort of ""victims"" themselves, which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story. I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws, like the editing being a little too MTV-ish perhaps, but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them. Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs, the convincing cast of actors and actresses and  last but not least  the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs!"
"the-movie-guy","8","102","170","9 March 2006"," A horror film made for the horror fan
","(Synopsis) The movie begins with the showing of original footage from some of the 311 nuclear tests that were carried out by the U.S. government in the desert of New Mexico during the years 1945-1992. The government had ordered the local residents to move so they wouldn't get hurt by the atomic tests. But some of the residents (miners) refused to leave their homes, and were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. The miners went to the mines and survived, but their newborn children were genetically altered. The children are now adults, and to survive in the desert, they murder and rob tourists going through the desert. They are not only insane murderers, but they have become blood-thirsty cannibals. The Carter family has an accident in the desert, and they are about to become the next victims. However, Big Bob Carter, (Ted Levine), a retired police detective, isn't going to let that happen.<br/><br/>(Comment) If you like horror films, you are going to like this one, because it was made for the horror fan. Be prepared to see a lot of blood, gore, and guts. This is a remake that is actually better than the 1977 original. You will applaud for the actions of a German shepherd named Beast, and even the tech geek Doug (Aaron Stanford) when he takes on the mutates. There are several scenes that will make you jump out of your seat. By the end of the movie, you will want to hit some of these mutates in the head with a pick-ax yourself.

"The_Void","8","97","165","13 March 2006"," Bloodthirsty mutant cannibals in the American wasteland
","The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is ""why remake a classic?"", but the question I ask of this one is ""why call it The Hills Have Eyes?"" Many films have been made before and after Wes Craven's original shocker with similar ideas, so why not take the basic plot idea and give it a new title; thus making it a new film. Judged on its own merits, Alexandre Aja's exploitation horror flick is actually a good film, but it loses credibility unnecessarily just because it's a part of the remake crowd. After an explosive beginning which gives you an idea of what Aja intends to do with the remake; the pace relaxes a little as we get to know the doomed family at the centre of the piece. While this may not be very exciting, it pays dividends towards the end when the mutant cannibals start to get their own way. We follow a family who decide to take a holiday that involves driving through the desert. After fuelling their car, the helpful petrol station attendant tells them of a shortcut in the desert; but after they have a crash, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't the only ones amidst the nuclear hills.<br/><br/>Towards the start of the film, Aja packs the film with references to nuclear testing which leads us to believe that he wants to go deeper with the plot. However, by the end it all feels very half-arsed, as apart from a few references towards the mentality of America - these ideas never really bear any fruit. Ted Levine heads a capable cast in a role that is a world away from his turn as Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, and actually feels a lot like a Sid Haig impression. The rest of the cast have some impressive film and TV credits between them, but nobody is a particularly 'big' actor, which actually does this sort of film credit. The real stars of the show are the make-up department, who do a great job with the mutant cannibals. They all look very realistic, and it's easy to believe that the people in the film actually are mutants. The violence and gore is fairly heavy, although Aja is actually quite restrained in this respect, as it only occurs when needed and never goes too over the top. Aja also does well with the scare factor, as he continually creates a foreboding atmosphere by way of lots of scare tactics, including the backwater desert atmosphere, glimpses of the killers early on and my personal favourite - the voices that come over the walkie talkies.<br/><br/>The main reason that this film works is not because of the violence, however, it's the way that Aja almost makes the audience a part of the central family. The characters are all well defined and realistically done; and this means that once we get to the horror of the piece, it really is horrific. Aja does go over the top with this towards the end, but in general the characters are very well defined, and I certainly cared a lot more about the family in this remake than I did in Wes Craven's original. It seems obvious that Alexandre Aja approached this film with care, and he definitely did have a lot to live up to after the surprise hit 'High Tension' the year before. The director certainly has talent, maybe even the potential to become one of the modern masters of horror; but I'm disappointed that this was his second film, as I really think that if he'd created something original, it could have been something really special. The fact that this film feels like an attempt for him to break into the American market is too obvious also. I do have faith that some day he'll top his debut film - but he hasn't done it with this. On its own merits, however, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is a good film, and Aja can certainly be proud of himself for doing Craven's original justice."
"oykas13","6","4","4","12 February 2017"," Another Wrong Gas Station movie
","It always begins with the Wrong Gas Station. In real life, as I pointed out in my review of a previous Wrong Gas Station movie, most gas stations are clean, well-lighted places, where you can buy not only gasoline but groceries, clothes, electronic devices, Jeff Foxworthy CDs and a full line of Harley merchandise. In horror movies, however, the only gas station in the world is located on a desolate road in a godforsaken backwater. It is staffed by a degenerate who shuffles out in his coveralls and runs through a disgusting repertory of scratches, splittings, chewing, twitching and leering, while thoughtfully shifting mucus up and down his throat.<br/><br/>The clean-cut heroes of the movie, be they a family on vacation, newlyweds, college students or backpackers, all have one thing in common. They believe everything this man tells them, especially when he suggests they turn left on the unpaved road for a shortcut. Does it ever occur to them that in this desolate wasteland with only one main road, it must be the road to stay on if they ever again want to use their cell phones?<br/><br/>No. It does not. They take the fatal detour, and find themselves the prey of demented mutant incestuous cannibalistic gnashing slobbers, who carry pickaxes the way other people carry umbrellas. They occupy junkyards, towns made entirely of wax, nuclear waste zones and Motel Hell (""It takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Vincent's fritters""). That is the destiny that befalls a vacationing family in ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which is a very loose remake of Wes Craven's 1977 movie of the same name.<br/><br/>The Carter family is on vacation. Dad (Ted Levine) is a retired detective who plans to become a security guard. Mom is sane, lovable Kathleen Quinlan. A daughter and son in law (Vinessa Shaw and Aaron Stanford) have a newborn babe. There are also two other Carter children (Dan Byrd and Emilie DE Ravin), and two dogs, named Beauty and Beast. They have hitched up an Airstream and are on a jolly family vacation through the test zones where 331 atmospheric nuclear tests took place in the 1950s and 1960s.<br/><br/>After the Carters turn down the wrong road, they're fair game for the people who are the eyes of the hills. These are descendants of miners who refused to leave their homes when the government ordered them away from the testing grounds. They hid in mines, drank radioactive water, reproduced with their damaged DNA, and brought forth mutants, who live by eating trapped tourists. There is an old bomb crater filled with the abandoned cars and trucks of their countless victims. It is curiously touching, in the middle of this polluted wasteland, to see a car that was towing a boat that still has its outboard motor attached. No one has explained what the boat was seeking at that altitude.<br/><br/>The plot is easily guessed. Ominous events occur. The family makes the fatal mistake of splitting up; dad walks back to the Wrong Gas Station, while the dogs bark like crazy and run away, and young Bobby chases them into the hills. Meanwhile, the mutants entertain themselves by passing in front of the camera so quickly you can't really see them, while we hear a loud sound, halfway between a swatch and a swatch, on the soundtrack. Just as a knife in a slasher movie can make a sharpening sound just because it exists, so do mutants make swatches and swatches when they run in front of cameras.<br/><br/>I received some appalled feedback when I praised Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005), but I admired two things about it: (1) It desired to entertain and not merely to sicken, and (2) its depraved killers were individuals with personalities, histories and motives. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" finds an intriguing setting in ""typical"" fake towns built by the government, populated by mannequins and intended to be destroyed by nuclear blasts. But its mutants are simply engines of destruction. There is a misshapen creature who coordinates attacks with a walkies-talkie; I would have liked to know more about him, but no luck.<br/><br/>Nobody in this movie has ever seen a Dead Teenager Movie, and so they don't know (1) you never go off alone, (2) you especially never go off alone at night, and (3) you never follow your dog when it races off barking insanely, because you have more sense than the dog. It is also possibly not a good idea to walk back to the Wrong Gas Station to get help from the degenerate who sent you on the detour in the first place.<br/><br/>It is not faulty logic that derails ""The Hills have Eyes,"" however, but faulty drama. The movie is a one-trick pony. We have the eaters and the ea-tees, and they will follow their destinies until some kind of desperate denouement, possibly followed by a final shot showing that It's Not Really Over, and there will be a ""The Hills Have Eyes II."" Of course, there was already ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" (1985), but then again there was ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977) and that didn't stop them. Maybe this will. Isn't it pretty to think so."

","A remake it was... yes a remake, and of a classic horror movie too that  was good enough as it was, however... in a world of terrible remakes  and sequels, this was something that was far from terrible.  I would like to say first and foremost, that I was pleased with Aja's  first film ""High Tension"", the man has talent, and he put it to good  use here: A gory, insane, slasher type horror thriller that was the  opposite of cheesy. It really was creepy, and that is extremely hard to  do these days. It had great character structure, you can identify with  and care for the people who are going through this hell. Not many  horror movies do that, it's not even their job, however, it worked for  this film.   now that we know the character structure was believable, The story, oh  yes, the story itself, which we already seen in the original, was a bit  far fetched... but it was interesting and thrilling. In a way,  believable, because there wasn't much of anything in the movie  happening that one would refer to as bull****  like what tends to  happen in most of the rather bad films they make nowadays.   Great fight scenes, well choreographed, great realistic, really  disturbingly graphic looking gore FX, the acting for both the victims  and the killers all done well by these mostly relatively newer, lesser  known actors, who all did great jobs at portraying.   All that I can say about this film, in my humble opinion is: one of the  thrilling, more fun horror films that has came out in the past few  years. Right on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this beats the hell  out of crap like the Ring, The Grudge, Boogeyman, The Fog and other  watered down, pussified horror remakes. If you want scary, than see  this film. But I must warn thee: It is definitely not for the faint of  heart, so leave the littl eones at home."

They look terrifying, they murder and cannibalize their victims and communicate mostly in grunts. They are in fact so over the top, so hideously deformed, that there is no sense of reality to their existence.

They are so fictionalized, so distanced from our reality, that they exist outside of it and are rendered harmless to the viewers.<br/><br/>Watching this film I was reminded of Tobe Hooper's horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which I consider to be one of the most frightening films ever made. What makes it so frightening is not the attractive teens being picked off one by one, what is frightening are that film's monsters; Leatherface and his family. They are a family, just like the family everyone has. We can instantly relate to them, which makes the fact that they are murderous cannibals truly horrifying because the film intimately drags the viewer into their world. Family is a safety zone, and to destroy such a comfort as family the way The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did is quite terrifying.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes attempts to play up this same kind of familial terror, but fails. The family of monsters are, of course, all hideously deformed. We are given glimpses of a matronly figure, and are introduced to a giant-headed father figure who doles out the orders. Yet there is no sense that this family is connected, that they are functional, that they are even human. The viewer therefore cannot relate and therefore cannot be as terrified as the filmmaker thinks we should be.<br/><br/>Yet one more reason why the film fails in creating horror is that it paints the monsters as victims. In the original, the murderous mutants were simply murderous mutants, but in the remake they are victims of Big Government testing. We are shown a graveyard where the mutants laid to rest the victims of the nuclear testing, we are constantly made aware of the horrible effects the testing had on those who linger on (even getting glimpses of mutant children--not children, poor things!). If we can feel pity for the monsters in even the slightest ways, then they are no longer as monstrous and the horror is no longer as horrifying.<br/><br/>On to the much publicized gore of the film. The blood flows freely as a woman's organs are consumed in front of her son, a man is burned alive, fingers are chopped off and pickaxes plunge into craniums. This use of excessive gore adds nothing to the films, in fact it distracts from it. By having so much violence, so much ridiculously elaborate gore, the film creates a bloody other world for the film to exist in. The viewers are not part of this world, so they cannot be frightened by it.<br/><br/>In summation The Hills Have Eyes fails completely as a horror film. Its creations of monsters is over the top, as is the violence and Emilie De Ravin's American accent. At an hour and 48 minutes (unrated cut) this film is not worth your time. Rent the original or better yet rent Texas Chainsaw and see how a horror film should be made."

","Another remake, another waste of everyone's time. Hollywood has become a thrift store for tired plots. Take this garbage movie for example: A family takes a road trip. Guess what happens next? The car breaks down! Guess what happens next? Psycho mutants pick off family members one by one. Guess what happens next? A main character emerges from among the survivors and proceeds to decimate the mutants in ludicrous fashion. It's like The Evil Dead meets an even crappier version of The Evil Dead with mutants modeled after that ugly fellow from The Goonies.<br/><br/>Lame.<br/><br/>And now, here's everything I hated about the movie's premise. First of all, why is it that Hollywood believes that radiation makes you some sort of super mutant? Shouldn't the victims just get cancer or radiation sickness? But the baddies in this film weren't merely free of such maladies; they were, in fact, enhanced with physical strength and apparent resistance to shot gun blasts, 80 foot falls, and pick axes to the lungs. Second, even if radiation could give you super powers, what about radiation provokes a primal urge to kill normal-looking people--and only normal-looking people? Why didn't these rabid uglies ever turn on each other? Does radiation poisoning lead to strong communal bonds or something? Third, if the mutants have not been eating each other and only been dining on unsuspecting vacationers, then are we to assume that they've been eating an entire family of ""normals"" each month since the fifties? AND, they've been reproducing--instead of having been left sterile? Fourth, Doug and Bob abandon their defenseless family to seek out help--and Doug's instructions are to just wander aimlessly until he stumbles upon someone able to provide assistance. Like someone who has a gun, perhaps. Like Bob, who just goes of by himself like the macho lone wolf no one needs in this predicament. <br/><br/>By the way, only Republicans can use guns, apparently. Thanks for the political commentary, Hills Have Eyes.<br/><br/>Unredeemable characters making unredeemable decisions. The most respectable protagonist was the dog.<br/><br/>Taking a cue from the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wolf Creek, and The Devil's Rejects, the monsters were--surprise--rednecks. What is this trope? Do people in Hollywood think country people are frightening? Granted, rednecks irritate me just as much as the next guy, but I'm tired of seeing these cousin-diddlers in every single horror flick committed to film these days.<br/><br/>This movie was God-awful. I went to see it in hopes it would at least be enjoyable in the ""it's so bad it's funny"" sorry of way, but I was just left with deep regret and self-loathing."

","I am a big fan of horror movies and have am fairly good at watching gore. I went into this movie expected a bloody, slightly frivolous, but fun, movie. I left about an hour into it crying hysterically and about to vomit. Bloody deaths are one thing, but watching a father being burned alive at the stake while his teenage daughter is being raped by mutants and his other daughter is having her breast milk sucked out of her by another mutant who is holding her BABY AT GUNPOINT is another. I was getting my coat when the girls' mother comes into the trailer to defend her daughters and gets shot in the chest by the mutant with her (now crisp) husband's gun. I was too distraught to ask for my money back but I wish I had. The ""blood bath"" in this film was not-only excessive, but offensive. If this movie had an underlying message behind the deaths, I may have been able to objectively quantify the film, but gruesomeness for the sake of shock value alone is not worth $9.50 and my Friday night."

","Congratulations!<br/><br/>You are either a) a witness of this movie b) a person to be informed about it<br/><br/>ad) a): I am curious how you liked it?! Are you on of those who liked it? Or one of the couple of total dislikers? Well, opinions about this kind of film are impossible to judge. <br/><br/>ad) b): It is hard to find words for it. Let me tell you my first viewing experience: I went with my girlfriend to see it in the theaters. I guess, one could choose a more convenient flic to watch with your girl, maybe. But the interesting part was, we both fell asleep after an hour. From time to time I woke up by the actions scenes with its special gabba sound. And I never fall asleep in movies. It felt like having a disturbing nightmare with you realizing it is just a very strange surrounding. My girlfriend and I left the movie before the ending slightly amused about this surrealist trip. 1 year later I held the ""The Hills have Eyes"" in my hands in my local DVD store recalling the special movie experience in the theaters. The gabba music scenes finally got me interested in re-watching it. Maybe I had fallen asleep because of working too much? A second analysis should clearify my opinion....<br/><br/>My ""objective"" observations:<br/><br/><ul><li>The nuclear testing areas have mostly been cleared in the USA. The rest is heavily guarded by military area (I've been there, no way to get in unless you like to be arrested by the military or shot) Sounds realistic that common people just walk in there... - The nuclear ignition grounds, like the ones the democrat walks into, may still exist. But the radioactive dust you inhale there would kill you within several days/hours (depending on the kind of nuclear bomb). Guess why the scientists/technicians wore suits and gas masks to explore the area that were obviously not even the ignition grounds. - The politically satirical parts with the gun raising republicans and the gun-hating democrat are attempts to bring some wits or laughs in the movie. Except from that, there is absolutely no (funny) message. - Brutality: Showing the gas station guy blasting his head of in detail, burning a man alive, raping a teenager by two guys, aiming a gun at a baby. I have seen many gory movies but this one really showed it all - in total detail. Some movie makers have the talent to present brutality either in ""funny"" way (""Braindead"") or in a way that tells you brutality is not at all funny (""Platoon""). The first kind is a parody/satire, the second kind is criticism. But this movie fails for both categories. - Music/Sound is a necessary tool to stimulate a movie's atmosphere. Listen to the action sequences and you know what I mean. I think, this added perfectly to make the sadistic and gory scenes even more extreme. There seems no limit to this visual and acoustic slaughterhouse. - The storyline is so low, you can tell it in 2 Minutes. Typical logic of splatter movies with mutants without any logical explanations (it is the nature of this special horror genre) No explanations of the character's motivations, the scenery and the plot framework. Of course not, this movie only focuses on visual/acoustic experience: a movie expressing unexplainable homicide - and ONLY that. </li></ul><br/><br/>One remarkable scene is the following: The giant mutant gets killed by the democrat sticking the American flag in his neck. This is the only scene that has symbolic character: The US have nailed these victims of nuclear testing. Apart from that, don't expect any further stylistic elements.<br/><br/>In terms of entertainment in its basic sense this movie has not totally failed: I have to admit that it did not at all bore me, there was a certain fascination how far a movie can go. At least it keeps you wondering how the intensity of physical violence can still be increased (Thought this would be impossible after having watched ""The Thing"")Maybe showing the raping scene in pornographic detail and killing the baby with a shot in the head could be worth another remake. The next increase can only be taking an axe yourself... In terms of ""quality"" of a movie (I don't mean high cost CGI effects or expensive cast) the films fails on all lines:<br/><br/><ul><li>no imaginatory power - no real suspense - too high paced cutting - poor cinematography - poor acting - poor plot - senseless violence - stereotype choice of soundtrack</li></ul><br/><br/>To sum up: Apart from the ""meta-entertainment"" of the brutality experience, ""The Hills have Eyes"" is the worst I have ever seen. It succeeded in topping another all-time-worst-movie (unfortunately forgot the title). The worst about it is, that some people really like it. Enjoy!"

","now I've seen the original and I've seen the remake, and i gotta tell ya it's becoming a trend to make horrible remakes of original movies. Let's use Dawn of the Dead for example, the original was great because it focused on surviving from a horde of undead flesh eating monsters. But what kills it in the new one is the fact that the zombies....run. Zombies do 2 things, shuffle and eat. That's what made them scary, you could run away from a bunch of them, point and laugh, then look behind you and there'd be 100 more, making them run ruins it. But back to this pile of garbage called a remake of a classic. It's really almost the same movie only they tried to add a back story and just put in items that are in the same time period. Hey genius', what made the old ones great is that they were simple, family lost in desert attacked by weirdos. But this one ""ooh they didn't wanna leave this nuclear test site and now we're freaks, whaaa"" Oh, and also to reiterate just how horrible this movie was, I asked a bunch of people why they wanted to see it and you know what the told me? ""Oh I wanna see it because it has a rape scene in it"". Is that what this world has come to? Is that how low we've evolved to as human beings? That some retards actually WANT to see a woman carnally assaulted? I pray for you people, that in some small hope that you go beyond that mind set. -2 stars."

"beamerm3","1","31","62","18 March 2006"," Pretty Useless
","The first problem with this movie is the characters. None are likable. In fact, the script seems to go out of its way to make sure every single character is annoying. You never really care for any. Towards the end you might, but only because the characters stop talking. The movie then depends upon the charisma of the actors, which thankfully they have. Somewhat. Don't expect any characteristics from the mutants, though. Bloodthirsty, nothing else. Hell, they're obviously breeding, but there's only one female capable of it. Plot holes!<br/><br/>The second problem with this movie is the heavy-handed politics. They feel contrived, forced, and too blatant. The family is full of ultra-conservatives. Gun loving, God fearing republicans. Except for the one democrat, though. Sure, he's the most annoying of the bunch, very whiny, but suddenly you know where he'll stand. All of this would be fine if the politics were either subtle or crucial to the plot. They're neither. In fact, they almost entirely drop away. It feels like a desperate attempt for depth, but comes across as terribly contrived.<br/><br/>The last problem is the action. Very little. The first half of the movie is painful. Nothing happens. All you get is annoying conversation and dumb decisions. The second half picks up, with a couple of good gore effects, but... meh. There's only one interesting action sequence. <br/><br/>If you want to go to a movie and turn your brain off and see gore this is maybe a 5 out of 10. Worth seeing, but not good. Unfortunately the director decided to add ""depth"" to the movie, meaning he wants you to think. The movie does not stand up to any form of scrutiny, regardless of your political views. It's just terrible. For the record, though, I thought High Tension was poor as well. Decently directed, but plot holes abound. This is a much worse movie. Not directed quite as well, much more boring, and not a single character worth caring about."

","The Hills Have Eyes 2006 remake is an instant CLASSIC!!!
The 70's wes craven original CLASSIC is obviously excellent but the remake makes everything abit better, scarier & a sense of more gritty realism, it's terrifying.
I'm not knocking the original 70's Classic as I'm a huge fan & think it's a Horror classic too, it's just the remake ups everything including the tense dread filled atmosphere & the savage mutant attacks, it's a blood soaked masterpiece of a remake & is genuinely terrifying, both films make for an excellent double bill.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is so on the edge & full of dread, it's actually scary as hell without any silly comic moments, it's all kept tight,serious & tense.
The cast is superb, that goes for everyone in this movie!!!<br/><br/>The desert setting is terrifying & lonely, the mutants are absolutely terrifying & extremely savage.
This is a brutal,raw survival Horror with intensely filmed action scenes & fight scenes that are horrifying.<br/><br/>The whole mutant town scene is truly terrifying!!!
This is as raw & savage as these survival slashers can get along with the also outstanding Texas chainsaw massacre remake (2003) & the extremely underrated Horror Gem ""Borderland 2007""<br/><br/>This is a bloody slaughter house of a movie with scary cannibal mutants slicing up anyone they can get & ordinary people rising to be heroic.<br/><br/>A brilliant Horror masterpiece with intense performances & shocking gore.
Aaron Stanford gives the most powerful, intense & ferocious performance in the movie as ""Doug"" a timid geek type of guy until his wife is murdered & his baby is taken, then he become a savage vigilante warrior who brutally fights back against the mutant hillbillies & it's fantastic to watch!!! It's one of the greatest performances in the Horror genre & his character ""Doug"" is easily one of the greatest in the Horror genre!!!
Doug becomes as tough as Evil Dead's ""Ash"" as he goes through hell to get his baby back & as heroic as ""Mad Max"" by the end of the movie!!!
It's a standout stunningly raw performance.
Aaron Stanford is so great to watch fighting these monsters to save his baby, pure Horror & one of the greatest Horror movie hero performances of all time,
Just watch the tense as hell fight scene between him & Pluto, it's a terrifying & raw savage fight for your life sequence, one of the best fights in cinema history.
The Hills Have Eyes is truly a modern Horror MASTERPIECE."

","Three generations of the Carter family - father Bob, mom Ethel and their kids, Brenda, Bobby, Lynne, Lynne's husband Doug and their baby Catherine - are driving across the New Mexico desert en route to San Diego. Looking to cut some time off of their drive they unwisely follow the directions given them by the slightly creepy gas station owner and head out onto a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Unbeknownst to the Carter's, another family lives in the high desert hills, a clan of irradiated mutant cannibals who set a clever trap for the Carter's. One minor car crash later, the Carter's are stranded in the middle of nowhere. Bob Sr. and Doug head off in opposite direction looking for help, leaving the women and children alone. When night falls, the cannibals descend upon the Carter's, raping, killing and stealing baby Catherine away. What's left of the Carter's must now become as savage as their tormentors if they want to survive and get the baby back.<br/><br/>This is a shockingly faithful remake in some ways and an entirely new story in others. Fans of the original film will be happy to see that the storyline does not deviate very far from Wes Craven's original tale, but fans of Aja will be quite pleased with the gratuitous gore on display as pick-axes, baseball bats and even po'd German shepherds are used as weapons. The film is very bloody and tense with a grim, filthy atmosphere; you can almost smell the rotting body parts. Everyone turns in great performances despite some moments of clunky dialog. The desolate scenery is a character all its own; hellishly hot and red, littered with vultures and crows. <br/><br/>My only major gripe with this film was that not a lot of time was spent with the cannibal family. They don't have a lot of dialog and what they do have isn't the greatest. The idea of Family Versus Family that was so prevalent in the original film is missing here, and instead it's Family Versus Monsters. Which is fine, but as a fan of the original, I really would have liked to see the mutants interact with each other more and been given a sense of their family dynamics. And Billy Drago, perhaps the most severely underrated actor of his time, has perhaps three minutes screen time total and one line of dialog despite the fact that his name is in the opening credits and he's playing Jupiter, the head of the mutant family. Will somebody PLEASE give Billy Drago some decent screen time for gods sake! <br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy this remake very much. It was impressively faithful, but it was also willing to present some new ideas. The script is idiotic in several places and there's some downright silly music towards films end, but these are perhaps petty gripes on my part. All in all, it's a fun two hours of blood, scares and horror. As far as remakes go, this is one of the better ones I've seen.<br/><br/>It may take place in 95 but this film feels very 70s-ish; gritty, brutal and nasty. Fans of the original will want to see it at least once, as will fans of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn.<br/><br/>Pretty good."

","Plot: A family taking a road trip to celebrate the mother and father's silver anniversary run afoul of another type of nuclear family, one that is cannibalistic and mutated.<br/><br/>Alexandre (High Tension) Aja wrote and directed this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven (who is attached as a producer) semi-classic. It sticks pretty much to the source material story-wise. Almost all of the original is replicated here but a few new wrinkles were thrown into the mix mostly having to do with Jupiter's clan and their origins. A little bit of a political slant is thrown in for good measure but it's not awfully heavy-handed and most will glance over it. The remake turns up the style quite a bit over the original no surprise considering the better budget and change in directors. The gore got bumped up significantly and the family looks more disgusting than ever. Now for the big question, how does it stack up to the original?. I say it did pretty well. The original had it's flaws as well as this one but I think they were both done honestly and Aja did an excellent job trying to pay homage to the original and breathe more life into it. The acting is as good as you'd expect with a pretty good cast. Lovers of the original should be OK with it, I am.<br/><br/>Both the original and the remake score a 7.5 or 8 on my scale."

","Oddly, I'd been having a conversation with a bloke I met in a pub about Straw Dogs just before I saw this film  and it does have echoes of that film. The gruelling, exhausting horrific scenes that make the audience start to want the protagonists to take revenge; as well as the bespectacled liberal(ish) hero who is driven to violence.<br/><br/>PROPER SPOILERS COMING SOON<br/><br/>Which isn't to say this won't satisfy horror fans. The opening is a refreshing change from the usual slow build-up dynamic we are (sort of) used to scary films employing in their first few minutes. And although there is black humour, this is a proper horror film that doesn't wink at its audience. Most of the deaths are seen as a wrenching events that tear at the fabric of the family we are on a journey with. So there are real seeming consequences to violence - not just a cast who it's fun to see being killed one-by-one. <br/><br/>And there's a political sub-text, for those that want it. In the scene where the protagonist walks through the model village used for nuclear testing, it's like an eerie ghost town - spooky: but we are also reminded, I think, that the brutality we've witnessed in the film could be chicken-feed to the horrors rational governments once considered inflicting on the civilian population of other countries. And there are parallels with more recent events. I don't want to say too much but the film does explore the effects taking revenge has on us; and the notion that we are responsible for creating our enemies. There's a scene where someone finds an inventive use for an American flag that could be read in two very different ways.<br/><br/>Maybe the beers I'd had with the Straw Dogs man made me a soft touch but apart from a few missteps (the last shot punch-line) this was a film worth thinking about."

"manchester_england2004","1","10","17","30 May 2009"," Cinematic torture!
","This movie is cinematic torture. The original 1977 version was far from being a masterpiece, but it far beats this nonsense.<br/><br/>The 2006 version is a typical 2000s remake filled with boring characters, speeded-up action scenes, endless usage of the f-word in regular conversations, characters becoming hysterical with little provocation and very bad CGI effects.<br/><br/>As I've said already, the original was far from great. But it had a few great scenes that really stood out. When the old guy got burnt in the original, the scene was very intense and conveyed emotion. In this version, the old guy's death was executed too quickly to have any meaning to the rest of the movie and his family soon forgot all about him. Just about every other killing in the movie was executed this way.<br/><br/>The villains in the original were scary and menacing because they were so unpredictable and their initial appearance came as a complete surprise. In the 2006 version, the appearance of the villains was telegraphed well in advance. Even more surprisingly, the villains were acting even more hysterically than the main characters, choosing to smash up furniture and other objects for no reason. They were too laughable too be scary, but unfortunately they couldn't bring the movie up (or should it be down) to the ""so bad it's good"" level.<br/><br/>In the original movie, a lot of effort was put in to create atmosphere during the set-up scenes for the main action. In the remake there is no atmosphere at all and because we get to see the ENTIRE desert landscape around where our protagonists are camping out it must be rather obvious to them whether or not some weirdo was hanging around. It was due to stupid behaviour on the part of the protagonists that they got killed. Most of them were so annoying that I was actually rooting for the villains to dispatch them as soon as possible.<br/><br/>A baby was used by the producers to help create emotion from the viewers. Unfortunately, there are very few occasions when the baby appears to be in any serious danger of being harmed, thus killing any nail-biting tension that could have been developed. In the end, one of the ""villains"" turns out to be so human and compassionate that she saves the baby.<br/><br/>The remake is devoid of any suspense. Camera angles show us too much, thus killing countless opportunities for suspense that was available. Action scenes (i.e. the best parts) were speeded-up, killing the intensity, and the rest of the time the movie plodded along at a snail's pace with endless boring conversations and poor acting. In short, potential was wasted.<br/><br/>For a decent movie with a similar theme, see WRONG TURN. Or even better see the masterpiece that really kick-started this particular strand of the genre - THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.<br/><br/>Wes Craven so desperately wanted to improve upon his original 1977 movie and create something worthy of his talents like he did when he made the excellent movies THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, SCREAM and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. With THE HILLS HAVE EYES, he failed miserably. Hopefully he'll be back on track when he makes the next movie."

Its frustration and disbelief anyone could be that stupid. If you can swallow that kind of idiocy, and are either terrified of gorror, or amused by it, this film might be for you. I suppose it's the perfect gorror film, because it is the epitome of one, but if you are sick to death of the usual horror clichés like ""let's split up"", and ""run away and hide when the killer is vulnerable"" type crap, do yourself a favor and skip this one, it's drowning in it."

"rmax304823","2","6","9","8 September 2007"," Nice idea. Movie: One long execution.
","Great location shooting -- a windswept old model town, right out of a Twilight Zone episode, that was used as an atomic testing site. I love it when naive characters wander around in a deserted little settlement, discovering the mannequins and other left-overs from the era of atomic testing. There's a certain thrill in it all, which might be called ""the last people on earth"" arousal jag. The New Mexico desert is tinted a delicate yellow and is thoroughly windswept, inviting exploration. As a kid I spent a summer along with a handful of Coast Guardsmen at the closed Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The entire fort had been closed down and left exactly as it was except no locks on anything, like an empty movie set -- the mile long lines of barracks, the administration buildings, the hospital (with stained slides still lined up neatly on the shelves). It made your hair stand on end to wander at will through a community that was completely silent and empty. (Of course, now, anybody can do it by walking through downtown Los Angeles on a weekend.) I stumbled across a heap of discarded, live 20 millimeter cannon shells and, not realizing that live ammo of such age might be unstable, began juggling the things like a circus performer. That's kind of the story of this movie except the ammo assumes explosive human form. Five or six people in their trailer-towing van have a flat tire and wind up looking through the phony community they've discovered. It's an involving experience until the mutated zombies show up and then it turns into an unusually gory and revolting slash fest.<br/><br/>What a wasted opportunity. What could have been a great Twilight Zone story becomes just another movie with angry, made-up, el freakos, trapping and killing half the visitors in the most repugnant fashion and the survivors retaliating in kind. The camera lingers with relish on one of the deformed creeps (they all look different except for their bad teeth) who has just had a wooden stake thrust into his belly. To the accompaniment of a sound like a glue pot, the creature looks down at the protruding handle, says, ""Huh?"", and then pulls it out with what I think was intended to be an evil smile. You see, in order to really KILL the things, you have to do some REAL damage -- whack them through the head with an ax, jump off a cliff with them, blow them to smithereens in an explosion. The killings are not only an insult to the human body but to the human intelligence as well. (The escapees are literally drenched in blood by the end.) And yet that's what the movie is ABOUT.<br/><br/>There's no attempt to reach the audience above the abdominal level. It has nothing to say about atomic bombs or the wonder of the exotic. It might as well be taking place with half a dozen kids trapped in a mausoleum full of ghouls, a variation on a theme that was old a long time ago, only this time around the special effects are excruciating.<br/><br/>Of course it's always nice to see Kathleen Quinlan, but the acting here consists almost entirely of screams. And the young men, who ought to be able to take care of themselves, are incredibly stupid. One of them is being chased through the desert by a mutant who is equally light of foot. The kid is armed with an automatic. As he sprints and stumbles along he points the pistol behind him and fires wildly without looking until he empties his weapon. The viewer's heart races alarmingly.<br/><br/>Maybe you'll enjoy seeing zombies/ghouls/rotting corpses/mutants slaughtering innocent people in the bloodiest way imaginable. It wasn't my kind of film. I thought it sucked. But -- if I can end on a constructive note -- for anyone who wants to see an ax murderer at work, almost equally bloody but amounting to far more than an upper-torso exercise, they might try ""The Weight of Water."" If you don't like challenges, of course, then skip it."

","This remake of the Wes Craven classic is nowhere near as good. Certainly it has some great moments and visual images and the idea of a ""modern"" family having to fight off a family of savages is a frightening one, but some where along the way it lost its teeth. Certainly the fact that the studio asked that some of the more subversive touches of the original (baby for dinner anyone?) be trimmed doesn't help. It also doesn't help that this film has inspired countless remakes an homages over the last 30 years. Worse, I don't know how many retreads I saw in the last year. Why remake a film if you're going to de-claw it and then take the same path as every other film maker. Its pointless. Worse its about 20 minutes longer than the original film and as a result this film tends to stagger about for a good while before it seems to get its focus. Its not bad, but the remake is better and more out there. Given the choice, see the original."

She fights for her baby but he ends up holding a GUN to the baby's head. A GUN! to the head of a baby that's not even a year old!!! What happens next??? The freak breast feeds from the woman while pointing a gun at her child.

The mother comes into the trailer and tries to throw a rock at the man molesting her daughter. He shoots her. The older sister stabs him in the leg with a screwdriver, he blows her brains out all over the trailer. By this time, I left.<br/><br/>This movie lacks any integrity.

","My wife recently planned a night out with her girlfriends, so I had the T.V. to myself and the chance to watch some movies she wouldn't want to see. I had a hankering for some good old fashioned vintage porn and a good scary movie, so I rented this, ""Debbie Does Dallas"" and ""Taboo."" Of the three films I rented, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was by far the most pornographic, and the last of the bunch I'd want my child (if I had one) to see.<br/><br/>It astounds me that the MPAA will give a movie like ""9 Songs"" (which does happen to be a lousy movie) an NC-17 rating, virtually guaranteeing that no mainstream movie theatre will carry it, just because it depicts real sex between real people, and then turn around and give a movie like ""Hills"" an R. What kind of sick world do we live in when the sight of penetration is believed to be more damaging to our youth than the sight of people getting axe picks through their heads and their intestines ripped out? And lest you think I'm just a cranky prude, let me say that I love horror movies, and I'm always on the outlook for good ones (""The Descent"" happened to be fantastic) but I've nearly given up hope that today's batch of filmmakers know the first thing about what scares people. I'm not opposed to gore, and I think it can be used effectively (again, ""The Descent""). My objections to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" rest almost entirely on the fact that it's not effective horror. It's gruesome, to be sure, and it does inspire a sort of visceral reaction from the viewer, but so would a car accident. I've not seen the original Wes Craven version, but the film that this most reminded me of, 1974's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" gave me close to the same feeling, except that Tobe Hooper's film is unbelievably scary in addition to being nauseating, and it uses true film-making skills to scare the pants off of you, not simply digitally enhanced makeup and sound effects.<br/><br/>It depresses me that there's a market for movies like ""The Hills Have Eyes."" I must be getting older, because I'm starting to worry about the state of our country's youth. Doesn't anyone have the attention span anymore to be scared by a clever, psychological thriller, or even a sophisticated slasher film like ""Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Halloween,"" where your imagination did the work that computers do now? Horror movies used to be fun -- now they're just exhausting. I used to come away from then scared but exhilarated -- now I come away just feeling bad. It's hard to have fun in a movie that shows a woman's baby being held at gunpoint so that a sadistic mutant can suck on her boobs, and then shoot her in the head anyway; or in which a boy comes across the body of his dead mother being disemboweled and eaten. <br/><br/>I don't believe that anyone should be stopped from making films like this; I just wish people would have the brains to stop wanting to see them.

You have the familiar story of the slightly dysfunctional family who become trapped in the least-liked place in the world. How do you scare us? Throw in mutant cannibals! Truly original and highly unexpected. The directing was phenomenal compared to the other crap we receive from horror films *cough**cough* ""Silent Hill"". The acting is truly believable. I was even stunned to find that veteran actors such as Ted Levine were totally committed to this project. Also, the make-up...friggin' creepy and it works!

","The last decade really has been something of a nadir where American film making is concerned . Remakes and sequels dominate the multiplexes and things show signs of getting worse .

Hollywood was once a dream factory except the dreams in real life quickly fade while Hollywood dreams remain for eternity - at least in theory . I'll say one good thing about Hollywood studios and that is they've never had the insane temerity to remake the likes of ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and CASABLANCA . Please for the love of humanity don't remake these masterpieces . But I have nightmares that it's only a matter of time <br/><br/>This film is a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film and my expectations were not high . I'd seen the remake of THE OMEN a few days previously and did have the consolation that Craven's film isn't a firm favourite so French director Alexandre Aja should feel free to totally ruin his remake and there was no way he could emulate the nakedly lazy shot by shot recreation of THE OMEN directed by John Moore <br/><br/>Perhaps "" pleasantly surprised "" is the wrong phrase because there's very little here that can be called pleasant . It's a horror film and a rather stomach churning one at that . Despite an original opening scene the screenplay follows the same basic plot as the original as a family camping in the remote New Mexico desert find themselves under mortal peril . Aja has kept the most memorable scene from the original where a mutant does an Ozzy Osbourne on a budgie <br/><br/>After this the remake starts going its own way and develops the back story of who the villains are , something that from memory the original didn't . The mutants are descended from miners who refused to leave their town during the atomic tests of the 1950s . They are literally monsters in a remote wilderness and the make up effects are very good , especially one wretched creature who due to the size of his head is unable to leave his chair <br/><br/>As the narrative continues director Aja ratchets up the gore level and brutality to the maximum , some of which is rather stomach churning . It's not a film for the faint of heart but doesn't pretend to be and fans of the "" backwoods brutality "" sub-genre of horror will certainly like it"
"nightair86","1","8","14","23 July 2010"," The ""horror"" genre has descended to base obscenity
","Whatever happened to scary horror films? I mean films that actually make you feel afraid as opposed to films that sicken you with their depravity. For me, scary horror films are ones like the originals of psycho, alien, the exorcist and poltergeist. These were truly scary, clever pieces of art that thrilled us with the director's ability to scare the bejesus out of us through plot, script, music, acting and special effects. True masterpieces of the genre.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes, (and its predecessor and successor versions) and the other depraved films like Last House on the Left (both versions) rely on rank perversion and unnecessary depravity to achieve their ""shock value"". They are not, in my opinion, scary or fear-inspiring; they are simply depraved to the sickest degree.<br/><br/>Have movie makers lost the ability to be creatively scary in their art? Must every 'horror"" film that is made now have to include young, virginal girls being repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted in the most perverted fashions? Raped by escaped psychopaths and mutants, new mothers having their lactating breasts suckled upon, girls being forced to have sex with each other by their captors, female soldiers being penetrated from behind by hulking mutant monsters,.... it goes on and on.<br/><br/>If you want a movie that explores the ""horror"" of rape, then I recommend you view The Accused from 1988 with Jodie Foster as the lead. It is a moving film which shocks its viewer without relying on the excessive perversion that is so typical of the Hills Have Eyes style of film. One wonders what ""new"" depravities will be created by modern horror film makers. Perhaps now the psychopaths and mutants will employ their pets and animals to ravish the young maidens who are presented for violation. <br/><br/>And, just in case you still harbour illusions that these scenes are anything but sexual exploitation, have you noticed that all the victims are young, attractive females?"

While sticking closely to the original's plot, there are a few new twists added to the concept. The monsters aren't really fleshed out, but their past is given more of an explanation. The film is also gorier than the original. Again, this is more of an update tactic. Dan Byrd turns in another fine performance as does Emilie De Ravin. Ted Levine is appropriately gruff as the father. The monsters seem very interchangeable. Its obvious that there are several of them, but they have no personalities like they did in the original.

It was like someone had stopped the ride. I didn't have to be subjected to something just because I was in the middle of the row. I got up and walked out, too.<br/><br/>According to my friends, the rest of the movie was mostly predictable. The ending a little less so. The four of us went outside and started chatting.<br/><br/>""I wanted to walk out when you did,"" my sister explained, ""but I wanted to know what happened. I wanted to see the people triumph."" ""They went too far,"" was all I could say.<br/><br/>At this moment, all I feel like doing is calling the director and the writer(s) of that movie and telling them that every penny they make off that movie is blood money. That they didn't create the kind of movie that scares you and then slowly fades away when you step outside the theater. That the monsters in the movie aren't mutated miners  that the REAL monsters in the movie are all named in the credits.<br/><br/>I may not be able to get back the $6.50 I spent to be violated on a Friday night, but I hope I can do one small things. I can stop other people from making the same mistake. Don't go The Hills Have Eyes. It's disgusting. And PLEASE don't go see it JUST to see how DISGUSTING it is.

"Quinoa1984","5","7","12","17 March 2006"," shows what can be good- and not so good- about a remake
","Maybe I shouldn't be looking to making overt comparisons to the Wes Craven 1977 cult film The Hills Have Eyes, of which this Alejandre Aja filmed remake has done over Hollywood style, and just look at it on terms of just being a horror film in and of itself. But even on its own I found this film to just not work for me, even as I recognized things that I admired about it. And maybe it's because I decided to watch the 1977 original earlier this week that that film is so fresh in my mind that I can't help but make comparisons. However, when you are remaking a film that already has a flaw or two, you can either improve, be on par, or just not be as good as that film, or just be so-so on its own terms. Co-writer/director Aja has a film here that does work for its target audience- the young teen horror fan crowd looking for a quick fix of gore and cheap scares done in a somewhat shaky-hand held camera style. But the problem for me was a little more elemental.<br/><br/>For all of Craven's film's shortcomings- mostly by budget and time- was made up for by being a sharply entertaining exploitation flick, building on both the good and evil sides of the characters. This time, Aja is content with making a decent enough set-up for the first half hour or so, and then just plunging the viewer into a kind of checklist horror movie kind of layout. This is not to say he doesn't use the big-studio backup for some good; the makeup by Greg Nicotero on the deformed mutant villains is very cool and creative; the gore factor (not that I was necessarily relying on it for scares, which it didn't really) was very high and well laid out; the performances by the family, for the first half of the film, are believable enough with the dialog. But the problem for me lies in that the second half of the film, where Aja could make this good versus evil struggle scary and intense, into being slightly boring.<br/><br/>Not withstanding the fact that 80% of the original is transplanted (sometimes seemingly with the same shots and angles) into the remake, the new ideas put into the film also aren't launched off with enough to really engage. And then there are the action/bloody horror scenes, where Aja has his fun pitting these quasi super-mutants against our can't-be-beat heroes (one of which seems to survive and fight back with an incredible suspension of disbelief for one), but its not really that per say. So yes, there's more gore than the first go-around, yes, there are some added disturbing elements (i.e. a rape scene, not as disturbing as in some films but gruesome enough), and yes, the twist factor is turned up to 10. But with the turns of the horror-film screw, I just didn't get involved, even in separating myself from the original. And the fact that the mutants are very robotic-like in their pursuit of their semi fish-in-a-barrel takes some of the jump out of some of the could-be scares. It will please many, and if you are just a general horror film fan (and R-rated I mean, it doesn't cheap out on that end) you'll want to check it out). But it's a 'meh' in terms of it being engaging film-making."

","There has to come a point where a line is drawn defining that which is entertainment from pure sadism.<br/><br/>Given that many people will disagree on where exactly that line should be drawn, this movie still manages to go way beyond what any reasonable human being could call entertainment.<br/><br/>Lets be clear, the point of this movie is violence. Any so-called plot is inexpertly slapped on almost as an afterthought it seems. The movie from start to finish is the product of a very sick individual (or individuals) and its my honest belief that using or viewing movies like this as entertainment is extremely unhealthy. There is something very wrong with people who can see this as entertainment and perhaps needs addressing through the realisation that there are positive types of excitement as well as negative ones.<br/><br/>Given the nature of the movie, it is almost impossible to grant it any awards for acting ability, script, effects etc because all of these are deeply overshadowed by the gore and negativity this movie exhibits.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I didn't thank the friend who took me to see this bilge!"

","The Hills Have Eyes is a shock a minute thriller directed by Alexandre Aja. His modern adaptation of Wes Craven's original has had audiences around the world horror struck and terrorized.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes follows a family traveling cross country from Cleveland to California. Big Bob and Ethel Carter are celebrating their 25th Wedding Anniversary along with their kids and their daughter's fiancé and toddler. Naturally, being a horror movie, the get some bad directions and are catapulted into a forsaken 50's nuclear testing zone. Slowly but surely they realize that there are people living in the hills of the sharp, edgy landscape, and all hell ensues. This is a survival film, and how one family invades another's territory; they just happen to be radioactive, cannibal mutants.<br/><br/>This film throws real characters into a beyond belief situation, which some people may find difficult to trust. But for those who are just interested in a good, gripping movie, then this is it. The characters in this feature bring compassion and drive. In particular Doug (Aaron Stanford), a whimsical, spineless, Democrat who provides comic relief when necessary. His relationship with his wife and toddler, Catherine, is one to be admired and is the over all force in the film. He is a character who grows and develops from being the coward we laugh at to being the heroic and intrepid character we cheer for. Stanford's all out performance brought tears to my eyes and gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>His gripping performance is supported by two upcoming young actors, Emilie DeRavin and Dan Byrd,. They play the young adolescent siblings who still get embarrassed by their father's singing. They create another reason why we want this family to survive. Bobby (Byrd)is a lovable teen who only wants the best for his family and is torn between his father's ways and those of Doug. Brenda (DeRavin) is an average teenager who just wants to spend her summer with her friends at the beach. Their realistic acting intensify the story.<br/><br/>This movie is savage, brutal, but also very moving. This is due to an excellent cast, magnificent special effects, interesting script and creative directing. The Hills Have Eyes is probably one of the only remakes that has more of a psychological impact than the original. Wes Craven should be proud.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to those who aren't afraid of blood or mutants. This movie I guarantee will have you scared out of your wits."

","Vile degenerative schlock that passes for horror these days. The great debate between horror fans I suppose will always be is horror supposed to be scary or is it supposed to be shocking and stomach-churning. I favor the former but this is the latter. First, the original movie did not need to be remade. But I realize that argument is a lost cause in this creatively bereft age for films, particularly horror films. Remakes are and have been a constant for the last decade. They almost always are terrible of course and a pale shade of the original film. But it doesn't matter. Money talks and people keep watching these things so they keep being made.<br/><br/>The favorable reviews for this remake seem to mostly drool over the gross, bloody, rapey shock value of it like that is what a good horror film should be about. Clearly there are those who feel that way and as I've stated, I am not one of them. So if you like that sort of thing check it out and become a little bit worse inside. Otherwise avoid it like the plague. This movie offers nothing but degradation."

","After ""High Tension"" my expectations regarding Aja's next movie was very high. I feel fully satisfied and I think that followers of extremely brutal gore flicks from the 1970s will be as well. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a remake of Was Craven's classic slasher. Even though the film is not an exact adaptation, it retains the climate of the original. Alike Aja's previous flick, this one keeps in incessant suspense and daring gory scenes occur, therefore it's not a film aiming at teenagers or people with weak stomach. Furthermore, the plot is well-developed and characters with their well-outlined traits are characteristic and likable. I only would rather they behaved more rationally in some scenes. For instance, the scene when the main hero leaves a gun by his victim is very hackneyed. Nevertheless, the transformation of the main hero who has to radically change his attitude to violence and become 'killing machine' is believable and fully explicable. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is also perfect from the technical side. The film is well-shot on desert location and both mutants' make-up and set design are abominable and great at the same time. All in all, every hardcore horror fan should see this flick."
"bensonmum2","6","12","25","10 March 2006"," A worthy remake
","I've been a fan of the original The Hills Have Eyes since I first saw it during a midnight showing while in college. I had my doubts about the remake, but as I enjoyed Aja's High Tension more than I probably should have, I at least felt the film was in good hands. I still enjoy the 1977 version more, but my faith in Aja as an up and coming player in horror was not misplaced.<br/><br/>The film is very faithful to the plot Craven used in 1977 - a family traveling cross country finds themselves stranded in the desert and under attack from a mutant family living in the nearby hills. There are a few significant changes (the crater full of abandoned vehicles and the nuclear test city) probably due more than anything to a much larger budget, but these changes actually add even more interest and variety to the script.<br/><br/>There's a lot here to enjoy. The acting is great and definitely an improvement over the first film. I especially enjoyed Dan Byrd and Aaron Stanford's performances over the same characters from 1977. The new film is much more graphic than the first film. Aja doesn't skimp when it comes to showing the blood and gore. Aja has done his best to keep the brutality and savagery from the first film in his remake. And, for the most part, he has succeeded. One complaint I've already read on the internet is the movie is too slow. I completely disagree with that statement. I enjoyed the pacing throughout the film. The Hills Have Eyes may start off slow, but it builds to finale full of violence.<br/><br/>But there are a few areas where I had problems with the film. One thing that bothered me was the treatment of the mutant family. They never felt like real characters as there was virtually no character development within the mutant family. They are just there. I was also bothered by some technical aspects involving camera work and editing. The movies features what I consider to be way too many shots filmed with a hand-held camera and edited in a rapid, MTV style. Maybe I'm just getting old, but there were several moments during the film where I wanted to scream at Aja, ""Be still and let me see what's going on"". It was too much for me. Also, I thought the exposition was handled rather clumsily. The preaching like exposition given by the immobile mutant felt forced. Finally, and I realize many will disagree, I enjoy the low-budget look of the original. The look helped to give the movie a feeling that anything could happen. In contrast, Aja's film is much more polished looking. I won't go so far as to call it over-produced, but the look of the movie doesn't add as much atmosphere as the lower budget look.<br/><br/>In the end, while I did have problems with certain aspects of the film, overall The Hills Have Eyes is a solid horror film. Fans of the original should be able to find something here to enjoy that doesn't trample all over their memories of the first film."

","A suburban family who are driving cross country run afoul of a savage mutant clan in the middle of a remote desert. Director Alexander Ahja, who also co-wrote the hard-hitting script with Gregory Levasseur, brings a fierce take-no-prisoners attitude to the harsh and gripping premise, makes fine use of the desolate desert wasteland location, generates plenty of tension, takes time to develop the characters, adeptly crafts a few eerie moments (the crater filled with abandoned automobiles and a ramshackle house that's littered with mannequins rate as especially striking and unsettling set pieces), and delivers a handy helping of unflinchingly graphic gore. The sound acting from the able cast further keeps this film on track: Aaron Stanford as the wimpy Doug, Kathleen Quinlan as the spunky Ethel, Vinessa Shaw as the sweet Lynn, Emilie de Ravin as the perky Brenda, Dan Byrd as the sullen Bobby, and Tom Bower as a grizzled gas station attendant. Moreover, the mutants are quite grotesque and frightening, with Billy Drago as vicious patriarch Papa Jupiter, Robert Joy as the brutish Lizard, and Michael Bailey Smith as hulking beast Pluto registering strongly as the definite scary stand-outs. The startling moments of go-for-the-throat unsparing violence pack a ferocious punch. Both Maxime Alexandre's sharp widescreen cinematography and the shivery score by tomandandy are up to speed. A nice'n'nasty surprise."

","My main intent on watching this film was to see the first movie before the second movie, the hills have eyes 2, comes out. I wasn't expecting more than the average gore fest thats kicked out of Hollywood and given a 'horror' sticker to please your average kid, and strangely enough, this isn't what you get.<br/><br/>The film starts of with the inevitable pulse raising attack of unknown beings, which to be fair wasn't that great, apart from watching scientists being thrown around. Then the film slowly starts trudging through the rather painful back story of the family who are trying to go on holiday, and go on the conveniently placed shortcut.<br/><br/>This was where the film started to get better, with jumpy and slightly queasy villains assaulting the good guys at every chance possible, and once the characters get narrowed down, we are left with a hero.<br/><br/>To be honest i really wasn't expecting the gritty action that followed, but as soon as the movie hits halfway, it turns into a roller-coaster. The action is superb and intense and the enemies ever changing and scaring, this backed up with a score halfway between a spaghetti western and 28 days later and you get what i like to call, the first true survival horror movie.<br/><br/>Sure there has been many attempts at this before, all have failed in my mind, not just because they weren't that great a movies, but they never really had a survival aspect to it, or the ones that did, just lacked horror. This film although laden with 'shock factor' sequences of dead bodies lying about really makes you believe there's a true fight for survival, and one that will make you jump in the most unexpected of times, you even question whether or not the hero will survive, which is great. Since don't you hate knowing in Hollywood nowadays that the big tough guy with the stubble's going to win the day? Or even that other characters are going to bite it? This film always keeps you guessing, jumping and on the edge of your seat. And i'm glad that the first 45 minutes were rather dull, as it brings you into the movie, hoping somethings going to happen, until it does at the worst possible moment.<br/><br/>I hope others enjoyed it as much as i did.

It was delivered to me one morning, i opened it up and looked at the case and read the description on the back of the cover and thought it would be kinda like wrong turn but this film beats wrong turn, but thats my opinion. Anyway the film starts off with flashbacks of the nuclear bomb testing and how they became deformed, then you got the family who we obviously know they are gonna get stalked by the mutants and get slaughtered which is my type of film. I also liked the way Alexandre Aja tells the story of each person of the family, he don't tell you much but its enough to know about them and i definitely liked the way he kept the mutants mysterious until the scene where they attack the caravan, that was awesome and nice and gory just the way i like it.<br/><br/>If its blood, gore and suspense you want in a film then you have to buy or rent this film, close the curtains, turn the lights off and just have fun.<br/><br/>I personally found this film bloody brilliant and give Alexandre's remake of the hills have eyes a 10/10.

Think of all the people working on this film, the time it took from their lives, and the chunks of the Earth's crust that went into creating it and you have to stop and wonder, what the hell good could it possibly do? Well, one quick answer is that audiences are treated--though all too briefly--to the beautifully talented Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan. Remember Ted Levine as the beastly bad dude in ""Silence of the Lambs""? He receives his filmic revenge here when the cannibalistic mutants have at him.<br/><br/>So, aside from the veterans Levine and Quinlan, some great panoramic shots of the good ol' desert, and one subtle, sweet scene between Quinlan and her kids on the topic of ""The Chronic,"" this re-make doesn't contribute much to the well-being of Americans--as the opening credit sequence leads audiences to believe it might.

","""The Hills have Eyes"" is, without a doubt, the best horror movie I've ever seen. Before true horror buffs burn me at the stake I will confess horror is not my favorite genre, but with movies like this I could be converted.<br/><br/>My weekend started with a very disappointing ""V for Vendetta"". I simply concluded ""Not enough violence"". When someone suggested ""The Hills Have Eyes"" I more or less went with the crowd. I soon realized I was not to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm that guy that reads credits and when I saw Wes Craven's name I almost left the theater. Say what you want about Mr. Craven, but I saw ""Red Eye"", and I hoped Freddy Krueger was going to kill me before I fell asleep. Don't even get my started on ""Cursed"". I will say this much: He does cast beautiful women. Please, I beg, don't let the credits or opening scene distract you from the movie. It's a work of art not to be missed.<br/><br/>The movie has great character development. You truly feel as if you're watching your own family. Except for the fact that I instantly fell in love with Brenda (I hope Emilie de Ravin has a long successful career). The mountains, sun, and shadows are filmed to perfection. The cast has the look and mannerisms that make you forget it's a movie. It's as close to real life as you can get. Not enough can be said for every aspect of the movie. It better win awards.<br/><br/>Once the horror starts it does not end. The original confrontation between ""good"" and ""evil"" is so intense I don't know if I even took a breath. ""Shock and Awe"" is the only term that can even come close to describing what you'll see. The tone is set, and you know you are in way over your head. The transformation from ""wholesome family"" to ""kill or be killed"" is brilliant. I truly feared for the characters.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater I said ""That movie was brilliant!"" I then questioned, ""Are they allowed to show movies like that?"" Every line is crossed. ""Saving Private Ryan"" changed war movies forever, and I predict ""The Hills have Eyes"" will have the same effect to horror movies. My hat is off to director Alexandre Aja. I hope he, and the other genius that worked on this film, continue to bring American movie goers unforgettable films such as ""The Hills have Eyes""."
"simpletonistic","7","4","6","15 March 2006"," Immobile, Home, Alone:
","The most recent version of Wes Craven's original succeeds, and fails, because of its excesses. Director Alexandre Aja dwells deep into grisly, jolting murders, methodically building tension that keeps one squirming uncomfortably in their theater seat. Augmenting his technique, similar to Mel Gibson in ""The Passion"" and Emeril Lagasse in the kitchen, he kicks his executions up a notch, and succeeds in frightening the living bejesus out of us.<br/><br/>But, ""Hills..."" ultimately fails because the story does not give us enough information detailing, or even sketching, why a group of mutated descendants is hell-bent on rape, evisceration, and cannibalism. Lacking much in the way of expository data concerning the habits of his mutants (all of whom are descendants of families effected by A-bomb experiments done, for the most part, in their backyard), Aja's depiction of a double-rape, a suicide, and the burning of one victim ""at the stake"" (which were preceded by shots of infant mutants during the roll of opening credits) seem positively, and shamelessly, gratuitous.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, that's too bad, because his method of building tension, and creating good and evil characters whose lives intrigued me, worked well. Up to a point, the movie engrossed me. But, after a point, specifically, the double-rape sequence, the movie grossed me out. By way of explaining why ""Hills..."" fails more than it succeeds.<br/><br/>I bring to point another horror film that I saw recently, ""Final Destination 3."" In each, the body count builds, as it should. After all, these are horror movies, and one expects heads to roll, be lopped off, or blown apart in a variety of ways. That's the nature of the genre: blood, guts, and gore. In ""FD-3"" the killings aren't any less graphic, the victims go down, one after the next, and we are not spared the ""money shots."" Yet, in ""FD-3"" the killings, in conjunction with the story, seemed comical, each one ascending in order of incredulity.<br/><br/>Also, their pursuers, unseen, and with the usual horror movie killer's motive: we died, so you too must die, did not appear to have other needs than seeing the victims succumb.<br/><br/>In ""Hills.."" we see the evil killers, a group of grossly disfigured rednecks, but we are never given good enough reason to empathize with their desire to avenge their mutated selves, and ancestors, by cannibalizing their randomly selected, or delivered, subjects. Hell, being born ugly ain't any reason to resort to rape, torture, and cannibalism. If that were the case, well, half the population on Planet Earth would qualify as potential homicidal maniacs. (Myself included!) This inauthentic story line is where I feel that ""Hills..."" disconnects from its viewers, and mutates its intention to add to the horror pantheon. In a few words, the movie is too evil-minded, without giving us enough reason to believe why its antagonists would act the way they do.<br/><br/>It's one thing to scare people with your production, but you overstep your intention when you scare them away.<br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" will be one of those movies that people will watch and then instantly want to willingly forget. Unlike ""Final Destination 3,"" a movie they might want to enjoy a second time for a cheap thrill."

Vinessa Shaw's character Lynne seemed to be the glue that held the family together and wanted so much for everyone to be happy, and she loved her baby as any caring mother would. She also seemed to be the smartist and maybe strongest of the group. Dan played the teen boy role very well, i liked how he used the word ""random"" to explain the pig he saw, because I am a teenager and i use that word to describe just about everything.

It's the fact there are so many amazingly talented writer/directors out there who's projects out there never see the light of day and they have universes more talent than this piece of garbage has in his pinky finger. I think certain film execs should be arrested and put in jail for their assault on humanity with deplorable films like this with no redeeming value whatsoever. It just gives already sick and mentally unbalanced people something to get turned on by. And this guy thinks he so cutting edge? His head should be on a plate. His days as a ""filmmaker"" are numbered."

The part where bobby goes to look for beauty when he hears the dog barking which was not the dog and the freaks were in the trailer raping the girl oh my god i was freaking out the whole time saying where is that baby then i look up and the freak has a gun pointed at the baby's head well let me say i couldn't stop balling my eyes out my fiancé had to shut the movie off i was so hysterical if i had of watched anymore i probably would have thrown up. I sit through any other horror movie and not jump or budge or anything but this movie made me sick and anybody that has a baby should not watch this because I'm telling you you will be shutting it off just like i did it is disgusting.

"gregsrants","7","12","26","5 March 2006"," A very good remake, although I can't remember the first one
","I am always at a crossroads when a remake of a movie comes out and I can hardly remember the original (if at all!). Do I rent the original so that I can compare? Or do I stay away and let the remake attempt to formulate an impression on me before revisiting the past? Decisions, decisions.<br/><br/>Well, when it came to The Hills Have Eyes, I decided NOT to see the original again before the screening of the new 2006 edition. Although I am sure that Wes Craven did an 'admirable' job 30 years ago with the original, it couldn't have been that good since even seeing the movie poster and reviewing the plot outline couldn't initiate any memories whatsoever.<br/><br/>In retrospect, this was a very good decision.<br/><br/>The new Hills Have Eyes comes to us via Alexandre Aja, who shocked North American late night audiences with 2003's High Tension (also known as Haute Tension, also known as Switchblade Romance). In that film, Aja brought us back to the bloody horror films that we enjoyed so much back in the 70's and 80's as Cécile De France played a cat and mouse game with a serious sociopathic serial killer (.or did she? Ha Ha).<br/><br/>So when I heard that Aja was helming a film that would not be poorly dubbed and consisted of the terrorizing of an American family by a group of psychotic and radiation deformed stalkers in a desert, well, damn, I said ""sign me up!!!"" And while you are at it, sign my friends up too, for The Hills Have Eyes is a good film in a genre that struggles to produce consistency in a world where the local news provides more terror than producers can hope to duplicate without fear of an NC-17 rating being slapped on their finished product.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes stars Ted Levine (Monk) and Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo 13) as two members of the Carter family that are traveling through New Mexico when their truck is forced off the road via the ole 'spikes hidden on the road' trick. That then leaves the California dreamers (consisting of mom, pop, three children, a son-in-law, a newborn and some dogs) stranded in the middle of nowhere, and this nowhere just happens to have some mutated flesh-eating murders hiding in dem der hills.<br/><br/>The result might be typical horror film, i.e. family gets picked off one by one while getting a few of the baddies along the way, but Aja has a unique way of getting us there with true scares, gore galore and atmosphere which is usually the most lacking in entries of this type. Note, the atmosphere does come at the expense of thriller time and the movie does have faults in that it has large lapses between action, but it's a small price to pay and rest assured, you will get your fill of blood and guts before looking over your shoulder while navigating back to your car after the showing.<br/><br/>There is a rape scene that now takes the award for making me feel the most uncomfortable away from the pedophiles in Running Scared, and there are enough axe swings to make Paul Bunyan's arms sore. If it's blood you crave there was enough in The Hills Have Eyes for two films which is probably why the producers had to lobby to ensure the film only got an R-Rating.<br/><br/>So while every other week it would seem that Hollywood is rehashing a Japanese director's celluloid sneeze, The Hills Have Eyes was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was good, scary - at times frightening and the perfect compliment leading into the big budget bullcrap we are about to get once the season changes."

","I saw this movie a few months back and was deeply disgusted at the theatrics that were contained. Now, I'm not one that is sickened by the sight of blood, but the gore in the movie got to be so overdone, it became quite ridiculous and unneeded to support the story plot- blood doesn't need to be splattered over every single inch of the wallpaper to prove your point that the man is dead. That point was made ten minutes ago when they were massacring every other single character in the movie.<br/><br/>That fact that the baby died was a disgusting portrayal of ""horror"". It was just plain disgusting and rude! You do NOT need to kill everyone in the entire movie to prove your point that it was a scary place, a few characters will suffice.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me is the ""deformed humans"" that are the villains in the movie. I'm not regularly a human rights activist in any way, but the way that they were portrayed in the movie made me disgusted and probably lost a large percentage of the viewers on look of dis-formed people, lessening them in stature.<br/><br/>I think this is a HORRIBLE movie and should not be seen by anyone! The poor plot and gore that is placed into action is disgusting and looses all of my respect for the directors, producers and script-writers. It should be disturbing to anyone- and if it didn't disturb you there is something wrong. I will NEVER watch this movie ever again."

","Frankly, I hated this movie. Ironically, I would've enjoyed it - and still been extremely scared - if they had left the graphic rape scenes out. They were unnecessary; they made me feel extremely violated and angry and I had to force myself to watch the end of it. What angered me the most was the fact that the women are completely helpless. I know that in horrible situations people react differently, but I thought that making *every single woman in the film* incapable of defending herself was not necessary. It's easy to fall back on rape to make everyone in the audience feel uncomfortable, rather than create a scary atmosphere with music, lighting, etc. Horrible, horrible film. If you like graphic slasher, you'd probably like it, but if you like to leave your *real* fears at the theatre door and have fun just being creeped out, you probably won't like it."

Then it just goes way down hill from there. girl gets rapped but no one sees her or hears anything inside the trailer where there is a few people sleeping. the mother even just wakes up ignors her getting rapped by 2 guys and walks out to see her husband burning which was tied on with ropes to the only tree in the desert which are special ropes that don't burn until the body is burned to a crisp.

Lucky for me, I was warned about this movie from friends who saw it. It saved me from making a financial contribution to this kind of dangerous propaganda. It is by far Hollywood's most literal promotion of death and violence against the American family to date. There is absolutely no redeeming artistic or social value to this film. Yes there are a lot of really messed up people in this world. They see little or nothing at all wrong with this kind of ""entertainment"". All you have to do is turn on the news to know there are really sick people out there. Have you paid any attention to the news lately? The bottom line is films CAN influence people who are already unhinged into desiring to commit unspeakably horrible acts of harm on others. This film is definitely one of them. It crosses the line and makes sane mentally healthy people shudder to think of what ideas it may be giving some unstable, emotionally disturbed people out there. A film like this is adding gasoline to the fire. I can't imagine how those responsible for the making of this film can sleep at night.

I didn't feel scared or intensely glued to the screen, i felt offended, misled and completely repulsed at both the content, and myself sitting there watching it.

Apart from a disgusting molestation scene and complete humiliation of the characters, the director was obviously going for rage, pathos and promotions of revenge....but only succeeded in humiliating his audience and himself.<br/><br/>As for the story.... why would these people take some random shortcut a creepy guy that appears to have a stash of collected valuables (clearly not his) suggests??? Give me a break. As for the characters.... it makes no sense that these people would randomly seek out tourists to kill and eat. Why are they even angry? How are they even still alive and surviving generation after generation? They were told about the situation of nuclear testing, told to move for their safety and REMAINED in the area.

","Wes Craven's 1977 flick ""The Hills Have Eyes"" has just been remade by Alexandre Aja and would certainly please the targeted audience. If you're looking for hardcore gore, this may work as the film is basically two hours of sadomasochistic viewing pleasure (minus thirty minutes for the character exposition). Else...<br/><br/>Set in an abandoned area of New Mexico, a family on their way to San Diego gets stranded among the hills of the desert. With no contact to the rest of the world, they try to survive the dangers that lurk around them, including psychotic mutated cannibals. Uhm, basically that's all.<br/><br/>Movies of this type don't really rely on plot and characters, so it's natural for the main characters to be stereotypes of various degrees - although to be fair, the script does generate genuine sympathy for the family. The cast also gives a decent performance, with Emilie de Ravine of ""Lost"" prominently popping first into my mind. (I wonder why.) Aja, who also directed the French horror film ""High Tension"", amps up the gore level here, drifting over the story at a faster pace, obviously to suit the attention span of its expected viewers. And of course, logic begins to lose its grip and falls off completely behind. Thereon, heads are pierced with picks, fingers are severed, body parts are eaten, and so on.<br/><br/>Sure, ultimately we'll all view it subjectively and there are those who will drool over this kind of stuff. Personally, I find ""The Hills Have Eyes"" not total crap, with building tension and occasional scares at some point. Still, in the end it's nothing fresh either, without breaking any new grounds and nothing much to offer to anyone else. From the slashing and skewering opening scenes down to the twist, the film becomes not just a remake, it also becomes an index of clichés of the genre it treads on."

There are also multiple killings that were so over the top in showing everything.<br/><br/>I was ready to walk out after the first 30 min. of the movie. I would have but I was with people. So the rest of the movie I really just tuned out. Many people at the movie left and never returned. <br/><br/>I don't advise you to see this movie. You leave feeling as though you are going to be sick and if your anything like me you will have wished you spent your money on something else. So my advise is if you want to see it wait until it comes out of video that way you don't waste so much money and you turn it off any time you want. <br/><br/>I think I can honestly say this was the worst movie I have ever watched. Save your time and skip this one."

","The Hills Have Eyes is the most disgusting movie ever made. <br/><br/>I can pretty safely say that if you do not agree, you are demented. I completely understand that its just a movie and these things didn't actually happen, but just the idea that somebody would find the brutal rape of a young girl by a mutant man (twice) entertaining makes me physically sick. Aside from the fact that this took place while a man was being burned alive and a baby was being held at gun point while the mother of the baby was being violated. <br/><br/>Honestly, every good review for this movie makes me want to commit suicide.<br/><br/>Hollywood has gone too far.

"Jonny_Numb","7","6","12","12 March 2006"," A High-Tension Nuclear Family...
","Welcome back, horror! How I've missed you all these years...<br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" is yet another remake of a beloved (but not by me) '70s horror film that springs largely from Hollywood's ongoing lack of creativity. Most recent remakes have either been exceptional, but not on par with the original (""Dawn of the Dead""); just slightly better than the awful original (""The Amityville Horror""); or simply rock-bottom awful in comparison to the original (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""; ""Assault on Precinct 13"").<br/><br/>Wes Craven's original ""Hills"" was a 1977 production about a family who becomes stranded in the Arizona desert after their truck (complete with trailer) gets a flat. Far from a telephone or any other people, they stick out the night, only to be besieged by a family of cannibals living in the hills. While a low-budget production (popularized by the signature image of Michael Berryman's malformed head), Craven's film had a grittiness and brutality to it that adhered close to his previous film, ""Last House on the Left."" However, what sunk the original ""Hills"" for me was its lack of urgency and languid pace...that, and the cannibals themselves looked sillier and sillier the more they were shown. On the IMDb's scale of 1 to 10, I would have given the original a 4.<br/><br/>This redux, brought to us by the talented Frenchmen who gave us ""High Tension"" (Alexandre Aja and Gregory Levasseur), is not only a marked improvement over Craven's original, but one of the best horror films to come along in quite some time. As with ""Tension,"" Aja shows a clear skill in building atmosphere and suspense that frequently culminates in chest-tightening terror; the makeup is superbly grotesque and convincing; also present is the creative extremes of bloodletting that marked their previous effort. The politics of Craven's original remains intact, with unlikely heroes being reduced to acts of savagery, but the dynamic of the mutants has been made more ambiguous--instead of a close-knit family of savages, Aja's monsters don't seem as strongly linked; they are instead scattered across the desert like scorpions, which makes their menace a lot more effective. The scenes in the original that focused on the cannibals in their habitat often ventured into camp; in the remake, the relationships are there, but not explored in as explicit of detail, which works better, actually.<br/><br/>""Hills 2006,"" save for a few divergent touches, remains structurally similar to the '77 version. A toothless gas station attendant (Tom Bower, hamming it up) directs the wayward Carver clan (including Ted Levine, Kathleen Quinlan, and Dan Byrd) toward a shortcut through the desert that will (supposedly) shave hours off their trip to California. The shortcut is sabotaged, however, and the truck pulling the family trailer is totaled; in the meantime, the Conservative Father (Levine) and Liberal Son-in-Law (Aaron Stanford) head off to find help. ""Hills"" is deliberately-paced for about the first 40 minutes, providing some overly typical characterization and dialog; it is when the 'trailer siege' sequence rolls around that this remake kicks into high gear and doesn't let up. While keeping faithful to the source material, Aja uses grainy film stock, different film speeds, and a buffet of abstractly-rendered blood and viscera to put this remake over the top (in a way, Craven's film was a victim of the technology of the time).<br/><br/>The performances complement the material fairly well; while the characters begin as typical drones of current Americana, the film gives everyone ample opportunity to transcend their roles as a result of the extreme circumstances contained within. Aaron Stanford's limp-wristed cell-phone salesman transforms into a blood-spattered hero; Dan Byrd's easygoing son becomes a resourceful protector; Kathleen Quinlan's cheer-faced mother is reduced to a catatonic wreck. Among the mutants, Robert Joy (""Land of the Dead"")'s Lizard leaves the biggest impression, a bloodthirsty savage sporting cinema's most hideous overbite.<br/><br/>Within the current Hollywood climate, where remakes are as standard-issue and bland as department-store mannequins, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a very rare achievement: not only does it transcend the usual low standards of studio horror, but also stomps its source flat. Definitely recommended."

","OK here's the thing; going into this movie I wasn't sure how graphic it was going to be. The previews show it to look scary but you never really know until you sit down in the theater.<br/><br/>In a Nutshell; If you like graphic movies with deaths by an ax, baseball bat,being burned alive and basically tortured then you will love this one! ITS A WINNER! BUT...if you don't like those types of movies..avoid this like the plague.<br/><br/>The one thing I was definitely disappointed in was that they killed so many of the females off so quickly. 2 of them are killed within seconds of each other and in the same way and a male is dispatched minutes before them. So 3 of out 6 people that were in the car are dead within 5 minutes of each other. The only other thing that I thought was stupid is the characters were the clichéd dumb ones who go out and chase a dog after they know there are freaks in the hills, splitting up when they do things, and just generally making stupid choices all around.<br/><br/>I would think Kathleen Quinland of all people who was in ""BREAKDOWN"" (about a couple that breaks down in the desert much like this movie) would know not to be stupid..but there it was. Speaking of ""BREAKDOWN"", if you want to see a less gorier but still tense movie about breaking down and being harassed check that movie out...its great."

","First off, the original was no classic. It was a low-budget 70's exploitation flick (and a lousy one at that.) It was neither well-received by viewers nor lauded by critics. If it made any money at all, it was due to its minuscule budget, not an overwhelming demand for rentals. Those who refer to it as a classic were clearly born too late to remember it.<br/><br/>The passing of time seems to turn even the worst trash into gold in the minds of those who rate and review movies (eg ""The Fog"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.) ""Hills"" is not even the most significant Wes Craven schlock-fest of its era, that distinction belongs to the yet to be remade ""Last House on the Left."" Certainly a gloss-coated, big budget remake of that one can't be far off. Here's hoping that Hollywood sinks into the Pacific first! Anyway, I saw the original decades ago on VHS (as well as the other ""classics"" mentioned above) and I didn't completely hate it. Of course, I was twelve and wanted to see anything that made grownups upset. I do recall that it seemed trashy even for Wes Craven (back then he was widely considered the worst hack horror director on the planet.) So now here is the inevitable remake of this stinker and it's even more despicable than the first. It plays like a snuff film with a little bit of Rambo thrown in towards the end.<br/><br/>Would be a 1 but for some nice desert photography. It isn't as if the director is incompetent this time around, just sadistic and heavy-handed. And French too, which explains the lame attempt to politicize this bloodbath. Just what sort of platform is this for political messages? The bloody-mutant-shooting-burning-raping-biting-the-heads-off-birds party for the liberation of... Oh who cares. Enough said about this nonsense.<br/><br/>How to explain the numerous fawning posts found here? Children.<br/><br/>And watch out for the inevitable sequel!

Expected much from it but got more they i expected. <br/><br/>No fooling around with cutting all the good stuff out, or let everything to your imagination. NO fake CGI crap. No, just real life terror.<br/><br/>Do not think i only love this movie so much because of the blood and gore. But the tension and suspense is great to. Acting is great. And very important, you could believe this was really happening. For instance i saw Stay Alive last week. this crap movie about a video game if u play it you die. OK the idea was nice but....if u see the movie it was so unbelievable.

","I would like to start out by saying, god this film was awful. Do not give into the blood gore temptation, because if you do, you will be let down, due to the lack of storyline and plot. I know people enjoy the blood gore, I do too, a lot, but not the way this film did it. I saw myself swearing at the TV screen, because I was wondering where the storyline was? I guess this film followed Wes Craven's original, but even considering Wes Craven's film, usually lacks story lines anyways. When someone like Wes Craven and this new director Alexi.. something sticks to 'horror' genre, the public will notice your lack of understanding of total film-making. For instance, David Fintcher, director of Seven, can do horror drama. Or James Cameron, he can do great films like Terminator and T2, The Abyss, Alien, and then do something like Titanic. Really, in regards to the hills have eyes series,(original, 2006 version) grow up! People are getting intellectually demanding with films. Blood and gore will just not cut it anymore. This is not the era of Jason Voorhees and Z28 camaros at the movie theatres with vinyl vests and checkered flannels underneath."

","I also registered just to document how truly terrible this movie was. This tops my list of worst movies ever made. The storyline is terrible and does not develop any redeeming qualities of any characters, whatsoever. The direction takes notes from the worst parts of Deliverance, Dr. Moreau remake, and a bad family car trip. No imagination, no suspense, not much of anything. As the ""movie"" progressed I just wanted them to kill everyone so I could get on with watching my icebox thaw. In fact we decided that even Rumsfeld would not force terrorists to watch this movie in fear of the UN cracking down. If you like a scary horror flick, look elsewhere. This movie was horrible.

","In this remake, we see the family trip take a horrible turn as a mutated family living in the hills in a remote desert take a family hostage. The mutants are bent on revenge and will stop at nothing for blood and carnage. <br/><br/>I've yet to see Craven's original, so I can't really compare this remake to it. Although, from what I've heard this remake is far better. If I had seen the original, I would probably agree. Alexandre Aja, who brought us a little french film called ""High Tension"" is at the blood and guts genre again. This time he has more people to slaughter and a great team behind him to bring these horrific mutants to life. What we as an audience get is a sick, twisted, no holds barred horror film that isn't afraid to smack the viewer in the face. With so many horror films playing it ""safe"" in the recent years, Hills Have Eyes is a nice breath of fresh air in the horrors of the horror genre.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja and co manage to create such a creepy and isolated atmosphere, that if there were no mutants at all I would still get the creeps. The hills play characters themselves, as the home to these creatures, they too are frightening. The cinematography is too scare people and it does a pretty decent job at that. How is this film different from other horror films out there today? Well, instead of having a guy kill a bunch of teenagers, we have disfigured mutants kills and raping a family. Yup, a family. <br/><br/>Yes, there is a rape scene, and while it's not as horrific as some may have it seem be, you still have that uncomfortable feeling when it starts to play out. With the girl getting beaten by her attacker, then raped. While this may seem tame compared to the women beating of ""Ichi The Killer"", this film if more mainstream, so you can sense of surprised face when I saw it.<br/><br/>There are two scenes that are the highlights of Hills, one is when the mutants first attack the family, which is where the rape takes place. The second is when one of the family members goes to the mutants ""home"" and is basically a killing machine. I can watch the most horrific thing happen to a human being, but when an animal gets hurt, that's when it hits me. Yes, a dog dies in this film, but the other dog makes up for it by kicking some major ass. <br/><br/>The blood and gore? Plenty. One to keep the gore hounds happy. Hills showcases a mix of CGI and prop deaths. Along with the effects from the brilliant minds of KNB (oldschool Evil Dead, I love these guys). Seeing the mutants is fun too, even if you can't remember the names of any of them. They are cool to look at and all, but not very memorable. <br/><br/>Throughout the film I got a vibe from The Dawn of the Dead remake...mostly from the opening credits, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the films look and feel. Hills is one of the better remakes to come out of the bag in recent years. With other films like The Fog and The Omen appearing, Hills Have Eyes can stand proud to be the best of the bunch. I can see good things from Alexandre Aja in the future of horror.<br/><br/>Hills is an excellent horror experience, it has the right amount of creepy scares and more then enough uncomfortable gore. I found the performances to be surprisingly well done for a horror film, that is about mutated cannibals. This film is a horrific, grotesque, intense & above all fun ride through these hills."

"ApolloBoy109","2","7","15","13 March 2006"," Wow another Frenchman who thinks he understands Americana Horror
","What made Craven's original frightening was the mirror-like story line. The happy camper going family fought, loved, bickered and so on. The anti-social bad guys also fought, loved, bickered and so on. Did I say storyline. I'm sorry, there is no story. There wasn't a story in the first one either but there were scares and tension and it's odd that the director Aja directed another poor movie called High Tension and both were devoid of tension. Gore? Yes. Logic? None. When will film makers tackle the realities of people in peril? My answer . . . never. All the characters in this version behave as though they have never seen a horror film. All of them behave as if they were never taught the basics of survival. A) You don't split up. B) You don't walk back to the gas station and C) you don't follow the dogs into the hills. Furthermore, the trite explanation of the why the hill people are the way they are is so lame. Yea, right. Atomic testing. Abandoned town. Radiation. Yea, right. Okay. And I guess there is hope for us when the bomb is dropped. I mean the mutants in this movie survived insurmountable odds after the fallout. We can too! I don't know fellow horror fans, but I'm getting tired of torture being passed off for good horror films. Perhaps it's time to invent a new genre. Let horror return to real scares, thrills and tension. Let the sadists cum snuff film wanna-bes make ""Torment Films"" rather than ""Horror Films"". Ripping flesh, gallons of blood, no character investment and dopey dialog, not to mention a poor French filmmaker re-inventing the word vapid."

","Before I delve into the disgusting display of tasteless waste, I should probably confess I am not generally a fan of horror films. Personally, I favor psychological thrillers--you know, scary situations with actual plots driven by a decent screenplay. A friend dragged me to this film but I also confess, I had to close my eyes for much of it to avoid yoking on the poor kid in front of me. (By the way, what sick bastard took a kid to see this thing?) The one thing this film had going for it was excellent performances. The actors--fantastic. It's just too bad all they had to do was die. There is no story, no plot, no point. A man blows his head off (yess, you get to see it all), another man is burned alive, a teenage girl gets raped, two women are shot, a baby is kidnapped, and a number of corpses (including a dog) are eaten. All this aside, there are some mutated freaks wondering around moaning and making every attempt to be as grotesque as possible. Like most other slashers, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is also devoid of a conclusion. Surrounding me in the theatre was a nice variety of folks (mostly teenagers). Some occasionally offered some nervous laughter (and clapped a little), others sat there, like me, trying desperately not to throw up, and the rest just sat and stared. Just a tip--this movie will not move nor frighten you nor inspire you nor anything else one would expect to get out of a movie. There is no matter of substance, point, or taste in seeing this vile piece of crap. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND AVOID!"
"mcfly-31","6","7","15","12 March 2006"," warning: NOT your average slasher experience...
","Not just for a remake, but for any horror film, this was not your typical set-em-up and knock-em-off time at the movies. Director Aja really went above and beyond for this remake of the 1977 tale of a family driving through the desert, only to be set upon by a group of wackjob, homicidal cannibals. The film has an odd look to it, sort of retro but in the current age. There's cell phones and nubile young blondes, but also a travel trailer right out of the 70s and a ton of oldies featured on the soundtrack. That's all moot compared to the mayhem that ensues during this gruesome, relentless bloodbath. There's choppings, gunshots, people set afire, rape, and even an icepick planted into a man's testicular area. But Aja brings out a more emotional element by extending his terror scenes. The audience is no longer laughing and munching popcorn. They're murmuring and hiding their eyes. One passage in particular features one girl being raped, another having her breast sucked, and finally an unexpected moment of shocking violence. Unfortunately, some of the seriousness is taken away because some of the actions are committed by mutants. It becomes all too aware we're looking at actors in make-up (laughably, one villain looks like Sloth from ""The Goonies""), which somewhat takes away from the believability of it all. As well the above-mentioned fire scene, which just looks ridiculous. Plus the fact the hero takes so much abuse before finally standing up for himself, your patience runs thin. And if you've seen the original, one really effective scene is dropped, involving using a dead body in a lawnchair as bait. But for hardcore gore fans, don't you be worried for a second. This features more brutality and nihilistic carnage than the original. Which doesn't make it any better than the first one, though this a decent film. Technically it looks awesome, with very fluid direction from Aja, and a great recurring musical sting that has a subtle ""bong....bong"" to it. Though at times that standard, pounding ""CLANG!"" to scare an audience is overused when a character is only passing in front of the camera or scaring another. I can't say it's a great film overall, but is much better than the other remakes out today, but be forewarned again: DO NOT buy any food before going into the theater. You'll save $10 bucks, too."

","Yes, I am a fan of the original and at the time Craven made the 1977 version, he had little to no budget and yet the film is brutal and scary and disturbing. So now, decades later, with quite a lot of money, French director Aja is given the reins. The film has one flaw that a horror movie shouldn't have - it is rather boring. Now I like films to take their time - I'm a huge fan of Asian horror and they can be so effective at drawing things out so that dread is pushing down on your shoulders. But there were soooo many long scenes between the stranded family where nothing was happening and yes, at the end, when the ""gloves come off"" and it's REVENGE time - the movie picks up speed and lots of violence and gore and so what? The mutants in the movie are so outlandish that any reality factor goes out the window, they are basically fighting comic book monsters. While being stalked by REAL humans, by real depraved psychos is much more terrifying than subhuman monsters out of Tales From The Crypt comic book. The actors deliver and I do feel that Aja has talent as a director. But overall the whole thing felt like a big empty excuse to use a ""brand name"" in horror and show off the latest gore effects. Ho hum."

And half this movie has Doug trying to keep his baby from biting the dust.<br/><br/>Emilie de Ravin and Dan Byrd take the characters of Brenda and Bobby to a different level, having Ravin show more of a naughty side and Byrd show more of a bad ass side.<br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me from that point on was the ending, it just didn't do it for me. At least it left it open for a sequel, which could be pretty good."
"garymundy21","4","3","5","14 June 2011"," Disappointed?
","I have just watched this film and am so surprised by the IMDb responses to this film I felt compelled to register to post my first review.<br/><br/>Firstly I bought Wes Cravens 2 Hills Have Eyes films and the two remakes at the same time, so I don't feel I am too biased in any way as I have only seen each film once (bar the modern sequel). But I watched the original film first (about 9 months ago) and thought it was great. Very thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the film. I loved it. I then watched it's sequel about 6 months ago which I am sure everybody agrees is awful.<br/><br/>Now having watched this film I am disappointed with it but was shocked to see the majority of people on here not only enjoyed it but preferred it to the original. I completely understand that the film is the same story on a bigger budget with better production standards and more gore. But I felt that the film lacked the character of the original, it was competent enough sure, but even with the increased gore (and there was a lot) it did little for me.<br/><br/>Maybe it is because I watched the first film first so you may think I am probably biased but for me the film lacked the feeling of the original. I didn't like the new family and I didn't like any of the new mutants in the film. Excessive gore doesn't make up for character. And I am no prude to violence of that nature, but honestly I was bored for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>Also I didn't like the nuclear theme being brought up in the opening credits. I think it would have been better if this was revealed at the time it was in the movie not at the start cause then it would have had a better twist.<br/><br/>I have not watched the sequel to the film but I will do because that's the sort of person I am and I will watch it in the hope it is a new story and will obviously be better than the God awful sequel by Wes Craven.<br/><br/>I must also add I thought the 2009 remake of The Last House on The Left was pointless, it too lacked the charm and character of the original, but I enjoyed it slightly more than this.<br/><br/>Finally, I do also think if I watched this film at the cinema in 2005/2006 before seeing the original I probably would have liked it more but it reminded me of Leatherface, plenty of gore but doesn't captivate.<br/><br/>I now want to watch the original again and I may review it in due course."

","This film was great how the characters acted especially Doug and bobby. The mutants, Pluto, lizard and cyst are my favourite mutants because lizard is quite cool, Pluto is big and strong but very stupid and cyst looks scary but is ab it weak. Goggle, papa Jupiter and big Brian are boring characters because there cowards, gay and pussy's. The plot of the story is very good like tests, nuclear bombs, ugly mutations blah blah blah and how they must rescue there Babbie before its dinner to ass mite cannibals. Sorry but i think some of the women didn't even try to live as there crap but Brenda was good at surviving. Bobby is a hard ass ed teenager who hates all the mutants so much, man! He is hard core! Doug is really cool and its cool that he kills two mutants, Pluto and cyst, and wounding lizard! He just do-sen't give up for his lovely daughter, Cathrine or something i don't know. At the end, i thought it wasn't great, more mutants watching the family. I bet the family is dead after that or still fighting. Anyway, i give this a nine out of ten of great acting, mutants but a poor ending."
"christian123","7","3","5","11 April 2007"," A creepy and effective horror remake
","A family traveling through the Nevada desert are sent on a short-cut that puts them into the path of a deadly group of killer mutants, who have been preying on innocent travelers for years. <br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a scary and effective horror film that actually takes the time to develop everything instead of just rushing into the violence. For this type of film, there are really only two formulas that are commonly used today. The director could either develop the characters and story so the audience becomes familiar with them or the director can just do a quick introduction and just rush into all the murders. The Hills Have Eyes is an example of the former and it does a good job at it. The pacing is not too slow at the beginning and we get to know everyone as well as get a good look at the location. Then like a torpedo, the film just takes off and it manages to be memorable without being gory or over the top. <br/><br/>Alexandre Aja did a good job behind the camera. He really set up a creepy atmosphere for the film and he used that desert location perfectly. He managed to create plenty of tension with horrifying villains and quick editing shots. He also produced a few inventive death scenes that didn't depend heavily on gore to be scary. He sometimes dragged a situation out for too long but as a whole, the movie was usually interesting and entertaining to watch. The villains looked pretty good as well especially compared to other similar films like 'Wrong Turn'. I would say that the dialog was largely bland yet the characters were still interesting because they were more ordinary and therefore relatable.<br/><br/>Compared to the genre, the acting was better than the standard. Emile De Ravin gave a good performance. She could have played a shallow, spoiled brat but she had a little more depth to her. Vinessa Shaw was a bit of a miscast because she didn't strike me as mom to the baby, maybe more of an older sister. Dan Byrd was surprisingly good and I say surprisingly because I was expecting his performance to be really annoying but it was quite tolerable. Aaron Stanford was unlikable at first but quickly improved as the movie progressed. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levin gave adequate performances as the parents. Also, the actors portraying the bad guys did a pretty good job. Overall, The Hills Have Eyes covers some familiar territory but it still manages to be quite exciting thanks to the interesting direction and talented cast. Rating 7/10"
"shadowman123","8","3","5","26 March 2007"," Aja defies , and conquers !
","Being the craze at the moment that is with Hollywood (prequels,remakes and sequels)it was just a matter of time before they went ahead and remade this. However people should be glad to know that the man in the directors seat this time was Alexander Aja and if you have seen his french horror master-piece High tension your headed for a good time! Aja's take was different from Wes Craven's in the sense that this time round he shows us a travelling family on vacation going through the New Mexico desert where the U.S. government had secretly been conducting atomic energy blast and this is vividly explained all in the opening credits not leaving much to the imagination however the survivors of these nuclear explosion show us what did not kill them , only made them more insane! There is no time wasting in this one as we dive straight into the action and waste little time with things like character development (hey they all gonna die after all). The camera angels and cinematography is used in a brilliant way to show the vastness of the mountains and really giving the viewer that they truly are stuck in the middle of nowhere but then also shows a close up focus of how the horrors and consequences caused by radiation. Gorehounds and horror fans shall be pleased by the levels of blood , and body count and not to mention body parts flying about! and Aja also manages to weave our heroic dog into as homage and respect to Wes Cravens original. Another great thing was the cynical tone it had with the family members which made it all the more realistic.<br/><br/>To conclude , very rarely a remake can over take an original and especially one like The Hills have Eyes which has a devoted cult following but again , it shows that if you go away and do homework then you can inject something new fresh and make it worth while checking out. I recommend this to fans of the original and horror/gore fans or maybe people who are just in need of some entertainment during a boring summer day. I would not be at all surprised if this one started developing a following or people saying they prefer this to the original hopefully a remake of part two will make up for the original shambled part 2.<br/><br/>THE HILLS HAVE EYES - 8.9 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THE LUCKY ONES DIED FIRST!"
"emperor_tom","8","3","5","17 March 2007"," Smashes the original into oblivion...
","I remember the day i saw the original 'Hills Have Eyes'.I remember how, after being told by my father how great and scary it was, and seeing that awesome poster, i was looking forward to seeing a great film that would blow my mind. What i also remember about that day was how disappointed i was with the film. How i didn't care for any of the characters, how i felt no emotion when they met their demise, how it ended so abruptly and unresolved that i ended up hating the thing.<br/><br/>Flash forward 3 years and i sit down to watch the remake. I was obviously apprehensive, and to be honest things didn't start too well. The first 20 - 30 minutes were nigh on identical to the original, with a modern twist. The turning point came with the graphic brutalisation of the family. I noticed the difference straight away. Unknowingly, i felt genuinely upset for them. The rape scene was abhorrent, and the distress felt by the survivors was raw and hit home. It is a credit to the actors that they managed to act so convincingly that i for one was egging them on to get their revenge.<br/><br/>Ah, the revenge. Well, put it this way. Whether your a horror, gore, or action aficionado, you'll find something in the films second half to suit your needs. The fight scenes were well choreographed with fantastic camera work that puts the viewer right in the heart of the action. The gore was present and subtle enough that it wouldn't make you wretch, but enough to make you wince in pain. THere is also a strong political subplot running throughout the film, so that it makes you think about the US governments nuclear tests, and question who exactly is in the wrong. Are the 'mutants' just a by product of their governments neglect? And the ending was great. It was slightly clichéd (the one sympathetic character gives their life to save the hero) but tons better than the original. It also left it open for a sequel. Though from the looks of the one about to come out it has nothing in common with what the ending of the first one implies.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that is perfect Saturday night fodder. Indeed, once i watched it i wanted to watch it again. Be prepared to laugh, cry but most of all cheer on the protagonist as he fights to reclaim his daughter and exact revenge on the mutants that destroyed his life."
"hynese57","1","3","5","10 January 2007"," horrible
","I hated this movie so much I didn't watch the whole thing. I felt sick to my stomach and normally i can handle gore and I even like horror flicks, but sometimes they go too far. And let me tell you this is one of them. This is where I stopped watching. Dad burning alive while teen daughter is raped and older sister has breast milk sucked from her chest while her baby is held at gunpoint. And mom gets blasted coming in to save the day. Nice movie... was any of that necessary. I can understand doing things for shock value but this file is offensive. The woman who has her breast sucked on by one of the freaks gets shot in the face and she comes to life for a second when we all think she's dead. That was something that is acceptable for shock value or seeing someone's face blown apart by a shotgun is gross but acceptable. Rape if there is an underlying point to it can be acceptable but this scene in its context had no use other than shock and is not worth viewing."
"hoser_98","1","3","5","23 September 2006"," Terrible
","Unoriginal, uninspired, over-rated hyped up trash. This movie lacks all of the main elements of a good movie of any genre. You see the ""monster"" in the very first scene. The characters not only lack anything even remotely resembling character development, they are also easily forgettable. Most of the characters names are only known because they are listed on a website (like this one). One could argue that it is basically Wrong Turn based in the desert, but there is a major difference... Wrong Turn was good, this isn't. The first 3/4 of this movie bored me almost to sleep, the final 1/4 is not much better. It's predictable, it's not terrifying, there isn't as much gore as they would like you to believe, and overall I wish I had that 107 minutes of my life back. I would rate this movie R for Ridiculous. I've seen ""B"" movies that blow this out of the water."
"PrinceKheldar","2","3","5","13 September 2006"," Would have been bad 30 years ago
","As someone who's old enough to remember the video nasties of the late 1970s and early 1980s, I had the hope that the horror genre has moved on. These days, I figured, an intelligent audience want some thought in their slasher flick as well as the obligatory gratuitous violence. Sadly after watching this loose remake of Craven's classic I realise I was misguided. This sort of movie was done better 30 years ago with no CGI and a fraction of the budget.<br/><br/>The plot premise is actually very good. The execution (no pun intended) is dire at best. I don't think it's necessarily the director's fault: the script could have been written better by an 8 year old. Shallow characters, ridiculous situations, a ploy holier than the Turin shroud, and just plain stupid lines (Brenda's ""Let's get out of here"" towards the end takes the gold here - you'll see what I mean). Save yourself 1hr 40min and avoid this one like an atomic bomb test area."
"wolfcub7","1","3","5","5 September 2006"," Whoever decided gore and violence makes a good movie/version? Give me a break!
","Honestly, in my opinion, shocking scenes and disgusting elements take so much away from the movie. It's like the makers really don't know how to entertain people in the million other ways there are. I didn't think of the original HHE scary at all either but it was at leas a good film. It's atmosphere was dark and fascinating. <br/><br/>The remake spoils that by for example: - Why should the cannibals look any different from us? They made them somewhat deformed because of some radioactive thing at the area on the mountains. Perhaps they were trying to make it different enough from the original version but the way they did it, sucks. And anyway the deformity thing is old. Used. - One takes a beautiful pet bird, bites of its head and squeezes its blood into his mouth. Yay. *roll eyes* - One steals the already killed mother from the car and the boy finds him with the body, and sees him eating it. We actually see him tear of the flesh and put it into his mouth, as the son is watching. A bit disturbing but more disgusting. - When the hill people attack the family's trailer killing some of them, one of them who sexually harasses the girl in the original too, in this version he threatens the baby's life so she'd let him. Holds the gun pointing at the baby's face the whole time.<br/><br/>Then there's of course the long, long and pretty violent scene where the baby's father is trying to save the baby.<br/><br/>SO, many of the scenes were much more emotionally loaded than in the original, but never in any way but disgusting.<br/><br/>Tell me why is this supposed to be ""A version to die for""? as one of the critics state in the covwr of the DVD? It's nothing but a cliché version of a well-don original, and focuses way too much in shock-horror.<br/><br/>I'd say sincerely, if a person wants to see a movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"", should watch the original version. It's much more enjoyable."

Alexander Aja (High Tension) did a terrifc job in remaking Wes Cravens 1977 cult movie. Aja managed to greatly improve upon the flawed original in more ways than can be counted. This one is scarier, intense, a visceral experience n more technically improved remake coz of the larger budget and major studio backing. This movie is like a shotgun to your senses. The mood, atmosphere, and music add the perfect touch of edge of your seat creepiness. This is an extremely rare occurrence when a remake is far superior to the original. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre allows Aja to use the desert to its fullest to create a foreboding landscape. The hills and desert in bright yellows and subdued reds. The Moroccan locations that double for New Mexico r captured perfectly as a waste land totally isolated and foreboding at the same time."

","""The Hills Have Eyes"" features a small family that goes on an incredible trip that suddenly became a living hell. Such was the same unfortunate fate of the movie itself. The movie had potential to be a great thriller, but slowly faded into a world of horror movie clichés and improbable situations.<br/><br/>A small area in New Mexico was designated a nuclear testing site. However a family of miners refused to leave the area. The result: a generation of deformed beings with a strong resentment to the rest of the human race.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story of a small family on their way to San Diego. The movie was successful in establishing the family as a relatable and likable group of people. There is a retired cop father, a loving mother who was once a 60's hippie, their oldest daughter along with her baby and husband (the son-in-law looking for the approval of the in-laws), the adorable adolescents Bobbie and Brenda, and their lovable canines Beauty and Beast. Aww how cute.<br/><br/>Little do they know, they are driving directly into the clutches of another family that is not so lovable. A group of deranged individuals, physically and mentally, who not only rob from the passing tourists, but mutilate them, and of course, the inevitable tendency for deranged families in horror films to indulge in the delicacy of cannibalism.<br/><br/>The film was good in setting the atmosphere for the different families and in turning up the suspense and tension when the two collide. In the beginning, you surprisingly care for the tourist family and hope they make it out alive. But as the events transpire, and the family begins to make stupid decisions, and the deformed family begin to make stupider ones, the emotional content of the film is lost, including any hint of compassion and even, unfortunately, fear.<br/><br/>There were a few walkouts in the theater when I watched it opening night, but i couldn't tell if they were due to the graphic content, or the unsatisfactory film-making. There are moments of great suspense and a phenomenal makeup job on the Texas Chainsaw-like ensemble. But seriously, when are victims in movies going to learn never to leave each other alone and follow unfamiliar noises? And when will cannibalistic families learn to eat 'em when you get the chance, instead of waiting around and giving your dinner that final opportunity to get away?<br/><br/>For what it's worth, this was a decent attempt, and the movie is good enough for a rental. But when it comes down to it, I'd rather spend a night in those hills than a night with the crazy truck driver in Harold and Kumar. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is not so much a horror film as it is an instructional video for what not to do when going on a cross-country road trip. Never trust gas attendants. Unless its a Shell."

","A remake of Wes Craven's 1977 version, 'The Hills Have Eyes' left me feeling utterly unimpressed and, while I have not seen the original, if it is anything like this then I wonder why they even bothered . The plot revolves around a family lost in the desert and end up being picked off one-by-one by mutants, and it was basically one huge disappointment with only a few half-hearted scares, instead relying on excessive violence, blood, and gore to gain a reaction from the audience. In fact, the only real chill I got was in the ten minutes of trailers in the beginning when more intriguing flicks such as 'The Omen', 'The Dark' and 'An American Haunting' were advertised.<br/><br/>I am no conservative when it comes to violence in horror/action films since most sensible people understand it is just fiction yet nevertheless this film just left a bad taste in my mouth. Rather than using a sharp plot and clever camera work to deliver the chills, this was just a case of 'look how many gory ways we can kill people! Look at how we can splash blood around'. There was even a gratuitous rape scene that left me sickened, rather than terrified, that the scriptwriter could stoop to such depths to try to shock us. And there was even the typical predictable ending to gear us up for a possible sequel (though hopefully no Hollywood studio will sanction that).<br/><br/>The result was a flick that is clearly just intended to appeal to lads in their late teens and twenties who still get a kick out of seeing blood and guts flying around. For real horror fans, I'd advise waiting for the more promising horror/chiller flicks to be released through the year. Or, if you are really desperate for the mutants, check out 'The X-Files' episode 'Home', which does the whole concept in a more intelligent, frightening manner."

The story is very slasher familiar, so basically follows common formula for most slasher movies. However it was nicely done and uniquely done by having cannibals living in hills all disformed by radiation. its a very interesting subject. The movie does a good job of introducing scenery, characters, villains and giving a good creepy chill down your spine. Very gory and pretty much a good slasher flick, however only down side is the characters make insanely dumb decisions sometimes which is always painful to watch, mind the pun.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
For a slasher movie it ticks all the boxes of having very good shots, gory special affects/ prostectics especially for the time. Cant say much more it's good for the age of the film.<br/><br/>Acting:
The performances are again that of a slasher flick. Pretty good but not oscar winning. They did a good job of making us feel concerned and uneasy all the way through the movie.<br/><br/>Summary:
I thought this movie was pretty cool and interesting. Definitely a good watch and If you like horror movies, i would highly suggest it."
"robertemerald","9","2","3","23 September 2019"," Sturdy and scenic construction, plenty of shock violence
","What makes this film is not so much the violence, which is well choreographed for impact and brutality, with survivors ending up soaked in blood, or the story, which is a sort of expansion of a desert, mutant Deliverance (1972), the mutants themselves being suitably grotesque, but the carefully chosen killing grounds. The locations were a sort of hostile charm offensive, full of stunning rifts, ridges and craters, as well as a spooky ghost town and a dilapidated service stop. This important aspect made the camera work and editing all the more stark and real, so you can more easily feel the rising heat and sense of despair. The Hills Have Eyes is not really like Last House On The Left (2009), being a separate genre more in common with Wrong Turn (2003), The Descent (2005) or Feast (2005). I'd argue that The Hills is better than all three of those movies, though there is plenty of teenage alarm as in Wrong Turn, and the bad guys are similar. The bad guys are less similar in Descent or Feast, which involve basically a separate species after mutation, although the dropping off of characters one by one in highly dramatic incidents is now run-of-the-mill. Still, this is full-on entertainment with great casting and direction, some totally classic scenes and moments, and, for me, some cool originality. Admittedly I haven't seen the original Wes Craven film. The plot wasn't predictable, and the tension was palatable. Great horror that hasn't aged."

"makotoshintaro","7","2","3","14 September 2017"," Brutal
","Although I have not watched the original one, 2006's remake is the definition of a splatter horror movie and a must-see for the fans of splatter. The typical element of the half-abandoned, rakish gas station (diner in other movies) was a really good opening, and the characters evolved in the very first 15'. The come and go hunt was a bit monotonous after some point but the fight scenes are totally rewarding."
"bowmanblue","7","2","3","13 June 2016"," Actually quite good – by remakes' standards
","Yes, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a good film. Doesn't that mean it's a classic? No, it's a remake. And, seeing as – seemingly – every film needs to remade/re-imagined or have Spock home back in time to create an alternate timeline, most of them fall nowhere near 'okay.' Therefore, remakes need to be judged through more lenient eyes, so it may not be a good film, but it's a damn fine remake! The plot from the 1977 original remains the same – a nice, happy family gets stranded in the middle of an American desert and is slowly picked off by the local mutants who generally want them dead for varying reasons. Nice and simple. The family must therefore fight to survive.<br/><br/>And that's all there is to it. With a plot so simple, it could be great or it could fail. Luckily, the cast of actors save it. They work pretty well together and generally annoy each other (as most real families do). They bicker, they moan and get at each other, but ultimately come together to overcome a greater threat. Plus, most importantly, they don't make too many ridiculous judgements meaning they're the architects of their own demises. There's nothing worse than yelling at the TV screen to the protagonist because they're making ridiculous calls which simply further the plot. Here, the family do basically what we'd do in such a grisly situation.<br/><br/>And it is grisly. First of all there is gore (and strong violence) aplenty. Not only are the kills pretty extreme, but the make-up on the mutated locals is suitably gruesome. 'The Hills Have Eyes' certainly isn't for everyone. Its strong gore and adult content will certainly put some people off. It's not for the squeamish, but if you like your horror films brutal and violent then this one is for you."
"TheRedDeath30","7","2","3","3 October 2014"," One of the Better Horror Remakes in Recent Years
","You'll find a lot of people in the horror community who are just absolute haters of remakes. No matter the quality of the movie, they will tell you it's a horrible waste of time, or even worse that it somehow destroys the integrity of the original which they hold so dear. I am not really in that camp, though I will certainly admit that the average horror remake doesn't generally come close to the original. Let's face it, you're presenting a movie and story that's been done before, so you've already lost out on ""originality points"", thus you have to create an even better movie. Aja's remake of THE HILLS HAVE EYES is one of the few that I would put up there as an excellent horror film. Not as good as the original in my eyes, but good nonetheless.<br/><br/>It's very hard for me to rate the remake without comparing to the original. That may or may not be fair. In some ways, that's hypocritical of me. I'd be the first to tell you that movies shouldn't be compared to the source book (or comic in some cases). To me, though, that's because you're comparing different mediums and not, as in this case, comparing two movies to each other.<br/><br/>The basic plot of this movie is identical to Craven's excellent original, as are most of the key scenes, so that invites even more comparison.<br/><br/>I think that the mutants in this movie are a mixed bag when compared to the original. I like their origin story better in this remake. The idea of using them to explore themes of nuclear testing and the results on the people in those areas is inviting to a horror film like this. It, then, lends itself much better to explaining the mutations of this cannibal clan, far beyond just accepting that they are the ugly children of an ugly man, as the original wants you to swallow. That said, however, I much prefer the original clan. To me, they were more fully fleshed out characters. They had names and identities that were easy to remember. You ""knew"" who each character was and what their personality was. It then made them more complex. They weren't just blankly evil. They were a family, too, and that provided a better contrast to the vacationing family presented as our heroes. Here, in the remake, they want them to be more blank canvas villains that we naturally despise, rather than having any conflicting feelings about as viewers.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think that Doug (the son-in-law) is much better in this movie. One of the main thematic points of the film is that a normal man, pushed to extreme limits, is capable of just as much violence as the cannibals. That wasn't emphasized as much in the original. Doug was only doing what was necessary to get his baby back. Here, he loses his humanity very clearly. Yes, he's defending himself and seeking to reclaim his child, but he's pushed to an absolute extreme of violence in which we know that this is not the same man that we were introduced to in the beginning and will probably never be the same man again.<br/><br/>I like the addition of the nuclear testing site and I like the ""battles"" between the characters better in this remake. There are some cheesy scenes in the original that amount to nothing more than Jupiter and Pluto running for minutes at a time, or other characters just running or jumping rocks. In the remake we are definitely treated to a much more amped up style of action and it does pay off better. On the other hand, Craven's original carries a better tone, in my opinion. It sets up the feeling of dread better by slowly building tension. Before we ever see a villain, we are frightened. This movie starts off with violence and a mutant killing government workers, so that the attention deficit audience is hooked from the beginning and gets their fix right away.<br/><br/>I guess the big question to ask is ""had I never seen the original, would I like this movie"" and the answer is definitely yes. It's not a top 100 horror film, but it's on the borderlines. It's very good and very entertaining. I do know that there is a superior original, though, with a story that was already told once before and that reduces my grade for this movie to some degree."
"tequila101","8","2","3","26 August 2010"," This Film will leave you Disturbed
","Aka remakes Wes Craven's classic the Hills Have Eyes. I thought this was going to be another gore fest which was going to suck though I was really wrong about that.<br/><br/>I saw the Hills Have Eyes (1977) & (2006) both on the same day and I'd have to say the Original is better, though the Remake catches on very well because I find the Remake more of a disturbing film.<br/><br/>This remake keeps with the same plot as there is an American family riding in the desert and their car breaks down and then after that, blood-thirsty Mutants come and stalk them and then end up killing most of them.<br/><br/>This remake did an excellent job at leaving you scared shitless, I know I was after watching it. Especially the rape scene, my god that was disturbing. Usually remakes are never scary nor Disturbing but this one did a terrific job at it.<br/><br/>Though like always this remake has a downfall for being bloody. I'm glad that they didn't make it gory cause that would've ruined the film and most remakes with gore usually don't turn out the best.<br/><br/>I can't really complain about this remake because it was a very creepy, stalking one. The atmosphere was chilling, the villains where different which was quite a change and entire plot does have a more darker side.<br/><br/>I suggest you watch this film because you'll like it. This film will honestly leave you Disturbed for days and that is a great thing. That is what Horror films are meant to do. I wish that they would make some more remakes like this one because this one was (once again) DISTURBING!"
"Knuturo","3","2","3","10 June 2010"," Too disturbing for my taste...
","After I viewed this flick yesterday I really wanted to express my feelings about it because it's been weighing on my mind since.<br/><br/>First of all. At the beginning we see a happy normal American family, and it was then that I had a bad feeling about the rest of the movie, you know... usually there are just a couple of teenagers or young adults that you don't care about as much and of course you know that your watching a horror movie and you expect them to die, but this was a little over the line...not to mention that there is a baby involved..yes a baby!<br/><br/>Because it's just a normal family, you can relate to them and therefore you care for them 100 times more then for some stoned teenagers on vacation who sometimes even deserve the upcoming terrible events.<br/><br/>I really didn't want to see any of the family members die, but I kept watching it because I knew it was a movie and not based on real events and so on...<br/><br/>However!<br/><br/>Enough is enough when some of the family members (mom, son and son-in law) have to see the father tied up and burned alive to the ground while a deformed mutant brutally rapes the sister and the other holds the baby at gunpoint! Oh and by the way, the deformed rapist also starts to suck on the older sister's breast who recently had the baby in the movie with the son-in law...What's up with that?? <br/><br/>I mean is this what horror movies are all about today?? Being over the top sadistic and shocking? ""Hey just add enough blood and we can get an R rating and call it a horror movie"" I thought real horror movies were all about scaring people, not making them full of disgust and hatred for the bad guys...You are supposed to be scared of the bad guy, not hate him.<br/><br/>OK I know it's probably really hard to scare people, but it's definitely possible without so much cruelty and pointless violence against good people.<br/><br/>Another thing...If the mutants were in contact with the gas station owner, which I assume from the point that he calls for Ruby (one of the mutants) Why didn't those dumb-asses just eat off his food supplies?? That would have saved them a lot of blood and killings! And if he didn't have enough food supplies, why wasn't he then killing and eating off those people too? Makes no sense at all.<br/><br/>Anyway, there are some good things about this movie too, surprisingly. For example the film manages to make you hate the mutants so badly that you jump out of excitement when they are being killed one by one. Also, the beginning was a bit scary, with a few classic jump-scares. But after the unnecessary and brutal terrible events that happened to the family the movie completely went down-hill.<br/><br/>Many horror movies are better than this one, and for good reasons. In my opinion it's just another mentally disturbing movie like hostel and Wolf Creek (although Wolf Creek is a bit better) etc. etc. It's certainly not for everyone... Even worse, not for every horror fan, Which I consider myself to be!"
"johnwilloughby68","Null","2","3","19 August 2009"," The Hills have Noses
","The hills Have Eyes. Have you seen this? It is horrendously garbled tat. The version I saw was the re-make and it made me start to wonder why it was ever made in the first place. A weak and flimsy plot scattered with Hollywood style philosophical lines that are guaranteed to have you squirming with hatred for everything that is American. lines such as; The lucky ones die first. My immediate thought was that the lucky ones never get to watch this trite pap. I did actually consider myself to be lucky. right up until the point when I had sat through this unholy epic, now I think I am probably more unlucky than the people who actually survived this ordeal. The premise is weak; A suburban American family is being stalked by a group of psychotic people who live in the desert, far away from civilisation, and that's it. Each member of the family is killed off one by one in hideous and unimaginative ways by these psychotic hill-billies. I think it is fair to say that there are a couple of humorous parts in the film, but I really don't think that Alexandre Aja, the director of this modern masterpiece actually intended them to be funny. The film is supposed to be hard hitting and scary. I found it puerile and boring."
"zmwalter","2","2","3","2 September 2007"," For fans of low-brow gore-fests only.
","Ugh. What a waste of time.<br/><br/>Let's start with the fact that the flick is formulaic in the extreme. Every single plot element is damn-near interchangeable with several other movies in the genre (of which, more later), to include ""The Descent"", ""Wrong Turn"", etc. No shocks, no scares, utterly, completely, predictable.<br/><br/>Which makes one wonder, ""Why would anyone watch this?"" Because it's an example of what contemporary writers call ""torture-porn"", and what earlier writers call ""Theater of Pain"". You watch it because you enjoy seeing people hacked to pieces, burned alive, impaled by all manner of pointy objects, or even, in this flick, raped by deformed mutants (although in response to a common thread on this movie's message boards, I didn't find the rape scene all that graphic. Disturbing and awful, yes. But glory be, they left some things to the imagination). Maybe you like the thrill of nausea you get from watching cruelty, maybe you don't. But if you don't get a little creeped out by the degree of violence and depravity in this flick, you should perhaps be a little concerned about your own psychological barometer.<br/><br/>I won't patronize the audience by asking ""how could you enjoy this?"" Like I said, it's a form of porn. It just isn't for me, nor, I would venture to say for anyone who like films with subtlety or nuance. This is Grand Guignol, nothing more or less."
"UncleG","2","2","3","22 August 2007"," A shadow of a deeper thought can not be found in the desert

It is not frightening, it's all about g-o-r-e and disgusting ""zombie-like"" monsters crawling the desert. -The characters are so silly, that you can't care about them. Typical genre clichés are used here, but ain't funny any more. <br/><br/>In conclusion: disgusting violent scenes are not a reason for seeing this.

","Back in the 1970's, there was a movie with the same title. Now they have the same movie, same title, different type of intensity. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. A family going to California for vacation would have to take the scenic route. Who would know it would end up being a tourist trap? No one when some spike strips used in highway pursuits would totally disable the family SUV. In the original version the vehicle was a station wagon. That there's an upgrade. That one has a history. A history anyone would should forget. Mutant outcasts spreading terror after a nuclear blast years ago. Man, these people got a serious grudge. Not only did they take out the father, mother, in-law, and brutally assaulting the sister, it's up to the men of the group to fight back. Doug, who hated guns puts his ideologies behind him fast to get his daughter back from those fiendish beings. However, only one of them mutants was helpful with the victims, and rebelled against them. That freakish one with the strength and ax was a challenge. And the brother of the sister was mad enough to avenge the death of his dog. Very bloody, and very intensifying, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a keeper. So either way you go, 1977 or 2006, it very scary and not for the weak! Rating 3 out of 5 stars!"

","Alex Aja (High Tension) directs a well made horror film with great finesse here...well, the scenes are anything but clean, however. There is TONS of blood in 'The Hills Have Eyes', a disturbing film about a family (Cast members are not important, but movie goers will recognize Aaron Stanford of X-Men: The Last Stand and Emilie de Ravin of Lost), a mom, dad, sisters, one brother, one sister's husband, the young couple's child, and two dogs. This family is on their way out west when the get lost, unaware that their location is also home to enraged and horrifying humans who were mutated from nuclear radiation from atomic bomb testing. And the monsters aren't too happy about having visitors.<br/><br/>'Hills' is full of blood and gore that any horror fan will be a fan of. There is not a ton of mystery, but that is not really a factor. This is a very gruesome picture, as it contains material that no one under 17 should see, including strong and bloody gore, a scene of rape, masses of blood, people burning alive, and explosions. The film does do a great job of keeping the audience attached, which is it's best quality. The action and suspense keeps going throughout the entire film, and doesn't just stick with the normal 'crazies are attacking' plot. It actually grows into more, like a good movie should. I must add that Emilie de Ravin is a ton of fun to look at, so that was probably one thing that helped me enjoy more. The ending does leave it open for a sequel, which is great, because I can't wait to see more films like this. This film is not as scary as High Tension, but it IS better. Any horror fan will love this film, and any movie fan who can stand for the gore and blood will enjoy too. Alex Aja has done well on this one, and I look forward to watching more films of his.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

The acting was very-well done except for the scene midway through the movie when one of the freaks was chasing the young boy. This kid appeared earlier to have great knowledge of firearms but when he was being chased, it reminded me of a toddler with a water pistol. If these mutant rejects had just killed my family, I would be just as blood thirsty as the freaks were. All in all, If you're into suspense and horror, this movie is worth checking-out. The crew who looked after make-up, special effects, and costumes did an amazing job on the freaks. They looked authentic and a lot better then the ones in the original 1977 version.

Usually with those films you can say the death scenes were cool, you know unrealistic or never going to happen.<br/><br/>But with this film it kept me on the edge of oblivion, it wasn't funny in any single way. IT WAS Extremely DISTURBING AND SICK. I mean what kind of a director tries to scare you in to a panic attack (I actually did have a panic attack). The scene in the trailer where two of the mutants sexually abused two helpless and defenceless women (sexually abused is an understatement to describe the scene) made me feel shocked, angry, sick, afraid and very hurt! And to make it much worse the father of the women was being burned alive at the same time. And who in there right mind thinks of an idea for the cannibals to kidnap the family baby for food.<br/><br/>Take this for example: If the film didn't have a family involved as the main victims and maybe something like a group of older teenagers /Adults instead it might be another horror film that I could accept, but this film has gone way over the boundaries!!! It is an absolutely vile film!!! It's not so much the blood and gore, it's a lot to do with the rape, bodily abuse of innocent people.<br/><br/>You would absolutely hate you family and loved ones to be pictured in that film.<br/><br/>After the film i had to get my mate to drive me back home as I was in no fit state to do so because of the film, and he wasn't even insured on my car.

","I saw The Hills Have Eyes this past weekend and I must say I was quite surprised and pleased to say the least. I expected a gory horror movie along the lines of a Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses with torture scenes like that in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. However the movie was quite enjoyable, now I must point out that I am a horror movie fan and I go see all of them in the theater, no matter what. I laughed my way through Saw with the rest of the theater (although, I must say the idea of it was fantastic and it could have been great with better acting) and had to have a friend go with me to the bathroom after The Grudge.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie were fantastic and enthralling. They instantly drew me into the movie and got very deep and dark into their chanters. Although the dogs drove me crazy and if one more person let me out without a lease, I was going to scream I like the angle they added to the movie and they set up realistic reason for the family to go out in the desert I would go searching for my dog.<br/><br/>The movie did have some consistence issues, however I must say one constant was they were all (not just the mutants) superhuman in there strengths. Bobby fell of the mountain and other then a bump on the head was just fine, Bob was beaten and then it still took like 5 mins for him to burn to death, poor Doug was beat numerous times, I mean thrown through walls and still was walking tall. The mutants were also put to death several times and never seemed to die. I am going to attribute this to adrenalinesmile!! Overall I really liked the movie, it keep me on the edge of my seat, with birds flying out and well placed filler scares b/w the major drama. Yes it had gore and yes, it's a horror movie remake. I don't think it left you guessing too much except the end, which obviously leaves room for a sequel."

","I have never seen the original version of 'The Hills Have Eyes', so I'm in no position to comment on the loyalty, or otherwise, of the script and characterisation of the current screen incarnation, directed by Alexandre Aja.<br/><br/>As part of the larger family-in-distress-from-bloodthirsty-hicks sub-genre, though, it's traditional fare. The cock-sure and homely are quickly offed, the spoilt blonde quickly becomes the lust-object of the aggressors, and the downtrodden liberal hero embraces brutality in order to protect what he loves. The mutant miners, too, as the slavering, gibbering, malformed gimps we have come to expect. That said, these are all tried and tested elements of the genre, so perhaps it would be redundant to complain that they are clichés.<br/><br/>To it's credit, despite the occasional lapses into astonishing improbability  the seemingly indestructible family pet who repeatedly arrives to save the day just in the nick of time, and the feckless teens who develop MacGuyver-type tricks and traps to counter attacks of their foes  it does have a certain unpredictability. There are violent set-pieces, of course, but most of these seem to emerge out of what passes for a plot  rather than from a need to see someone eviscerated according to a set cinematic schedule. How much this structure is borrowed from the original, or is a refinement of the same, I cannot say.<br/><br/>What really lets the film down is a lack of decent characterisation. We are not invited to sympathise with them  other than, in the most general terms, the unfortunate circumstance of being butchered by mutants  so, ultimately, we have no emotional investment in caring who lives or dies.<br/><br/>In the final frames we see the same electrical binocular view of our heroes as in earlier scenes, indicating, of course, that the defeated mutants are not their only threatand that a franchise is on the way.<br/><br/>Mildly diverting, if predictable, gore-filled twaddle."
"Frottage","9","2","3","19 March 2006"," My way of reviewing a horror film
","This is not a very in-depth review for the movie itself. It's more of a generic ""this is how I grade a horror movie"", but i think people will find it useful: When I go to a movie (horror especially) I want to know next to nothing about it and see where it takes me. I've had too many experiences hearing about a movie and going into it with a certain expectation and having it shattered. so, ignorant of as much possible, I want a horror movie to:<br/><br/>--Scare me-- OK, duh, but i mean: not just cheap ""BOO!!"" scares but shocking me with twisted, messed up, depraved actions that I'm glad I could never think up myself. I'm not especially squeamish, so i expect a good horror movie to lay the depravity on thick and make me think, ""oh sh**!"" <br/><br/>--Be believable-- I hate it when an actor makes a stupid decision or a plot line that would never happen brings you into reality and you think, ""oh yeah, i'm watching a movie. the writer who came up with that idea right there is an idiot."" <br/><br/>--Draw me in-- Have believable characters, character growth (if even possible in a horror movie), contain sufficient suspense and gore, able to create reactions from me - make my jaw drop, have me (want to) yell at the screen, feel my heart rate increase, etc.<br/><br/>This movie does it all. I don't care about how it relates to the original or whether or not it's offensive. All i know is i was scared, i got involved with the movie / characters, and enjoyed it."
"lonewolf_and_cub","Null","2","3","14 March 2006"," The return of the great American Nightmare
","Thank god for directors like Alexandre Aja. It seems only an extremely small handful of people still working in the movie business these days remember what makes a good, effective horror movie and Aja is certainly one of them. This movie drips eeriness and tension, i haven't seen a film that's kept me so on the edge of my seat in so long that this film reminded me all over again how powerful cinema can be and you can't get much of a higher recommendation than that. This film harks back to a time when horror flicks had something to say rather than just being about pretty teens getting carved up. It doesn't feel like a studio film-it seems way too brutal and visceral for a studio picture but then if you've seen Aja's previous masterpiece HAUTE TENSION(SWITCHBLADE ROMANCE) you know what to expect from his twisted yet brilliant psyche. So does it beat the original? In my humble opinion yes it does, the family are far scarier this time partly due to the fact they're a lot more grotesque(nuclear fallout made them mutate in this version) but also partly due to the way they revel in killing, torture and rape and harbour no mercy whatsoever, the family's pleas falling on deaf malformed ears. The premise is as old as the titular hills itself but the intensity and shocks in this movie plus quite likable characters are what carries it through-Aja's direction is brilliant too-he captures the ominousness and vastness of the desert perfectly, the scenes in the mining town near the end being some of the most well shot in this type of movie that i have seen in a long time. It is a little similar to the original in terms of the fate of the characters but it has enough surprises to keep fans of the original entertained-most notably the brutal battle in the mining town where Doug evens the odds against the freaks with nail-biting results. If i had one criticism it would have to be that considering its theme that violence begets violence and dehumanises the victims as well as the perpetrators it perhaps makes their victory seem a bit too much like a triumph at the end but other than that it's damn near flawless."
"astro-43","8","2","3","13 March 2006"," Great for modern horror but did not live up to the original...
","...nor my expectations.<br/><br/>I had great fun watching this on opening night in a packed theater, and thought overall it was as good or better than almost any of the recent sea of horror releases. However, I have two primary complaints (which involve spoilers to some degree): <br/><br/>1. NOT GORY ENOUGH. Having read reviews that said things to the effect that the director didn't know the difference between scaring and assaulting the audience, and that this movie was unbearably gory, I have to ask what kind of sissies the reviewers are. Did none of them see High Tension? Now *that* was gory.<br/><br/>2. WHY DUMB IT DOWN? It's not like the original was a very complex movie to understand, but the remake actually removes nuance and complexity rather than adding it. I'm talking specifically about the elimination of any back story with the mutant family, their connection to the old man in the beginning of the movie, etc.<br/><br/>Given the atrocious, out of place patriotic gesture in the last quarter of the movie (if you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about), I actually wonder if that and the reduction of story are a French Director's snobby comment on (the lack of) intellectualism of American audiences. Not that he'd be entirely wrong - the flag schtick drove the teens in the audience to hooting cheers.<br/><br/>I thought the remake was great at nearly mimeographing the 'normal' family, but why the reduction of story re: the mutant family? Still, I love me some horror, and this was still good horror, despite not comparing well, in my eyes, to the masterpiece original."

Anyone who thinks otherwise...I don't know, I guess it is just opinion, but it's hard to believe that someone can dislike it. (Unless they really cant stand gore, thats understandable) I thought it was excellent, good music, chilling scenes, disturbing scenarios, perfect atmosphere, good acting. It also gets an emotional stir out of you, as you feel bad for both sides in the movie at times. Mostly the family of course, and it really sucks you in.

","Hollywood is hardly lacking in remakes of 70s cult horror flicks, Wes Craven bringing many of them to us through what seems to be a real desire to genuinely frighten a hardened contemporary audience. The Hills Have Eyes brings us more 'lambs to the slaughter' in what may be one of the most gruesome remakes in years.<br/><br/>The films plot more or less abides the pre-set rules of it's predecessor; average American family complete with the 'Big Bob' (Levine) father figure and his teenage children are stranded in a desert, seemingly alone. Of course, they aren't alone. After one of the family's beloved pets goes missing, a twisted (and ultimately shallow) plot begins to unravel involving terror, shock and (of course) disgust.<br/><br/>Being a shocker film, The Hills Have Eyes relies heavily on what is clearly a good eye for horror direction; which results in scenes of quiet, wait-it-out torture, and others of genuine, intense terror. One scene in particular, which lasts for perhaps ten minutes maximum (yet feels like an hour) is incredibly uncomfortable to watch, and although the characters involved are never properly established (as is a common trait of horror flicks), audiences will find themselves holding their breath, mouths agape throughout. Musically, the film excels in places, as screeching strings conjure images of sharpness and agony, further enhancing the tense nature of the films more horrific scenes.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is, rather than a horror flick, a gruesome shocker. And although it may not really reach it's audience on a deeper level of communication through a meaningful and complex plot, the drama and genuinely horrific scenes portrayed at the films darkest moments certainly make its audience feel something. Even if it is nausea."

"underclass_hero24","9","1","1","5 March 2011"," Reminded me of what a horror is supposed to be like
","I didn't go into watching this film with high hopes. Hearing that it was a remake of an old Wes Craven slasher furthered my skepticism. The only real reason I bothered was because a) my girlfriend had broken up with me and I needed something to distract me and b) its got Emilie De Ravin in it who in my opinion is extremely cute.<br/><br/>The last movie that truly scared me was Aliens which I saw when I was twelve, since then all horrors I've seen have been little more than gore feasted stalker movies. The Hills Have Eyes changed all that. It opens with a nice gory scene of scientists getting impaled with pitch forks, the brutality caught my attention. Things slow right down as the film introduces the Carter family taking the scenic route through the desert to San Diego. ""Yay there's Emilie!"" says the slightly interested me. <br/><br/>Then things get a bit worse, their truck and caravan gets sabotaged by road spikes. Okay, now I'm watching. Whilst the 1st 30mins is a bit slow, it did something that other horrors don't do: character development. When the s#!* hit the fan (and it does horribly), I wasn't laughing like I generally do. I was genuinely shocked and felt sorry for the characters.<br/><br/>The violence is extremely explicit in this movie, no holds barred and it was for once genuinely disturbing. This movie has restored my nervous approach to horrors and also on a side note confirmed that Emilie only does good movies ^_^"
"jake-law123","6","1","1","31 December 2010"," Decent remake, okay film.
","Nobody really expected any higher of this depressing remake to Wes Craven's 1977 horror film. Although it does follow the first quite well, the film itself could have been less depressing, and more frightening. Its set on what kind of horror your into. The psychological type, or the gory type. For this, its a little of both. But a lot of key things in this are taken away for its own pleasure. But it still holds out.<br/><br/>The story is about an American family who become stranded in the middle of the New Mexico desert, where they become the prey of cannibalistic mutated humans living in the hills.<br/><br/>Similar characters, similar dialogue, and similar events to the original, this one brings a different approach that the other one did. Brought up the gore, and simplified the dialogue. Goes a little overboard with the blood and violence, and the scenes go on to the very end until your ready to call it quits. But if you stay throughout the whole film, its not that hard.<br/><br/>A few fatalities are entertaining. But the scenes for this film become not much, and don't seem that long. The first half is them becoming stranded, and getting attacked by the mutants. The second half, all the way to the end is hunting down the mutants. It just turns into a slaughterhouse.<br/><br/>Not that this takes away from the film, but these guys are pussies. A guy with a gun runs away from one of the mutants chasing him. Try shooting him! It would be so awesome to bring the Dawn of the Dead guys in there, and take care of all of them easily. Its like, stand aside and make way for these guys. They would all gun them down in no time.<br/><br/>Like I said before, it as a remake is good. As for it as an actual film, its not that bad, but its not that good. It has its flaws, but overall its watchable. If you have seen the first and are curious, give it a viewing. If you haven't, then still go ahead. Its not like you absolutely have to watch the original first. Just avoid the sequels. They suck!"
"Blekkhart","6","1","1","1 November 2010"," Can't decide whether to be offended or impressed
","I review this movie without having seen the original. Maybe that's just as good, since the review will then be based on the merits of this movie alone and not on how it holds to the original. What is this movie all about ? To me it's about shock value, horror, torture, freaks, sadism, survival, humiliation, revenge and a lot of gore. Some people will probably find the gore and horror in this movie hilarious and look at it with humor, while other people will be offended. Personally I'm leaning more towards the latter. I love horror movies, but I was never a fan of movies like Hostel and Saw, where horrific killings and torture seems to be used solely for shock value - as cheap entertainment. This movie will probably appeal to the audience of those movies. But in my view it is a superior movie. It's not Deliverance, which explored the theme of survival against sadism on a different and more serious level (I would label that movie more of a drama than a horror movie). Hills is definitely a horror movie and pure entertainment. But as such it's actually very well made ! The directing, acting, locations, effects, musical score...it is all quality stuff and makes this movie something more than just a cheap bucket of blood and fake limbs being poured all over the audience. I find this movie quite artistic and atmospheric at times. The cinematography is nice. It's not a cheap attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers..it's quite a classy attempt on cashing in on gore hungry viewers:) And I guess it must be a worthy remake of the original. What it all comes down to is - do you like these kind of movies or not. If you do, I guess I can recommend this movie. But it's definitely not for the faint of heart. Personally, I was balancing on the edge all through the movie, not being able to decide if I should be impressed by the quality of the filmmaking, or if I should be offended on what was portrayed on the screen. What really made this movie hard for me to watch was the scene involving rape and murder of innocent women, and the fact that there was a baby involved. But in terms of filmmaking it's definitely a good movie. So I guess I will give it a 6. I'm sure people who are not offended, will easily be able to give it a higher rating."

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother repeating the ""The hills have eyes"" synopsis because since it's a remake, the premise is nearly identical to the original. First of all, the script is certainly fresh. The performers are very likable and truly grasp common sense. May I add, the characters are devoid of stereotypes. Moreover, the gore, is simply phenomenal. Gore isn't the equivalent of a good film, but, since this film is a cannibal film, I thought I'd emphasize a little on the violence aspect. Furthermore, the pacing is perfect because it's very brisk and things run along very smoothly. <br/><br/>Now, while this film isn't dreadful, there were some flaws in my opinion. For starters, I did not appreciate the resolution of the film because it seemed like it detracted from the experience by a little. Furthermore, I thought the film took quite a while to get going, but once the stuff hits the fan, it hits strong. In addition, I thought the implied rape scene was very unnecessary. It seemed highly out of context and didn't fit the mood of the film for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this remake does not disappoint, but judged as a film, it's really nothing special. I really admired the script, I liked the performances, and my interest was peaked throughout, but something was lacking. While this is a remake, there are some very startling moments and this movie is highly gritty. Don't be fooled, this movie doesn't take you to a place where the stars shine. ""The hills have eyes"" is a worth a rental. Not much else though."

","Fairly faithful remake of Craven's Hill Billy seventies classic, a movie which I have never really gotten along with. Just as in the original, an unsuspecting family attempt to drive through the New Mexico Desert on their way to California when the 4x4 pulling their caravan has a blow out and they plow into a large rock. Was it just a freak accident, or did the mutant inhabitants of the hillsides set a trap to ensnare any unsuspecting travellers? As night falls and oddness ensues, it soon becomes clear that the mutated denizens of the valley are the result of nuclear experiments, the American government testing their hardware on a region supposedly uninhabited (this really happened, folks) who are now all too eager to chow down on warm, ripe, healthy flesh. This remake suffers much along the same lines as the original, with lots of running around, shrieking, wobbly camera syndrome, and not a whole lot of anything actually happening. Craven is on board once more, this time as producer, so there is some authenticity to proceedings - presumably the reason it is so faithful to the source material - but, given that the original movie isn't really up to snuff, the remake was only ever going to struggle.

","In my recent search to find a descent horror flick, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was my next choice. Being born and raised in New Mexico, I am always interested in movies that are either filmed there or claim to take place there. Now that I live in St. Louis, I am a big critic of ""New Mexico"" movies. First off, the opening scene had me laughing hysterically. I love how they made the desert look more like Mars. It was obviously not filmed there. There are a lot of directing mistakes, mainly in geography. First off, there is no Hwy 88. I also know that parts of NM (like near Lordsburg and Alamogordo) look pretty desolate, but it's not as bad as shown in the movie. I'm also surprised how these ""creatures"" keep sneaking up on the characters in the wide open desert. Here are a few more mistakes: there are no mosquitoes in NM--it's the desert--remember? Also, if it's supposed to be the middle of summer, why are they wearing pants and jackets when it would be 95-105 degrees outside? There was gore galore and a few ""jump out of your seat"" scenes. I was a little weary to watch the scenes with the baby (being a mom, it was hard to think what they might have done to her). I also don't like how they portrayed the mom. Why do they always make them sound so stupid? ie- ""oh, honey it's probably just a coyote....""

I was expecting lots of gore when I watched it, and what I got was way beyond my expectations, I was one happy gore-phile after that one. But the thing is, it's actually a good movie, the story is cliché but it's alright, the acting isn't great but it does the job. It is an average movie that I would normally give a movie like this a 7, but the violence and the tension definitely boosted the rating, because it adds so much to the movie and makes it so much more effective.

","A family is driving across the desert wastes of New Mexico on their way to San Diego. It's the last trip for the whole family as one daughter has married and has a child, and the other two kids are reaching an age where family trips aren't quite as fun anymore. But dad has just retired from the police force and it he and his wife's wedding anniversary so it's a special occasion. None of the kids wanted to take the cross-country trip in the Suburban with an old Airstream trailer in tow but it was for the parents so you suck it up and do it. On their way through the desert an old man who owns a fill-up station tells them of a short cut that will save them a couple of hours drive time. Wonderful. When they take this shortcut though the family quickly finds out that it's no short cut at all, but a trap set by a family living in the hills that cover this desert. A family with a taste for human flesh. And now this suburban family will have to fight for their lives against another family that is barely human, a family that has made its livelihoods on preying on travelers coming through their hills, and a family with some monstrous secrets that won't be secret much longer. So if the movie is damned close to the original in its story  identical in fact save for some important fleshing out  why the hell do I like it more than the original? The aforementioned fleshing out is why. In this version the hill family, and there are a lot more of them this time around, come straight out of a nightmare. Deformed and deranged, this family doesn't just seem like hill people who have lived out in the wilds too long but like true mutants that are no longer human at all. These are truly monsters, and they act monstrously. And director Aja allows the family to act their fury and their horror out instead of giving them dialogue. These are monsters and monsters rarely need to say a damned thing to be monstrous. I also love that the story of where these people come from and what made them is expanded. Sure, we hear about the fact that nuclear testing made this freakish family but it's far more powerful when we see it and see where they live. And I liked that the husband to the family's daughter is such a weasel because it makes his story arc so much more interesting when you see it come to fruition. All is not perfect however. There are some very odd musical cues here that all but work to take the air out of scenes. I can't really remember us finding out solidly that the gas station owner is the father, to a degree, of this family of mutants. Unless they decided to change that fact altogether, they make it pretty vague. A strength in the original was the back-story on Papa Jupiter and poor old Jupe is kinda relegated to a bit part in the film, which is a shame. There is also one edit that drove me nuts, where the camera pushes in on something but there are jump cuts added in as well. Ack! So there are some bumps on this road but not so many that it derails a pretty good movie. And a pretty nasty movie. I know there were a lot of young people in our showing and at least two young women walked out. Why? 'Cause this isn't a fun horror film, something we have gotten a lot of in the past few years. There are no real laughs, there are no ghost kids, and this is not PG-13. This is a hard 'R' rated horror film that will upset a lot of people. As well it should. It wasn't made to give a few light scares but to freak you the hell out. Whether it goes too far is up to each individual to decide but for me, it nailed the feel it should have. This is an unsettling story and feels that way. I like the original Hills but I really like this remake. The direction is great, the camera-work is superb, the scares are solid, and the makeup fx is amazing. Myself, I have problems with a few things in it but it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me and it was actually better than I expected it to be, and that's always nice to find. I recommend this for horror fans looking for another hardcore movie to remind them why they love the genre but casual fans might sit this one out.<br/><br/>Definitely Worth A Rent!"
"luke-346","7","1","1","1 February 2007"," Finally a contemporary American horror with a little bit of guts!
","Alexandre Aja has constructed a wonderful horror remake of Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes, but before I get to the ins and outs of my comment I think it's important to note that the horror genre should split opinions and on reading some of the other comments this film it clearly does. Yes it does contain scenes that some viewers would find 'gory', 'stomach churning', 'horrific', 'sick', 'twisted' and even 'demented', but these are all terms that I believe should be associated with a good horror film. Secondly it is one of the few contemporary American horror films that dare to embrace a scene of sexual violence and consider it integral to the plot. This is due to it occurring during the audiences' introduction to the nuclear fall-out victims and is purely there to help assist the audience in establishing these characters as extremely menacing and repulsive and every time these characters are seen on screen this is how the audience will feel - repulsed. Having seen the film several times now I can say that it is encouraging to see a film that is attempting to push the boundaries that little bit more on what can be accepted in modern Hollywood cinema (even if it is in the form of mutated killers in the New Mexico desert).<br/><br/>The suffering encountered by the family throughout the film will be seen by some viewers as gruesome  but then again it is a horror! The film does suffer from horror clichés and it does pose you with many burning questions whilst you are watching (including ""Why shoot?"" Why investigate the strange noise?"" ""Don't go in there"" etc) and these thoughts will take the edge away for many viewers. <br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes does have a strong Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel to it as there are many similarities that can quite easily be drawn. Another film that's heavily referenced is Straw Dogs, mainly through the Character of Doug to Dustin Hoffman, as audiences will quite easily buy into his perceived outlook on life not to mention his laid-back appearance.<br/><br/>Another downfall in the film lies with the decision for it to have a strong political stance. It is littered with examples, predominantly encapsulated with the over use of the American flag. There are many political connotations including the reference of guns being a tool for Republicans (and the guns ultimate failure in achieving any service for the family  in fact it's negative), the use of the Hendrix's 'Star Spangled Banner' riff when Doug reaches down to collect his glasses after a bloody battle with a nuclear fall-out victim (a rendition that is often associated with anti-war and anti-American notions), the use of the dog as his sidekick can arguably be seen as an association with the Democrats (Blue Dog Democrats, Yellow Dog etc) and of course the role of the girl in the bright red coat.<br/><br/>Finally the film is a very good remake and yes, in my opinion, it is better and it will divide movie goers but what it won't do is divide the level of appreciation that will gained by many horror fans from this welcomed, well-made and well delivered re-instalment to the genre."

A clan of genetic mutants, with a thirst for blood are watching them, planning their attack on the unsuspecting family.<br/><br/>The Hills have Eyes is a very gruesome and spine chilling horror flick that surpasses the original made by Wes Craven. The characters are very well fleshed out before the carnage begins, and it really helps to bring a real sense of compassion for the impending victims.<br/><br/>The cast all portray the terror of the situation very convincingly, and the character evolution runs nicely along side the story and the events within it. The Direction captures the tension and the sheer brutality of the plot effortlessly and this, coupled with the realistic and stomach churning visuals, heightens the impact of movie very effectively.<br/><br/>7/10 Not a film for the feint of heart"
"czarnobog","8","1","1","22 July 2006"," Not as Scary as the Original but Still Fun to Watch
","This movie starts off great. The opening title sequence is beautifully done -- everything, that is, except the title credits themselves. On a big screen they may have been readable, but reduced to a TV screen they are a messy glob of orange. Dark orange which is absorbed by the density of the images behind them. Maybe it's time for movie companies and post houses to start considering that film titles and TV titles are two different things, and separate sets could be made. At least until five foot TV screens are the norm. That is, when everyone has them. Not just the people designing the credits.<br/><br/>The casting of the family is superb. What a blessing to see a horror film with a mostly unknown cast. No supermodel ingénues like Jessica Biel or Sara Michelle Gellar to detract from the illusion of reality. Considering the quasi-verite feel of the original, which was a huge part of its power, this was an especially wise choice. The costumes and make-up are magnificently mundane, contributing to the build-up of tension. These are characters any average human can relate to, and the hints that they are stepping into something horrific effectively prime us for an explosion of horror.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that promise is broken the moment we meet our first bad guy. While the casting of the family is sublime, the actors chosen for the mutant freaks is soft and unconvincing. The lamely designed make-up never disguises the fact that these are normal, even attractive actors. One can only assume that the director, who handled so many aspects of this production perfectly, took a miscalculated gamble that the make-up itself would render the characters frightening. Either that, or someone decided that they wanted this to be a soft horror film. Something to appeal to the undemanding, middle-of-the-road audience, rather than the hardcore horror fans.<br/><br/>One of the creepiest things about Wes Craven's original version was the believability of the hill people. Michael Berryman's freakish features combined with his subtly bizarre costume were more unsettling than any of the characters in this remake. Even in their special efx make-up, the new freaks are about as scary as something you'd expect to find in a circus sideshow.<br/><br/>One real treat in this film is the cinematography. This is perhaps the most exciting piece of cinematography in the horror genre since Adam Greenberg worked with Kathryn Bigelow on ""Near Dark."" Hopefully the young Belgian cinematographer will continue to grace movies worthy of his very distinctive style, and not wind up shooting bloated Hollywood turkeys... or worse, directing humongous turkeys like Jan de Bont.<br/><br/>Older horror fans who caught the original version in a theatre will no doubt view this differently than younger viewers who have no pre-conceived expectations. Those who do note the difference have to call into question Wes Craven's influence in making this one a bit glossier and less frightening. Every year sees more Wes Craven productions, with a wide range of success. The sheer volume and disparity suggests he's more of a rubber stamp than an actual hands on producer -- but the lack of true scariness in this movie may also be the mark of his older, softer sensibilities imposed upon the director.<br/><br/>While not as scary as the original, this is an enjoyable film. It's the kind of ""horror movie"" that a true horror fan can sit through in the company of friends who are fans of the kind of horror which isn't really very scary but can scare the pants off them."

","The movie has got some bad press because of the level of violence and gore, but I find this a tad ridiculous. The previews alone set the stage for an extremely disturbing venture into a families encounter with violent radiated mutants. Anyone expecting a relaxing family film has issues.<br/><br/>The makeup crew does a wonderful job with the mutants, and the story is on par with your average slasher flick. Overall, the movie was worth watching, but not one I would rush out to buy. The suicide scene was superbly done, and the rape scene (which seems to be the primary cause of so much conflict) was scary and intense. Just like it should be. I found the ""I am a peace-loving hippie until you make me mad then I turn into Rambo"" schtick a bit of a stretch, but hey, it's Hollywood right?<br/><br/>If you are looking for an intense, scary movie with wonderful special effects...watch it. If extreme violence and gore in film bothers you...don't."

","This is one of the best horror movie remakes I've ever seen. If you love gore, you'll definitely love this! The acting and scenery for the movie is perfect. You really can't help but to love the eccentricity of the freakishly frightening people of the hills. The director really gives them a lot of different characteristics and makes them unique in their own different ways. The movie really starts to get exciting when the remaining stranded family begins to defend themselves and seek revenge on the mutants that surround them. This has got to be the scariest movie I've ever seen but at the same time fascinating. I found it very hard to take my eyes off the screen even during the most disturbing scenes. This movie is a horror spectacle at best."

","Just returned home from the theatre after watching ""The Hills have eyes"".<br/><br/>I have heard of Wes Craven's original but never had the chance to see it. Therefore I cannot tell you if it is better than the original, equal, or worse. What I can assure you is that is an highly intense movie. You get very attached to the characters, you feel like you are in their shoes. Frustrated and lost when the car breaks down in the desert, scared and helpless when they are attacked by the mutants, angry and revengeful when they attack the mutants. If you also consider that the plot of the movie is nothing special (a family lost in the desert is attacked by mutants), the director succeeds in keeping us at the end of our seats during the whole time. <br/><br/>Whether you are a horror fan or not you should watch it."
"SoylentGreenIsPeople91","8","1","1","8 July 2006"," Not too Bad...
","Along with many other fans of the original, I was pretty annoyed when I learnt that it was getting the remake treatment. However, that was before a mate of mine pointed out that Alexander ""switchblad Romance"" Aja was at the helm. Although i haden't seen Switchblad Romance, i had read the reviews, seen clips from the film, and was able to deduce that the man has a considerable amount of talent. Indeed, the script for this film, which mercifully does not rely too much on old clichés, sets the tone and pace very well. the story is pretty basic, so could have turned out badly in the wrong hands, but it proves to not only follow the original closely, but also to add some interesting twists. You see, i find that many remakes, although good films, do not follow the original closely enough (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax), which makes us wonder if the makers have actually SEEN the original, or too closely (psycho, the Omen), which leaves us wondering what the point is, but this is a very well done adaptation that Wes Craven should surely be proud of. It features nice character development, unusually good acting, great special FX, and enough blood to keep all gorehounds well chuffed. fans will love it."
"rebelphilos","8","1","1","25 June 2006"," The hills have eyes and the producers too: excellent popcorn horror
","When you decide to watch a movie like this updated version of ""The hills have eyes"" you are not looking for a Hitchcock nor a Kubrick. Not even an Oscar nominee. What you really want is a couple of hours of good plain entertainment, with some smart suspense, a minimally coherent plot, and a good production that should translate in a clear direction, good photography and adequate sound (yes, sound, the main element in the ""boo-factor"", you know, those moments when the people jump from their seats and screams pop up around the theater).<br/><br/>Well, this movie has all of the above. It provides the kind of entertainment you expect without being too explicit except in what refers to human or mutant butchery that nowadays seems to be a must for the genre. Nevertheless these scenes are very well achieved, rounding an excellent work in cinematography by Belgium Maxime Alexandre, under an overall good direction over his own screenplay by Frenchman Alexandre Aja.<br/><br/>For my surprise this movie does not make use of the usual resource of the hot chicks nor hot guys. Actually there is nothing close to the hot guy stereotype, but even though there is good hot chick material in American Vinessa Shaw (a Kubrick-chick if you remember ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and Australian Emilie de Ravin (your lovely Claire Littleton in ""Lost"") playing as sisters, there is basically no explicit use of her sensuality, even less of her natural body attributes. There are two scenes than run together where one after other sister are under some kind of perverse sexual harassment where almost everything is left to you to complete with your own dirty mind.<br/><br/>Again, be aware that this is a good movie form the absolute light entertainment point of few. Don't think not even for a second it's perfect. The plot is full of holes, some impossible stuff happens, but what the hack, the whole idea is just a big impossibility, this is not a documentary or anything like that. So be smart, lower your criticism, help yourself with a drink, a good dosage of sugar or whichever substance makes your mood go smooth, relax and have fun."
"tbyrne4","8","1","1","10 June 2006"," Surprisingly scary remake of Wes Craven film
","re-make of Wes Craven's grungy 1977 film of the same name, ""The Hills Have Eyes"", directed by Alexandre Aja is surprisingly freaky.<br/><br/>It's essentially a re-tread of the original: A family on vacation is trekking through the New Mexico desert on their way to San Diego (although I think in the original they were in Nevada) and break down in what used to be an atomic test site. A family of hill-dwelling mutants, deformed from the fallout caused by the atomic testing, attacks the family, who are forced to fight back and become as ""savage"" as the ""savages"".<br/><br/>The original paid more attention to the mutant family. They were more of a primeval clan with a code and a genuine reason for doing what they were doing: taking revenge on the civilized world for making them who they were. Their appearances and actions were more understated and the audience was forced to empathize with them (a little, anyway). The girl Ruby, in the original, was a perfectly normal-looking girl (quite a cute one, too). In the re-make the mutants are flat-out monsters. Everything they do is brutal and putrid and horrifying.<br/><br/>Craven's intention with the original was not just to make a horror film but (as in ""Last House on the Left"") to make a horror film that acted as social protest. The film is based upon a actual incident in Scotland where a group of cannibals were found living in a cave. They would set upon travellers, rob them, and steal their belongings. What attracted Craven to the story was not just that they were cannibals, but that when they were caught, the cannibals were tried and then tortured (!!) by the ""law"" for their crimes. He was fascinated by the way civilization becomes savage in the face of savagery, often outdoing it.<br/><br/>Aja's film succeeds as a straight-forward horror film (remarkably so, too) but there is nary a whiff of social protest to be found here. The stock footage of nuclear blasts and fallout victims is necessary for the story but slightly disappointing because, in the end, if the mutant family are such incredible monsters, who cares how they got that way?? It could have been in a train wreck for all we care.<br/><br/>The first forty-five or so minutes are all build-up. The footage of the desert (shot in Morocco, I believe) is absolutely stunning. When the mutants move in for the kill: they move in FAST. It happens fast and is disturbing because of Aja's willingness to go overboard with the mayhem and through some sneaky sound techniques that makes it feel like the viewer is being pummelled by the violence.<br/><br/>It doesn't really let-up, although the last third starts to drag a little. During the last twenty-five minutes I started to feel fairly certain the film had played its best hand. But its all quite good.<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you're in the mood for a good horror film.<br/><br/>Be forewarned: this is GORY, scary stuff. More so than most horror films being released nowadays. I wouldn't let little kids watch it. But if you're a horror buff, go for it."
"cwfultz","10","1","1","18 March 2006"," Intense and kind-of disturbing
","So I didn't really know what to expect with this one. I've seen the original, and that one was bad enough. But with today's technology and Alexandre Aja directing (I've seen ""High Tension""), I knew that this one would be rough.<br/><br/>I wasn't let down, either. From the get-go, this movie is intense. The death scenes are so awesome. I can't wait to see this unrated. The trailer scene was the worst. It really creeped me out. And when Doug went after the baby, I felt like he was diving into Hell by going into the Hill people's town. And the chase scene in the house between him and one of them (I don't remember which) was awesome. This movie may or may not disappoint you because it is a lot like the original, which, I guess, is a good thing. It shows how dark the human nature can be. Fans of gore and violence won't be let down. Some of the camera techniques were a little odd, but other than that, the directing was wonderful. The acting was right for the film. Nothing really stood out in my mind.<br/><br/>10/10"
"anxietyresister","5","1","1","14 March 2006"," At least it improves..
","Having not seen the original, I cannot compare the two.. but I am pretty sure I have seen a hundred other films just like this. A family are on the road with their caravan through the desert on the way to California, and unwisely decide to listen to a weird petrol store attendant's advice on taking a short cut. En Route, the tyres mysteriously blow out on their car, and strand them in the middle of nowhere with little water and (conveniently) no phone signal. Little do they know, this area used to be a ground for nuclear testing.. and the mutated survivors of these atrocities aren't happy about having strangers on their patch..<br/><br/>After a VERY slow start with a lot of bad dialogue delivered by third rate actors, the film finally gets going around the half-hour mark. Then, in a devastating sequence of events that is never topped, we get an attack on our protagonists which is so gratuitous it should satisfy even the most demanding gorehound. Sadly, after this high it soon degenerates back into a standard mediocre horror flick. We get the typical scenario of the mild mannered man who has finally had enough and proceeds to take revenge on those who have kidnapped his baby. There's a lot of blood & guts to come, but it is directed in such an unexciting fashion your pulse level won't rise above normal very often.<br/><br/>It doesn't help when there are many strange decisions taken by the characters that put them in more danger, you quickly lose sympathy for them. Why, for example, would you leave an infant and it's mother alone if you knew there were killers in the area? And why shoot a pursuer at point blank range when you can blow him up with your motorhome (which has all your supplies in it)? Also, how many times do you need to be reminded to tie your dogs up if they keep running away every five minutes? Yep, these are all very worthy questions, but not ones you'll find any sensible answers to here.<br/><br/>Overall though, despite my complaints above, I have to take my hat and say it was better than I thought it was going to be. At least after the snoozeworthy first third, the film is never really boring. It contains enough action to make it a hit with teen audiences, and you cannot possibly predict who will live or die as is common with most in this genre. The ending drops a strong hint there could be a sequel. Wow, I'm surprised. Is that the sound of a new franchise I hear? Hollywood must be very pleased.. 5/10"

","Back in 1977, horror master Wes Craven released upon the film world a low budget horror experience called ""The Hills Have Eyes"" which helped revolutionized the horror genre. After the film's release, Wes Craven's career had become a hit or miss directing crappy films(Scream 3) to highly influential genre pics(A Nightmare on Elm Street). 29 years later, what many consider to be Wes Craven's finest moment in his film career is brought back to life with the 2006 remake called ""The Hills Have Eyes"" of the same name.<br/><br/>This movie is brought to you by none other than Alexandre Aja who directed the shockingly gruesome gore fest ""High Tension"" last year. The same as ""High Tension"" Aja is a master when it comes to splatter, gore and truly capturing tension on screen.<br/><br/>I have not seen the original ""hills"" so I cannot compare it to this one. While this is not the best horror movie or movie in general in the whole wide world, it is fairly entertaining. The plot might be a little ludicrous but what it lacks in a simple, contrived plot it surely makes up through it's direction and cinematography. Aja is truly a master of this genre and when he starts creating thrills, he doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Many people might complain that this film was too heavily edited and has to many quick cuts but I feel that this works to this film's advantage because it truly emphasizes the tension that I think Aja was going for.<br/><br/>I recommend anybody to see this movie. I don't normally see horror movies a lot in the theaters and this will probably be one of the better horror movies released this year."

We finished four bottles of beer, and nothing had happened on the screen till then. Then the first ""blood-thirsty-mutant"" made her appearance. The thing looked like she'd been in a ""soft"" roadkill. How did the girl-monster acquire that face? Was she hit by a bicycle? Or did Dennis Rodman kissed her? I have no clue. Somewhere, this particular scene reminded me of I am Sam, but that is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Then the first dog was killed by one of the monster ""thingummies"". A little while later, the other monster made his appearance. I cried copious volumes of tears when I saw him. This one looked like he'd been hit with a pan, bottom first. Anyway, he sneered and jeered at the screen till I wanted to smash my TV.<br/><br/>And then the happy campers start getting killed, raped, and maimed. Yes, in that particular order. Then they trap a mutant and blow him to smithereens. They almost had a high-five sequence there. Then the lead guy pokes the Master-Monster in the eye and gets away with it too.<br/><br/>In the final scene, the survivors walk away in the sunrise or sunset. I was busy pulling the last strands of hair in my armpits by then anyway, so I didn't notice.<br/><br/>Verdict? I think a guy a guy in Ghana with a lower budget would have done a better job.

Anyone can re-direct a rape scene or gory murder scene, but you should not come away from it feeling like you just missed out on making it back to the ticket counter in time for your refund. I must credit the director with one thing -- he remembers P. T. Barnum's law on capitalism: there's a sucker born every minute. It took me 50 minutes into the film to realize what a sucker I am. One other thing - the movie is rated R. That's not a strong enough rating for the idiot parent that takes their five year old to see a movie like this.

While 1977 only show only little of it. Personally I thought 1977 looked like a bunch of cave men more than mutants. The 2006 version had better unexpected scares and mysteries to why it is the family was stuck in the dessert. While 1977 actually just gives the whole movie away by showing the trailer. I don't know why,but it's just my opinion that the 2006 version showed more empathy in horror. Like 1977 just tells the story about these people around the beginning of the movie,while,of course,2006 gets to the story last before the action fighting begins.

"Leofwine_draca","10","3","6","30 July 2016"," An arresting remake that far surpasses the original
","I've never really been a fan of remakes but I'm pleased to say that this new version of the '70s horror classic is well worth a watch. French director Alexandre Aja (who cut his teeth on the grisly SWITCHBLADE ROMANCE) revels in the bloodshed and pain in this action-packed thriller which is essentially a film of two halves. The first half is slow paced and takes time out to introduce the central characters of the storyline. Camera-work is strong and stylish throughout and great use is made of the eerily desolate desert scenery. Because there's so much going on in the movie, there isn't really a great deal of characterisation; instead the characters of the protagonists are revealed through their actions or in-actions. The film has a 'survival of the fittest' policy whereby the strongest characters find their inner strength while the weaker ones fall by the wayside. Of course there are a couple of exceptions to the rule.<br/><br/>The second half of the film begins with a nasty interlude in which mutants invade a caravan, rape a young blonde teenager, suckle a mother and threaten a baby with a gun. This is pretty depraved stuff and not for the squeamish. Afterwards, the last forty minutes of the movie show the human characters fighting back as best they can, and I'm pleased to say this part of the film really hits the mark, as well as in a similar film like HOSTEL. Aaron Stanford, a geeky 20-something, emerges as the film's true hero and the scenes in which he battles the mutants using a combination of luck and skill are tremendously fun. Aja piles on the bloodshed at every stage, with bloody shotgun blasts, axes tearing through flesh, impalings, and all manner of nastiness. The opening shot of a scientist thrown through the air at the end of an axe is a good forerunner to this latter carnage.<br/><br/>Special effects in the film are excellent – but then they're by the typically excellent Greg Nicotero, so you'd expect them to be. The mutants are suitably weird looking, although they're nothing we haven't seen before (especially if you're familiar with other horror flicks like WRONG TURN). Robert Joy stands out as the chief mutant, a real psycho of a guy; a natural progression from his deformed character in LAND OF THE DEAD. The other supporting characters are good at being terrified, and I especially liked the sub-plot involving Ted Levine's character, a big tough guy who has the most awful fate imaginable. All in all THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake is entertaining stuff, not really disturbing or as scary as I had heard but instead standing as a great example of the 'survival horror' genre."

From the first twenty minutes of that film, I knew I would be a devoted fan of these new, daring filmmakers.<br/><br/>But then they tacked on an ending that would've made me reach for an air sickness bag if theaters stocked them, because it seemed to be so jarringly, unexpectedly implausible, misogynistic and just plain STUPID. I sincerely believed that they could never redeem themselves as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to three years later, after horror legend Wes Craven handpicked Aja and Levasseur to redo his early drive-in favorite, THE HILLS HAVE EYES. By this time, I was absolutely an anti-fan of remakes of any kind. As a rule, most Hollywood remakes and ""reimaginings"" of classic films have now managed to live down to the lowest of my expectations. Unlike some really well-done examples from back in the Eighties - Cronenberg's THE FLY, Abel Ferarra's BODY SNATCHERS and Chuck Russell's THE BLOB just to name a few - remakes now seemed to be a miserable excuse for some bloated Hollywood suit to command that a beautifully crafted original be stuffed into an effects-laden, badly scripted and acted, PG-13 rated pale imitation of its former self, just to make some ready cash off its ravaged carcass. <br/><br/>I had no hopes at all that this incarnation of THHE would be any different. None. Even though the preview trailers were well-done, it seems that anybody can make fantastic trailers for craptastic films. And with Aja and Levasseur as creators of this new version, I figured that just like with HIGH TENSION, the croissants would surely hit the fan like before.<br/><br/>Happily, for the most part, I'm glad to say I was wrong. <br/><br/>Classic fright film purists who would ""fart in this movie's general direction"" should give it the benefit of the doubt first. The new script not only remains basically faithful to the original premise, but the manner in which the original film established a reputation for being the second most brutal film Craven ever made for its decade, still holds true with this version for our own times.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the original story is amped up, with a few scary pluses added. Where the former THHE presented a mutant clan that lived in the desert hills with very little explanation for how they got there, Aja and Levasseur plays upon the deepest musings of your most morbid outdoor fantasies with a ""what-if"" scenario that adds government-sanctioned nuclear testing and the usual bureaucratic screwing-up and screwing-over the ""little guys"" to give the marginal plausibility a little goosebump-y kick. If you've ever stood in the desert during an off-road trip and gazed at the forbidding hills, wondering what in the hell might be out there besides coyotes and scorpions, this movie provides a gut-churning possible answer.<br/><br/>The best advisory I can provide regarding the violence is that those without ""hard-R""-rated constitutions should stay far, far away. The effects work and action sequences here make Craven's original seem almost quaint. And the acting here is more than adequate from the ensemble cast, even if some of the character arcs in the script become a little less than convincing. <br/><br/>I just want to say in closing that I have gained a new respect for director Aja's talents. I still haven't found it in myself to bestow full trust in him after the HIGH TENSION debacle, but the new THHE is certainly a big step in the right direction; not only for him, but for millennial remakes in general."

","This movie, in all its length, is compelling and absorbing to watch. The reason for that is more because of what it doesn't show than what it does show. There are no real heroes, the feel of the movie is one that is gritty, down-to-earth, naked truth.<br/><br/>The inevitable result of what man has done to man is painfully and often gruesomely put to the screen. I'll be frank: lots of people die in this movie, in explicit detail. It has strong gruesome violence and terror throughout.<br/><br/>The acting is, for all rights and purposes, excellent. The tension and heavy emotions involved in the situation in the New Mexico Desert this family finds itself in are very real.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching if you can stomach the detailed graphic violence.

","This movie was awful, I don't know how anybody could like this movie. There were no lead characters and the dog had the most balls in the whole movie. How could the cell phone geek turn into a violent killing machine? Then the end of the movie they are stranded out in the middle of nowhere, how are they supposed to get home? Another thing, don't even get me started about the trailer scene, two stupid looking mutants break into the trailer and the first thing they do is rape an under age girl. Then after eating a bird the mutant that just rapped the girl holds a gun to a baby's head and sucks the tit of the mother of the baby. Then shoots the her in the head after she stabs him with a screwdriver. Was that even necessary? That scene had no business being in a movie it was just sick and twisted and just turned me off to the rest of the movie. And do you mean to tell me in a little crappy trailer the mom runs out not being able to see a huge mutant guy standing on the other side of the trailer on top of her daughter, come on. And how could this movie even be classified as horror? It was not even scary, I was just disgusted that society would allow a scene like the trailer scene to take place. I wish I could have my money back for seeing this movie and the time I wasted on this movie. Awful, do not see this movie."

"jw_ok","1","3","6","26 March 2006"," Definitely not Debbies - sad that this is considered a ""good"" horror film
","**contains spoilers** This is the worst movie I have seen this year and I say through Scary Movie 3 b/c it was on TV and I was bored. The plot is predictable, the characters are a little more developed than most horror films but I felt no connection for the most part. I honestly laughed more times than I jumped, and as gory as people make this movie out to be, I didn't cover my eyes once. The characters make all the typical bad decisions they make in every movie and I have to say that the dad and son have the worst marksmanship ever, I've never shot a handgun but I'm pretty sure the most accurate way to shoot is to aim, not spin shooting at an unknown target (Dad at gas station) or while running away from the mutant chasing you (the son right after the mutant steals his mom for lunch). The only scene I found disturbing was the rape scene, even though it seemed that the mutants were to stupid to actually have sex with the girl. The only real disturbing part was when the mutant held the gun to the babies head while molesting the girl. The dog was pretty cool though. Overall, predictable, pointless gore, and no psychological thrills. The viewer seems detached from the characters and violence seems a bit cartoonish. (for good measure, three kids that had to be between 8 and 12 years old sat two rows in front of me and I didn't hear them scream or cover their eye - maybe that says more about violence in movies and society but nonetheless....)"

"brodie8288","8","3","6","19 March 2006"," Aja Very Well Could Be The Next Wes Craven
","With his American debut ""High Tension"", Aja definitely went where many modern-day horror films don't....he went the most violent, vicious, and animalistic route that he could to tell the story of a pshyco chopping down a family and kidnapping an innocent girl. Most would think that since his next movie, ""The Hills Have Eyes"", was all-American, the censors would have to cut his original ideals. It has been reported that the original cut was NC-17, however, that doesn't mean that this ""R""-rated version made it all the easier on the eyes.<br/><br/>Comparing the old to the new, Wes Craven's was a very good classic horror movie. It wasn't the best, but this was only due to the fact that it was so ragged. It lacked sufficient funds and, in my personal opinion, didn't give Wes the full-range he could've used in order to make it the way he wanted. Instead, at times it felt more like a Mad Max involving a family instead of something that would seem brutal or scary. It was raw.<br/><br/>Aja's version is much more fleshed-out with a much clearer back-story, as well as tension and suspense. The violence was similar to that of a 80's slasher with a big budget, so, if you're in it to see blood fly, this is your movie. I believe that, had Wes Craven has Aja's budget when he had his original idea back in the early 70's, the original would've been much similar to this.<br/><br/>As a horror director, Aja is definitely on his way to becoming one of the greats. His style is defined much more in this, only adding to what we could see in ""High Tension"". He likes gore, and he shows it well.<br/><br/>I could actually say that the remake was better than the original.<br/><br/>To the people who liked the original better, I mean no disrespect. This is only my opinion."

"ivo-cobra8","10","3","7","28 March 2016"," A decent awesome horror slasher remake that is better than the Original!
","The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a decent horror slasher remake flick from Wes Craven's classic film from the 70's. Don't get me wrong by my title when I said is better than the original, I like Wes Craven's classic horror film from the 70's, but Wes Craven ruined it, with a rushed unnecessary sequel. Watching this flick I must say I love this flick to death, much better than the original. It is my personal best horror remake of them all, the best one that Hollywood come up with it, this is just my opinion. It is more bloody, more entertaining and it has for more action than Wes Craven's original flick did. I love this flick and it is definitely in my favorite horror slasher films. The fact is: this film is well shot, well directed by Alexander Aja, has a good intensity to it, wonderful score by Tomandandy, a solid job by Aaron Stanford aka Doug (for me the acting of the leads, like Doug, in this version was way better than the original), and the ending was extremely thrilling. Great comeuppance of the mutants by Aaron Stanford. His fight against the mutants to save his baby was intense, brutal, bad ass, and was a hell of a fight. He deserved his victory. This film is a fast action packed horror flick that put's you on the edge of your seat. I recommend this film to any horror film fan, but it is not for everyone.<br/><br/>Plot: A cross-country road trip takes a deadly turn in this chilling remake of Wes Craven's classic horror film about a stranded family that falls prey to a freakish clan of blood-thirsty mutants in the New Mexico desert. Packed with gut-wrenching gore and heart-stopping suspense, The Hills Have Eyes will keep you on the edge of your seat! <br/><br/>I like the original, but it ends without any explanation, this movie does far way better, I like the changes Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford) was such a bad ass in this movie, far way better than the character was in the original. Pluto (Michael Bailey Smith) was a creepy horror slasher mutant in this film, unlike he was in the original. I like the music score by Tomandandy François-Eudes Chanfrault, which it was far way better score than in the original film was. Aaron Stanford for me in this film is a real bad ass no question debut. I also liked the actress in this film Emilie de Ravin who plays sister-in-law of Doug Bukowski, her acting was amazing, she was gorgeous and weary beautiful I love her to death. Mostly I remember her as Claire Littleton from Lost (2004).<br/><br/>I know this film isn't a cult classics or potential classic, but for a horror flick, it is far way far better than the original and this film took my breath away. Dan Byrd also did a solid job as Brenda's brother Bobby Carter. You have also Ted Levine from Joy Ride, Tom Bower from Die Hard 2 (1990), Billy Drago from Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990) who plays another villain in this film and Robert Joy from CSI: NY (2005) as his beloved character Dr. Sid Hammerback. The cast is still great in this film and it have a solid cast. You have an explosion in this film, a lot of action, a lot of fights, the villains are really scary and not goofy like they were in the original.<br/><br/>I like the scene when Doug then awakes in an icebox where the mutants keep the bodies of their victims and he bangs on the box until it opens, I love all bloody scenes and I love that Brenda, Bobby and of course Doug with his baby Catherine stays the family on the end of the film.<br/><br/>Good horror films STICK WITH YOU. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) is such a film -- a masterpiece of horror. I saw it in on my computer 3 years ago and I never forgot it. It's bloody, grotesque, and very disturbing -- which, of course, make it a great film -- a film to be remembered (and heck, it's only a re-make)! <br/><br/>The performances and the story are believable and shocking -- and really, that's what I want in a horror flick: I want realism -- otherwise, what's so scary? They spared nothing.<br/><br/>Overral: I love this flick to death, It is my favorite horror flick and the best one in the remakes. It get's a solid 10 by me.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a 2006 American horror film and remake of Wes Craven's 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes.

"hu675","8","3","7","14 August 2006"," One of the strongest horror film since Alexandre Aja's own film ""High Tension"".
","In New Mexico, at a deserted highway. A mysterious, seemingly normal Gas Station attendant (Tom Bower) leads a middle class family (Aaron Stanford, Emilie de Ravin, Daniel Byrd, Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Ted Levine and Maisie Camilleri Preziosi) to take a shirt cut by driving through the desert. Since the family are on their way to California. This family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere and not thinking, they are near an old nuclear test site. An strange group of Bloodthirshy monsters are watching them from the hills and these monsters are planning their attack on this wholesome family.<br/><br/>Directed by Alexandre Aja made an effective, strong brutal horror movie. Which is based on a 1977 film, written and directed by Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream Trilogy). Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja and Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Gregory Lavasseur (Who also co-wrote ""High Tension"") made this remake with more irony, emotional and violent than Craven's take on his original movie. In this new remakes focuses on a nuclear waste subplot, a different third act and making the villains more mysterious, creeper & open minded. The only thing i felt missing watching this remake is Craven's (sometimes outrageous) dark sense of humour in the original. Oddly enough Aja and Lavasseur made this villains a bit more sympathetic. Because this remake, they made these monsters victims themselves by the nuclear test site. Which of course, the big differences between the original and the remake. In the original, these attackers were inbred cannibals living near an old nuclear test site. In the remake, they become monsters by being deformed by the test site turning into cannibals themselves and living at a old test site.<br/><br/>This remake is actually (only sightly) better than Craven's movie. This remake has top production values by having excellent cinematography work by Maxime Alexandre, a surprisingly good cast (including:Robert Joy as Lizard, Micheal Bailey Smith as Pluto, Laura Ortiz as Ruby and Billy Drago as Papa Jupiter), great production designs by Joseph Nemic the Third (Terminator 2:Judgment Day), convincing make-up effects work by Gregory Nicotero and Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger (The Chronicles of Nadia:the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Hostel, Land of the Dead) and sometimes brilliant music score by tomandandy (The Rules of Attraction). Like Craven's original, this remake is also flawed in parts. Especially in some of its dramatic moments and towards the conclusion.<br/><br/>The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has two informative commentary tracks. Commentary One is the Co-Screenwriter/Director:Aja, Art Director/Co-Screenwriter:Lavasseur and One of the film's producers:Marianne Maddalena (Cursed, Music of the Heart, Red Eye). The Second Commentary is by the producers:Craven and Peter Locke (The original producer of the 1977 picture) is actually a bit more entertaining and fun than the first commentary track. DVD also has a terrific 50 minute documentary, production diaries and a music video. Only two things missing are the excellent theatrical trailer and deleted scenes (Which it was briefly seen in the documentary).<br/><br/>The new ""Hills"" is one of the best horror remakes in a while. Like Craven's original film, this remake will also have an cult following. Since this remake was a sleeper hit at the box office and did well on DVD. There's no doubt the producers:Craven, Maddalena and Locke are working on the upcoming sequel. Let's hope the sequel will not be a remake of the absurd second ""Hills"" 1983 movie. Which Craven and Locke were also involved in. Super 35. (****/*****)."

","I am not a violence wuss. I have never considered a film to violent or over the top. My personal thoughts on this film is that the kind of violence in certain scenes was unnecessary. The mood could have been set without it and all it did was make me sick to my stomach.<br/><br/>There seems to be a kind of acceptance of sexual violence in Hollywood at the moment. I think we may be reaching a point where a fair warning should be given. Many many people have been affected by this form of violence. These people should not be subjected sans warning to this form of violence as it may bring back issues they should not have to deal with at their nightly entertainment.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the movie being shown and it is not a big deal if this stuff doesn't affect other people. I reiterate my point a warning would be sufficient. I no longer want to see this form of violence in a movie and I don't think that 18A is enough of a warning lots of films with swearing and lots of gun-play or maybe just some nudity are rated 18A.<br/><br/>It wasn't that this movie was awful (as I said in my rating) but that ruined the mood for me and almost made me physically ill. I am well aware I sound like a wuss who cant handle violence, I can, but never again in this form. I will look harder for warnings of this form of violence in movies, it is not for me."

Emilie de Ravin acts very well in this movie (she's a very different character to Claire from Lost). However, I have to say that Beast (the dog) has to be the most useful character! He took out two of the mutant people! Oscar for the dog please! The ""people"" in the desert are so freaky (as are the birds ;) ). The make-up artist really should get an award for the way in which they made them look.<br/><br/>One part I didn't enjoy though was when a couple of the mutant guys got in the trailer with the girls. That was sick. Though at the same time it was a good part of the film - I just wish I wasn't such a wimp and hidden behind my hands for that scene.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good movie.

","I've never seen the original Hills, but I think I would have found this remake even more disappointing had I done so. The new Hills follows much of the same style as every other gritty, choppily-filmed horror movie to come out in the past couple of years: quick cuts, good acting, loads of gore. In terms of appearance, it looked much like Devil's Rejects and Hostel. If that's your thing, then this is for you. <br/><br/>But Hills leaves in its wake several unanswered questions, a few eye-rolling clichés, and a couple startling examples of outright stupidity. Examples, respectively, are a lack of any detailed villain back-story, the ever-present necessity of no cell phone signal, and how ALL the characters overlook exactly how they ended up stranded in the desert. And speaking of clichés and stupidity, don't even get me started on the ending.<br/><br/>If you expect no more of a story than to act as a machine for plot advancement and gore production, then see this by all means. Just don't expect any T&A or humor. At all."

I don't want anyone to think I went to this movie already hating horror films because I love fighting and blood and all that good stuff.<br/><br/>This movie is very different than anything out there. As the movie really began to pick up it almost made me sick. The scene in the trailer where most of the killing is done was perhaps the most disgusting, and violating part in any movie I've ever seen. The rest of the movie was tolerable yet still sick. I don't understand why anyone would ever make a movie that really hit home like that (the rape scene). To watch those mutated people just execute innocent travelers was so hard to watch and my heart was pounding so hard I thought it was going to pop through my chest. The make-up and detail to realism was incredible making it even harder to watch when people were mutilated.<br/><br/>What the movie neglects to talk about is WHY these people act like this. The movie has some very good acting, which is surprising considering most horror movies today have garbage acting. The lines were kind of corny and the actors did such stupid things.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that this movie was a complete waste of money. It had no value what so ever other than to make people really happy they aren't in a trailer in the middle of the desert. If for some reason you do go out and see this movie, make sure you have a very strong stomach and don't go if you are sensitive to disgusting horrible things."

","Switchblade romance was already a really stupid film who treat it's audience like idiots and this remake of the Wes Craven classic if less stupid is still quite moronic. Then again it's full of incoherences, it's heavy on symbolism, then again Aja has never been known for subtlety, but if it's the case don't do,symbolism or psychology and just go plain trash! The scene with killings with the American flag doesn't make any sense : the US army is after all responsible for the mutation of the bad guys. In the original the bad guys were characters , here they're just a freak show with no depth at all. The Wes Craven was really inventive in ways of killing people, the dragging of the bad guy with a rope and a car wheel, the python scene. Here it's just violent and pointless. The end is particularly bad, Ruby sacrifices herself, she could have pushed her dad but no she's jumps with him, in the original she saves the young dad using a python, that was bad ass. <br/><br/>The bits where the guy is holding his phone to check if there's any network is phony, especially when they do it twice , that actor for that scene only should get an award for worst actor ever . <br/><br/>I cannot believe people think that might be a better version than the original , the make up on the villains is so bad you can actually see the plastic, it's plain awful."

","What I'll always remember about this horror movie is how attached I became to the main characters. In most horror movies, the victims are just there to be killed in creative ways, you never really feel any emotions watching them die. In this movie, the characters felt like a real American family. You will find at least one person in the family who you will relate to. The acting is great, which adds to the intensity of seeing people who you've come to care about be attacked by savages. The final act of the movie is one huge adrenaline rush that had me cheering. There are some minor issues, that I will not mention, because they are easily overlooked."

"zombiefan89","10","2","4","31 March 2012"," Finally! A Good Remake!
","This movie, I dare say, surpasses the original by every possible means! It's positively gruesome, but it's about cannibals, which makes sense. Why are they cannibals? Because their a bunch of inbred weirdos living in a desert. There's not exactly a Wal-Mart to buy food from, is there? The movie bares a striking resemblance to Wrong Turn, as the inbreeds are much uglier and more monster-ish than they were in the original, which is still a good thing. There's also the rape scene, same as the original. I personally applaud rape in horror movies. Not pornography quality of course, but it's just one of those things that should be there when a psychopath goes on a killing spree. This was what disappointed me in the Jason movies. Didn't he find one of the girls he killed attractive? Logically, being a moral-less lunatic, he'd have to have urges. Overall, I loved this movie. It's everything the original was with the modern advances of 2006. This is how all remakes should be."
"Ncmm81","9","2","4","6 June 2011"," a very fine remake
","""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) has to be one of the finest remakes I have ever seen (my personal opinion). I know the original film well and it has long been a favourite of mine. The story line of the 2006 version is the same as the 1977 version - even the cast look like the original cast - but the new filmmakers brought something new to the story. I won't spoil the movie for those of you who have not yet seen it, but let me say this, the additions in the remake are great. The new aspects of the story, the sub plot and back-story, really enhance the picture and gives the fans of the movie much more to think about - it's more exciting and much scarier. Could even say it's more believable this time round (okay, maybe not believable but definitely more thought provoking along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). In short this is the best example of a remake - the original was very good, but this was far better, it built on the original film (even had the look shot for shot in some places) and then took it to the next height, whilst skilfully remaining faithful to the original story and never veering away on it's own tangent. I thoroughly recommend this film - I love it. 9/10"
"raypdaley182","1","2","4","18 April 2007"," Incredibly DULL!
","I've not seen the original so I won't be comparing this to that, OK? Apart from the minor scare and the guy killing the 2 scientists at the start this is really boring for a very VERY long time. The travellers dog gets killed (we see nothing apart from it's body) and then not much happens. We're almost 40 mins into the film where their truck is sabotaged by the hill people (they use a stinger on it) and then lots of not much happens.<br/><br/>The dad of the family walks back to the truck stop and the son-in-law finds a vehicle graveyard in a crater (and really should have sussed what was happening by then, it's totally obvious). The truck stop owner kills himself and the dad of the family is caught by the hill people and things actually finally start to happen.<br/><br/>The son-in-law returns to the camper and the families second dog is taken (which should make them really suspicious but doesn't?).<br/><br/>There's a major goof where one of the hill people gets into the trailer (we clearly saw the people LOCK it from the inside, so I'm sorry but NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!). Even after they set fire to the dad to distract the others away from the camper (like it needs 3 people to go check out a fire) not much happens.<br/><br/>The hill people trash the trailer, they ""rape"" one of the girls (even though you see nothing - it's implied) and finally someone goes back to check on the screaming. Was that Hill guy breastfeeding off that girl? That child looked a little bit too old to still be breastfeeding so I think they got that very wrong.<br/><br/>Mum of the family is shot, the girl he breastfed off is shot and killed. Still not really a lot happening. If it's a suspense thriller then it's really heavy on suspense and very light on thrills.<br/><br/>Amazingly mum isn't dead from being shot at such close range by a Magnum. One of the hill people loses an arm and the 2nd dog comes back alive and unharmed and the remaining campers find a radio the hill people were using.<br/><br/>Come the dawn the son-in-law takes the dog to search for his abducted baby which the hill people took during the night raid. The brother and sister of the family set up tripwires to protect themselves by the camper and the son-in-law finds the old miners town camp.<br/><br/>Even when the son in law is caught in the house by the hill people there's lots of talking and not much action. Even during a fight sequence which Wes Craven probably thought was action.<br/><br/>When the boy follows the blood trail, he has ample time to pull his gun and kill the guy eating his sister but he chooses to fire wildly behind him, wasting his rounds like an idiot.<br/><br/>The fake scare after the son in law had shot the last hill guy in the chest, throat and body and then he got up (so Ruby had to push him over the cliff) was too much to take seriously. Also that the guy in the camper had survived the huge gas explosion too.<br/><br/>Obscenely dull for a horror/action film and had me reaching for fast forward far too often."

","Less than 2 minutes into the film (no kidding!), 4 people are brutally murdered by an axe-wielding mutant dude. Well, we can't have our audience getting bored, can we.<br/><br/>Then, the obligatory shady ""lookout antagonist"" is introduced, who lures unsuspecting travelers into the claws of the psychotic killer family. Apparently, Hollywood's use of this clichéd character was not limited to just The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and sequels/remakes), House of 1000 Corpses, and many others. They just can't help themselves.<br/><br/>Ironically, the next 45 minutes are horribly boring. In fact, they contribute to what I call ""negative character development"", which actually made me hope for the deaths of the characters  especially the young daughter, who was a real wench. Also, pointless jump scares are added in here and there. You know, typical Hollywood stuff.<br/><br/>Then comes the pointless and gratuitous gore: some mutant dude bites the head off of a bird and drinks its blood; some mutant dude shoots the grandmother in the chest, and then shoots the mother in the head (who somehow lives long enough to scream at her husband before she dies  cuing up another pointless jump scare); dismemberment; lots of axes to various heads; etc. At one point, a mutant dude is raping the teenage daughter, while another mutant dude is ""milking"" another woman while pointing a gun at her babies head. Now that's great cinema (sarcasm).<br/><br/>One thing that particularly annoyed me was that the family of victims was armed to the teeth! They had a magnum and an automatic pistol at the beginning of the film, yet whenever these firearms would have come in handy, they wasted bullets like they were candy, blinding shooting into the desert. At one point the teenage son chases the unarmed mutant dudes in the desert and stops to fire at them from 50 yards away, instead of catching up to them and killing them point blank. So stupid!<br/><br/>The film continues to morph into some sort of perverted action movie, with the would-be victims wielding axes like pro-lumberjacks!

In fact, I feel it could have been gorier, then it would have distracted me from the fact that the entire production was made up of no-mark characters wandering about a hackneyed plot peppered with clichéd music/sound effects and 'scary moments' that are telegraphed with letters the size of mount Rushmore.<br/><br/>Major studio horror film making at its worst."
"polanco101","1","2","4","20 August 2006"," It couldn't get any worse....or could it?
","I have never posted a comment on here ever, but this movie was so horrible that I was compelled to do so. Now let me take a few seconds here so that I can try to put into words what I feel I should say. Yeah its that bad. OK. As a true fan of the horror genre, I have seen my fair share of BAD horror pictures, it comes with the territory and especially these days, but this one definitely takes the prize. There were sooooooo many things that were wrong with this movie that to list them all here would be next to impossible but let me begin with the first of many.<br/><br/>The first ingredient needed to make a good picture is naturally a well written script. Then you throw in a talented director et voila. I would not be surprised if Alexandre Aja, the director, wrote the whole script on toilet paper on a trip to the bathroom. Is it possible to make a decent film out of a mediocre script? Yes. And many have done so in the past. But calling this script mediocre would be doing this film a favor. The characters are just so one dimensional and unlikeable that its just sad. Half way through the movie I really did not care whether or not any of them lived at all. The film makes absolutely no effort to draw you in. I mean granted this is fiction and sometimes we have to suspend belief and just go with the story, but there were so many scenes where I just sat there thinking ""no thats ridiculous, how could that be happening, this makes no sense."" I'm not gonna go into specifics to spoil anything but how could someone write scenes like that? Could you at least make the littlest effort at writing something believable? <br/><br/>The cinematography, which was pretty decent, tries to achieve a certain mood, yet its all offset due to the film's pathetic direction, lousy acting, horrible script, extremely slow pace (in the beginning) and over the top gore.<br/><br/>I was and still am extremely disappointed. The whole thing lacked style and substance. <br/><br/>As for originality, wait...what originality? This film was a cross between ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Wrong Turn"" with all the good parts left out. It's unbelievable how Hollywood continues to churn out these big budget, cookie cutter character, no story movies. I wish I could have rated this movie a zero, too bad thats not an option. Do not waste your time, RUN just RUN, hell run for the hills if you like, just stay away from this movie."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","2","4","6 August 2006"," Alexandre Aja gets it right
","A remake of the 1977 film by Wes Craven with the same name.<br/><br/>A family on their way to California go through a remote portion of the New Mexico desert in effort to cut down on travel time. When they have an accident (that's not really an accident) and get stuck out there in the middle of nowhere they realize that they are not alone. A group of people living out in the desert that has fallen victim to radioactive mutation starts to terrorize them.<br/><br/>Unlike the original Aja keeps a strong focus on atmosphere and keeping certain key things shrouded in darkness or off frame until the opportune moment for a shock comes along. That is really the main difference in this version from the original and it works to great effect. The original gave the mutant way too much screen time and that took away much of the horror and the atmosphere become more uncomfortable rather than scary. He not only is the atmosphere eerie, even though much of the film takes place during day, but the visceral shock is also much more intense. Featuring a good use of computer and prosthetic effect seamlessly blended together this film provides some of the best visceral horror around anywhere. Alexandre Aja is a good path to becoming a horror master now that he has both 'High Tension' and this film on his short, but impressive, resume.<br/><br/>One slightly annoying thing in this version, that wasn't in the original, is the opening scene. In 'Hills 1977' Wes Craven just got right down to business and showed an eerie shot of the desert at twilight. Here we get an admittedly shocking, but kind of generic horror film opening with a few nameless victims getting done in. How many times since 'Jaws' has that been done? But it really doesn't matter, since it is a good set up for the intensity that will come at you full force later in the film. 8/10<br/><br/>DVD release is unrated and contains intense brutal violence/gore, a rape scene, and profanity"

"MrGKB","7","2","4","23 April 2006"," Director Aja shows great potential...
","...especially on the heels of 2003's thriller, ""High Tension,"" which played with similar themes of savagery and blood vengeance. His approach to horror cinema is uncompromisingly brutal and appropriately cathartic, and will delight hardcore fans everywhere. Others may not be so pleased, as the comments on this board amply indicate. Of course, why these ""others"" would ever bother to watch a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (in either incarnation) is pretty much a mystery, but I digress.<br/><br/>Well-lensed by Maxime Alexandre (who also DP'ed Aja's ""High Tension"") and tightly edited by Baxter (ditto), this post-millennial retelling of the Wes Craven classic strikes its audience right in the face with its bloody allegory of America's xenophobic nightmares, Mexico and Iraq. I'm surprised that other commentators haven't seen this yet, or perhaps they have and I just haven't caught up with them. Seemed pretty blatant to me, though. Representative white-bread conservative family unit (with one black sheep) marooned in the remote desolation of New Mexico that turns out to be a restricted atom bomb test site (read: U.S. military flexing its muscle) is beset upon by a family of homicidal subhumans (ostensibly created through the mutating influence of radioactive fallout) who live troll-like in the equally abandoned gold and silver mines of their forefathers. Mayhem ensues. Survivors become as much via rapid descent to the animal level of their assailants. The ol' red savagery of tooth and claw, or in this case, pickaxes, baseball bats, and German Shepards.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm insane. At any rate, Aja slowly ratchets up the suspense in his first act, building character and filling in back story, then smacks you in the head with a gobbet of wet flesh in the second, and serves up an even bloodier catharsis of vengeance in the third. The two biggest names in the cast, the aptly-cast Ted ""Silence of the Lambs"" Levine and Kathleen ""Breakdown"" Quinlan, are dispatched first, quickly followed by the beautiful Vinessa ""Eyes Wide Shut"" Shaw. The parents' kids, Dan ""I'm a lot older than I play in this movie"" Byrd and Emilie ""Lost"" de Ravin and the babe's hubby, played by Aaron ""X2"" Stanford, turn in bravura performances as they battle the brood of mutant cannibals (read: Ay-rabs and Messicans) trying to kill them. The baddies sport a fair number of character actors, including Robert ""Land of the Dead"" Joy, Billy ""I haven't done anything notable since 'The Untouchables' but I sure get work"" Drago, and Tom ""You've seen me in all kinds of stuff even if you can't remember my name"" Bower. The gore is copious and unflinching, courtesy of the genius of Greg Nicotero and Co., whose work seems to be everywhere these days.<br/><br/>Aja, along with co-screenwriter, Gregory Levasseur (anyone beginning to see a highly tense pattern here?) keeps the stakes high as well. The family dog, Beauty, isn't just killed, she's eviscerated graphically. The father isn't just killed in front of his family, he gets burned alive so realistically you'd swear you could toast marshmallows by the scene. Next thing you know, Sis and Mom are dead or dying, younger Sis has been raped and traumatized, and things are looking pretty bad. They only get worse. I won't bore you with any further recap, but will say that although the grand guignol finale sadly slips into Hollywood overkill (Robert Joy, lie down! Yer dead!), it's still far more effective delivering orgasms of sanguine catharsis than 2005's ""Hostel,"" a darkly-minded pretender to the ""Straw Dogs"" throne.<br/><br/>Upshot of this meandering comment: this one's a keeper, especially when the director's untrimmed cut is released on DVD. It has its flaws (can anyone say, ""bad CGI birds? I knew you could! How about, ""twist ending obviously designed to set up a sequel?"" Sure you can!), but far fewer than either of Rob Zombie's cinematic visions or the overrated Aussie contender, ""Wolf Creek."" Definitely not for weak stomachs or those who cringe at the very idea of threatening helpless women and babies, let alone grown men.<br/><br/>I'll be looking forward to Aja's future efforts, disturbing as that concept may be."

The story focuses on a family headed out west until they run into a band of mutants, I will admit Nicotero did a great job with the effects but that's to the extent to it. All style no substance, all gore no galore. Alexander Aja would be wise to come up with his own junk not other people's once brilliant ideas. To think they remade a lot of classic horror since 2005, John Carpenter's ""The Fog"", along with ""When a Stranger Calls"" and now ""Eyes"", all 70's-80's films are here by gone.

It didn't scare me--it just disgusted me.<br/><br/>Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It's surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It's not creepy or chilling--just dull.

","This film is highly amusing for the horror movie buff. I would only recommend it if you wish to see a film only for the insane amount of gore. In short, this film sick, disgusting, revolting and downright repulsive. The plot is poorly developed and weak, but the lack of deep storyline is easily over-looked with the amusing scenes of brutal slaughter and severed limbs. I would definitely call it a horror, but not a thriller or suspense, there aren't many jumps or shocking scares. If you enjoyed 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' you will definitely enjoy this one. I recommend this for a good laugh and the countless scenes of blood and gore. If you are of weak disposition or easily disgusted, you should probably skip this one."

","Having recently discovered the attraction of very old horror films, I seek movies which are not simple exploitation of the word horror, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which in my opinion checks one's intelligence at the door. A few things attracted me to The Hills movie, one being the promotional trailer which shows a history of nuclear testing. So it's not completely out of the realm of possibility, as there is a historical precedence, which is clearly illustrated. This is not an entirely predictable movie. Too many movies are, which detracts from their quality. What I did successfully predict paled in comparison to the shocks I received. My companion had to look away from the screen a few times. This movie combines the genres of horror and science fiction. At least one hopes it is fiction! I do not go to the movies to see many horror flicks but this one was worth the trip."
"rchadwi@hotmail.com","8","2","4","15 March 2006"," A Remake Better Than Most - May Contain Spoilers
","I'm one of those moviegoers who has the opinion that, 1) the book is always better than the movie and, 2) the original is better than the remake. Having said that, of ANY remake I've seen, this was is best at recapturing the suspense and pure violence of the original, and maybe in some ways better (given the improved budget).<br/><br/>First I will say what is good about this movie. The suspense and violence is unrelentless. The original did a great job of not only using gore/violence, but pure suspense (a lone trailer in the middle of a pitch-black desert surrounded by an enemy that is unknown and unseen). The remake re-captures that well, unlike many that just up the gore factor with no heed to suspense. Second, the violence, when it does occur (and oh, it does!) is chilling. This movie makes the remake of ""TCM"" look like a romantic comedy. Additionally and perhaps paradoxically, the movie also takes time to ""mourn"" the victims, showing the emotional impact of their demise on their family. So there is a real human element there, which makes one care...somewhat. Last, this movie uses it's increased budget and special-effects abilities smartly, creating a very plausible landscape and setting for the violence. The portrayal of a insane and mutated ""family"" living in an old prop-town (used as a prop for testing the effects of nuclear explosions) is very haunting.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this movie does suffer a bit. First off, since most of these movies seem to cater to the younger crowd, we have your uber-annoying pair of teenage jerkholes (the son and daughter). The teenage boy is ESPECIALLY annoying and I prayed every minute for his death. His death SHOULD have come very quickly, due to his stupidity and to the situation he got himself into early on which, given the entire premise of the film, should have guaranteed his corpse status. Again, it seems horror films do a poorer-than-most job at creating characters you WANT to see live. Also, there are the usual incredible holes in the story. How a cell-phone salesman who looks like he's never seen a bike or weight-set in his life ends up single-handedly killing nearly the entire clan - including besting a 300 lb. insanely violent giant of a mutant in hand-to-hand combat - is impossible to imagine. How the boy and girl, who are the most inept, incompetent and weakest characters in the entire film, turn into a pair of virtual McGuyvers and best their foes, is equally incredible.<br/><br/>But oh well. Take it for what it's worth and if you're a horror fan, even of the original, you won't be too disappointed. As horror films go, the best in quite a while."

Claustrophobia, Anxiety, Suspense, Dread, Aw. I shuddered at some of the scenes. There was some drama in the movie, which helps the audience catch its breath, but right after we go back in to another fright-fest. The characters are well developed, so, that you actually care for them. People were clapping when some of the scenes were going on because it was so intense! Wow.

","This updated version of THE HILLS HAVE EYES is pretty faithful to Wes Craven's original. The basic setup is the same, w/ a vacationing family breaking down in a desert wasteland. When night falls, the blood hits the fan. Director Alexandre Aja pushes the violence and gore levels into the ultra-red zone, making his remake a very grisly tribute. The real difference between the two films comes in the final act, when Aja opts to dig into what he hinted at during the opening, and show the truth behind the murdering mutants. This is also the most visceral part of the movie. Craven's commentary on civilization vs. barbarism, and modern man's regression to the primitive under extreme stress, remains intact..."

The ending was also ambiguous however the actors all did a great job in their roles and had great chemistry between them. But the actual baby was evidently used for some very disturbing scenes for which they should have used either cgi or animatronics. The cimematography had some great senic shots but there were continuity errors and mistakes plus it was unfortunately filmed in Morocco.

","The last decade embellished in horror remakes, some absolutely abysmal that shan't be discussed whilst others were just rolling around in mediocrity like a pig in mud. Aja's remake of Craven's original mutant bash is surprisingly well-fitting despite some tendencies that cause characters to make impeccably stupid choices. Hills were present, and deformed eyes were glaring down at tourists with a palpable sense of blood-thirsty dread. Delicious. A family embarking on a road trip get lost in the middle of a New Mexico desert. With their car mysteriously damaged, they are unable to go anywhere.<br/><br/>Enter the irradiated miners to cause terror, steal babies and illicit some uncalled promiscuity in the form of rape. Most family members, notably the father, son and sister's boyfriend, have a suitable amount of personality that make their characters worth investing in. After all, this is a horror dealing with an ever-growing list of expendable cast members, so to inject some attachment to them made the obnoxious jump scares and ridiculously dumb character choices tolerable. Individuals splitting up doing their own thing without thinking is a precedent in this remake, allowing the mutants to prowl the hills and hunt them down. Speaking of murdering primitives, Aja intelligently shows us glimpses of them initially in order to crank up the tension. Unfortunately he does not maintain that for much longer. As soon as he shows them in the glorious moonlight, the mystery and suspense dissipates immediately with most of the mutants coming across as basic.<br/><br/>Let's be honest though, you came for the gore. And my word, you got it! Shotgun to the head, pickaxe to the eye and the heroic pet dog Beast ripping throats out like it's his day job. Exceptional work in the makeup department, no question. This is by far one of the better remakes from the naughties. Whilst I do take issue with some characters, directorial choices and the lethargic ending, these hills were a pleasant (if you can say that) re-visit."

","Let me be clear about one thing: This is not a good film. The narrative is sorely lacking in places, the dialogue is nothing special, and in some parts the acting is almost painful to watch. In too many cases the director attempts to cover up bad writing with disgusting and disturbing special effects - a sad trend in today's horror cinema. And speaking of horror, outside of those special effects, very little in this movie is actually scaring. There are no ominous moments, nothing to psychologically shake the viewer, and what few genuine scares the film does contain are all pretty much ruined by the all-too-obvious accompanying music cues.<br/><br/>That said, if you watch this as something other than a horror film, it can actually be fairly entertaining. This is more along the lines of something like Evil Dead 2, Planet Terror, or Army of Darkness - each of which has about the same amount of realism as The Hills Have Eyes. This movie features a mixture of comedy and action similar to the previously mentioned movies. The violence gets quite comical at parts, and the fight sequences are pretty well-coordinated. While THHE lack's the clever catchphrases that make Ash so popular, it does manage to maintain one's interest throughout the movie. In fact, if the creators had spent more time molding the movie into something like Army of Darkness, this would probably have turned out to be a much better film. Unfortunately, it suffers from attempts to keep it in the horror genre, and the makers do not have enough imagination to make that concept work here. As an action-thriller-comedy, however, it's worth a rental."
"GodsPrototype","8","0","0","1 April 2009"," Brutal Upgrade
","I am not a fan of most remakes and despise the fact that in Hollywood there is a faction that feels the need to remake excellent original films, some only a few years old, and completely take the limelight away from the originals. Just look at 'The Eye' & 'Quarantine'. They insult our intelligence by assuming we won't be able to watch foreign language films and would prefer to have millions of dollars spent remaking it in the English language.<br/><br/>In saying that, Hollywood remakes are sometimes not necessary but occasionally it seems that a film is dug out of the archives that is so ready to be remade or in this case totally and brutally upgraded. Because it doesn't really feel as though you are watching a remake it just feels like you are watching the same film that you vaguely remember all those years ago but it has undergone a brutal upgrade.<br/><br/>The look of the film is very very good and the cinematographer and director should be very proud of the look of the film. The landscape looks brilliant bathed in bright sunlight and the gore is well done and plentiful especially as we move into the 'Test Town' toward the end of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch but for some strange reason I couldn't get out of my head the fact that I thought Cilian Murphy would have been better cast in the lead hero role and could have maybe brought a different aspect and depth to the character.<br/><br/>I must say as well that I have an incline that as far as horror remakes go this could be the first film that possibly outshines the original, which is a rare feat and one that should be applauded. Most Horror films are set at night for obvious reasons but a large proportion of this film is set during the daylight which I believe makes the film stand out from its peers even more and looks so much better.<br/><br/>I think this is an excellent survival horror film by any standards and is up with the best of them in my horror collection. I would totally recommend it to any horror fans and anyone who wants to join the Carter family for a brutal ride. But be warned as the new version contains an extended and very visceral rape scene in the family's trailer.<br/><br/>Not for the faint hearted 8/10"

","I don't know if ""horror movie"" is the right word, cynical slaughter fits better. Don't see this movie if you wanna be scared, don't see this movie if you want to see a mindless slaughter with teenagers being killed in fun ways, see this movie if you wanna see something that's full off suspense, breaks every border and just goes to far.<br/><br/>In the beginning we are introduced to the family. To uncontrolled dogs, too stereotypical American parents, their son and two daughters, and one of the daughters husband and their baby. In the beginning I am sure I won't feel any sympathy with the cynical family, something which radically changes. After all there is a family this time, not a bunch of stupid teenagers or something like that.<br/><br/>The ""scarriest"" moment is the beginning when you don't know whats going to happen. Then the movie just turns psycho. I have to say I almost got angry sometimes. When the two younger girls gets raped, the baby gun pointed and the father burned alive outside, it almost hurts. ""WHYYYY?"" you are thinking while watching this. To make you very angry at those mutant-things, which are the ""monsters"" in this movie, is the right answer. There are also a lot of gore, but I don't find the gore very hard to watch compared with the twisted attempts against the family.<br/><br/>Those mutants aren't very scary, but their is a absurd fascination about them, even if you most of all want them to die. The movie really succeeds to make you feel sympathy and suspense, the only problem is if you can't handle it when the movie goes to far many times.<br/><br/>The less-good things in the movie is the acting, and sometimes not the very realistic reactions and actions by the characters. And the soundtrack that makes up for an irritating double moral. There is some heroic victory themes playing while the mutants in the characters revenge are getting brutally killed. I don't understand why , when the movie itself are criticizing the US for nuclear tests in the desert (in this movie causing people to turn into mutants). <br/><br/>However, just see this movie if you at least know something of what is coming up."

","I have spent the best part of the last 25 years or so (I'm now 35) watching a plethora of films of all genres, yet i have to say that i have a deep love for all things grisly and frightening, so i approached this with 1 part excitement and 1 part cynicism, mainly due to being sick of all the inept remakes that clutter our screens (a few movies being of notable exception). My excitement came from the knowledge that the directing reigns were being given to Alexandra Aja, of whom i have the utmost respect for producing the intense and blood spattered flick Switchblade Romance or Haute Tension if you prefer. The beauty of remaking a film like this is that it has a strong enough following within cult or genre circles without being quite so mainstream as say something like the Friday the 13th or the Elm Street franchises - so, with the exception of genre lovers there was probably little expectation IMO.<br/><br/>What young Mr Aja produces however is one of the most intense, bloodthirsty and at times disturbing horror films of the last 2o years; certainly at a time when i, and I'm sure many ""true horror"" fans are desperately trying to get rid of the taste of all the ""oh so clever"", self referential popcorn teens chillers of the post scream era.<br/><br/>If you have seen the original, I'm sure you'll be aware of the set up - Family in a motor home become stranded in the desert, miles from civilization and become prey to a group of cave dwelling mutants. So far so what ? Well for starters, unlike so many other films of this type, the characters aren't just your standard cinematic cannon fodder, and when horrible things start to happen to them, we actually give a damn and (as much as is possible) empathize and feel for them. Secondly, i have exposed myself to some of the nastiest stuff that has ever graced our screens, yet on repeat viewing a lot of films lose their impact at key scenes - some, however have that wonderful ability to give you a gut level reaction on future viewings. For me, this film manages this admirably; and during the notorious motor home invasion i still find myself appalled and shouting obscenities at the screen.<br/><br/>The blood and gore levels have been amped up to 10 on this one and those lovers of the crimson stuff will not be disappointed, but the film itself succeeds on so many more levels than your normal bog standard splatter fare - well paced, well acted by all and at times unbearably tense, this is what a real horror film should be like."

First blood to the mutated cannibals, but those city folk sure are driven by their primal instincts to avenge monstrous creatures that society turned into savages. Watching the contrasting families, all with their own defining characteristics which the narrative builds upon, go tooth and nail at each other, momentum swinging either way, gives the film its core.

","The remake of Wes Cravens classic from the 70's is pretty cool to say the least. The story is about an American family on a road trip who happen to find themselves stranded in the middle of a desert, little do they know the desert is crawling with mutants from nuclear experiments gone wrong. Needless to say, chaos ensues. Its got a decent cast for a horror movie with Aaron Stanford and Ted Levine both in major roles. However the main factor that separates this from other horror movies is how the viewer gives a toss about the characters. People are usually very blood-thirsty before seeing a horror movie but when I saw this I actually wanted (some) of the characters to live. Don't get me wrong, this movie is abundant in gore and bloodshed, but its handled very well. There's one scene in particular that will mercilessly yank at your heartstrings. Another huge plus this movie has is the mise en scene. The hot desert setting with the sandy mountains and hot sun provides a very eerie atmosphere that is hard to come by in modern film. The one thing i will say about this movie is that the monsters got off to easy. It feels like they didn't get what they deserved. I don't know about you but if someone killed my parents and raped my sister I would want them to suffer for it. Unfortunately this wasn't really the case. They all got killed fair and square, but I think the viewer would be much more satisfied if a wood chipper or a flame thrower was involved. Then again life isn't always fair, especially in horror movies. Overall I think this is the best horror movie ever. I'm not a huge fan of the genre but i must admit i haven't seen too many of the older flicks. To me films like Saw and Hostel are just too... boring, and i was glad when the characters met their gruesome deaths. The Hills Have Eyes actually converted me to the 'good guys' side and I was genuinely sad to see them go."

","Wes Craven's stylishly directed and disturbing remake of his debut horror film meets up to its high expectations in this gore filled thriller. <br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is set in the context of American Nuclear testing as a family become isolated in the desert where the bombs were first used. The old occupants of the testing site are scarred and deformed with a thirst for revenge. <br/><br/>Opening images of nuclear fallout concisely set the scene as the framework of the plot is communicated to the audience. Craven cleverly plays down the impending violence in the opening scenes, while the film initially seems to build itself up to be a clichéd and predictive horror movie. The violence seems predictably imminent and the audience is almost encouraged to comfortably await a typical scene of mild violence. However The Hills Have Eyes will have you wincing throughout, as Craven goes no holds barred letting loose his sadistic killers on this helpless family. Characters are ruthlessly killed off as Craven creates impressively horror filled scenes of violence. This film is a must watch for horror fans."

","I have to say i'm an avid horror fan, i think horror movies are fascinating in the way they satisfy the senses that audiences are unable to admit to. Human beings are fascinated by violence, and not just anyone, all humans, it is in our nature to be violent.<br/><br/>The Hills have eye's is the remake of the relatively unknown 70's cult horror film by Wes Craven. The remake has all the ingredients of a great horror film, superb performances, great cinematography, great music. Now tell me what element is missing from that list?<br/><br/>I had already heard beforehand of the films graphic content, and had prepared myself for the absolute worst, Cinema is an experience to be had, Jumping into controversial material is a great joy personally.<br/><br/>One scene and one scene only spoils this film for me, the rape scene, it is despicable. In fact the whole trailer scene, the first attack, is most awful. It crosses the line. The film is not all that original, and i wasn't having fun while watching the film, i found it to be verging on sadist porn. The final half hour though i thrilling, but it is out weighed to the down points.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Well.....Not recommended"

","I saw this movie last weekend and still can't get over how good it is. Almost makes me want to rent the DVD just to see the extras. What was so good about this one is that the plot gets going right away, no messing around for half an hour. And nothing in this movie appears fake or unnecessary. Once the family to the gas station, I thought they were done right there because the old dude there seemed a bit off. But once the man gave Doug and his family a shortcut to get to California by taking a side road in the desert of New Mexico, that's when I knew they were done like dinner. Everything else was just brilliant, few flops here and there, but well done nonetheless. March 06 The one other thing about this movie is that it pokes fun at the US near the end in the house when the US anthem is being played. Alexander Aja did an awesome job here shedding some light on what the government did between 1945-62. The one thing I couldn't figure out was the scene back at the camp when the antenna started moving around. Apparently it was supposed to be a distress signal from young guy to Bobby, but can't tell for sure. Was the guy's left hand figures chopped off in the fight in the house? According to wikipedia, he lost 2 fingers, but by the final fight, they appeared to be reattached (it was hard to tell because they were also taped up). I still think that the sequel should have picked up where this one left off because the ending here was absolutely brilliant. March 8 My idiot friend thinks it was a bad idea to have Doug not kill the young girl mutant at the end because he thinks the audience would love to see the unexpected twist ha. and when Bobby found the mutant consuming his mother's remains, instead of running away, should have taken aim and shot him??? March 10..the other thing that might have made this film even better is a slightly improved score. There were several scenes (when Doug goes off looking for help) when they could used audio with a more intense, frightening sound, something like a Marylin Manson or a Ministry guitar track."

","Wow, talk about a movie screwing itself up by going too far. To start off, I have seen Cannibal Halocaust, the Saw movies, Hostel, and all of the other graphic horror staples. However, this one is definitely gunning for first place in terms of realistic violence.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very well. There is an opening scene with pickaxe slaughter. An idyllic American family is introduced. The creep factor and tension builds. It was all going pretty well, until the mutants set the father on fire. This was shown in gruesome, graphic detail, complete with screaming and skin melting. Then, a pair of mutants breaks into the family's trailer. The start off by raping the 15-16 year old daughter. This is shown in fairly gruesome, repulsive detail. Then, one of the mutants finds the family parrots. He then bites one's head off gruesomely on screen, and then tips the body allowing the blood to flow into his mouth. The older daughter of about 20 walks in. The mutant holds a gun to this daughter's baby and threatens to shoot him. He then pulls up her shirt and fondle's her breast. Believe me, it is not arousing in the least. The girl's mother is then shot, and the older girl who was previously molested was shot in the head. The baby is then stolen by the mutants.<br/><br/>After that, the remaining family members attempt to recover their stolen baby. Much carnage by the way of pickaxe ensues. The movie ends with the oldest family member returning triumphantly with the baby. The end of their ordeal has come. All has well. or is it? If the description of the family invasion scene does not sound like something that will bother you, then go ahead and check out the flick. It is pretty good. However, I did not realize the amount of violence I was getting into. Therefore, these horrific acts of violence detracted from the film immensely. It crossed a boundary with me. If you can easily stomach graphic violence, then go ahead. It's not a bad film. But if you are revolted by the descriptions, you might want to pass this one up."
"burgershmurger","Null","0","0","17 August 2007"," slasher by the numbers; evidence that the genre is at a dead end
","It's symptomatical for the current state of the slasher genre that this is just a remake of Craven's 1977 classic. When this type of genre emerged in the 60s and 70s, it was a breath of fresh air for the film culture. But nowadays, it has reached a dead end and cannot move on anymore. Pretty much any splatter flick from the recent past relies on the same tired plot elements by the numbers. Watching the action unfold, you are bound to get bored because you can tell from a mile what's gonna happen: Throw in a few no-brainers, throw in a few hillbillies and inbreds and people are gonna do stupid things and people are gonna get killed one by one etc. It's just frustrating and annoying to watch people getting murdered especially since you've seen it a thousand times before. The only difference is the way the killings happen. Aja's remake relies on plenty of gore to make up for the lacking innovation but it doesn't quite work. Moments of tension cannot hide the fact that it's all been done before. The gore level is the only element the entire genre has been hinging on for a while. However, on the whole those movies have run out of steam because they are bogged down in their own stereotypes and predictable plots. They used to be engaging and punchy when they were new in the 60s and 70s. But now I'd much rather watch more subtle horror movies or dramas that provide me with new perspectives and food-for-thought instead of hip new ways to chop someone to pieces. Those splatter movies largely pander to teenagers and their immature tastes for grisly scenes of death but there comes a point where you grow out of it and plumb for something more to chew on. I wanna see a movie evolving around an hitherto untold story that is gonna make me discover a new world. But both HHE and its other splatter buddies have been grating on my nerves for a while now and it's time to move on from severed limbs and eviscerations."

","I'm not one for horror films usually. Actually, for years I couldn't bring myself to watch horror films at all. But I had heard so much about ""The Hills Have Eyes"" re-make and was intrigued. So I decided to rent it.<br/><br/>I can't say I enjoyed the process of viewing the film, but now that it's over, I can say that I think it's a great one.... if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>You rarely see a movie that is at a 10 for intensity...THE ENTIRE TIME. And the ""scare tactics"" were right on.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the performances. Nothing was over-the-top. All of the moments were very honest. On a side note, I enjoyed that they captured the quarrel of a family vacation (before it gets hairy...that is.) <br/><br/>Above all else, this was about survival, and doing whatever it takes to protect the ones you love. <br/><br/>Basically what I'm saying is.... if this type of film is your thing, pick it up! Not for everyone... and I never need to see it again, but for what it is, it's great!"
"Jakethemuss","8","0","0","3 August 2007"," surprisingly graphic, surprisingly good!!
","Before watching this, I was expecting another tame, filtered down ""horror"" yarn in the vein of recent day slasher flicks. I thought it wouldn't satisfy my thirst for on screen gore, or impress me as a remake of an old classic. I was wrong.<br/><br/>For a mainstream, cinema released flick I was surprised with what they showed. I would liken it with Rob Zombie's 'The Devils Rejects' in terms of how the violence is presented. Although not as disturbing as that film, it is easily as gratuitous. I am no stranger to extreme cinema, but this still managed to make me squirm in some parts.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of an ill fated American family crossing the barren deserts of New Mexico in an RV. Things take a turn for the worse however, when a tyre is punctured out in the middle of nowhere, leaving the family stranded in the supposed empty desert. At the time they are not aware of the danger that awaits them, whereas we are, which is when the tension starts to mount.<br/><br/>It isn't long before the families unwanted guests pay a visit, and all hell ensues. Those who do go first, go out in hideous ways, leaving a handful of survivors to fight for survival against not only the wilderness, but the less than hospitable creatures that call the hills home. The film is directed in such a way, that you find yourself liking the family, and almost being there with them as they face the troubles together. Although it is a situation that none of us, or at least the vast majority of us, have ever been in, you could almost put yourself in their shoes, its a fear that feels REAL.<br/><br/>What intrigued my the most, was seeing the movie's hero, X-men star Aaron Stanford, turning from normal day Dad to axe wielding avenger as soon as he realised he had to take action. Also good performances from Lost star Emilie De Ravin and Dan Byrd as her scared but helpful younger brother.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who classes themselves as horror fans, as this does not fail to deliver the goods."

","The only reason I watched this movie was Aaron Stanford. It only gets a 3 because the only things I like from it was the acting, the suspense, and the violence/terror (not that I like seeing people die but because it looked very real).<br/><br/>Many people don't like the movie because of the rape scene, but that's not the reason I don't like it. After all, it IS rated Re so people should expect something like that from this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, everything stars happening too fast. It's like, the viewers have no time to adjust. The dad burns to death, 10 seconds later, Brenda gets raped, 30 seconds later the mother gets shot, 1 second later, Lynn gets shot. Then right after that, the baby is taken away. 4 down in like a minute. It's stupid.<br/><br/>Second of all, the good guys always die very fast due to some unknown reason. On the other hand, it takes the bad guys to get shot more than 50 times to die, and even then they don't die until they get up and chop someone up with an axe with the strength they have left. THEN they die. They're only people, just like the good guys. Being deformed doesn't make you stronger. OK fine, Doug is one of the good guys and he doesn't die easily, but that's only because he was the main character.<br/><br/>Third of all, I know it's supposed to be a very intense movie, but c'mon, what's with all the deaths? Can this movie get any sadder? And the only good mutant HAS to die. I almost cried when Doug found his wife dead on the floor. And at the end of the movie, the binoculars we see just ruins everything. What's the point of watching the movie when you see this guy desperate to get his baby back, who worked so hard to kill a whole bunch of deformed freaks, while you're hoping the guy is going to survive, just to have it ruined at the end? All that for nothing.<br/><br/>It's the most retarded movie ever. Period. I don't care what you think, my opinion will not be changed."

There where bits (and lots of those bits) that grossed me out but still I was transfixed. It was well acted and the make-up artist did a great job in achieving his goals of creating the results of nuclear fall-out. The horrors of messing with this stuff was startling in its reality. The vastness of America brought home in the knowledge that those missing have never been found. Which is similar to Australia where I live. No-one came looking and if they did, well. We create those monsters and then get upset when they bite back. Scary stuff. Loved the dog but get fed up with the easy victims they become although Beast sure did avenge his lady love. I thought the actors, all of them did a great job, but if any writers or directors read this I am sick of helpless screaming females.

"BaronBl00d","6","0","0","21 July 2007"," Deep in the Heart of New Mexico
","I saw the original The Hills Have Eyes - a compelling, stunning, morally bereft film by a then Wes Craven dedicated to showing the baser side of humanity on film. A chore he did surprisingly well. I knew what to expect from a remake from his 1977 film about a family of cannibals living in the New Mexico desert preying on any interlopers that might make their way through their territory. I was surprised; however, that the remake was done with so much care and attention to detail as to not just make a hasty remake but a homage to Craven's film as well. The Hills Have Eyes through its first 2/3rds is as compelling, tense, taut, relentless as the original but with greater character development. The acting in this movie was really quite good with Ted Levine standing out as the patriarch of a family going west in a huge camper with two dogs(and a couple of lovebirds). Levine is one of those actors that just has a presence about him and a believability to any character he creates. The rest of the cast does well in their roles despite being asked to undergo some major character transformations. Director Alexandre Aja shows he knows how to use a camera and I loved the location shots in Morrocco so convincingly used as the Sout-West American desert. As I earlier stated, the first 2/3rds of the film are gold(gold, Jerry!) The last 3rd, at least for me, lacks that same kind of tension as we start to get a reason WHY the cannibals are in the desert to begin with - and though I think it is a nice attempt at some kind of explanation, I just did not find it very credible. That being said, the way it was set and the look were nonetheless impressive. The remake of Craven's original film is a gory, at times very unpleasant film which has the ability to do what so few sequels do today - stand on its own feet to some extent as a movie worth seeing in its own right."

","I watched this updated version before I saw the original and this movie was intensely scary. The ideas of being stranded in the middle of nowhere and there is (unbeknownst to the victims) a family of mutated cannibals living within and around the surrounding ""Hills"" is enough to keep me from driving in the desert. The theme of revenge at the end of the movie really impressed me, many horror flicks have omitted that technique as of recent. But I felt that the revenge was perfectly done and deserved. I don't know how Wes Craven feels about this flick but I really enjoyed it a lot, if you have seen the original, make note how eerily similar both movies are.

The make-up effects are laughably bad and the ""baddies"" just look silly. HOwever, Emilie de Ravin saves the day with her portrayal and she carries the film.

","While traveling in a trailer to California through the New Mexico Desert, a family is misled to a shortcut going to nowhere by the owner of an isolated gas station and wrecks the car in a rock. Along the night and on the next day, they are attacked by a group of deformed cannibals, fruit of the atmospheric nuclear tests conducted by USA from 1945 to 1962 in that spot. Absolutely trapped by the psychotics, they have to fight to survive.<br/><br/>I didn't want to watch this movie. The reason is because the critics said it sucks and it was nasty but I watched it and it was better than I thought it was but that's not saying much. Let me start with saying this: It was predictable, well, at least for me. I did not know why I knew what was going to happen (with an exceptional last 15 minutes).<br/><br/>This movie is slow. Nothing happens in the first forty minutes or so which is kind of boring, if you ask me. When it does get moving, there are many horror clichés, throughout the film. The characters are doing stupid things to get themselves killed. Then this movie frustrates people because of these clichés. Then it turns mean spirited, killing people for their entertainment, but that's only a segment of the film.<br/><br/>The only ""good"" part in the film was actually the unpredictable last fifteen minutes. Finally, the characters do smart things and fight back, like a revenge flick. But so and so, there has to be an open sequel, which of course leads to The Hills Have Eyes II. I wonder if that film can have more clichés.<br/><br/>I actually liked the whole performances by the whole family. They were realistic and surprisingly sympathetic when they are getting hurt. I was actually surprised there is an emotional core in the film. Not many horror films have that, these days. The character development is also good. Other good things I'll note are the creature designs and the cinematography.<br/><br/>Horror fans will probably like this for the buckets of gore and violence. Some, like me, will not like it for the dumb characters and the clichés. It's not a scary film. It's better than what you think it is but isn't that good of a horror film."
"aimless-46","7","0","0","7 April 2007"," Comparisons to the ""Original""
","Viewers will be happy to know that the remake of 1977's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" maintains the hokey fake binocular point of view device. Ever notice how those two circles with the black borders used for movie POV purposes are not what you actually see when you look through a pair of binoculars (there are no circles in there). <br/><br/>I had the luxury of watching the two films at the same time. I would run 15 minutes of the remake first and then she same15 minutes of the original. Roger Ebert contends that it is a loose re-make; I disagreed until well past the midway point of the story. Until then it pretty much followed things scene for scene, with minor updates to reflect 2006 rather than 1977. The bill for a tank of gas was under $10 in the original. <br/><br/>They chose to alter the back-story; in the original the gas station owner had spawned the original creature back before WWII and he tries to persuade the family to stay on the main road. In the remake the creatures are products of atomic testing and the gas station owner is paid by them to divert people off the main road. The introduction of the old atomic testing device allows the production design people to create a government built fake town left over from the testing. It is populated with old mannequins originally placed there to show the effects of a nuclear blast. This set is a nice addition to the original and the biggest deviation or the remake. <br/><br/>Not so effective is a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" field of abandoned cars and trucks (belonging to prior victims); mostly because the device has become almost obligatory to these familial horror stories (insert ""Wrong Turn"" here). In the original this was an off camera Air Force dump site from which the son-in-law salvaged some equipment. Making this a textbook example of why showing nothing is sometimes better showing something. <br/><br/>My reaction until well after the midpoint was that the remake was better. It was very respectful of original and the higher budget and technical improvements meant better film stock, more elaborate camera work, and better audio. Neither cast is exactly full of heavyweight talent. The new higher budgeted group might actually be more talented but Craven is a much better acting for the camera director than Aja; so the acting advantage clearly goes to the original (who also seemed to be having a lot more fun with their material). <br/><br/>The remake falters (relative to the original anyway) for the last third of the film. In large part this is because Aja failed early on to define and adequately develop personalities for the mutant family. This was the real strength of the original as the family in the hills was quickly identified and their internal relationships developed. They took a gleeful pleasure in their mayhem and Craven kept them in character throughout the production. The remake is inconsistent, at times it tries to make them more sympathetic and at other times more primitive and savage. Plus it adds a non-ambulatory character like that in ""TCM"" and ""Monster Man"". Unfortunately here he serves no purpose other than as an excuse to employ more people in the make-up unit. <br/><br/>Finally, the remake lacks the original's best visual image, Michael Berryman's hairless asymmetrical head which was featured on the poster and video cover art. Berrymore's characterization of ""Pluto"" became a cult figure with his groveling and whining. Michael Bailey Smith's new ""Pluto"" does not begin to measure up to Berryman's. The remake's best visual image is a superior ""Ruby""; Laura Ortiz manages an expressive performance that is both wistful and eerie-nice job. <br/><br/>It appears that Aja incorporated parallels between the two families but few will notice and even less will care. I say ""appears"" because somewhere between production and release this stuff was so haphazardly assembled that it lost all sense of unity and purpose. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Overall this wasn't a bad movie. The premise was decent, and the adversaries were scary but amusing. I enjoyed the way the mutants interacted with each other, such as during the rape scene, when Pluto tried to argue that Lizard would be unable to commit the act. Big Brain's speech seemed to leave me almost feeling sorry for the creatures, which is uncommon in horror films. <br/><br/>One thing that bothered me however is that the characters are given guns, and yet they can't seem to use them. It was sad to see the dad, who was apparently a cop, blatantly wasting ammo without actually acquiring a target. This would be someone who has been trained to keep cool in tense situations."

People were saying how awful some of the scenes were, that they got sick, even saying that this movie was sicker than 'I Spit on Your Grave' and 'Last House on the Left', I didn't see all of 'I Spit...' but I did see 'Last House...' and let me tell you I felt awful after seeing that movie, borderline physically sick.<br/><br/>Now back to 'The Hills...' sure this movie had some kick-ass pure gore scenes, the bad guys were truly evil and very well done, but at no point in the movie did I feel sick or even bad like I had felt during 'Last House...' not that I was hoping to get sick or anything. Don't get me wrong, this movie was really well done and I enjoyed it a lot, I was even surprised at some points, especially during the trailer attack, I did not see the Lynne thing coming, or the Ethel thing, most movie makers aren't that ""evil"" towards nice mothers, but it worked well in the movie. It made Doug become this revenge-killing machine. <br/><br/>I really liked this movie and all but it didn't scare me at all, sure I did go ""ouch"" at some points, mostly during the whole revenge part of the movie but then again, they had it coming.

Apart from that thumbs up for 'The Hills Have Eyes'<br/><br/>The one scene where I did get a little restless was when Big Bob had his...well lets call it 'hot scene' (so it's not too big of a spoiler) and Brenda was left in the trailer in a very bad situation, all I could think of was, forget Bob he's toast, get your asses back to the freakin trailer.<br/><br/>I guess my point is: good movie, great special effects, I saw the making of and really kudos to all those guys and girls that worked on the movie because it really really looked great in a kind of gory way but still everything looked so real.

","Though I have not seen the original 1977 film, I cannot help but agree with some of the positive comments about this film, especially those regarding the engrossing use of character development and violence to captivate the viewer. Rather than rehash what has already been said, I would like to share my personal experience with this film with you.<br/><br/>I began watching this film at midnight on cable. At one point, I fell asleep due to personal exhaustion. Not too long later, I awoke to my television blaring the screams and shrieks of the victims in the film. I woke up at what is clearly the most vile, raunchy, and disturbing point of the film. I am a 27 year old male. I love to show gory movies to my girlfriend and friends and creep up on them when they're not suspecting it. Still, I was completely taken aback, appalled, slightly sickened, and disturbed by what I awoke to. Clearly unable to fall back asleep, I HAD to keep watching to see the film's resolution (if any).<br/><br/>This is the power inherent in good film making; to reel the viewer in with character development and then manipulate the viewer's emotions by doing wretched things to those characters.<br/><br/>This is by no means the greatest or scariest horror film, but I found it to be far more enthralling and captivating than any recent teen slasher or pseudo-scary Ring-type movie.<br/><br/>I haven't had this much fun being appalled in years!"

","Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes is a horror classic. Extremely disturbing and intense. This remake is pretty much the same apart from a few minor tweaks. Usually I am against horror remakes, I see them as pointless, money-grubbing affairs that never top the original. Although this isn't as good as the 1977 version, it's still an intense and well made horror movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens with images from nuclear testing. There are some disturbing images of mutations and explosions. We then enter present day, the Carter family are travelling through New Mexico to California. They stop off at a gas station and get directions from the crazy attendant. Of course, this shortcut causes them to crash. Big Bob (Ted Levine) and Doug (Aaron Standford) split up to find help while the rest of the family stay behind. At night, the mutants raid the trailer.....<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja has done a decent job with this remake. High Tension, his other film, was very well made. It was scary and suspenseful and it packed a punch in the gore department. THHE doesn't either. This movie is extremely gory and quite disturbing. But by the end, the gore doesn't become anything at all, since there is so much being thrown at you.<br/><br/>The special effects are brilliant as is the brooding score.

","I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but, ever since the news came that an update of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was in talks, I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation, actually. Unlike ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""The Fog"", to name just two examples, Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job, as his own project ""Haute Tension"" is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting, but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict, except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts, a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there, and now they still prowl the wasteland, assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu, and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females, elderly folks or even newborn babies..."

The beginning is not as boring as many other horror movies. I have no problem with the tension being built up, didn't have the feeling I had to wait to long for the action. I would have given this movie an 8 or a 9 if they had not made the same disturbing little ""mistakes"" as I see in many horror movies. But maybe even that were a little jokes(?). One of the things I hate is that when a group of people is getting murdered: Why ???? DO They always go away on their own, normal sane people would stick together. But recalling how the movie went on, I can forgive that. But if you almost kill somebody KILL him again, I hate it when they are getting up again and continue doing some nasty things. But again, seemed almost like a kind of wink. So it's (not)exagerated, must be the influence of the genre. For a horror movie it is really nice, some real emotions in it. The two 'big boys' in the movie are not doing much.

","What up my pygmies..it is I the infamous Gore Mongral back from the bowels of horrors pits to bring you yet another flick of repulsiveness. Today is ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake. To start I will say that as a rule of thumb I do not like remakes however there are those exceptions like John Carpenters ""The Thing"" which happens to be my favorite horror movie of all time. So after saying that where does ""Hills"" fall more like The Fog remake or The Thing remake? Thankfully it is the latter.<br/><br/>You know the premise if you same the original, family going on vacation, stranded in the desert and attacked by crazy desert mountain folk, family members die the remaining members fight back against the nuts and get away. This movie is the same however it definitely has its own wrinkles that make it more than just your standard remake. If I could say one word about the movie is FINALLY! Why finally, because thank God somebody gets it. Horror done right is when you have a descent story with some characters that you can get behind and seeing them be put through their own personal hell and how the heck (if they can) they get out of it.<br/><br/>Also with a film with this kind of subject matter you got to have the violence on high and the gore and blood flowing throughout which this film does. For a Movie Theatre release I'm use to OK to good violence and gore but not quite what you would see on a uncut DVD however this movie (though cut to make a R rating not an NC-17) left enough of the gruel to satisfy gorehounds of any kind. If this is the shredded version of the film I cannot wait to see what was cut! Now with all that aside the negatives of the movie, though minor could hamper some short attention spanned horror fans from really getting into it. There is a nice violent beginning but then we get lulled a little with character development that takes some time to move on which at the midway point will have you thinking where are those freaking mutant mountain folk. If you can be patient though the payoff is more than worth it as some of the coolest violence this side of a 12 gauge shotgun to the head (hint hint) will be on display.<br/><br/>In conclusion, thank you Alexandre Aja for this film, thank you for being an old school horror fan and not wimping out for a PG-13 garbage fest. I look forward to your other movies as so far you are 2 for 2 (this and High Tension). You are definitely a genre director to keep an eye on. As far as the movie..what are you doing get off your duff, stop reading this post and check it out.<br/><br/>8/10 Very good movie remake or otherwise, little joking as the terror hits quick and violently especially in the 3rd and 4th acts of the film. Worth your $10.00 so see it while it is out.<br/><br/>Thats it for now pygmies until next time heed my advice, don't get directions from a no-toothed gas station attendant as you may end up in The Hills Have Eyes sequel!!!"

","The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of a film that in harsh honesty has benefited from a lot of very generous and undeserved hype. It really isn't shocking- if anything it's pantomime- cartoony and delivered without any real sense of style. Wes Craven's Last House on the Left has a similarly undeserved reputation. Yes both films feature shocking scenes-but delivered in such an artless manner it leaves the viewer cold, or even worse, disinterested. It was never a contender for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre title of ""off the beaten track/ away from civilisation"" brand of horror.<br/><br/>The remake does have a wonderful visual flair. That is something I can not deny- it's beautiful on the eye, you feel the searing heat of the desert, the savagery of the mutants actions- it's all conveyed beautifully. The opening is wonderful also- it's one of those pre-credit massacres that cannot fail to grab your attentionbut that's the problem, once it has your attention it doesn't seem to know what to do with it.<br/><br/>It' a disturbing trend in horror films today- the build up that leads nowhere, the rest of the film plodding along almost without real direction. It was there in the recent Texas Chainsaw remake and House of Wax also. It just makes for infuriating viewing. I don't want to watch a boy having to chase his dogs back after they've been let out a trailer accidentally for the umpteenth time. It gets very annoying, and it's pretty weak as plot devices go. The odd moments of genuine shock and savagery are effectively conveyed but for the most part they seem to punctuate a pretty drawn out uninspired film. It's not a horror film in that respect- it's a film that's quite devoid of atmosphere except the odd shocking moment spattered here and there.<br/><br/>I'd say it was worth renting- it certainly isn't a dreadful film, it just doesn't really do anything especially new, or interesting beyond the look of the film. As I've said before, the hype will work against this film, because the actual execution really is only so- so. Still a fantastic opening sequence."

","After a day of contemplating it i still don't really know if I liked it or not... I was definitely disturbed, and surprisingly a little sympathetic, a trait that rarely accompanies a horror movie, but I still don't know if i really liked it.<br/><br/>The beginning to me didn't actually seem like the beginning of a horror movie... It kinda seemed like a comedy or a drama, where a stereotypical family gets stranded in the dessert and is forced to work together under comical circumstances to survive.<br/><br/>It kinda had trouble deciding which route to take for the basic plot, they had so many options I can't blame them. I think the directors and writers decided to go everywhere when it came to that. Family dog dies, father is burned alive while the family watches, teenage daughter is raped and no one saves her, mother and wife is raped and murdered, the mother of the family dies, and the baby is taken.<br/><br/>WHAT MORE CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN??? This scene shocked me, disgusted me, make me sympathetic, angry, and even a little teary eyed. But unfortunately in comparison the rest of the movie didn't quite stack up to the intensity of that one scene.<br/><br/>I'm slightly torn, I liked the general idea of the movie, but it seemed like some of it was lost in the translation. It's slightly jumpy and I assumed the mutants had a REASON to kill them, unfortunately I was mistaken and there was no real reason for anything.<br/><br/>Overall I think I liked it, and if you are a gore fan, and not too interested in the overall plot, I would recommend this movie for you.

"brainofj72","9","0","0","1 August 2006"," Not Just Another Horror Remake
","Fresh off his visceral masterpiece Haute tension, French director Alexandre Aja gets behind the camera once more for his second film, a revamping of Wes Craven's 1977 Texas Chainsaw wanna-be The Hills Have Eyes.<br/><br/>Upon a casual glance, it's easy to dismiss Hills as yet another useless Hollywood remake of a gritty '70s horror film  the original is indeed gritty and from the '70s. However, unlike Dawn of the Dead or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hills is a film that could actually benefit from an updating. Also, unlike the Dawn and Chainsaw remakes, Hills has a director at the helm that actually loves the genre and knows what the hell he's doing.<br/><br/>By now, the scenario is all too familiar: an all-American family gets lost in the middle of nowhere and falls prey to some twisted clan of deranged psychopaths. Clichéd? Sure, but don't forget that the original Hills was one of the first. So just what does Aja bring to the table that sets Hills apart from the other (usually laughable) films of this type? An abundance of style, realism, emotion, and gore.<br/><br/>Aja seems to have a very solid understanding of the most primal emotions possessed by mankind, and in Hills, he explores them in a way that most filmmakers wouldn't dare. As in Haute tension, the violence is presented in a delicate blend of realistic horror and exploitative titillation. When the family is first attacked, the violence is brutal and ugly. However, when the tables are turned a member of the family becomes the one inflicting the violence, the bloodletting is slightly heightened and exploited for entertainment. Could the protagonist be enjoying his vicious revenge? Aja portrays this masterfully and dares his audience to enjoy it with the protagonist. Just how far should one be willing to go? How far is too far? Is this just as wrong? Can it be justified? Something else atypical about Hills is that we actually care about the characters. Instead of the usual ditzy blonde teens we can't wait to see get killed off, these characters are believable and we feel for them. They are all wonderfully portrayed by the fine cast, especially Aaron Stanford (whom you may recognize from X-Men 2 and 3), who gives a surprisingly terrific performance.<br/><br/>Something else that makes Hills more than just an average slasher flick is the masterfully subtle social commentary. The ever-present motif of the American flag (quite literally being shoved down a throat at one point)the rousing score so peculiarly similar to Ennio Morricone's distinctly (and ironically) American The Good, The Bad and The Uglythe ubiquitous desiccated desert landscape that bears a suspicious resemblance to the Middle Eastthis film has something to say.<br/><br/>The only real flaw I can find in Hills is that there are, occasionally, a few groan-inducing ""jump scares"". They're cheap, gimmicky, and wholly unnecessary. But considering that Haute tension is pretty much entirely without such trickery, I can only guess (and hope) that they were due to studio interference. They have to at least somewhat cater to that moronic demographic, I suppose.<br/><br/>So what's next for Aja? He says his next film, The Waiting, is going to be a gore-less ghost story. He says he wants to see if he can be scary without the gore. There you have it, folks  a man that is unafraid to unflinchingly show copious bloodshed, knows how to present subtle social commentary, and is looking to challenge himself. If the horror genre has a savior, Alexandre Aja is it."

","** Spoilers - Comments generally intended for those having already seen the movie ** I've read several of the reviews on here on typically there are people that loved it, people that hated it, and everything between.<br/><br/>One of the recurring themes of the unfavourable reviews is the fact that several of the events depicted are in extremely bad taste and have no place in a horror film such as this. Specifically, I'm referring things like the rape scene, the baby and some people have also commented on the pessimistic open ending.<br/><br/>I don't think movies, in a particular genre or otherwise, should have the follow 'rules' about what is appropriate or not. Obviously I'm not suggesting children's movies should be allowed to show people copulating with dogs or anything like that, but I mean in an adult-rated film I don't think it's fair to criticise a scene simply because it's in bad taste and may offend.<br/><br/>I don't have any personal 'issues' with anything depicted in this film. That's not to say I'm not upset or moved by such things in movies, if done well, in an appropriate way. But actually, I found the rape scene and baby-peril scenes rather funny. Not because I find rape or potentially dead babies amusing at all, but because it completely smacked of the filmmakers' desperation to come up with something shocking. When the mutant started suckling the mother's breast I was just thinking how ridiculous it was and how much it was a pathetic attempt to disturb me - which it didn't.<br/><br/>(I believe there are different cuts of this movie, but I saw the British version which seems to be uncut.) So basically, I thought this was a below average horror flick that tried desperately to be shocking and creepy but just came across as silly. Aside from the gore, there really isn't going for this. I was way too distracted by all the plot holes and leaps in credibility to get involved enough to be either scared or disturbed."

You see, this is a classical horror movie. And you should not look forward to something you have not seen before in other horror movies.<br/><br/>The only difference between this and other horror movies would be that every individual including the ""desert freaks"", seem to have their own personality and it also comes clear that one of those freaks seems to be more intelligent than his fellows due to his acting and ""communication skills"" (in a primitive way).

Of course, the film is gore (a lot more than the other recent 70's horror movies remakes) and could be somehow shocking (I agree with that for the rape scene), but it can't really traumatize the public. It doesn't go to far in pure horror because of the monsters, who are shown without any humanity left (exept for the little girl). They're like carnival's figure or clowns, a grotesque caricature of the normal family, which makes them unreal and untruth. <br/><br/>This treatment of the evil characters - all in exaggeration - undo the fear they could have deeply inspired, for an immediate but not durable thrill. And that's quite disappointing from the director of one of the most inspired, terrifying and clever horror movie of this last years : ""Haute Tension""."

","What do you think of the title? Witty, eh? I thought of it myself. *sighs* OK, subject at hand is The Hills Have Eyes. If you're looking for a morose, gory-flick that'll have your date clinging to your arm, this would be a steal at double the price. But if you're looking for an intellectual, provocative heart-stopper with genuine characters... you'll be walking away empty handed. As for me, I'm a mix of both (that being, I didn't have a date) Acting: I'm kind of debating key part of any film. I've never experienced being stalked by fall-out victims from the 50's, but given the unlikely plot... I'd say they did decent. Decent. The actors were the B-Class's best and brightest, including Ted Levine and my personal favorite, Emile de Ravin. She's too fine. uh... back on subject. The characters were flat. The father was a retired serviceman who's a conservative (saw that coming, right) The mother's a... for lack of a better term... a mom. She prays a lot. Ahh, the son. This was an interesting addition. He played a sort of Macauly Caulkin in a post-apocalyptic desert. Only, this was no Home Alone, and there was no Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern! The one that stood out the most was a cliché' as old as anvils falling on coyote's heads. And that was the outcasted son-in-law/ determined father. Enough said.<br/><br/>The part that I thought captivated me the most was pure, un-adulterated chaos that this movie portrayed. And that's basically a 16 year-old, white male speaking. Sure, I'm up for loading buck-shot into freaks that the government left behind. Hey, you won't hear me complain when a cell phone salesman digs a pick into a man's skull. (the cell phone salesman reference is what the determined father does for a living) But that doesn't really make up for a weak story in the long run. Not in my opinion, no.<br/><br/>I don't regret seeing it, no, not at all. But it's not one of the situations where ""I love you, but I'm not 'in' love with you"" Readers, it's not even an ""I like you, like you."" It's basically ""hey you're a cool kid, let's hang out!"" no more, no less.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, (and dead) I'll give it One-Thumb-Up... and that one thumb's probably for Emile de Ravin and the creative fatalities.<br/><br/>-Theodore Reddinger"

","***SPOILERS*** Incredibly grossed-out sequel to the 1977 original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" follows the 1977 version almost scene for scene until some half hour into the movie. It's then, with the advancement of special effects over the last thirty years, the movie becomes an almost unwatchable horror show. <br/><br/>Traveling to California Big Bob, Ted Levin, and his family stop off at this out of the way gas station, in the middle of the New Mexican desert. After filling up their given directions to a short cut through the hill by the somewhat creepy gas station attendant Tom Bower. It turns out that old Tom is working with a number of psychos who have it in for the human race because of the condition that they find themselves in; due the the years of nuclear testing in that part of the country.<br/><br/>Disabling Big Bob's van, and the trailer attached to it, the unseen killers wait for darkness to fall and then make their move on the helpless, and unsuspecting, stranded travelers. With Big Bob going back to the gas station for help he's shocked to see old Tom laying drunk in the outhouse talking to himself. Before Big Bob can figure out what's wrong with Tom he takes out a shotgun and blows his brains out. Running to Old Toms car Big Bob is then attacked, by one of the many weirdos in the movie who ties him to a tree and sets it on fire.<br/><br/>The next ten or so minutes in the movie with the out of hiding mutants attacking Big Bob's family are so disturbing and shocking, even to grown ups, that I'm surprised that the movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"" didn't get an X-rating just for it's graphic violence alone. Breaking into the trailer the psychos fall upon Big Bob's younger daughter Brenda ,Emilie De Ravin, and manhandle, and possibly rape, her so badly that it's almost a miracle that she didn't end up losing her mind much less her life. Both Big Bob's wife Ethel and his older daughter Lynn, Kathleen Quinlan & Vinessa Shaw, are then viciously murdered. Lynn and her husbands Doug, Aaron Stanford, infant daughter Catherine is then kidnapped by the killers who take off into the hills.<br/><br/>Big Bob's teenage son Bobby, Dan Byrd, had earlier gone out in the hills to find one of his pet German Shepherds Beauty and, after finding Beauty torn to pieces, fell off a cliff almost breaking his head. Helped by one of the psychos children Ruby(Laura Ortiz), who was about the most normal of the bunch, Bobby had some idea of what was in the hills but was just too traumatized and afraid to tell any of his family members. Now, with both his patents and sister-in-law murdered, Bobby becomes almost insane with anger only wanting to get even with those who did him family in.<br/><br/>Lynn's husband Doug a life long pacifist and anti-gun activist also changes his opinion of guns and knives and every other weapon of death. Now becoming almost as ferocious and kill crazy as those who did Lynn in, and took his infant daughter Catherine away with them. This sets up the audience, who still have the nerve and stomach to stay around to watch the movie, for what has to be some of the most unwatchable and horrific scenes in motion picture history.<br/><br/>Defintly not for the meek and weak at heart ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is not the kind of movie that you'd take a girl, whom you want to impress, out to see. The violence in the film almost turns cartoon-like with both the killers and Doug and to a lesser extent Bobby and Brenda having it out in a battle of life and death in the empty desert as well as in a deserted town that was the test site and target of atomic explosions. Doug together with his pet dog Beast take on almost the entire band of mutant/psychos in his attempt to rescue his daughter. Dough ends up so badly beaten and mauled by these crazies that it's hard to believe that he's still alive by the time the movies over. Bobby and his sister Brenda have a somewhat easier time of it only having to deal with what seems like the head man or psycho of the bunch with him ending up blown straight to kingdom come, together with the family trailer, at the end of the movie."

(I'm a little averse to blood and gore and such.)I liked the story, and I loved the CG they added in. (Big Bob's eyes turning white as he was burning, the extra blood when Lizard gets whopped with the skillet, etc) All in all, good movie, watch it at night, in the dark, with a bunch of 12 year olds.

I haven't seen a movie ever with such vulnerable, wholesome victims. Overall, I guess I would say that the movie was effective in suspense and horror, but I was shocked and disturbed by the victims they chose to die.

","I sat down and watched this flick with high hopes. Its publicity made me into the typical 'experiment gone wrong' viewer.<br/><br/>I know in horror flicks people die and often you get a sense of right and wrong and what should be. If you make a movie like 'The Hills Have Eyes' you may want to consider the back-lash of ending it without closure!<br/><br/>The bloody movie, ends with some tool-belt looking through his binoculars and a hopeless situation in which the so called victors are stranded in the desert with next to know hope of escape.<br/><br/>Most people want the protagonists to win or at least be comforted in knowing that all is not in vain. The twisted individuals responsible for ending it in such a way make the viewer upset and even resentful for the lack of creativity in which the story finished. Maybe some would argue ending a movie in free-fall is suspenseful and allows the viewer to assume the 'post-mortum' which would undoubtedly occur or not, but it is just a stupid way of saving money and hiding the lack of brain cells involved to wrap up a movie with a little class.<br/><br/>Someone should give the people responsible a good shake because the reality is, if they want to reach more people and have good feed-back they will end the movie not cut it off."

","On the audio commentary of the DVD, art director/co-screenwriter Gregory Levasseur said that him and Alexander Aja were paying tribute to Straw Dogs. I thought this was a cool idea. They also mention that they were paying tribute to True Romance(1993). I still have to say that the original Hills Have Eyes(1977) was a lot better. The cannibals were more likable and normal in the original. Also, the themes and symbolism was great too. Having a normal family turn to their dark side and being just as savage as their enemies is neater than suggesting the negative after effects of atomic testing like in the remake. The best part about the remake was the tribute to Straw Dogs.What do you think about this smart idea? Please be honest.<br/><br/>P.S.

","I wasn't expecting too much when I first heard about this remake. After all, how many cruddy, unnecessary horror remakes have we had in the past few years? Too many. But when I found out that Alexandre Aja was at the helm, my gore-filled heart started beating a little faster. High Tension was great, so I figured he couldn't do any worse.<br/><br/>Now, having seen it, I can easily say that this is the best horror remake I have had the pleasure to watch. In fact, it will probably end up going down as one of the best horror films I've seen in the last six years (after Uzumaki, of course). In fact fact, I just may have to put this sick little puppy on my Top Twenty List.<br/><br/>Forget what the detractors say. Every minute of this movie, from start to finish, is edge-of-your-seat entertainment. It only gets better from the opening shot onwards. The camera-work is superb, and Aja obviously knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable, even during the lighter moments (there aren't too many of those). He's even done some things with the camera that I've never seen before in ANY movie.<br/><br/>There are dozens of cringe-worthy scenes in this flick. If bucket fulls of gore are what you're looking for, look no further (I should add that I have only seen the unrated DVD release, so your viewing experience may be a little less bloody than mine was). The special effects are top notch, brought to you courtesy of Nicotero & Berger.<br/><br/>I've got few complaints- for one, sometimes the music was a little too ""operatic/epic"" for my taste, but overall, this is how horror movies should be done! I should also add that I'm a big Ted Levine fan, so seeing him do his thing made it all the better.<br/><br/>An excellent piece of work, and this movie may someday be considered a true classic in the horror genre. If you liked High Tension, you'll love this! Go out and rent this movie now- if you're a gorehound, or just a casual horror fan, you won't regret it."

","I'll just start by stating this is a VERY well made film. Good production value, sound, visuals, performances, etc... It's a relentless, thrilling, scary freakin' ride! Don't know what the point of the film is - but does it really matter? This is a horror remake that can truly be labeled ""HORROR"". It offers a true sense of dread. I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it. It wasn't ""fun"". It was, however, horrifying. It seems like movie makers, like video game designers are interested in shock value, pushing the moral envelope, if you will. Since there is so much real terror in the world now, then our entertainment should be that much more, right? Maybe. As long as we, as adults, can decipher what is real and what is fiction... we should be okay, right? Maybe. It's when I buy a theater ticket to The Hills Have Eyes remake, and see a guy, his girlfriend, and their 3 kids (all three clearly UNDER the age of 8) sitting in front of me that makes me sick to my stomach. In my opinion, this movie is a clear case where the MPAA should have rated it with an NC-17. And parents, even if it's only an R rating, do you, your kids, and the rest of the viewing audience a favor, and LEAVE the little ones with a freakin' babysitter."

The atmosphere is what makes this movie great, you'll feel chills and jump at every little thing. The main issue I had was at times, this movie was difficult to watch, particularly one scene. For even liberal viewers I'm sure this movie will cross line at times but you shouldn't let that stop you from watching the movie which is disturbingly beautiful. The music score is perfect. The only reason I'm rating this with an 8 out of 10 is that it was difficult to watch and also the movie relied more on disturbing terror rather than creepiness which is what I expected from the movie.

I didn't think that it was all that scary, maybe a little freaky, but not that scary, but it was very very disturbing. Very bloody, very nasty, very disturbing. But as disturbing and nasty as it was, I expected it to be more disgusting.<br/><br/>I liked the characters, and the dialogue was pretty good, thankfully it wasn't cliché like in most other horror movies. This movie is sorta emotional, it had me feeling for the characters, and cheering for them when they got away or ""beat the bad guy"". Unlike most horror movies (i.e. Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween), it didn't have you cheering for the villain(s). This movie had me hating the mutants and hoping that the protagonist(s) would get their vengeance.<br/><br/>The plot was decent, it wasn't cliché or predictable, there was some plot holes though, and it left some things unanswered. I felt though, that this plot premise is overused, stranded in desert, characters find they're not alone, etc (yes, I know this is a remake but it doesn't matter).<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, and highly recommend it to horror fans, 9 out of 10 for ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006)."

The sense of family relationships are established quickly and essentially to provide the tension and fear of the attacks. Second, the acting isn't ""cheesy"" as it is often the case with b-movies. The generally unknown actors give the movie a sense of realism that high grossing actors couldn't accomplish. The acting is actually quite good. Third, the story is all in all believable and the plot is well drawn out. Fourth the cinematography is excellent, you feel as your almost there. The special effects are top notch and seem very real.

","I do not know how good the replay value of this movie will have yet, since I only watched it in the theater once... But there was a lot to admire about the director's skill in making this film. It really grabs a hold of the audience and those unprepared for what ""true horror suspense"" really is, will leave the theater by the frighteningly despicable ""trailer scene"".<br/><br/>The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is because the ""hero"" character that arises from the family to deal revenge in the 3rd act, is not the character I would have chosen. I probably would have made the son character a touch older and made him the hero... If only because I believe the kid could fire a shotgun sooner than the liberal cell phone salesman. Also, oddly the father and son characters should have handled there firearms with more skill then running and firing at random like idiots. Meanwhile, the cell phone salesman, who never fired a gun before, seems to handle a shotgun with ease by the finale. Minor quibble.. in an otherwise uber-suspenseful and satisfying horror film. <br/><br/>This falls more in the category of the revenge horror flick. Cause I could understand why people leaving at the trailer scene, would be disgusted by the film. You didn't stick around long enough to see the monsters get what they deserve.<br/><br/>One bad review from someone that did leave at the trailer scene kinda baffles me, so I had to quote it here. <br/><br/>LITTLE_WACHO, from Canada says: ""This movie lacks any integrity. Please, don't waste your money or time to go see this movie. You can't even laugh at the crimes being committed. They're not funny or entertaining. They create a feeling of uneasiness in the pit of your stomach. This movie is a waste of money not only for those who see it, but for the idiots who made it. There's a line when it comes to horror films, and they left it way behind them with this film.""<br/><br/>First of all, why would you want to laugh at a rape scene? The director didn't play ""Benny Hill"" music with the family members running back and forth from the rape scene in the trailer to the father being burnt alive outside. He made it hard to stomach and edge of your seat suspenseful for a reason... <br/><br/>That ""uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach""... that's called a good HORROR movie. People that don't like to ride rollercoasters, usually don't like that sinking feeling in there stomachs. Which is fine... The reviewer should just admit they don't like horror films... not bash a well-made one. <br/><br/>Personally, I agree that the ""trailer scene"" is hard to watch... And that makes the revenge on the ""monsters"" by the second half that much more satisfying. It's not a brilliant thought- provoking film people... It's just a well-made horror film."

"nived84","7","0","0","16 May 2006"," The most intense horror film in years
","Yes sire, we have a winner here folks! The Hills Have Eyes is the best horror remake since 2004's Dawn of the Dead, and I doubt you'll see a better horror flick all year long. It's brutal, gory and insanely intense; a really well done, fleshed out nightmare, that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners. The movie is a remake of a Wes Craven film from the 70's about a family driving through the New Mexico desert on a cross country road trip when their truck is wrecked and they are left stranded in the middle of nowhere. Their cell phones are out of range to pick up any signals, and their truck is smashed up beyond any kind of repair. Their options are limited, and none of them are good. As it turns out the part of the desert they happen to be in was once a nuclear testing ground used by the government. A group of miners were ordered to leave their homes and seek refugee from the nuclear fallout, but they didn't leave, and in turn were left deformed, mutated and extremely deranged.<br/><br/>I've always found that the best horror films are the ones that really allow you to care and sympathize with the characters, because being able to put your heart into the characters really is what keeps you on the edge of your seat, and most horror movies do a poor or terrible job at doing that. It's only once you're emotionally invested in the people that you can really root for them and hope that they all make it out alive in the end. If not, then your just watching people who you don't care for getting endlessly slaughtered, and it's not engaging or interesting as a movie going experience. The Hills Have Eyes does manage to do this, and does it quite well. We spend the first twenty or thirty minutes learning about this seemingly average American family on what would seem like a completely normal road trip. I was actually quite surprised at how much time the film burns just allowing us to grow closer to this family before plunging them head first into a hellishly intense nightmare in the middle of nowhere. Once we've become attached to these characters it hurts us to see them in such jeopardy or even killed off, but that's the reality of the film; it's survival of the fittest in the grittiest of ways.<br/><br/>The first scene in which the family is terrorized by the mutants from the hills is quite a tremendously disturbing scene. So much so that I did notice several people get up and walkout, so this movie clearly isn't for everyone. The scene in which two of the mutants torment the women of the family in the trailer is pretty sick, and is made only more horrifying because there's also a little baby, whose life is also in jeopardy. It's a risky scene, very real, but also very risky. Once the sequence is over you're left shocked, repulsed and immediately you hate these mutants, and you can't wait until these guys get it in the end. The mutants in the film are monstrously primitive and relentless, and it helps that they're also cannibals, which puts them over the top on the creepy scale.<br/><br/>You watch this normal average everyday American family being victimized and tormented and then there's the aftermath; what are they gonna do about it? The mutants have killed members of their family (including one of their dogs) and have kidnapped their baby. From this point on the entire film is in straight up smackdown, in-your-face horror splatter mode, with plenty of nasty gore, slow, but gradual building suspense and a wickedly vicious score filled with raging guitars. The remaining members of this poor family aren't just gonna sit back and let themselves be terrorized again; they take action, holding down the fort (which in this case is the family trailer), and go after these freaks, kicking ass and taking names. Heck, even the family's dog kicks a little mutant ass! At that point you'll be screaming ""Hell yeah!"" The Hills Have Eyes is an intense horror film; shocking, horrifying, gory, and unpredictable. It just might be too much for some people, but for hardcore horror fans, THIS is the film you've been waiting for, and it certainly delivers the goods! It's an unapologetic exercise in visceral horror, so raw it just might fry your nerves."

","I'm not the type of person that gets scared by blood, cutting, slashing, ripping movies, but this one had me on the gore side BBAADD!!! I had no idea i would be that terrified. I can't really explain the feeling....they just take it OVER THE EDGE. Way, way, way, way ,way ,waaaaaaaaaaaayyy over. I was very disappointed with the acting though, i mean bobby (Dan Byrd) was waaaayy too brave for his age. I doubt many ppl new in real life know he's 20 years old and Brenda (Emilie De Raven) is 24....but w/e who cares. This movie is the best thing since the old Amityville Horror: The Possession, definitely the most terrifying movie. Any ppl out there that think they don't get scared easily, then u definitely need to check out this Gore flick and test yourself. Overall i didn't really like this movie, i just rated it R of how much it scared the hell outta me. I thought i wont get scared at all when watching this, just enjoy myself....but boy how wrong i was....."

If you like horror movies with scares, good acting, gore and disturbing images, than this will be a good movie for you. If you don't enjoy watching this stuff, than you may not like it. All I can tell you is I am not a big fan of horror movies. My friends insisted that we go to it. I thought it was good, scary and I had a great time at the movies. I enjoyed how eerie the first half hour was. It had a lot of uneasiness to it. Then at the forty minuted mark, the movie turns to a ride through Hell and back. It consist of axe fights. burnings and rape. (The rape scene is not that bad, it was completely over-hyped don't worry, I hate stuff like that and I made it through. Here is the overall review.<br/><br/>*Story= 7/10- Not too original but still really good. *Acting= 10/10- Very nice. *Visuals/Effects= 10/10- The mutants looked so real, and the setting was beautifully crafted. *Scares= 10/10- Really scary and intense. Overall= 9/10 This movie is great, of course it will not win an Academy Award, but as far as horror movies go, this is way up there. Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"OllieZ","7","0","0","30 April 2006"," A Good Remake
","Lately in cinema, I have felt somewhat 'numb' to horror films. Lately there have been a slew of 'Saw' situation horrors, 'Wolf Creek' torture porn and the same old Japanese-remake bullshit.<br/><br/>Now, I thought Saw was pretty good - a tad schlocky and easy to predict, but entertaining nonetheless. Wolf Creek at the cinema was great, yet it loses its power the second time through. The middle section is still intense, but it all seemed too slight in comparison to horror of the 70's. Hostel was a surprise, because no matter how much porno/gore it had, it still actually had a heart, and played out as more of a thriller than anything.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a tough one to call. As a remake it is really similar to the 77 original; whereas the original stopped, the remake carries on for a typically open ended finale.<br/><br/>In terms of pacing, I love films like this. It's as if Aja went to the John Carpenter school of Atmosphere. The director slowly cranks up the tension - a little too slowly perhaps? But never mind, it is enjoyable, and we soon set out the stock characters and boundaries between the family.<br/><br/>The pay off for all that waiting is suitably violent - maybe excessively so (not a bad thing). For 15 minutes, the family are assaulted, the daughter violated by a 'mutant' and a baby is kidnapped. When I saw this in the cinema, it totally grabbed me by the neck - it's a shame it let go soon after.<br/><br/>Aja had a brilliant set up, followed by a very intense 15 minutes of old school violence. The mistake with both this and the original is that the film runs out of steam. Aja had the opportunity to crank up the tension to 11, to utterly thrill us right to the end of the picture. Yes, the audience should be allowed a breather, but there was too much flab between the violent set pieces.<br/><br/>Still, this is a minor problem in an otherwise good film. The remake is better than original, but so it should be after 30-odd years. The build up is great, the acting is solid, the violence is intense and disturbing and the climax is typically cynical.<br/><br/>If I had to choose a horror film of 2005/2006 to watch again...it would probably be Hostel or this. Although Hostel is not half as violent as it would like to be, it still hits all the right spots. The film isn't bogged down by homage; it efficiently works up a solid thriller. The Hills Have Eyes is not as darkly comic as Roth's effort, but I love the atmosphere that is built up here.<br/><br/>So I would give the film 7 out of 10. Perfectly acceptable horror film, but something tells me that it could have been a lot more. Let's hope the horror genre gets out of this Myer of remakes and excessive gorenography and carves a niché of its own, not someone else's."

","Surprisingly, this movie was everything I thought it wouldn't be- pretty good... I actually bought my $10.50 ticket with the mind set of "" This movie is probably going to really suck..."" But it didn't! It was totally better than I had thought it would be!<br/><br/>If you enjoy funny thrillers, this is a movie for you. I'm not quite sure which I did more of: laugh, jump, or "" ewww"". But I know there were plenty of times when I did all three at once! As for the plot, there was not really much to it all. You have your family and their dog going on a road trip, which of course, takes as many turns for the worse as possible. The movie starts off pretty slow, but I'm sure the directors did that so we as the viewers could build a relationship with the family. It actually started off so slow, you actually felt like you were on the boring road trip with the family.<br/><br/>When the movie finally did pick up... Boy did it pick up! The laughther, the jumps, and of course the ""ewwws"". The movie had quite a few corny parts, but they were funny, and actually worked themselves out. As with any horror flick, your jumps were supplied by things moving in the shadows, or a bump outside the door. Now, for the ""ewwws"", the movie was pretty gruesome, which made the movie even better. Also, the strange vengeful characters you will later meet in the movie, are an "" ew "" just by themselves."

","Wow... this is the first horror movie that i've seen in a LONG time that was actually like a really good movie. I'm a big horror movie fan, and this made me realize why. but, unlike most horror films, this movie actually has a SLIGHT chance of actually happening. It was realistic to an extent. they did have to dramatize it by making the deformed people like 100 feet tall. All of the nuclear testing did actually happen, which did cause a lot of deformities, and we didn't treat them well, when actually it was our fault, so you could actually see this happening in a weird way. It was really gory, and pretty nasty, but that's kinda what i expected going into this movie. The one thing that i didn't like was that it pretty much reminded me exactly of Devil's Rejects, which i didn't like. But obviously there was something different about the two because i loved this movie, but i hated Devil's Rejects. They also did kind of drag it on a bit too much. But still. All in all, this movie actually scared me, which is the point of a horror film. And don't listen to all the people that are complaining about all the gore and stuff because i mean come on its a horror film. what do you expect?

","Between 1945 and 1962, the United States conduct 331 atmospheric nuclear tests in the New Mexico desert. Present day, the radio active fallout has deformed and mutated people living in the test area. When a group of scientist are savagely attacked, the Carter family are not far away, travelling by caravan to California. Head of the family, Big Bob, an ex-cop is stubborn, and despises his son in law, Doug who votes democratic and anti-gun lobbyist. Doug's wife Lynn tries to separate them as much as possible, while caring for their baby Catherine. Daughter Brenda rather be at the beach, mother Ethel once a hippie finds solace in religion and son Bobby who's along for the ride. At a decrepit gas station, a nameless attendant tells of a dirt road short cut through the hills. When the tires blow and the car crashes, the family soon find they're not alone.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of Wes Craven's film of the same title. Unfamilar of Wes Craven's version, director Alexandre Aja has created a well crafted and suspenseful horror film. Aja takes time to set the scene and to flesh out the characters. The family dynamic is believable and honest; Bob dislike of Doug, small squibs between the siblings and parents. The emotional investment in the characters is genuine; which a lot of modern day horror films lack, making the experience all the harder to watch.<br/><br/>Aja has also injected a lot of subtext, with the anti-nuclear testing and the governments denial. One point shows one of the mutated villains singing the Star Spangled Banner and honoring the American Flag, even to the knowledge that the 'normal people' made them the way they are. There is also small looks on family dynamics.<br/><br/>As shown from Aja previous film High Tension, Aja is not ashamed to throw the blood and gore around. High Tension had a sense of violence for violence sake; it was really untamed. This time Aja restrains himself; though this is still very graphic and very violent, it has more style and holds more merit to it.<br/><br/>This has some of the best acting in a horror film of late. Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are great as the parents. Emilie de Ravin, Dan Byrd and Vinessa Shaw are also great as the siblings. Really driving the film is Aaron Stanford as Doug. He makes Doug's transformation from weak anti-gun man, to gunslinging, ruthless killer credible.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is one of the best remakes and horror films of late; it's unsettling and an exhausting ride."
"afdiazr","7","0","0","13 April 2006"," Aja tones down for American remake
","Yeah, this film's first 45 minutes are a bore. I think Aja tried to introduce the audience to the characters and the mood of the film the same way some flicks from the seventies (TCM, Dawn of the Dead, the original Hills Have Eyes, I Spit on your Grave) did, but in this case it really drags and feels like an empty attempt. If you loved Aja's Haute Tension, I think you will be expecting the same realistic impact from the violence, but don't be fooled, THHE doesn't feature anything like that. It's gorier, but the tone of the violence is your typical American tone, instead of the European wild-and-insane- as-hell violence present in Haute Tension. So this movie seems more like that a movie. One of the things that really made an impact on the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was the way it was filmed. Like a documentary. Haute Tension had a small dose of that, and it worked, but this one is filmed in such a neat way it feels artificial. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of violence, but I wasn't really moved by it. The miners look good, but not particularly disturbing. If you have seen Chris Cunningham's 'Rubber Johnny', you'll find nothing disturbing about THHE's mutants there's one that resembles Rubber Johnny too much. The death's aren't that violent either. They are pretty repetitive. After everything I read here, I was expecting something with more impact.<br/><br/>You will have fun. But that's as far as it goes."

","Monday, March 13, 2006<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes<br/><br/>Well it is Monday. This weekend was kinda boring! So I wanted to make up for it and go see a movie last night. I have been wanting to see ""The Hills Have Eyes"" ever since I heard about it. Simply because Wes craven hand picked the director Alexandre Aja. He was the writer and director for ""High tension"" if you remember that movie. High tension is also one of my favorite Horror classics. Its gory though really gory! But this is not a High tension post so the point is Wes craven did a good job of picking Aja to re-make his horror classic. Yes The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of Wes Cravens 1977 version. But Aja did an awesome job from beginning to the end with the re-make. If you don't know the story its about a family that gets stuck out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico when their car breaks down. An area originally used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing that was intended to be empty...or so they thought? Well some of the locals refused to leave! When the radiation and everything hit it changed them. And you can pretty much guess the rest. But I went not even knowing you know what The hills have eyes is or anything. Well those motha freakin HILLS have EYES! Because the movie was crazy, sick, wicked, twisted, and well will throw demented in there to. But I recommend anyone that likes horror movies to go see this one. I went with my friend Jeff, Chase, and this girl Natalie which jumped like every 5 minutes of the movie! Its scary and creepy and did I mention GORY! But not as bad as High tension but still bad! Anyway I'm glad I went and saw it, but I don't know if I could handle it again. Like it was a good movie I am glad I saw it but I would not want to experience it again! Too disturbing for p, But I rate it 7.0. Actually I just rented some movies tonight and I'm kicking back cause I fell off my roof trying to get a Hacky Sack. It's a long story! But my shin is messed up. I fell off the roof onto this brick wall type thing and scraped it up real bad. I thought I broke it or shattered it. But ahh blah it's going to be okay. Anyway that is the end of this post blog dawg! L8r!"

THE HILLS HAVE EYES is relentlessly suspenseful and downright scary... horror fans, especially those who are eagerly anticipating Alexandre Aja's work after the amazing High Tension may be slightly let down by this movie, but Aja still delivers, with beautiful cinematography and great performances from the cast, especially Dan Byrd and Emilie De Raven as brother and sister. A close family is terrorized by deranged mutants in the desert? It's a risky plot, especially coming out right after THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and other similar slasher fests... it might actually depend how some people feel about the run-down, been there done that plot to enjoy this film. This was the first movie I actually had to hold onto my seat through, though. I haven't so much fun or been so scared in a while during a horror movie.

","Remakes should generally be avoided like the plague, however AJA'S movie is an exception. Staying faithful to the original but expanding it to greater effect.<br/><br/>A lot of people are upset by the amount of gore and comments such as ""sick and disgusting"" have been bandies around-well don't watch it then. The problem with virtually all cinema released horror over the last ten years is that is has become safe and more consumer friendly so people are scared shitless when somebody makes a truly visceral film. Yes there are scenes that are hard to watch and make you feel uncomfortable, but that's what horror films are- they push the boundaries and your ability to go with it. A film is just that after all-a film, you watch them to confront some part of your psyche knowing that you are relatively safe. If you find mild horror disturbing why watch something like this?-surely you have done your homework via reviews etc before viewing? Away from that i would like to comment on Aaron Stanford's character and his metamorphosis (or catharsis?) from meek pacifist to a crazed killer-surely this is an underlying theme to the film-we are all monsters and ostensibly no better than the mutants themselves!"
"sickleroulette","7","0","0","4 April 2006"," A good, solid horror flick with plenty of guts and gore to spare.
","Without a doubt, solid (albeit gory) entertainment. Most of the films that I've seen were kinda lame. Saw 1 and 2 was okay but none of them had the intensity and blood-soaked carnage as this (with the exception of ""Hostel"" which IS far more sicker and gruesome than THHE). The direction and cinematography is BEAUTIFUL; the arid, endless desert is a wonderful setting for this horror film. My only gripe with this film is that there's very little character development. I wanted to know more about the mutants and their inner workings as well as more interaction. It may slow the film down, but a little more development wouldn't hurt. I would advise parents not to take the younglins along for this one but I was shocked to discover a group of 8 year olds on a field trip watching this film in the theater. I fear the worst for them come bedtime.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a solid gore fest for those with a taste for the gory details. With a little more character development, it would've been more than a horror film. It would also be an instant classic."
"AIRJAC3","9","0","0","3 April 2006"," Finally A Good Remake
","I am actually quite embarrassed to say this but I actually did not want to see this movie at all at the beginning of the year. On another thread here I actually put this film on my ""Have no care to see"" list and boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Anyway, Alexandre Aja has breathed new life into the horror genre of today and I hope he keeps at it. The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of the 1977 Wes Craven film of the same name. In this day of remake central, I had very low expectations for this film, considering I fell victim to the ridiculous hype for the joke of a movie Hostel earlier this year. This film was widely publicized so I thought it would just be another teeny bop movie that wouldn't be that impressive. I was dead wrong.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is so simple that it should be bad, yet it isn't. A vacationing family gets stranded in the middle of the New Mexico desert, where a group of descendants of mutated miners call home. In these deserts fifty years earlier, nuclear testing was conducting and the mining families chose not to leave.<br/><br/>The doomed vacationing family consists of a mother, father, two daughters, a son, the oldest daughter's husband, and their baby girl. The film is very slow at the beginning but we get glimpses of the mutants early in the film.<br/><br/>As nightfall nears, the family decides to split up and search for help. The father goes back to a gas station they passed earlier, the daughter's husband decides to go up ahead for help, and the rest of the family stays with their car and trailer. Thorughout the beginning of the film, however, a mutant girl by the name of Ruby is shown sporting the son's windbreaker but doesn't seem hostile. Cue the cliché dog running away into the hills and what ensues next is a barrage of disturbing encounters with the mutants and brutal murders. In a matter of five minutes, half of the family is killed, one of the daughters is raped, and the baby is kidnapped. The deaths are very gory and done with great skill in detail.<br/><br/>The remaining family members gather their wits together and decide to make a stand. The baby's father goes out to search for her, while the son and youngest daughter stay back at the crash site. The baby's father comes along a mining town that was used for nuclear testing and is the home of the mutant colony. He goes through hell trying to find his baby but he eventually sees Ruby on top of a mountain running with the baby in her hands, trying to save her from a cold-blooded death from one of the other mutants. The baby's father transforms from a white collar punk to Superman and goes on a killing spree trying to rescue his daughter. He eventually meets up with Ruby where she attempts to give the baby back to her father, but not before the last remaining mutant alive attempts to kill them all. Ruby ends up saving the day sacrificing her life for the baby and her father. The end.<br/><br/>From that basic plot this movie may seem kind of dull, but it is not. It is a great story with excellent direction and suspense. Aja knows exactly how to scare people and how to make his antagonists personable and evil. The acting was horrible though, in my opinion. I actually wouldn't have minded if the whole family was wiped out. They were the most annoying group of people I have ever seen on film. I was starting to wonder who was actually the mutants. The mutants seemed to have more brain power than these morons.<br/><br/>I find it funny that the one character that I did identify with was Ruby. For a mutant, she was a cute girl with a heart of gold. She tried to warn the family with acute warning signs, but they just did not understand them. Throughout the movie I was hoping she would live or at least show the family she meant good.<br/><br/>Overall the film was good. The dogs were VERY annoying and so was the youngest daughter. With as many clichés this movie was saturated with and terrible acting it contained, it was not that predictable. The order of deaths was very surprising and I dare anyone to say they were not shocked when each person died at the moment in time they did. The music was awesome in this film and so was the opening credit sequence. I loved how Aja meshed the happy and jolly music with the snapshots of mutated humans. Excellent movie.<br/><br/>*** out of **** <br/><br/>Congratulations Alexandre Aja for making a remake that was good. I guess there is a first for everything."
"Rathko","7","0","0","3 April 2006"," A Superior Remake
","Yes, you heard me, a SUPERIOR remake. The original movie, despite being a Friday Night video classic throughout the eighties, really wasn't a particularly good film. It always seemed like a cheap remake of 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' in the desert, but without the atmosphere, the suspense, or the scares. The remade 'The Hills Have Eyes' manages to be surprisingly faithful to the original in story, while improving on it on almost every level. The characters are more believable, the performances more professional, the narrative is tighter, the suspense more masterfully built. The crazies here actually seem crazy, rather than the lumbering cavemen morons of the original, and the production design, especially when we arrive at the 1950's test village, is excellent.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it's a great movie. It's entertaining and enjoyable, but what you see is what you get and there's nothing beneath the surface that could ever warrant a second viewing. It's nice to see that the recent re-emergence of hard-R horror is restoring a little quality control to a genre that has been descending headlong into creative Armageddon the last few years. These movies, from the 'Texas Chain Saw' remake to 'Hostel' aren't BAD, but they have yet to produce a bona fide classic either. Not sucking is no longer an acceptable objective. Now we want to see something that is actually good."

","Alexandre Aja gives you the goods and waits for your horrified squeals in gleeful delight in this wonderful re-imagined picture inspired by Wes Craven's ""take-no-prisoners"" film from 1977 with Dee Wallace Stone. We have two families. One is of a miner colony who refuses to leave their homeland before a nuclear strike. The results are plain disastrous and terrible, leaving them scarred, deformed, and just plain obsessed on getting anything of their former life back, including violence and stealth. We also have the Carter family which is your typical American ""apple pie"" family which, by the looks of them, function very well together as a unit. After many an introduction, we get down to the core which is survival. A trap is triggered and sends our ""apple pie"" Carters whirling into one hell of a tourist trap. In the middle of the deserts of New Mexico, where no signal from a cell phone can be had, they attempt to make the best of things while sending a few people out for help. The mutated miners, who live on the opposite side of a nearby mine in a landscape of waste, death, and psychosis, savagely harass, abuse, and in several instances kill, rape, and feed off of their abandoned victims, The Carters. Here is where, naturally, everything is out of control and the terror never stops until the credits. You get shock after shock after shock. Whatever you think won't happen usually will and when you think the film has hit its worst moment, there is always something more heinous awaiting you from 'round a corner. This is quite possibly the best horror film I have seen in years as it is straight forward and given that, there is no laughing to be had here, just pure terror and as a horror fan, I can't be scared about that."
"Mr_Blonde3","Null","0","0","2 April 2006"," An enjoyable film
","*spoilers included* I watched this film last night and was highly impressed. Having not seen the remake, I got to go into it with an unbiased view (Usually I hate remakes) The plot involves the Carter family, on their way to California. Big Bob (Ted Levine) likes to take the long way round, and when they stop at a gas station in the middle if the desert, they get more than they bargained for. The attendant, who seems to have something going with whomever or whatever is out there in the hills, becomes suspicious of them and sends them into the lion's den. Their tires are blown out by whomever is out there, and they are forced into an accident. Then the horror begins.<br/><br/>The film is well cast. Veteran character actor Ted Levine makes for a great Big Bob Carter. He has the look and feel of a retired detective, and I enjoyed every moment he was on screen. Kathleen Quinlan is also excellent as Bob's wife and mother of the kids. Aaron Stanford is great as the fish-out-of-water husband of Bob's daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) both have tender moments and are quite convincing as a married couple. It's fun to watch Stanford's Doug become more and more heroic as the film progresses (Think Brody in ""Jaws"") Dan Byrd and Emilie De Raven are also standouts as the younger generation of Big Bob's clan. They have that brother-sister ""I hate you"" relationship down pat, and it's great to watch them bond together as the horrors continue.<br/><br/>Not too many of the mutants are huge standouts, as they don't get a lot of screen time, but Billy Drago is nicely diabolical as Jupiter, as is Robert Joy as Lizard. You're rooting for them to get their comeupance.<br/><br/>There were a few moments of ""Why is that character doing that?!"" I had the row in front of me in hysterics when I muttered aloud at one point in the film (You'll know which one when you see it) to Ted Levine's character, ""Stop wasting your bullets!"" They agreed.<br/><br/>Thankfully, they're not frequent, and they don't ruin the film. Every horror film has these moments, there's just no getting away from it. And I figured that Ted Levine would not make it to the final credits when he was given special billing at the beginning of the film. Usually when a name actor gets special billing in a horror film, no good can come of it.<br/><br/>I knew when I watched the opening credits roll and saw that the make-up effects were done by Greg Nicotero that I was in for a special treat. I wasn't disappointed. The mutant make up is extremely well-done, as are the gore effects. (Including chopped fingers, and a life-sized burning mock-up of one of the stars.) A great work by Director Alexandre Aja. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of his work in the future. I was impressed and entertained."

","Alexandre Aja's ""High Tension"" was a tense, heavily atmospheric horror film that, despite a completely unnecessary and improbable ending, announced him as bold new stylist in terror cinema. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" solidifies him as a major talent, and provides one of the best, gut-wrenching, fingers-digging-into-knee horror films of the decade thus far. Rob Zombie accomplished a similar feat last year with the mesmerizing ""Devil's Rejects"". Both films revolve around families of freakish killers, though their points of view couldn't be more different.<br/><br/>""Hills"" gives us the all American family road trip and the subsequent (and convenient) horror movie convention of a car breakdown in the middle of nowhere. But oh, what a glorious nowhere it is! The hills in this movie really do have a life of their own - rolling desert dunes punctuated by huge chasms and valleys, all drenched in toasted sand and lashing wind. The movie accomplishes a rare thing: making the usually safe haven of daytime even more nightmarish than the night. Never mind the lame script or transparent characterizations. This is a movie about monsters and the innocents they draw into their web. A visceral sucker-punch of a film.

My point is; I respect that you didn't stomach this movie, but instead of whining about the low moral fiber you should pay it respect for being the TRUE HORROR-MOVIE IT IS! After the scene aforementioned, the plot takes a little turn, and becomes a survival/revenge movie. Revenge is always a good foundation for some good old splattin', and that is also what we get served the second half of the movie. Still, though splattin'is fun, the final stages of the movie also had suspense. Conclusion; this is an ugly, stinking, putrid movie, but as a horror flick it works extraordinarily effectively."
"MovieManMenzel","7","0","0","1 April 2006"," Alexandre Aja's remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a decent horror flick however it is no where as good as his previous film ""High Tension""
","""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a remake of the 1977 classic horror film with the same title. The movie focuses on an American family who is traveling across country to San Diego. Along the way, they stop for gas in a town which looks like it is deserted. The gas station attendant (Tom Bower) tells the family that there is a shortcut to San Diego through the hills. And because this is a horror movie, the family listens to the gas attendant's advice and follows the shortcut only to find out that it's a trap. The family is now stranded in the hills of some unknown desert in New Mexico only to find a group of deformed miners who were victims of nuclear testing seeking their revenge on humanity. Lots of blood and violence ensue <br/><br/>First things first, how come almost every time I go to see a horror movie in the theater I have to deal with idiotic people who either talk through the entire film or bring little kids to the film? In my case I was lucky to experience both in one place. So note to parents, leave the kids at home, this type of movie is not appropriate for your kids. And secondly for those who want to give their social commentary during the film please wait until it's over or go outside the theater to do so. Thank you. Anyway despite my frustration by this I was still able to sit back and enjoy majority of the film.<br/><br/>I personally didn't find ""The Hills has Eyes"" a great movie by any means but I think it was a decent horror movie especially for a genre that usually produces very bad movies. After seeing director Alexandre Aja's last film, ""High Tension"" which I really enjoyed, I was very excited about seeing ""The Hills have Eyes"" but sadly after seeing it I do not feel it lived up to all the internet hype surrounding it.<br/><br/>The main problem is that the movie's plot is very similar to majority of horror movies. A family gets stranded in a desert which no one else knows about. Something bad happens and more bad things happen as the film goes on. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" however does a great job of building suspense and you are pretty much at the edge of your seat during the entire film. The movie also contains some of the most violent and gruesome scenes I have seen in a horror film which seems to be Aja's trademark for horror films. Both of his movies have a lot of violence, a lot of blood, and a lot of gruesome images.<br/><br/>The one main problem I had with the film was character development. Yes, I know it's a horror movie and not a drama but I do still expect a little. This movie does very little to provide character development. In fact, I felt like I could careless about most of the characters. The only characters you felt bad for was the baby and the little sister Brenda (Emilie de Ravin). And you only felt bad for Brenda because of what happens to her later in the film because something happens to her that no one should ever have to experience. Other than that the characters just seem so typical and lame that you really don't care about any of them.<br/><br/>Also the film gets a little too much near the end; the violence goes a little over the top and the invisible character (you know the guy or girl who keeps getting stabbed, shot or killed but keeps coming back to life) becomes a little too clichéd. And when the film ended I literally laughed because I found the ending to be so ridiculously typical and clichéd that I couldn't do anything but laugh at it. The acting at times as well is a little weak but then again this is a horror film and even ones I have really enjoyed never have that good of acting. I wonder why horror movies can never have really decent acting. I don't understand this but hey it's the genre is so I can really blame Aja for that.<br/><br/>In the end ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a decent horror movie, it's not the best film in the genre but it is certainly not the worst. The director, Mr. Aja definitely has a skill for creating very violent and gory films. I just hope the next time he directs a film he can add a little more substance and thought to it like he did with ""High Tension."" Overall I can't say I didn't enjoy myself watching this film, it was very suspenseful and had a lot of action. It is definitely a must see for those who are a fan of the horror genre.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a 7/10. Please for the love god if you are going to see this movie don't bring any kids under the age of 12 with you. It's really not appropriate at all for them."

","The Hills have eyes is one of the best horror movies of the last three or four years. Unlike several recent horror movies, (Land of the Dead, for one)it was not gory for the sake of gore. The characters were deep and moving, and unlike most horror movie characters, they were smart and determined. Doug's rampage through the town was the most incredible scene I've seen in any movie for some time. The acting in this movie was superb, the story was wonderful, and the scares were genuine. Wes Craven, producer (and writer of the original The Hills Have Eyes,in 1977) displays why he is considered by many the ultimate master of terror. Four out of Five Stars."

","I just got back from watching this film. I thought it was a pretty decent horror/thriller. It had plenty of ""make you jump"" moments. It was a little on the gory side; more of the violent ""axe to the head"" kind than the ""zombie eating guts"" kind (though there was a little of that!).<br/><br/>It's not a happy film. Bad things happen to the good guys unnecessarily and in a way that is a little upsetting. If the stupid kid had just told his family about the dog maybe they would have been prepared. But I think that makes this movie less formulaic. I give a B, which to me equals 7 out of 10."
"RobertF87","6","0","0","1 April 2006"," Good Remake
","The original ""Hills Have Eyes"" (1977) is often fondly remembered as a gruesome and disturbing film, when it actually isn't really. It was actually passed in Britain with comparatively few cuts for the time, and for a lot of British viewers was, for a long time, the only really 'horrific' horror movie available, however Alexandre Aja's remake makes up for that by including all the buckets of blood that audiences might have missed form the original.<br/><br/>Sticking closely to the original storyline of an all-American family stranded in the desert and being attacked by depraved cannibal mutants, created from nuclear bomb testing decades earlier, the film nevertheless is far more intense than the original. Although it does suffer from the glossy look common to most modern horror films, instead of the bleak, rough low-budget appearance of the original.<br/><br/>Another change is the added emphasis on the background of the attackers, which does add something of another dimension to the film, making them slightly more sympathetic.<br/><br/>Worth watching for horror fans, and a must-see for fans of the original. This is a decent horror film, but ultimately nothing special.<br/><br/>Contians swearing and graphic violence."

","The Hills Have Eyes is the first horror film to come out in the past 2 years that managed to make me uncomfortable and do I dare say...afraid?I am a fan of the original but I always knew someone could of done it better. And Alexandre Aja did it...he is one of the few saviors in the horror genre today. Not giving us pieces waste such as the many other horror films out today...he gives horror fans what they want to view. And for that he deserves to make it big. <br/><br/>The characters were simple people...not to say that is bad at all. I found the dialog between the family members to be quite on par with real life. Especially the brother sister dialog and bickering. Everyone played their part perfectly and the film is successful because of that. When the ones who die actually die on screen...I found myself being disturbed by their deaths. That hasn't happened to me in a long ass time. Kudos to Aja. <br/><br/>Spoilers: The mid attack scene in the trailer was WELL DONE! Never have I been so uncomfortable by what I was seeing. Especially the death of the sister Lynne who gets shot in the head...totally disturbing if you ask me. Not to say what happens up until that is not disturbing. Don't worry it is! <br/><br/>The music of the film was was pretty damn good. Except the cheesy victory music played when the good guys won...totally corny and out of place if you ask me. But the music used for the tension scenes were totally on the ball. That banging or whatever it was really set off an emotion of pure dread. It was simple but very effective.<br/><br/>Alexandre'a directing was well done. The film had wonderful attack scenes that were perfectly paced. The film looked great. Such a disgusting atmosphere makes a wonderful horror film if you ask me. I really hope this guy stays around because he seems to be the one who will continue to impress with horror. It's been awhile since we've had someone like that. And I for one am excited as hell!<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is a great watch. It's disturbing,scary,and full of intense tension. Do yourself a favor if you're a horror fan...go out and see this before it's too late to watch on the big screen. The film deserves it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"gjung01","7","0","0","29 March 2006"," Worthy Remake
","Having seen the original ""Hills Have Eyes"" and was bowled over by Alexander Aja's ""Haute Tension,"" I anticipated his take on this recent remake of a well know horror film. I have to say that Aja stayed true to the original but then built upon that further and made some improvements that worked. The effects were impressive, most notably, the mutant make up effects and the acting was better especially with the characters of Bobby and the son-in-law. The infamous trailer attack scene is much more brutal and shocking than the original. The only problem I had with the film was that it dragged in places much like the original had and the characters are never really sympathetic but rather a bunch of boorish, whiny people (with the exception of the older daughter and the dogs). Having watched the original, I knew who was going to die and I think this took away from the intensity but Aja did a wonderful job at recreating and updating the film for today's audiences."

Id have to say it was without doubt more gruesome than scary. Some of the scenes in the film were extremely shocking and horrific it was almost upsetting and one of the scenes was even a bit of a tear jerker. I thought the story line was excellent as I don't think I've ever seen a scary film quite like it, but I didn't realise this was a remake.

I found that it was lacking in jump scenes, only one scene really made me jump back, but it made up for it with not holding back anything, showing every gruesome detail and the special effects were amazing. I'm kind of sorry I didn't see the original before seeing this, I usually try to see where the movies are coming from either by watching the originals or reading the books, but all of that aside I give this movie two thumbs up for one of the best horrors so far in 2006.

","First of all lets start out with all these people who are writing comments and people writing reviews about how GORY and Visceral this movie is! Well it's not that gory, so apparently these people did not see Hostel which I thought was a far more gut wrenching and visually scary film. This film had it's moments but if you have seen the original it kind of takes away from this movie. I left the theater feeling a little uninspired. I know I know it's a remake but the plot followed so closely that it seemed to take away the shock value of the special gore effects. The gore was good when it was there but still was not what I was expecting. Out of the 3 recent horror movies that I have seen at the theater I would have to rank them: 1. Hostel 2. Final destination 3 3. Hills have eyes as far as the gore factor, don't get me wrong the acting and story line in this movie is far superior to FD3 but FD3 had more astounding kill scenes! Overall you won't be disappointed with Aja's effort here but it is lacking something."

","The Joe Cool Review: The Hills Have Eyes(2006) <br/><br/>Starring: Aaron Stanford as Doug Bukowski, Kathleen Quinlan as Ethel Carter, Vinessa Shaw as Lynne Bukowski, Emilie de Ravin as Brenda Carter, Dan Byrd as Bobby Carter, and Ted Levine as Bob Carter <br/><br/>Plot: A family on their way to California is taken down the wrong road and is stalked and killed off by a group of inbred mutant cannibals, altered by nuclear testing years before. Who will survive? <br/><br/>Openers: Wow. You know I knew going in that there was no way that this movie could be worse than the original, and it actually looked good. And it was! Was no surprise though somewhat as Alexandre Aja did a great job with Haute Tension and I expected more of the same. Since this is a remake, I should go ahead and announce any changes, without spoiling the movie of course. The cannibals are mutants now, thanks to nuclear testing. The events in this one are pretty much the same as the original, only with some pretty cool twists added(like the testing village and the auto graveyard) to spice things up a bit.<br/><br/>The Good: The script and acting are worlds better than it's predecessor. First of all we are graced with the presence of Ted Levine, who plays Big Bob. He's awesome in everything I've seen him in, whether it be Silence of the Lambs, the creepy trucker voice in Joy Ride or even Monk. He's pretty good here too, and I liked his character. His constant shots at his son-in-law Doug are funny. The rest of the cast does well too, for the most part. Aaron Stanford does a much better job as Doug than the guy in the previous movie, as he doesn't OVERACT. This movie also features it's fair share of gore and genuinely creepy moments that make you squirm. The make-up effects used to create the mutants(especially Big Brain) are nothing short of spectacular. You can tell a lot of work went into it and it pays off. Some of the mutants are just disgusting, which is how they should be. It takes the creepy factor to a new level.<br/><br/>The Bad: This movie isn't perfect. Still going with the previous story, the family is still not that bright. They still listen to the creepy old guy in an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and they go down that road. They still split up and make some stupid decisions. And they still act calm around signs that should be disturbing(again, the auto graveyard!) and make them want to get out of there as soon as possible. Emilie de Ravin and Dan Byrd were annoying as the kids. Especially Dan Byrd. We also get a somewhat abrupt ending this time as well, although with a little more closure.<br/><br/>The Ugly: There's a really disturbing scene in the movie that involves the mutants forcing themselves onto two women that made me and from what I saw everyone in the audience pretty uncomfortable. It helps to establish the gritty tone of this movie but regardless, it belongs in this category.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Not only does this do better than the original, but it's pretty good in it's own right. It didn't pull any punches and therefore it became true horror, which is what horror is supposed to be. Horror is supposed to make you scared and uncomfortable. And this does that effectively.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 of *****"

","This film is a basic retelling of a 70's classic. It begins with a radiation team in the hills of the southwest taking reading at a nuclear test site. A man stumbles out of the hills crying for help, but alas, an unseen behemoth lumbers out and savagely kills everyone brutally with a pickax. Jump to a restored RV. Big Bob is taking his two daughters, son, granddaughter, wife and unliked son-in-law to California in his prized restored camper. They stop at the only gas station along a long desert strip and are told of a short cut through the Hills which will chop three hours off their drive. Hint: whenever a creepy looking gas station attendant offers advice, help, suggestions always refuse. If movies like House of Wax and Wrong Turn have taught us nothing else, it's that lonely gas station attendants are in cahoots with inbred, deranged sociopaths. But these people ignore all that, and decide to take the shortcut, fortunately they have two German Shepard's with them. And what do you know, they have cut names, beauty and beast. Shortly along the ""shortcut"", they blow out their tires and wreck their truck. A strings of tirejaks like the ones cops use, are the culprits, but they don't notice. Beauty is spooked by something and takes off into the hills. She isn't seen again (at least not alive.....muwahahahahahaha!) This is where I have a problem, this dog is such a pussy because it's name is Beauty, and beast turns out to be a real bad-ass, because it's name is beast. Get the allegory? It's two sides of an animals persona. Good and gentle until you F*!K with them, then they get medieval. This is also played upon the characters as well. Like the dumb wimpy son-in-law. He purposefully abstains from taking a gun when he goes for help, but when the sh@t hits the fan and the inbreds attack, he turns into a Bruce Campbell wannabe. Using every imaginable weapon at hand to combat the hill people. Not really believable, then again neither is a band of miners who survive a direct hit by a nuclear test bomb in the Nevada desert to gain superhuman powers and become modern day cannibals. This is where the movie went south for me. I mean some of the improvisation is creative and something I'd do if in a similar situation, IE.blowing a guy up with a gasoline loaded camper, but other stuff was truly ridiculous. Surviving an attack by a seven foot tall, axe wielding monster. Especially after having a couple fingers lopped off. They go so far as to rip off a crucial scene from True Romance. Think James Gandalfini and Patricia Arquette. So basically watch the original, and skip the remake."

This new film captures a new sense of horror that moviegoers today find more entertaining than the classic spooks. Not leaving any details of mutilation out, The Hills Have Eyes is hard on the eyes, but keeps the audience entertained throughout. I must admit that the film is definitely a little corny and the way the mutants look is sure to make someone laugh but the new ""trailer"" scene is bound to leave no smile on anyone's face. I was so impressed by this scene that I really feel that this could be one of the better horror films this year just due to that one particular scene. I must warn audiences though that the scene is extremely brutal as the director Alexandre Aja doesn't hesitate to leave anything out for imagination. Overall, this was a mediocre horror film but is surprisingly entertaining from beginning to end, making it an above average film and deserving of a recommendation.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

The instant gore of a man swinging a pick axe through the back of some sort of scientist is just the start, the pick axe makes plenty of other appearances throughout the film. The story of how the people become stranded in the desert is the same as all other horror flicks, they mutants have a friend who agrees to bring them food if they'll bring him the victims' merchandise. There are some disturbing scenes in the film though that were almost too real at one point, mainly when the mutants first turn up at the caravan, enter huge amounts of disgust as we see people burning at the stake, shootings to the head, breast feeding(not to the baby, sick.) and other disgusting shows from the villains. I was glad that the film didn't result in the same fashion as wrong turn and other recent horror films where the attackers cannot, will not be killed.

","Horror movies are in. Big time. They're cheap to make, easy to sell, and almost always make money. Ever since splatter flicks like Saw and the remade Texas Chainsaw Massacre started cutting the movie mustard, Hollywood has been pumping out horror films like water from a sinking dinghy. Yet behind all the flair of Tinseltown's latest line of manufactured monster movies, the audience is left with something to be desired: a horror movie that actually scares.<br/><br/>Well, look no further. The Hills Have Eyes, a well-acted, well-directed new slash-and-smash is the film horror fans have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Hills begins with a team of sweaty government workers in a desolate New Mexican desert. They are testing for radiation when they are attacked by two hideous men who smash the workers' heads against rocks until they are dead. <br/><br/>Then begins the most disturbing opening credits sequence since the movie Se7en, where a collage of horrific footage and photographs is shown like a View-Master from hell, featuring human deformities supposedly caused by nuclear fallout. The film claims that radiation from government A-bomb testing in the southwestern United States caused these deformities as well as the deformities of the villains in the film.<br/><br/>The audience is then introduced to the Carters, an all-American suburban family en route to San Diego for vacation. Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo 13) plays Ethel Carter, mother of Lynne (Vinessa Shaw, Melinda and Melinda), Brenda (Lost's Emilie de Ravin) and Bobby (Dan Byrd, A Cinderella Story). Lynne's husband Doug (Aaron Stanford, X2) is a glasses-wearing cellphone salesman who at first seems more affixed to his gadgets than their baby-daughter Catherine.<br/><br/>Ted Levine (Memoirs of a Geisha) plays ex-cop/pater familias Big Bob Carter, who learns from a seemingly good-natured, toothless old gas station attendant that a shortcut through the hills exists which could shave hours off the family's venture. What Big Bob doesn't expect is the spike strip laid out a few miles down that shortcut, which causes the tires to blow and the axle to snap in half. He also doesn't anticipate the onslaught of hungry and grossly deformed cannibals come nightfall.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Bob Bob's nuclear family is no match for the microwaved mutants from the hills. By the end of the first night, half the family is killed, poor Brenda is molested and raped by a man who closely resembles Sloth from The Goonies, and baby Catherine has a gun pointed at her before she is kidnapped. What follows is an hour of non-stop butt-kicking, ax-swinging, blood-gushing action. The surviving family members take up arms and wage an unholy war against the hill people.<br/><br/>Director Alexandre Aja's update of the gritty 1977 Wes Craven film of the same name is a slaughterhouse of a flick. It boils to the brim of decency with maiming, dismemberment and decapitation. In one scene, a man blows his head through the roof of an outhouse with a shotgun, leaving nothing but a bloody stump. Soon after that, another man is burned alive like a witch on a stake while his family helplessly watches. But, shocking violence aside, the film is frightfully entertaining.<br/><br/>For once, there are some scares in this movie that actually do scare. One scene in particular has one of the most terrifying jumpers since 1999's The Sixth Sense, and another scene, featuring a character aptly named ""Big Brain,"" is a nightmare waiting to happen.<br/><br/>Special effects fans will appreciate the gore galore served up fresh from special effects wizards Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero of K.N.B. EFX Group Inc., Hollywood's premiere gore-makers who have provided stomach-turning effects for films like Hostel and Kill Bill. <br/><br/>Aja, who's High Tension was an international hit last summer, is the Wes Craven of this generation. He directs with the skills of a master, achieving a combination of fine acting, great suspense and some jump-inducing scares.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hills Have Eyes is the fright-flick many have been waiting for. It delivers goretastic goods like a freight train driven by Jeffrey Dahmer. For moviegoers looking for some toxic terror, see this movie."

","I love the original film. Michael Berryman was a scary guy and he to me is Hills Have Eyes. hen i heard they were doing a new one i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema. It was a slow start, too many scenes of the desert and the mines. Also too much on the nuclear testing years before, i don't' recall much on that in the original but i suppose all re makes change a few bits of the film. The Cannabals weren't quite as scary and a bit shocking to see the young children towards the end of the film. What happened to them? The rape scene isn't as bad as some have said and has kept to the original script again. What started as a slow film got really gory and quite jumpy. A few bits were a bit unbelievable, the Hero Dad rescuing his daughter after so many beatings...even though he had been portrayed as a bit of a wimp. I love horror films and love to be scared but too many films use killings/violence as a a way to scare you, to me the unknown and the not knowing what is going to happen next is scarier. All in all for someone who hasn't seen the first one then they will probably enjoy it but i would suggest watching the first one too. Glad Wes Cravern was involved in this film again."

","Oh great. Another remake. Has Hollywood just simply given up on the fact that films will never be able to be original ever again? Or is there some kind of conspiracy or alliance with former filmmakers and Hollywood? Either way, we have another one right here, although Wes Craven seems to be more involved with this film than other directors that are having their films redone. He serves as the executive producer and was very involved in casting the actors. During the 1950's, the Neveada deserts were ground zero for nuclear testing. Everyone that lived in the dessert was forced to evacuate the area and find a new home, but the stubbornness of a small family refused to go and stayed put in the dessert mines while they become infected and mutated by the radiation poisoning in the air. Several years later, a family that is road tripping across the nation to get to San Diego, who's father rather see the dessert landscape, takes a shortcut through the dessert suggested by the owner of a small gas station in, you guessed it, the middle of nowhere. The families jeep and camper are sabotaged along the way, in which the jeep is totally demolished. Finally half way through the film when you realize that this is a horror film and not a family film, the family is soon being viciously attacked by these abnormally disfigured humans attacking anyone that ventures down their road and use human flesh as a source of food. It definitely puts a negative side on those who are less fortunate in their appearance, but evens out when a little girl of the mutated family shows concern for the baby that was kidnap and does everything she can to return the baby to the rightful owner. I love the fact that French director Alexander Ajae(High Tension) directs the film because it seems as though he was trying to poke fun of the classic American Western films by putting western music behind the hero of the film. There is also a hint that the film was showing the inhuman look of nuclear testing and the wrongs of testing in the Neveada dessert, having hearing a long speech by a helpless mutates human in a wheel chair, blaming everything on the American government. Slowly but surely the film gets it's point across, but by the time it does, I didn't really care. The gore scenes were very intense, supported by a long rape scene, and if you have seen High Tension, it's very similar. But the film didn't leave me with anything but to stay on the same road and not take any shortcuts in which will only lead to ones death."

","Just seen this today and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The original was a classic I saw in the late 70's. This was the same story but with more in your face violence and gore. The violence is thick and fast after 30 Min's or so as the family is terrorised. In fact 2 people walked out of the early morning showing I was watching after 45 Min's as they could'nt stomach it. The acting was also good and even though I knew the plot, the tension had me on the edge of my seat. After Haute Tension, Saw, TCSM and Dawn of the Dead remakes this is a great addition to the genre. Looking forward to the Omen remake and Hostel, this is a great time to enjoy horror films and make sure you don't miss this one!!!"
"cpbadgeman","9","0","0","13 March 2006"," Right-on remake of an underground splatter classic
","I absolutely loved this remake of Wes Craven's gruesome 1977 original. The plot is very simple: a blandly average suburban family are stalked and besieged in the New Mexico desert by a clan of cannibals mutated due to radiation from A-bomb testing. Director Alexandre Aja very effectively builds the tension in the first half of the movie and then, with the skill of a surgeon, unleashes an avalanche of violence and brutality all the way until the closing credits. People aren't killed in this film, they are slaughtered. If you understand what I mean by this comment, then you'll likely enjoy this gore-soaked gem.<br/><br/>Unusually for a horror movie, much of the action takes place in daylight. However this actually raises the suspense as it highlights both the desolation of the film's setting, and the primal nature of the struggle between the protagonists. The minimalist soundtrack is also strikingly effective. In short this is a vicious, first-class gut movie that attacks it's audience over and over again. An absolute must-see."

","This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and is refreshing after some movies like When a Stranger Calls. Aja has a promising career ahead of him he make gross gore look sleek and interesting other than vomit in the aisle. Some key scenes really got to me and stayed in my mind long after the credits rolled. It stayed simple and didn't try to delve deep into the back story of the mutants. It made you jump and really get invested in the characters, horror films rarely do that. This definitely one of the better horror flicks you'll see in a while. The end may get a little unbelievable but it still gets you looking up at the screen in awe It mostly appears to the horror fan but if you can stomach it a would recommend to the nervous.

"RHPSvegas","6","0","0","13 March 2006"," The original will always be the best
","I definitely prefer the original, not to say that this one isn't alright. I felt, however, it was intentionally OVERTLY gory. I've seen many horror films and handled quite a bit of on-screen violence, but this left me dazed and feeling a bit sick. The original implied a lot, which made it atmospheric - this one outright showed it. The opening credits are jarring, with clips of deformed bodies in jars. That was one thing I didn't like: the way that this movie over-did the nuclear testing aspect. In the original, it was implied that the fall-out from the test range affected the family (Papa Jupiter is the son of the gas station attendant who buried a crowbar into his face and left him in the desert when he killed his mother; Jupiter in turn found a hooker and started a family on the Nellis Airforce Test Range in the Mojave desert in Nevada). In the original, Doug does say that he found abandoned houses in a crater, but they actually show it in this film. There are more ""mutants"" in this one (there's a guy with a severely swollen head in a wheelchair, children, an obese woman in a house, etc) that are unexplained and were not in the original. I do not like what was done with Ruby, because she actually has a character in the original, she speaks and proves that she is not savage like her family (thank you Janus Blythe!). Giving Doug the same hair and mustache was an interesting touch, and overall the Carter family had the same sort of ""feel"" and general look as the original. I don't like how Bobby was turned into a kid as opposed to a wise teenager. There was no need to change the character of Mars to ""Lizard."" Pluto looked like a rehash of Sloth from The Goonies (Michael Berryman will ALWAYS be Pluto). I would suggest anyone who liked this seek out the original and see how it was meant to be."

","The Hills have eyes..another potential cult classic from Wes Craven.<br/><br/>The most striking feature of all to me is it seems to be a comment on the politics of the USA rather than a straight forward slasher flick.<br/><br/>The main protagonist, Doug is a democrat and general Left wing looker. He sticks out like a sore thumb with the overtly traditional structure of the Carter family. Many references are made to manliness by the patriarchal figure. In the plot there are many clues given to the director's political opinions. Sutble references are given in the use of guns, dope smoking and the backdrop to the nuclear victims homes. In the opening scenes a mismatch of imagery is presented perhaps suggestive criticism of politics of the past.<br/><br/>I am trying very hard not to give plot details away but there is a sense of unending in the final scene. However a conclusion is drawn to the politics of the under plot. The final scene suggests an optimism in youth of today and the freedom of choice when it comes to defining what a family is.<br/><br/>But thats all politics!The film deserves much credit for the unbelievable camera angles. They really create a sense of creeping up, dread is approaching. The scenery itself is breath taking, remote and desolate.<br/><br/>go see!"

","A mix between ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a nail-biting, grab the person next to you thriller. Of course there is the gore, but it all plays in nicely to give you a worth while moving going experience. One of the better, if not the best, horror movie I have seen in a long while. This movie is based on the notion that during nuclear testing in the North American desert, miners in towns in the area refused to leave their homes and retreated to the mines where they worked. Over time, the nuclear fallout caused severe physical and mental defects in the people exposed to the radiation as well as the off-spring of those inhabitants. These sites were so far of the map that they were forgotten. Set up as a ruthless cat and mouse game, any travelers who accidentally made it to this nuclear wasteland were condemned in a place where ""the lucky ones die first!"""

","The Carters, an all American family, decide to take a family vacation across the desert. Instead of fun in the sun the Carters, including the rather out-cast son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford), will face something beyond their wildest nightmares in the hills of New Mexico.<br/><br/>After coming across a lone gas station run by a eccentric (Tom Bower), the Carter patriarch 'Big Bob' (Ted Levine) decide to take the advice of traveling on a road that isn't listed on the map. In doing so, he drives his family across into the off limit areas run by the Department of Energy where, in the sixties, nuclear tests took place. It is in these empty hills where the Carter family will experience the wrath of those who suffered from such tests and have little compassion on outsiders for whom the blame for their current state. <br/><br/>Only after the first series of attacks on the Carter family, and the eventual mutilation of several of the members, that we discover what the truth is. Miners, who refused to be driven away from their homes before the tests, hid in their mines while the tests were enacted upon their land. The result was a generation of physical and mental scarred beings who now murder and pillage any who come across their hills. Of course, they do this in league with the eccentric who owns the gas station who makes a good profit off the valuables they drop off for him.<br/><br/>Only the tenacity of Doug, the courage Bobby Carter (Dan Byrd), and even sole remaining family dog, keep what is left of the Carter family alive. Through deceptions, and brutal hand to hand combat, what remains of the family finds vengeance against the group of mutants and survives another day.<br/><br/>But perhaps only 'another day'. For it becomes clear that they are still being watched even after their nightmare ends...<br/><br/>What makes The Hills Have Eyes so good is that it is an old fashioned horror movie with no strings attached. No political agenda, no advanced amounts of CGI, no big budget thrills. It runs only on suspense, acting, good make up, and the ability of the director to tell a good story. And that, especially in horror movies, is hard to do. It is violent, bloody, and even graphic at times. But it is a good movie that never lets down. <br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This movie has the potential to be a fantastic horror film. The basic story line is very original (not counting the old version) and the violence comes in truck loads. It's been a while since I've seen a movie with this amount of gore that didn't look like a cartoon. I am a gore freak, so that's the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place. When Doug axes the weirdo in the wheelchair guy's house, I almost clapped, it was so good. This is not a movie where all the gore is computer animated. <br/><br/>The only real problem I had with this movie is the stupidity of the characters. It's like they put every single horror movie stereotype and crammed them in to one movie with times 50 gore. Doug is beating the crap out of Lizard with a gun. No, he's not shooting him, he's just beating him with it. Then, Doug drops the gun right next to the guy thinking he's dead and walks away. Obviously, Lizard takes the gun! That scene is in about every horror movie known to man, but Aja still has to put the scene in to follow the crowd. I know characters in horror films are supposed to be somewhat dumb, but this movie is almost too much. Aja found every single random thing he could put in the film without losing the actual plot and threw it in the movie. Honestly, film makers need to make some new stereotypes to put into films, so audiences wont know what's going to happen every single step of the way. <br/><br/>Other than that, though, great movie for twisted, strange people such as me."

I can't remember the original real well, but this movie was much better than some of the more recent horror films. I was way better than The Fog, and much better than Cursed, another Wes Craven film.<br/><br/>The most surprising part about this movie was the acting. I actually felt sympathy for all the members of the family, and was glad to see them fight back against the mutants. I've actually grown sick of movies where the characters are simply put in a film only to be hacked to bits. However there are deaths of course, but I will not give any of that information away.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Alexander Aja's camera work in this film. I enjoyed the various angles he employed to make the film more disturbing. The movie also had a gritty quality about it, which only added to the films overall creepiness. In fact it kind of reminded me of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Hitcher. I never saw the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre though.<br/><br/>The plot of course is simple. A family is crossing the New Mexico desert on vacation and stops at a gas station where they get directions on how to get to California. The weird gas station attendant at first gives them the safe direction to go, but changes his mind when he discovers that maybe one of the members of the family has learn his little secret. We already know what that secret is when we are first introduced to this strange person. They follow the shortcut he gives them and mayhem en shews from there as they become stranded in the middle of nowhere. The vacationing family soon discovers that they are not alone and are being stalked by a murderous mutated family that lives in the hills surrounding them.<br/><br/>Very effective film with many gruesome scenes, Hills Have Eyes is definitely a movie that horror movie buffs should enjoy. Its starts with some very violent scenes and then builds from there into one of the better horror movies to come around in a long while. It also gives us a back story about the mutated family which deals with the nuclear bomb testing that went on around the area and how the bomb testing is what caused the mutations, making them what they are today."

Aja, who has followed up his excellent horror film High Tension (albeit with a debatable bad ending) and improved upon the lifeless original in about every way possible. This film combines great elements of funny cheese, good acting, great makeup effects and jumpy scares with added back-story on these desert freaks to make the most rewarding experience I've seen in horror since, uh, well, High Tension.<br/><br/>Because Aja doesn't waste time here wallowing in the emotions of the characters, we really just have to react at a very ordinary family being terrorized by these mutants. No shot is wasted, and from the script to the music everything about this film is better than the original. I hope this starts a trend of directors improving upon all of Craven's crap films.

I want my heart to pound nearly the entire time, i want to laugh at twisted scenes, and i want to be forced to look away from the screen. So thank you Aja, for making this such a great experience.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so of 'Hills' is mainly set up, with one hell of an opening scene (which really gets you into the mood for what the film is going to be like) and a few creepy scenes and good scares. But once that is all over with... this film really takes everything up a few notches. Aaron Stanford is one of the best parts in this movie (maybe he just had the best scenes), but he really stand out here, and Aja shows he is no amateur to the camera or to horror violence at all. One scene, where Stanford's character discovers his inner Rambo needs, is one of the most amazing, imaginative, and best shot death scenes I've ever seen. That really just made me proud. They don't make 'em like this anymore, so catch it in theaters for the full experience. It will really take you back to the great 70s horror movies.... but with a little added gore."
"fred-287","Null","0","0","11 March 2006"," Better than the original (for once).....
","My problem with Alexandre Aja's previous ""High Tension"" was the failure to acknowledge his source material (Dean Koontz' novel ""Intensity"") plus he abandoned Koontz' story and tacked on a ludicrous ""twist ending."" But when I heard he'd be doing the remake of Wes Craven's ""Hills Have Eyes"" I was happy because Mr. Aja clearly has a gift for ---umm----intensity on screen. My anticipation has been rewarded: Mr. Aja has done with Craven's movie what the Cramps used to do with those goofy old ""novelty tunes"" like ""Rockin' Bones,"" ""Googoo Muck"" and ""Green Door"": stripped it down to it's essentials, amplified those and poured his soul into it as though this were indeed his own original work. He's also made some improvements, chiefly the ""backstory"" about nuclear testing in the Southwest and a remarkable sequence not in the original (granted, it reminds one of the recent ""House of Wax"" remake) with a guy wandering through a ""ghost town"" populated mostly by mannequins. Aja let 'r rip with the make-up effects (clearly this was money Craven lacked at the time; about all he could do was hire the diseased Michael Berryman for effect) to make these people REALLY mutant (granted, it reminds one of the inbred hillbillies in ""Wrong Turn""). He also gave them all the same proficiency in English. Unfortunately he lets one of the desert rats make a rambling speech about the ill effects of the nuclear testing; that point was already made during the opening credits.<br/><br/>The plot outline is remarkably faithful to that of the original (a ""normal"" family on a camping trip to California runs afoul of loonies in the boonies); Aja seems to agree with me that ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" This means that if one's seen the original, one pretty much knows what's coming throughout, not necessarily a bad thing. Even Aja's minor changes are an improvement, e.g. we don't see Ruby right away at the gas station; the gas station owner is more sinister and absorbing, deliberately sending the family into harm's way to cover up his own involvement with the crazies but then atoning for his sins in a suitably violent manner; when one crazy snacks on a pet bird, instead of stuffing it all into his mouth he bites off the head then drinks the blood. Aja makes the family more likable than did Craven (still not people whose company I'd seek), thus it's easier to give a crap what happens to them, plus he doesn't try to give the crazies ""equal time,"" leaving them their more effective function as the menacing Other(s). And if you came for blood, you won't be disappointed. I read that this version was edited for the R rating, but there's still plenty here in which to wallow. For those worried that Aja would try to ""up the ante"" by letting the baby die: relax: as I'd expected, he knows what Yanks will and will not accept. Hitchcock killed a kid in a movie in 1936 and got grief about it the rest of his life.<br/><br/>All the actors give Aja what he needs---for those guys buried under the make-up: you're real troopers! Personal favorite Ted Levine made the best impression on me as the retired cop; Aja doesn't let him use the ""N-word"" but does give him a snide line about Democrats hating guns (yet it's the ""peacenik"" son-in-law who manages to hit his target). Kathleen Quinlan lends her small role enough subtlety and underlying pathos to warrant an Oscar nomination in a different sort of movie. Emilie de Ravin from TV's ""Lost"" isn't required to do much more than scream and does that well, plus gets a nice lick in at the end. Kudos to large-eyed Laura Ortiz as Ruby who with barely any dialog conveys the sadness of the only desert rat to want to escape their little hellhole; Aja gives her a final action that comes darn close to elevating this particular gore fest to ""tragedy"" status.<br/><br/>Have to get this quibble in: is there anybody in the universe unaware that when you've been battling a homicidal maniac and he's finally down, you NEVER EVER just assume he's dead? Even if the character never saw a horror flick in his life, having gone through all that to rescue his baby, he's got a shotgun and he's not going to empty it into the body? In this instance Craven's version was better with the son-in-law repeatedly plunging the knife into the bastard's chest, exactly what I would've done. As Ice-T eloquently put it in ""Trespass"": ""It's about survival.."" I didn't mind the closing bit with the binoculars---seemed a final visual jolt as in ""High Tension""---just so there's NO SEQUEL---- enough already. .""And the Academy Award for Spookiest Impersonation of an American Desert goes to----MOROCCO, for 'The Hills Have Eyes'! Accepting for Morocco."""
"samseescinema","7","0","0","11 March 2006"," dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore
","The Hills Have Eyes <br/><br/>reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com<br/><br/>rating: 2.5 out of 4<br/><br/>Oh the humanity. Or lack thereof. In Alexandre Aja's remake of the 1977 Wes Craven mutant-fest, characters rip, shoot, tear, bite, axe, swing, kick, detonate, jump, and dismember each other to the bitter, very bloody end. Clearly reminiscent of Aja's last picture (the cult fave/box office sinker High Tension) The Hills Have Eyes has its sights, so to speak, directly on the same horror exploitation genre of the 1970's, where the make-up artist played as much a role as the director. And for the most part, Aja's style rings as true as it did with High Tension. But often Hills asks Aja to branch out into the realm of psychological horror; and here, Aja's direction stalls. <br/><br/>A family of seven (a smaller family apparently wouldn't produce enough body bags) is well into a cross-country road trip, tugging a streamline trailer through the barren, hilly deserts of New Mexico. They're given a tip by a scruffy gas station attendee that there's a shortcut up the road; a shortcut that will cut hours off the trip. Lo and behold, the family's car is sabotaged eight miles into the desert and they're hunted by a band of mutant miners. No, the premise isn't rolling heads with its originality. But this is a remake, after all. And a Wes Craven remake at that. But before we discount the film, take into account that High Tension's premise was even less inventive, instead making great advantage of the plot's simplicity. And, for once, isn't it nice not to work out the mucky, ghost-girl-in-the-bathtub mystery we've rehashed a dozen times over by now with the recent tsunami wave of Japanese Psych. Horror? <br/><br/>""Character Arc"" apparently isn't a term Aja has learned in his young film-making career. But its exclusion here is another refreshing breath amongst the continual spray of blood. His characters are plopped straight into the film fully constructed, not asked by the screenplay to develop and evolve throughout the film, but instead simply react to the situation. The method works to sidestep dialogue segments and long teary monologues that would otherwise slow the plot. Aja keeps the pace sprinting throughout, eager not to let his audience slouch in their seat in what would usually be a lull in the action for other, more conventional, horror films. The contradiction to this method, however, is that the screenplay asks for a lot of screen-time before the killing starts. Aja deals with these segments poorly, often depending on shadowy figures suddenly crossing frame to keep audiences twitchy. These tricks are cheap and without thrill. They rely on jump factor instead of true terror, letting Aja's trademark pacing stumble early on. They also make idiots out of the mutants. The things just look damned silly at times, chomping on the stump of a dog's leg and groaning like a sing-song caveman. <br/><br/>But when the heads start rolling, The Hills Have Eyes finally shifts into gear. The first scene of terror (the first attack on the trailer) is a multi-layered set piece of gratuitous violence. It mixes bloody, horrible tragedy with white-knuckled, unsettling suspense. The scene screams at us with a bloody breath, shouting to us that no character is safe and that visceral is only a euphemism for what Aja intends to throw at us throughout. Alexandre Aja is, after all, the master of modern suspense. And from there the film continues strongly, stumbling only on the occasional silliness of the mutant characters and the laughably overwrought orchestral score. Aja sticks to his old tricks, mounting dizzying suspense with the grittily satisfying payoff of bile-bubbling gore. His thrills are a whirlwind of intensity, dropping us directly into the scenes of violence and giving them a reality that only heightens the cringe of the inevitable. And Aja spares us no gore. There are no cut-aways here. We see every shocking, bloody moment. But after films like Saw II and Hostel, we're a tad desensitized to such gore, calmly swirling and sipping our slurpees as fingers roll about on splintered floors. <br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes was the obvious progression for Alexandre Aja, stepping from cult indie hit to mainstream remake. But Hills isn't a sell-out film, as indie snobs are keen to point out. Aja keeps to his guns with style here. This is the same gritty director from High Tension, just with a worse script and some silly mutants hanging cross-eyed on his back. <br/><br/>-www.samseescinema.com"

","This movie was very much like the movie ""Wrong Turn,"" about a group of campers getting lost in the woods and chased by inbred, cannibalistic mountain men. But it was a pretty good movie, although some parts were pretty disturbing. It also has that ""revenge"" factor, where the victims are able to get even with their attackers which sort of helps the audience better deal with all the stuff that happens to the family. The story in general is also pretty interesting in that its actually somewhat believable (the fact that the miners and their families in that area were effected by the nuclear testing going on.) Pretty cool special effects too. In my opinion, it wont win any awards, but its worth seeing"

","I like to think of myself as fan of all genres of movies. I also like to think that I know what the difference is between good and bad movies. This movie,""The Hills Have Eyes"",is a good film. I would like to iterate the fact that if your not a fan of this genre then your not going to enjoy it. this movie does horror well. It's really violent and gruesome with very tense moments. The movie plays close attention to detail especially in the gore and makeup effects and the setting and atmosphere also plays a large role. Unlike many movies in the same genre this movie is not cheesy and the acting is believable. with that said there are weak spots in the plot and some parts which are very predictable. But what Horror movie isn't like that? personally I believe thats what makes a horror movie.

To go see a movie like this one, you have to be open minded and not expect an Oscar worthy performance. I really like films like this that gets the audience's participation with all the screaming and shouting. The Hills Have Eyes makes this possible by putting in some dumb characters making dumb decisions, all to get the audience riled up. I enjoy films like Crash or a well developed film with a great plot and great performances but sometimes you need to chill out. There's nothing wrong with getting a good scare and having fun at the movies.

"pzazz_hij","9","0","0","11 March 2006"," Petrifying stuff
","I was really looking forward to this after seeing director Alexandre Aja's 'Switchblade Romance' (or 'High Tension' as it is also called) last year, which was one of the best horror films i've seen, so if he did half as good a job here then it would still be worth seeing.<br/><br/>Being a big fan of horror i stand by the principle that there isn't a horror film out there thats too scary. I still believe it but i fail to see how they can get much more scary than this.<br/><br/>It starts off quite slow, which will be obvious to everyone, but this allows us the rare interaction we want with the characters that we grow to like. The victims are not stupid teens or just any random people just so they can be horror victims. They are a ""normal"" down to earth, stereotypical family that we care about, which does work well.<br/><br/>Much like 'Wrong Turn' the villains also have their own personalities and qualities that we , sort of, reflect on, and again it works.<br/><br/>There is not much originality in this film as far as the gore and violence goes but when it hits you, it hits you and you know it. There is lots of blood and graphic gore continuously through the second half of the film and, by this point, the tension has been built up really well ready for the big scares.<br/><br/>One thing that really did surprise me was that the ending had a really emotional touch, that i wont say any more on but i found it a really good and clever idea that did work, at least for me anyway.<br/><br/>Ultimately i really enjoyed it, in fact i thought it was petrifying stuff that i don't recommend you see, i insist you see. Brilliant Horror."

","I expected this film to be good, however, I did not expect what I got from it. The movie for the most part follows the original and only stops to give more depth to situations that arose in the first. It expands on a few inter character relationships between the Carters which only gives more validity to the circumstances of the situation.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers: The sequence that begins from when Big Bob arrives at the gas station to when the mutants retreat from the trailer may be the most Brutal I have seen in a horror film. Not because of the shocking events since they all took place in the first, but because of the imagery and good performances by the actors. The following minutes until Doug transforms are some of the most elegant emotional sequences I have seen in a horror film. This movie does not drag itself down trying to paint the differences between the Carters and Papa Jupe's clan, instead it leaves you with the fact that th clan is evil and it forces the remaining Carters in to a fierce battle for survival. WhileDOug takes a beating through the end of the film, you watch him struggle to keep on going, but Aja makes sure to always show you his motivation for getting up again. The only complaints I have are a few spots where the score is a bit too over-imposing and the lack of screen time for Jupiter. I liked the symbolism tied in with Big Brain and America's nuke tests, which seems too say that it's America's fault for the existence of the clan, but there is a final scene with an American flag that seems to redeem America. I f Aja continues this streak, I believe he may be able to combine the imagery and beauty of Argento with the cohesiveness of Carpenter and the shock value of early Craven. 8/10"

The desert dwellers who attack the Carter family look like they stepped out of ""Wrong Turn; they're too cartoonish to be truly threatening like the previous tribe, which included the immortal Michael Berryman and James Whitworth as Papa Jupiter. Photographically, the film is slick, and Aja does some good work layering in old photographs of deformed babies and older children suffering gross deformities. If you know the plot of the original, there are no surprises here. Despite its limited budget, the original maintained an atmosphere of dread and doom, and the family felt real. This remake family, unfortunately, feels like a movie family, and I didn't buy them as a unit with a history together. The violence, thankfully, is impactful, and there are shotgun blasts to the head, axes buried in skulls, a slimy mutant incapable of movement, big shotgun deaths, a ghost town that looks like it just got built, a crater of abandoned vehicles, a fantastic little girl mutant with uneven eye sockets, a rape, a burning, and a fast climax. Still, between the good bits, the narrative grinds to a halt because the characters, as newly re-imagined, aren't any more human than the owners of the eyes in the hills."

Yet, on all other counts this film is certainly a failure. Even though I did not enjoy Saw, I sat through the whole thing. However, during my screening of The Hills have Eyes, I walked out as the rape scene was ending.

All the horror staples are here. The most deserted gas station in the world, the desolate setting, the creepy degenerate running the gas station, disfigured nuclear mutants that feed on human flesh. The horror-cliché stereotypical nuclear family is there too, complete with gruff gun-toting conservative dad, saintly matriarch, pregnant young woman, wuss who doesn't like guns, innocent baby, and eye-candy daughter. (don't get excited, there's no skin. I mean, if a horror movie is going to be horrible, they could at least throw you a bone, right?) If you don't want spoilers (smarter would be to not see the movie at all), stop reading this review now.<br/><br/>Some lowlights of the film include numerous skull splittings with pickaxes, a mutant-on-girl rape scene, a mutant nursing from a new mother before killing her execution style, a character being locked into a freezer full of disembodied limbs, and a few unmerciful renderings of a shotgun headshot suicide and someone's fingers being hacked off with an axe. Also included are images of a gutted family pet, and a radioactive mutant biting the head off a parakeet and squeezing the bird's blood down his throat like it were a can of easy cheese. Of course these all are accompanied by various other 'filler' violence that is presented in ways that are not very shocking, not surprising, but rather deeply predictable and seem more like an advertisement for whomever did the prosthetics than a dramatic device.<br/><br/>The characters are two-dimensional and behave in stupid and predictable ways, such as running off on their own, splitting up at night, and going off alone to investigate strange noises. We're never shown the human side of the irradiated mutants, which I think was a huge missed opportunity for character development. Most of the mutants only speak to utter sinister clichés, apart from a monologue delivered by strange mutant reminiscent of the elephant-man. It's really too bad the writers didn't see fit to let us learn more about him and see a human side . Some of the screen time used for cheap, ineffective scares could have been better utilized here.<br/><br/>All in all, it's bad, even for a horror movie, and suffers from the usual predictability and stupid behavior by the characters. It might be the most violent film I have seen, but it's not frightening - rather, it alternates between wanton, unintentionally funny, boring, and grueling.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie gets 0 stars and owes me two, but IMDb requires me to give at least one."

The script is terrible, and the acting is worse. This is a terrible disservice to the original movie. I have to say the best part of this movie is when the previews for scary movie 4 were shown. Other then that this entire film is pure garbage. But from a blood and gore stand point its pretty good, and at times the images that are shown to you are just plain disturbing, but that positive is lost when the actors start talking.

","Let me start by saying the title sequence for this film is very well done and really sets the mood for this nuclear horror. I always appreciate a good atmospheric title sequence. The performances are authentic and convincing in this movie. Before long I have forgotten I'm watching a movie and I am immersed in the hot desert with this stranded mid-western family on a vacation gone wrong. This movie is a feather plucked from the same bird as any Toby Hooper horror film. A truly violent movie, some of the scenes are difficult to watch and leave one feeling violated and horrified. The music is nostalgic, the papa's and mamma's, obscure classic country rock creates an atmosphere that pays homage to classic 70s slashers while misleading the viewer into an ""everything's alright"" state of mind. It isn't before long that things start to take a turn for the worse. People fear what they don't understand and rightly so in this scenario. I give this movie 5 bags of popcorn. For a truly immersive experience try watching this film on a hot summer day in the middle of a desert."
"MattBirk","7","2","5","3 March 2016"," A Great Action-Horror Movie (and One of the Best Horror Remakes)
","This is a review of the unrated version of the movie (the one not shown in theaters). According to sources, the unrated version has around 60 +/- seconds of addition footage (mostly violent content). Thought I'd share that tidbit in case anyone was curious!<br/><br/>While many might have stopped reading by now because of the amount of high violent content, I have to admit I was entertained throughout the vast majority of the movie. It all sort of stems from how well you can sympathize with those being tormented. I personally found the family dynamics totally worked, siblings acted bittersweet to one another, the father was dead on (arrogant and the man with a plan), and together they felt real. Even if at times some of them were unlikable they still felt like the typical squad. Put them in a very tense situation by Mr. Aja and you have a fast-paced mutant thriller.<br/><br/>This is an action-horror movie plan and simple. Characters fight against the mutants multiple times, they make traps, traps go off, chases ensue, one-on-one fight scenes, and many more aspects that make this an action type movie. There is little suspense to mention outside of first few scenes were the mutants move unnoticed. That being said, it was a pretty enjoyable film (as long as you can handle the violence) because of how fast paced the movie is. And by fast paced I mean once the carnage starts and the mutants make their presences known, the movie doesn't let up till the final image. This is a movie that creates its scares by visuals, from the grotesque looking mutants to the over the top gore displayed on the screen. So for me, the movie wasn't scary at all.<br/><br/>So are you going to find this movie on a list of best horror movies of the past XX-amount years? Probably not, mostly because the movie substitutes suspense for gnarly imagery and in your face violence (which a lot of people aren't down with). That's not to say the movie is bad, but Aja (director) knows what he was going for with this one and who his target audience is (gore hounds). The Hills Have Eyes was created for those people who want visual stimuli and unrelenting violence, and the movie succeeds as such."

Gore has never been a problem for me before (others having told me that I was sick for not being bothered by some scenes in other movies), but this movie was abhorrent.<br/><br/>I occasionally had to avert my eyes from the screen to avoid nausea, and was absolutely shocked that this movie was ever accepted into theaters. Wanting to cry most of the time, and feeling defiled and unsettled after finishing this movie, I wish for the first time in my life that I had never rented a movie.<br/><br/>The viewers are assailed by images of blood, gore, and many disturbing images; many of which could have been toned down or lost all together. Overall the only reason I can say that people would like this movie is if they are obsessed with blood and death.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, and I did jump a few times; however, I would recommend that you stay away from this movie. I am not naive about what goes on in the world, and even planning to enter the FBI's violent crime unit, but for the first time in my life I am saying that a movie like this never should have been released, or even made for that matter. <br/><br/>I have defended many horror movies, stating that they do not contribute to the descent of our society into violence, but I now think that I cannot keep that stance.

","The Hills Have Eyes and are Hungry? *The ideal movie for psychopath Serial killers and child molesters*<br/><br/>This movie starts out with a theme as cliché as they get. A family takes the ""short-cut"" through the desert. This short-cut scenario in and of itself is so overly used it's been beaten to the point of exhaustion. Why after all would you take directions from a creepy gas station attendant in the middle of nowhere is beyond me. The plot lacks any sort of good character development in this movie as well. None of the characters are very likable or anything but ordinary, and they lack the charismatic qualities that make a great cast. There's also not enough character development in the earlier stages of the movie. Could it be that the mutant's in this movie are somehow smarter than the average Joe's that they are feasting upon one by one? It sure seems that this movie portrays that sort of agenda. The mutant's pick this family off one by one, once they pop the tires of their truck and strand them on the isolated desert road. <br/><br/>One scene in particular stands out to me in this movie. Midway through this gruesome account of a movie, the women are left defenseless in the black of the desert night. The men leave them unattended in the trailer when provoked by outside distractions from the mutants of the hills. When they return it is to the mother fatally shot in the stomach and almost dead, one sister shot in the head gasping her last breath, the infant girl stolen, and the only female remaining was raped by both savage mutants'. One in the process of raping her had to hold his nose on. You can't help but think of the children that are going to be born of this masquerade from a girl that is still a child herself. It doesn't get much worse than this. This movie is just disturbing, disgusting, and rancid. A few scenes later the violated girl and her brother are the only two remaining at the trailer site. They had to drag the bodies of their mother and sister to the truck. The next thing you know, they hear some noise return to the truck and the body of their mother is missing. The boy runs after the trail of blood to find a mutant ripping chunks and feasting from the body!<br/><br/>Superhuman mutants? Nuclear fall-out would most likely cause lessened strength, lessened brain capacity, and the inability to reproduce. Not the opposite. The plot of this movie is so unbelievable in the respect that these mutants can survive so long and triumph over the humans. This movie puts horror to shame in its deranged traumatizing efforts. I give this one four negative stars. In fact, I'm profusely ashamed that I rented and even watched this one! It was so brutally traumatizing that I actually had to finish it to get some of the sicker scenes to leave my mind! Not my idea of entertainment. Care for a hearty serving of mental anguish anyone?"

","""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake is a raw, honest, Horror movie. The exploitation genre is getting polished in this new millennium and Alexandre Aja is one of the directors that's doing it the right way.<br/><br/>This is by far the most violent, gory, disturbing Horror movie from the new millennium. ""Hostel"" was raw and brutal but half of it's running time was just not ""horror"". ""The Hills Have Eyes"" goes directly to the point and smashes us, the audience, in the head in the first minutes. It gives a brief explanation towards the forthcoming events. Something that the original didn't have (and that was a reason for it to be considered a mindless exploitation flick). Then, the movie has it's obligatory character development. We see that the family gets along pretty good (except for Big Bob and Doug), and that there's a lot of harmony on their lives. Unfortunately to them, their future is darker than night. After their car crashes in the middle of the desert (mysteriously as no one can explain to what happened to the wheel), one by one, the typical American family are tortured by a bunch of deformed and deranged cannibals. <br/><br/>What will happen to the happy American family' Who will survive? and HOW?! this seems like a dead end road for the family. <br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a disturbing, violent movie clearly, not for everyone. If you are into 70's exploitation or you simply enjoy violence and tense Horror movies, this is what you are looking for. The movie doesn't allows you to breathe because of it's constant violent scenes and chills. And when you finally breathe, then it comes with something even more shocking. The movie deals with crude scenes that could only be watchable for fans of the genre. That's what surprised me the most! Alexandre Aja was brave enough to put all the violence in the movie. No time for black humor, or your typical references from movies like Scream, or The Ring. Instead, Aja puts as more violence and scary scenes as he can to create a truly shocking Horror movie. The man also knows how to move feelings! When you see that an innocent, normal family is getting slaughtered by a band of wackos, you know that it may affect you in some way. <br/><br/>The acting is great. Simply great. Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinian deliver a solid, believable performance as a couple that seems to be still in love and that cares a lot about their children. I wanted Big Bob to survive. I'm sure that he could take down any of the cannibals in a mano a mano. Dan Byrd and Emilie de Ravin are a reality. Both deliver a strong, brave performance. I'm glad both survived. Also, they were believable as siblings. Aaron Stanford delivered also a great performance. My initial impressions about his character were not good. He was annoying and whined a lot. Later on, he pulled out an emotional performance as a caring father, husband, and sensitive person. He then was brave enough to hunt down the cannibal family in order to save his baby daughter. I rooted for him. He's not the typical hero. Special mention deserves Vinessa Shaw. Her performance was simply great. She portrayed a loving mother and wife with great emotion. She was also hot! I've been a fan of hers since 2001. Way to go. Hopefully she will get more important roles, she deserves them. <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting characters were very good on their role. The cannibals were savage and deranged as hell. One of them reminded me of Jason from Friday the 13th part III. <br/><br/>Please watch this movie if you lost faith to the genre in recent times. This movie will be a cult classic in the future. Alexandre Aja, what a way to consolidate in the genre and in the likes of the fans! His direction is fast paced, interesting, dark, and has a feeling of uncertainty. The man knows how to craft violence and mystery in a believable way. He seems to be a man that believes in his projects , not caring about the tendencies of new Horror. <br/><br/>Watch this disturbing, violent, cruel movie because it's great on it's on way. If you are not into Horror or can't take violence, then this movie is not for you. This is not a simply revenge flick. There's more about it to dig in...<br/><br/>You make like it or not, but you will have an opinion towards it. That's for sure."

There is one scene about 45 minutes in that will make even saddam feel as though he is watching a movie directed by a psychopath. I don't like to write spoilers, but this seen, which depicts a mid-teen girl being raped by a mutated human, amidst the father being burned alive on a wooden pole, is the reason for my departure. I know this flick was originally written in the 70's and probably follows the original fairly well but, you'd have to have a really sick mind to put something like this on film. Sad part is, aside from this scene it probably ended up being a really good movie. Don't get me wrong I like a good horror flick, but rape scenes in any movie make me want to puke.

Yes it mentions government nuclear tests but it also mentions democrats not liking guns and brings to mind the major gay rights supporting, terrorist supporting (like the new film Vendetta) and agenda of democrat controlled Hollywood. But this film also leans left in some ways. basically, the film has hardly any agenda which is great. This was a big cut above most slasher films with a low budget look. It removes eroticism from horror in a redefining way. There is a clear good and evil here. The victims are not shown as fools or deserving it.

On the other hand, going through hell and surviving would be very empowering. Maybe I'm a pessimist.<br/><br/>That said, the behavior of the hill people was very believable. The movie was certainly scary but for me it was more depressing and lonely. I mean, it's bad enough to go on a family trip in the middle of the desert but to be attacked by inbred nuclear test rejects is even worse!<br/><br/>I'm still not sure why the bad guys have to be so elaborately malicious (other than entertainment value) if they're only trying to survive but whatever.<br/><br/>So, as far as the genre goes, not horrible but not my thing."

","Ah, the homely, squabbling Carter family. Traveling through the Nevada desert on the way to San Diego. When suddenly their trailer is beset with punctures and promptly crashes off the road. Was this an accident? Or is there here, in a place where atomic testing was done years before, really eyes in them thar hills?<br/><br/>So here it be, yet another horror remake of an older much loved picture from the age of the X certificate. Taking on the task, and wrath of fans, for The Hills Have Eyes is Alexandra Aja. Aja, boasting good horror credentials after directing 2003s Haute Tension (Switchblade Romance), actually pulls it off rather well. Sure it at times feels like he's confused as to if it wants to be ""horror porn"" or a ""boo jump scary movie"" but by and large it's a dirty damn grimy chiller.<br/><br/>Once Aja submitted his cut to the US censors for classification, word quickly spread that it was so grotty and sick it got the death knell NC-17. Rumours were rife that the film was so disgusting, people were walking out of test screenings feeling ill. There is no such thing as bad publicity, but in this case it became a bad case of unachievable expectations, the desensitised MTV crowd just wasn't enamoured with it. This was after all a hip horror director in waiting, aided on production duties by Wes Craven himself {director of the original}, throw in the shrewdly out there press reports, well it should have been the second coming of the anti-Christ in many eyes.<br/><br/>Yet now it's finally getting support in the right circles, and that's rightly so. For Aja builds his film up nicely with an extended introduction to our characters, whom we know are soon to be desperately violated. The atmosphere, thru gliding camera work and plinking score, is heavy, pervading doom is the order of the day, and then Aja unleashes his hellish barely human monstrosities {led by a fabulously vile Robert Joy}. Blood flies and screams are abound as Aja gleefully starts to up the anti for screen horror violence.<br/><br/>Very much following the marker set by Craven's original, is actually what stops this from truly breaking the mould. It lacks freshness to go with it's willingness to set bloody parameters. But, and it's a good but, this is still one fine and squeamish little ride, one that lingers like a naughty thought for days in the memory. 7/10"

Alexandra aja's movies are always pretty messed up and extreme. if your a huge fan or pointless horror movies where people are getting axed in the face then this movie is definitely for you. i am only happy this movie was free, but i wish i could've spent 2 hours of my life watching something else"

","I think my expectations are getting too high. Half the time I see a horror flick anymore, I'm way disappointed, as I was tonight. From the opening credits on, ""Hills"" was predictable and completely unoriginal. I've gotten to the point where, while I still dig some good old gore and blood (and yeah, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" has plenty of that) I kinda want some kind of plot and believable character development. I really didn't see much of either here. I didn't give a f@#% about any of the characters, be they victims or psycho inbreds. It seemed like it followed the ""Scary Movie"" stereotyping rules to the tee...don't go wandering off alone, don't turn your back on the killer, etc. It also felt like the producers and director had watched the ""Dawn Of The Dead' and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" re-makes Way too much. From the washed out sepia tones, jerky camera movement and clever camera angles, I felt like I was watching a re-tread. Even the opening credits copied ""Dawn"", with interspersed back-story scenes and a trendy old country song playing. I LOVED the ""Dawn"" and ""Texas"" re-makes. They took the original material and payed tribute- they didn't try to re-do the original scene by scene, a-la ""Psycho"" and ""Night Of The Living Dead"". ""Hills"" made the mistake of merely modernizing the original script, with no iota of originality added. In all, a decent popcorn flick, no surprises here. While it's nowhere NEAR as bad as ""Alien Vs Predator"" or ""House Of The Dead"", it's also not in the neighborhood of ""The Devils Rejects"" or ""High Tension"", both of which f#$king rocked. Overall, a C grade."

"jabokakermit","1","2","6","17 July 2006"," Tragically stupid attempt for horror, but a nice comedy
","This movie is really cheap. Cheap ideas and poor directing skills. The characters are acting so stupid all the time, that it is a good achievement for people with that intelligence to have survived under the circumstances of normal city-live.<br/><br/>I would classify the movie as ""comedy"" or ""parody"". It was a good idea to watch it with a bunch of lads (in Europe), who have a bit pervert sense of humor and laugh at other people's stupidity. We laughed all the time. We laughed loud. The fact, that we were able to predict the next scene in all these ""tense"" situations was good for the self-confidence.<br/><br/>But let me state some facts. The effects of radiation on the human body cause sickness and dead. Some anomalies are possible in later generations, but what we see in the movie is so far from the reality as the director from the Oscar is. But considering the rules of the genre, we can assume that the desert people are a special kind of cyborgs, who have developed strength of a tiger and mental skills of cartoon-donkey. After I watched how much and how brutal Doug has been beaten and then could run and fight... After I saw the one cyborg blowing Lynn's brains away with the same gun, that caused the mother to take off for 5 meters, I was sure she is dead. But some minutes later she was still tragically breathing in the hands of her loving husband. Then she even hiccupped. After I saw that boy falling off the rock and hitting the stony ground, but some hours later just having little scratch in the front of his face... After all this I was sure that all characters are cyborgs. Big Bob should be still alive. Well, he was just hit several times in a front window-glass and then was burning for some minutes. Furthermore the scene, where Doug hits the cyborg with the screwdriver is a clean copy-paste from Tarantino's ""True romance"".<br/><br/>The movie is really fun. But in the genre ""thriller"" I vote for 1(awful). All these good votes for the movie come because of the radiation and atom-bomb thematic, which seems to be a classic Joker in the hands of a good-for-nothing screenwriter (as racism is), that makes critic's mouths wide open shouting ""Great movie..."". I could make a movie, where 89 years old grandma farts radioactive gases and I would get the same ""Great movie..."" votes."

As a young female, I was deeply disturbed by the scene where a teenage or twenty something girl is raped. At first, the scene starts with the mutant uncovering the sleeping bag and seeing Brenda's legs. He makes an intrigued face that draws a laugh from the audience. Then, the line between comedy and grotesque, unnecessary footage is crossed. The mutant mounts her, and believe me, the gross part is not that he's not ""human"" Per Se, but that his face displays satisfaction in contrast to her countenance of horror and helplessness. Horrified, I kept thinking this part had to end soon, but then another mutant comes in and fights for the right to rape Brenda--and wins--and proceeds to rape her from behind. I was physically sick to my stomach at this point. Dejected, the mutant that first raped Brenda sees Lynne is scared for her infant's life. Taking advantage of this, he holds a gun to the baby's head and proceeds to kiss the mother's chest. At this point, I got up and left.

The gore is pointless, especially following the release of Hostel. If they wanted to push this movie past others in this genre, they should have killed the baby.

Director Alexandre Aja (who gave us the ultra-creepy High Tension last year) lends some slick style to the movie, but more importantly knows how to drive suspense and gruesome shocks to effectively horrific extremes! As violent and harrowing as the original film was, this remake is even more so. At times the movie is far more nightmarish than the Wes Craven film. The boys at KNB FX provide some truly gory blood-letting and some terrifying makeup work on the villains. There's also great filming locations, excellent set work, and a moody music score to boot.<br/><br/>The cast is a strong highlight of the film. Aaron Stanford rises to his role well as a desperate father. Dan Byrd is great as a young victim. Vinessa Shaw does an emotional turn as an ill-fated young woman. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Lavine are both strong as the parents of the family.

It is also a degrading puke fest that should be buried in dog crap and run over several times. It is truly depressing to witness a standard family get terrorized and graphically dismembered by cannibals just for the sake of entertainment. Back story regards government nuclear tests gone wrong that mutate desert dwelling people. They respond by killing everything that happens to enter the desert. Some of the family manage to retaliate including one guy who fights a gruelling battle to rescue his infant daughter. What is cliché here is that it just happens to be the guy who is most fearful of the bunch. That worked in Deliverance but here it just seems tacky. Director Alexandre Aja does his best but even production is nothing great. Actors like Ted Levine, Robert Joy, Vinessa Shaw, and even Oscar nominated Kathleen Quinlan are wasted in this awful material. Shaw is even given the uncomfortable position of having one of these monsters suck on her nipples like a deformed kid.

","The Hills Have Eyes is an effective horror remake that was better than expected. This film is definitely not for the squeamish but if you're a horror movie fan than you'll probably enjoy this one. Director Alexander Aja has done a decent enough job giving audiences a gruesome horror film with the perfect location that builds up suspense as the movie goes and things continue to get even more dangerous for the characters who find themselves in a desperate fight for survival. The cast are admirable in their roles including Aaron Standford, Kathleen McQuinlan, Vinessa Shaw, Emile de Ravin, Dany Byrd, and Ted Levine. Some of the actors aren't in it that much (except Standford, de Ravin, and Byrd who get the most screen time) but they do make the best of their limited screen time. The same can go for the relatively unknown actors playing the mutant cannibals. All of them are believable and they play their truly frightening characters to perfection. The make up used to create their characters are incredible because they look realistic as far as horror movies go not to mention many of them are absolutely terrifying and scary. This film may not have had me wetting my pants but The Hills Have Eyes has its share of suspense and scary moments that will make you jump in your seat. The brutal deaths committed by both the mutants and the main characters are well executed fitting the tone of the film. The music also adds to the suspense and syncs very well with the feel of the movie. Also worth mentioning is the location they chose because it definitely adds a lot to the film because the desert in which the characters find themselves is totally cut off from civilization. A place forgotten by humanity where a race of mutant cannibals have been lurking in the shadows snatching and dismembering victims who dare come into their territory. The dialogue for the film wasn't the greatest at times and there were a few predictable moments but the rest of the movie made up for it's couple of flaws. Overall The Hills Have Eyes is an above average remake with plenty of inventive gruesome deaths, just the right amount of suspense, and solid acting by the cast thats sure to please almost any fan of the horror genre."

","The first time I saw this movie, I had never seen the original. Afterwards, I tracked it down and was able to compare the two. Unfortunately, it made the remake seem like even more of a letdown.<br/><br/>The basic story is familiar enough. Family in RV is driving through the badlands, their tires get blown out and they end up stranded. Pretty soon, some nasty mutants show up and set the dad of the family on fire before raping the young daughter and suckling on the oldest daughter before shooting her and taking the baby. So it's up to the slightly nerdy son in law to rescue his child from the mutant freaks.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I spent the first 45 minutes of this movie bored out of my mind. It was way too by the numbers for me. It wasn't until the mutants made a bonfire with the old man as the kindling that I felt anything. But I think that was more disgust with the teen girl being raped as her dad burned followed by the other sister getting sucked and blown away. After that, there wasn't much more worth mentioning, save for a creepy scene where the son in law hides in a freezer full of body parts.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie just sort of exists. While not nearly as bad as it's sequel (do NOT see that one), it lacks anything really scary. There's a decent bit of gore and some disturbing moments but nothing that will make you sleep with the light on. Worth a rental if you're curious but otherwise, go with the original."
"johnnyboyz","5","1","2","1 December 2008"," Disgusting and unnecessary film that offers nothing bar that adrenaline kick once the pain causers get their comeuppance.
","Yes, it's one of those films that's so gruesome and nasty you're either going to enjoy it and love it for its pure, out and out effectiveness or hate it for the exact same reason. Horror as a genre has that ability, like comedy, to produce content some will take to but others will not. The Hills Have Eyes to some will be a thrill ride of adrenaline and eventual retribution played out in glorious, grimy, grungy cinematography; to others it'll be a freak show with few redeeming features. Truth is, the film is more of a freak show with few redeeming features than it is an intelligent and interesting exercise in horror but comes complete with daft metaphors and ill logic at times.<br/><br/>The original was made at a time when the genre was on the cusp of a wave. 1972's Deliverance and 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre helped launch the idea of out-of-towners stranded, lost and helpless in a wilderness unbeknownst to them. Wes Craven's 1977 version was about a family getting stranded right where they didn't want to be and the 2006 remake is a similar set up: place the pigeons exactly where you want them and unleash the cats.<br/><br/>The trouble is The Hills Have Eyes is just this followed by an orgy of buckets of blood, violence and disturbance. It's not like Deliverance or Hooper's 'Chainsaw' movie in the sense it doesn't incorporate the location as a third element to the character's survival (as the forests of Deliverance did) but merely renders the desert in which it's set a large, open space people must take ages in travelling through. Additionally, it lacks the sense of danger Hopper's 'Texas Chainsaw' had, which gave us a fair amount of suspense and disturbance in equal measure, as seen in the dinner table scene nearer the end and the chase through the woods/country house prior to that. The Hills Have Eyes ignores elements of chase and setting up a potentially nasty encounter and skips straight to the shock and horror of it all.<br/><br/>The film begins with a montage of nuclear weapons being tested which immediately reminded me of the opening of 1998's Godzilla, but it is as much about nuclear testing and makes about as much-a statement on nuclear testing as Godzilla did, which is zilch. Once the set up has been done and a gas station attendant has an attacks of morals, the film gets going; descending into its messy and needlessly unpleasant procession. Throughout the course of the film, we will get to see loved one's watch their other loved ones burnt to death whilst being alive the whole time. We will also get to see someone else being raped in front of the family members, also watching on, and in clear, obvious un-comfort – is this supposed to be entertaining? Is this the level these action/horror hybrids have sunk to? <br/><br/>But the film isn't just a series of scenes in which we get to see harmless, innocent people suffer at the hands of creatures that get no introduction bar a nuclear testing montage and a small title paragraph of information. The film is about a band of Americans; a band of Americans in a desert locale getting horribly picked off one by one by an enemy they have no clue to either: how to defeat at first; where they are coming from or what they even are. Parallels could be read into to do with the Iraq war or general conflict in the middle east and it may well be that people look back at this film in years to come as some sort of parallel to these events.<br/><br/>Talking of the location being a large and wide open space that bamboozles and forces the family to cover large distances, why is it that the mutants whom eventually show themselves are able to negotiate and hide within the canyons whenever the family try to intercept or chase them down? Some of the more would-be humbling scenes such as one family member discovering a graveyard of previous victims' cars have been done before, recently in a film entitled Wrong Turn so the impact does not hit you like the makers want it to and thus, it comes off as uninspiring and flat.<br/><br/>I think The Hills Have Eyes is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute, action film that entertains and scares in equal measure but it's more of one, long sick procession of gore and unpleasantness that nobody needs to see – was there a point to all of this? Even more-so, was there a point of remaking the original? One element of real distaste arrives in the form of a young female character who sunbathes in a bikini, is provocatively shot and states she'd ""rather be in Cancun"" – it's clear the audience is supposed to be attracted to her since she's shot accordingly so. It is when that character is raped later on that we get to see possible repressed fantasies the film embedded within our psyche earlier on, getting played out. Like this tiny element and the Iraq war situation acting as a metaphorical backdrop, the film is needless and unpleasant thus allowing most people to come away from the film thinking they've seen something brilliant, purely because they've been taken on a roller-coaster of thrills, spills and surging hormones – what a shame."

","Horror films seem to be taking a turn for the worst at the moment, there have been only a few films in the last decade worth noting and a whole stream of ones that are forgettable.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is definitely one you will remember, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the best parts of the entire film, which really isn't saying much as the characters seem deeply uncomfortable playing their roles. More so than they should be.<br/><br/>Positive things stop there. It seems that many horror directors realise that their film simply isn't scary enough so they turn it into a sick gore fest. The Hills Have Eyes is an example of this. Scenes in this film are too brutal for even the hardest of stomachs.<br/><br/>The effects are decent, but nothing out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Overall, brace your stomach and brace your patience, because The Hills Have Eyes is instantaneously dull."

","Thanks to this film, director Alexander Aja became famous. And why shouldn't? Because his remake of Wes craven film of same title is unvelibable. There is a lot of violence, starting at the beginning, then there is a stop, where you get to meet the characters, always with a little of suspense, because you're thinking at what moment do the psicopats will appear. Well, I'm not going to tell, for your surprise. But the horror part last since the guys show up to the end of the movie, it's almost like an hour of complete horror! This movie is made for the horror fanatics. So if you're one of them, you should really watch this film."

","In 1977, the Wes Craven classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" scared people to death and gave people nightmares. 19 years later it was remade under the same name, except this time, it's Scarier! The 2006 update of The Hills Have Eyes is just as good as, if not even better than the original.<br/><br/>Here we have an entire cast of unknowns, and that's a good thing. In the beginning, we see a group of scientists collecting chemicals, when a mutant kills them, and drags their 4 bodies by car. Then we focus on a family driving through the New Mexico desert to visit family from out-of-town. A quarter of the way there, their tires are flattened and they are stuck. They decide to stay in the desert until their problem is fixed. What they DON'T know is that they are being watched by a group of deadly mutants, who terrorize them all night long! THHE is a great movie. Definitely not for those with a weak stomach and contains lots of hardcore blood and gore. Totally recommended if you liked the original!"
"Danielramos16","10","1","2","16 June 2008"," This film has the potential to mess you up
","Well first off let me state that any time I watch a remake of a classic horror film I get worried. When a Stranger Calls, The Fog, The Hitcher, Prom Night, And House of Wax sucked!!! Not scary, not original, not smart, and not faithful to the original. Not to mention they all make the mistake of casting good-looking teen actors that are so dumb & unlikeable, luckily this film didn't make that mistake. This remake of Wes Craven classic The Hills Have Eyes (1977) is not only faithful to the original, but it's scary, visceral, and so brutal that it could mess you up for life (if your too simple minded that is). <br/><br/>This story follows the exact same flow as the original,and has the same theme of Good family Vs. Evil Family, but there are a few alterations that just add more suspense & horror. the evil family was horribly disfigured by Radiation Fallout from nuclear testing. They lived in this mining community but the residents were forced out by the military so the government could test nuclear weapons in the area. Tragically the family refused to leave their home. So now not only are they a family of cannibals, but they are angry deformed cannibals Which makes them far more terrifying & disturbing. The Cannibals prey upon unsuspecting travelers not only because they are primary source of food but because they angry at what they perceive society has done to them. The good family (The Carter's) are your typical All-American suburban family, not perfect, and not completely likable but not every family is, so they really seemed like a genuine regular family<br/><br/>I love this film because it's almost identical to the original, but it make some alterations to add suspense, keep a sense of unknown, and adds far more Blood & gore then I even thought possible. Cinematography plays a big role too. The Carter's drive into wasteland of a desert, surrounded by hills. They end up in the middle of nowhere, it creates a sense of helplessness & dread, a great horror film uses the scenery to creep you out. It's everyone's worst nightmare; to be attacked and not a soul on earth can help or even hear you. The music is also very unsettling, and helps build tension.<br/><br/>Then we come to the point were Blood is everywhere and the shear brutality of this film really makes you uncomfortable. The Dad is burnt alive, The Dog is Ripped open, The Daughter is Raped, The mothers are shot to death, and the baby is kidnapped! holy crap! Of course this is all controversial but Sadly these kinda things happen in real life. This movie asks a morale question; if your family or loved ones are brutally murdered or threatened, will you find it in yourself to retaliate, could you be so brutal & ruthless when it comes to survival? All the violence is truly terrifying and throws you into survival mode. The surviving Carter members suddenly pushed into this primitive state of violence, but they know they are doing what they need to do in order to survive. Doug is the geeky salesman of the group, He is a democrat, a liberal, and doesn't believe in guns or violence. But the scene where he sees his Wife mutilated on the floor and his baby abducted, he completely breaks down we see a man loose everything he holds dear. It's interesting to see extreme violence come out of people we never thought could be violent, but if you had to be so violent to save yourself & your child.... Would you? Cause in the end in order to survive and save his baby, Doug becomes a blood soaked, Axe & Shot gun wielding maniac.<br/><br/>This film is filled with blood & gore which is so awesome cause Im into those kind of horror films, but it's better because it has meaning to it (again the concept of violence in people). It's scary like hell, there are so many times when you feel creep out & uncomfortable, and the tension is at a constant high. I know there are many people who are overwhelmed by this film, all I can say is; if you don't have the stomach for it don't watch, this is a film for blood soaked horror nerds like myself :)"
"Rob_Taylor","5","1","2","14 November 2007"," Over the Hills and Far Away........as far as you can get!
","Yeesh! Where do I start with this one? I suppose I should point out that, apparently, horror means gore in modern movies. If so, then Hills is a ""real"" horror movie alright. There's gore by the bucketloads. In fact, there is so much of it that it rapidly becomes meaningless as a means to shock the viewer.<br/><br/>In fact, let's be honest, the sorts of people that like these kind of movies like them for precisely that....the gore factor. Horror does not enter into it.<br/><br/>So how does this movie stack up in terms of entertainment value, let alone horror? Well...not good. Although I do recall watching the original many years ago, about all I remember is the basic plot. And this remake seems to me to follow that pretty soundly. So, an actual remake, rather than a reimagining. And thats probably why it doesn't work so well. If they'd put a little more thought into the story rather than writing scenes as feeble excuses to depict senseless violence and gore then the film might have had more value.<br/><br/>As it is, however, they didn't and the film, as a result, is extremely predictable and formulaic. The ""good guys"" are a somewhat dysfunctional extended family that learns to work together....eventually. Throughout most of the film, though, they all do their own thing and perform such retarded actions that its impossible to feel much sympathy for any of them, let alone root for them. In fact the only characters that you have any kind of feeling for are the dogs and the infant baby. None of the others seem worth a damn.<br/><br/>So, having established the inherently unlikeable family it actually becomes quite pleasant watching them slowly get picked off for their idiocy. I know its a staple of horror movies that characters do stupid things, but here its just ridiculously overdone. Any family that dense deserves whatever it gets, quite frankly.<br/><br/>Another thing, horror movies shouldn't make you snort with laughter or derision during them. Hills does that more than a few times. I think its mostly the absurdity of what went was happening on screen more than anything really funny that caused it. But whatever it was, I chuckled several times.<br/><br/>Is it intelligent cinema.......hell no! Would I recommend it to horror fans.........no.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it to gore fans.....yes.<br/><br/>But I'd qualify the last by referring to the first comment above. Don't expect anything remotely like smarts to be shown by any of the characters.<br/><br/>Summary: Gore factor: 8/10 Plot: 2/10 Snore factor: 8/10"
"wadelv4","10","1","2","22 July 2007"," Jaw Dropping!
","Before I saw this movie, I had heard of the '77 cult classic. I didn't expect anything special. I saw this rental lying around the house, and popped it in the DVD player, not expecting more than a gory good time. Once the final credits started to role, my jaw was hanging 5 inches down. I was absolutely hypnotized by its brilliance. This 2006 remake has led me to be one of the biggest Hills Have Eyes fans there is. A very unique thing about the Hills Have Eyes is that the gore and brutality are at the perfect times. So, if you're expecting some slasher film with blood in every other scene, this movie is much, much more (even though there is a TON of blood). Above all it's inspiring. It's about what a man will do to save someone close to him, even in the worst possible circumstances. Still with all that, to be an excellent movie, it has to have great acting. Well, you have your wish! The acting is spectacular. Now that brings us to the mutants. The make up effects were genius. The mutants look so real and gruesome, it's almost hard to look at the screen the entire movie, and that's exactly how you know the make up effects are great! All in all, this movie is any horror fans dream, and if you come out not liking the movie, then you're not a true horror fan."

","I loved this movie. I have seen lots of horror movies, this was one of the best, if not the best. It is only rated in the 6.4-6.8 star range on this site, considering that it varies with votes, but to me this movie should have around 8-8.5 stars on this site. I give it 10 star rating for a horror movie, and a 9.5 star rating as just a movie. The reason I think it has been rated lower than I expected is because of a few things: gore, blood, and rape. Okay, those aren't reasons to rate a movie badly. This movie is rated R! The R rating allows those things. Its a horror movie, and lets be real, what horror movie doesn't have blood? Okay the rape scene isn't 'ethical' but it sure does add to the horror of this movie. So those things make the movie more of a horror to me, and are not reasons that I wouldn't like this movie. I have seen the SAW movies 1-3 and this movie is quite a bit better. A lot more creepy, has a better story line, better jumps, better acting, better emotions. To the point; this movie is better than all of those movies, head and shoulders.<br/><br/>I rented this movie expecting an average thriller and horror movie. It was way better than I expected it to be. It has a 'this could happen in real life' sense to it. Sure, mutant cannibals are very uncommon to say the least, but the pictures at the beginning of this movie so everyone watching it that the nuclear testings DID deform things. Therefore, its possible that mutants could have formed somehow. Its not logical but its possible. The acting was great in this movie overall. Not a lot of big names but still the acting is way better than average. You will most likely be scared and grossed out at various points in this movie, which is how a horror movie is supposed to be. I'll admit I needed about 30 minutes before I could stop thinking about this movie and finally fall asleep. This movie is good, even great. Don't let a little extra gore or one attempted rape scene ruin this movie for you.<br/><br/>Final comments. One of my favorite movies, and I'm not just saying that for this review, this is one of my favorite movies that I have seen. I plan on buying this movie, to add it to my collection of only about 15 movies. You will most likely be thinking of this movie next time you go to a desert. The Hills Have Eyes truly is creepy and yes, gory at times. This movie will make you wonder and make you jump. You will want to kill these mutants yourself at the end of this movie. After all, it is a horror movie."

Lets just say that The Hills Have Eyes totally changed my perspective on remakes! This movie was insane! Great scares, good gore, sweat breaking suspense, and a terrifying storyline. The brilliant thing about The Hills Have Eyes is that you care for the characters and through every scene your cheering them on to kill those creatures. You can feel their pain through every scene and that just makes the movie even better. This is not for the weak stomach, there is definitely some disturbing content. But if your in to these kind of movies and you can handle gore and some big entertainment, scares, thrills, and suspense. Then you will definitely enjoy The Hills Have Eyes."

The fact the film got as high as a 3 was down to the last 10 minutes, otherwise it would be languishing on 1.<br/><br/>It's not in the slightest bit scary as their is no tension, and twists as someone mentioned in the featured comment...where?! The director includes too many of the deformed characters too really feel scared by any one of them and he goes with the old mistake of making them almost invincible.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the first, but if this movie sticks closely to the storyline I'm unsure of why anyone would want to do a remake of it. It's one saving grace is that it creates a few protagonists that react in the same human way as anyone else would, making it easier for them to be related too or enjoyed.<br/><br/>Overall, only a good movie if you like gore, in terms of suspense, thrills, twists and a decent antagonist/s (which all combine to make good horror films) this film comes up WAY short."

I recommend it for people who doesn't get disturbed or find violence disgusting.

","After SNEAKING into the theatre as I was underage, I watched this movie with little to know hopes of it being any good. After losing all faith in the horror movie genre after seeing poor movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax, The Grudge etc. This was a refreshing change. I don't know if it's because I thought I would hate it or the fact that it was SO suspenseful but I loved every second of this film. (I'm not sick I just love suspense.) The film kicks off with a nice little kill scene to get you prepared for the rest of the necessary gore. As we are first introduced to the characters there are mixed emotions but it turns into a character based film where you feel concern and remorse for the characters. This is also due to the fine and little known cast. I didn't find the movie predictable or one bit frustrating. Although the cinema I was in, there were a few laughs after one of the very graphic killings. You will be left asking yourself 'Can they do that'. Oh yes they can. Usually in horror movies you will turn to the person beside you and say 'This is where the character gets it' but this film leaves you wrong and feeling a bit stupid. So don't predict in this film just in case.<br/><br/>I saw the remake before the original which is definitely best to do. I've read other comments and in my opinion I don't understand how such an average movie like the original was turned into such a 'masterpiece'. Keep in mind this is just opinion. I loved everything about this movie, especially the fact that you WILL be on the edge of your seat for most of it. Without talking the movie up please watch it and just sit back and enjoy horror at its finest. I have got the date of its DVD release implanted in my brain and so should you."

","I've been a great horror fan since I was a little child, and am quite unable to miss a single horror flick even when I know it's bad, like the 99% of all horror movies we're all used to watch these days. And I'm always disappointed by all of them, they're all superficial, shallow, not scary at all, badly acted and horribly written. The result is that if I happen to come across two good horror movies per year (over about 40) I'm happy and satisfied. I've never liked American horror movies based on family slaughter and massacre, which normally take place in deserts or rotten villages lost in the middle of nowhere. Not because I don't like the landscape, but because they're normally just BAD. Well, I have to say that ""The Hills have Eyes"" is the best horror movie I've seen this year (so far). The movie is well acted and directed, the soundtrack is great and the script is also fantastic. But what strikes me most is that I can't stop thinking about it, it leaves you with a disturbing feeling of fear and danger that is very unlikely to be found in any other horror flick nowadays. The level of brutality and violence is so strong... I really recommend the movie to all horror fans."

The negative thing about this film is that it's again the tourists who are killed and that's the same in so many other movies. But if you want to have nice exciting night, this movie will help you with that. But you need to be used to a lot of ketchup (read blood) because that's one thing you see a lot. The creatures are very scary I must confess. They don't die quickly like in every horror movie, but this film keep in touch with the realistic world. So it doesn't look stupid as many other horrors.

"melissaowczarzak","10","1","2","6 August 2006"," This Is a Really Good Movie
","It seems to me that many horror movies disappoint. They are filled with bad acting or unbelievable plot lines but this movie does not disappoint. It follows the story of a regular family traveling through the desert on their way to a California vacation. The family is extremely likable and this makes it all the more excruciating when you realize they are the targets of some very bad people. The acting in this film is solid, my favorite performance delivered by the actor playing Bobby, the families teenage son. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. There is a lot of gore so if that's disagreeable to you, then don't watch this film. If you are a horror buff then this one will be very enjoyable!"
"chrizzie","1","1","2","4 August 2006"," Participants of these kind of movies must have got some serious issues going on.
","Horror you say? Yea sure, I enjoy a good horror movie from time to time. Gore? No problem there, its a basic part of horror right? So, whats the problem then? Well,...everything!<br/><br/>Movies a lot like this one (let me name: Texas chainsaw massacre, Hostel, etc.) only have ONE single purpose: to disturb people. There's no story, no plot, no characters, no suspense, lousy acting, these are all without exception trademarks of these kind of movies. Basically the story has no real use, it's all about the gore. If they just put a dozen people in a room along with some chainsaws, axes, knives, a shotgun (you get the picture?) you would have the same effect.<br/><br/>Now, that is how it should be imo. However, I said ""a lot"" like this one. Because this movie actually has one important difference to those other movies we know. The other ones I mentioned have some random characters, 95% of the time they are teenagers who really don't care about each other anymore when the 'chopping' starts. This is acceptable. I for one really don't like those kind of movies (as I mentioned they are really just for the gore, there's nothing to it), but I can watch 'm. Now this movie however is about a family. A nice family with 2 parents, 3 kids (1 of 'm is maried and has a baby!). When these kind of disturbing things happen to a family, the movie is turned completely around I think. The gore that you usually can enjoy upsets you when you see a mother and a child involved. Now, I am not ignorent, it is obviously meant to be this way. But should it be?<br/><br/>I really don't think so. For me, gore is acceptable (and sometimes even enjoyable) when you see it happen to some idiot teenager who you really don't care about. But when you see families being torn apart in horrible ways, I don't know... it just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Therefor I ask myself, who would ever participate in making such a movie? They're plainly disturbing (on a very wrong way)."

","I cannot express how disappointed in this film I was. I was expecting a nice remake of a classic thriller/horror film and what I saw -- was a mess.<br/><br/>The story is simple: A family on some kind of a motel 6 funded vacation gets steered the wrong way where another set of families that was effected by nuclear blasts and decades of radiation and fallout gets to hunt them.<br/><br/>Let me point out something nice about the film that does warrant a look: Yes, the best part of the film was the cinematography direction which kept your attention. I must admit, it was very stylish, updated, urgent -- just done very well. But to me, that does not make a complete film.<br/><br/>The Acting: not the best.<br/><br/>The Horror: Predictable.<br/><br/>The Fright: None.<br/><br/>The Make-up: Shoddy. Come - On it's 2006! None of those folks had any scare potential! There wasn't any imagination whatsoever with how those folks up there looked. I saw scarier things on that gosh-awful film of Johnny Knocksville's ""The Ringer"".<br/><br/>The Story: Well, a good one, it's been done before so... I was seriously hoping the update would help. It didn't.<br/><br/>Gore: Benign.<br/><br/>Violence: (stay with me here) not violent in a horrific kinda way. I'm tired of the same old/same old - The cute coed getting raped by the guy with three teeth, poor old dad being burned or hung, poor old mom being eaten, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>The Characters: Well, here we go. I didn't care if any of them lived or died - none of them held my interest for long. That's what made me completely loose interest in this film.<br/><br/>To be honest, I kept wondering WHY this film needed to be remade at all. Portfolios so that everyone involved could get another film? Probably.<br/><br/>But as far as a fright/horror fest. Not really. This remake could have sat on the shelf a bit longer until someone else came along to resurrect it and scare the pants off of everyone."
"dollarbillsemail","4","1","2","1 August 2006"," The Hills Have Eyes (Disappointing)
","Oh, hark! It's another remake. Will Hollywood ever have an original thought? Well, simply put, if you're into horror movies, you'll enjoy it. However, if you're a fan of good movies, you won't. Overall, I found it disappointing from both perspectives. This movie was highly anticipated by aficionados of the horror genre and the trailer for it looked very impressive.....as trailers usually do. The movie was chopped up a bit to gain a more marketable rating. So, I declined to see it in a theater and instead viewed the unrated version on DVD. Now, let's delve into the GUTS of the movie, so to speak. The special affects were excellent and the creative make-up on the mutants was excellent. They put together a decent cast whose performances were both professional and believable. Actress Emilie de Ravin, currently on the hit TV show ""Lost"", plays Brenda Carter and screams VERY WELL. There was enough blood, gore and gruesome mayhem to satisfy even the heartiest of horror fans. So, the question is, with all of this going for it, why did it come and go in theaters so quickly? Blame this one on the director. It was presented very badly. He wasted the first 45 minutes of the movie following this dysfunctional bickering family lumber along and become stranded in the desert after wrecking their trailer. I sat there watching and wondering, when is something going to happen? He should have utilized this time to build up the suspense and to create some sympathy for the potential victims. Unfortunately, he didn't. When the first attack came, I was just glad that something finally happened. At that point, I couldn't care less about the family. In fact, if I felt any sympathy at all, it was for the mutants, victims themselves of 1950's nuclear testing. Then, from the moment of that first attack, right through to the end of the movie, it was non-stop blood and gore. That's why this movie failed. There were no breaks in the action. There was no suspenseful buildup to any of the scenes. Hence, you felt no terror and you felt no fear. A viewer needs to get into the movie and feel for the characters. I felt nothing. Having seen more than my share of horror movies over the years, I viewed it as nothing more than blood and gore. It's a shame too. This movie could have been done really well."
"kymmr2","7","1","2","23 July 2006"," Very suspensing and gruesome movie!
","I saw the unrated version of this movie, and I now wonder what the rated version could possibly be like. This film had many twists to the road it was taking by killing off some characters you wouldn't expect, which is what you need in horror films to build suspense and curiosity. Some of the scenes were filled with great tension, some with so much, I kept shouting at the screen because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acting was great from most of the characters except a few. The deformed people are horrific and creepy, but what's even creepier is what they do and how they act. Bottom line, this movie delivers a big gory horror piece that nearly becomes excellent."

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I watched it last night with my brother and after the movie ended I wish had those 2 hours of my life back. I have not seen the original so I can not comment on that. This movie ranks up there with Battlefield Earth. The film was very unrealistic the characters actions were just plain unbelievable. For example, the victims have a limited amount of ammo yet feel the need to just fire into the darkness or at some random creature hundreds of yards away. Also how have the mutation people been able to survive on their own for 50 plus years with the occasional passer by. This film is littered with plot holes and just plain bad. Basiclly stay away from this film and don't waste 2 hours of your life."
"Panthro83","4","1","2","28 March 2006"," Some scenes may not be suitable for anyone
","I gave this the benefit of the doubt, going to see it despite being disappointed by most modern horror films. This one seemingly had an identity crisis, trying to be everything to everyone, and ending up satisfying only those who were after blood and gore, as well as some unnecessary depravity.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, there are plenty of films that contain parts of this, but done in a better way. Deliverance beats it hands down for suspense and the whole redneck angle. The original Texas chainsaw massacre beats it on a slasher/bloodfest score.<br/><br/>The script showed a lack of inventiveness and intelligence, especially when recreating an original film. The dialogue was poor all round, and the ending was bland.<br/><br/>Surely if you had multiple tyre blow-outs you might think something was wrong? and why go down a dirt road when you have barely and idea where you are? There were also some unanswered questions, perhaps cut from the final film.<br/><br/>When one of the family sees the stolen goods in the gas station, she does nothing, not even uttering a single word about it. Surely you couldn't trust this man's directions? The mutants supposedly survived in the mines for many (dozens of?) years, yet came out to live in the mock village afterwards? Three things they could have done to improve the film if only slightly: one: the beauty and the beast thing would perhaps have added a little if it had been beauty that had gone on the killer rampage, as opposed to the more aptly named beast. (Not that the names we'rent incredibly irritating anyway...) two: at the end, the gas station attendant could be directing another set of brainless people down towards the mutants.<br/><br/>three: Just not bothered remaking it at all..."

Nothing was overdone, the scares were well timed, the action developed well and the gore was placed just right! There was just enough gore and blood, not quite stomache turning but enough to add to shock value. There was a terrific beginning that got right to the plot, and not many lagging points.

And, they didn't mention that they were even cannibals for the longest time in the remake. Then,the killings began & staying true to the original, the German Shepard gets killed, and the Dad,Mom & Sister get killed in the exact same way as the original, except the new one up it with the character of Jupiter (with the worse case of cleft palette since the dude in Wrong Turn) drinking the Lynne's breast milk from her tit, was very disturbing & definitely made me squirm! Gross! And, then the scene where Aaron Standford's character finds the nuclear test site village & goes to rescue his baby, that was a cool new addition. And, the new character of Big Brain was GREAT! Especially, his oh so very creepy rendition of the Star Spangled banner! And, the scene where Pluto starts eating the Mom after body-stealing her corpse was Just Brutal!!!! I'm surprised the MPAA being so scared of The Christian Right & their start of an Inquisition on the movie industry would allow this great re-make to be so BLOODY! Awesome.Alexander Aja brought him gem of a horror film from France last year in High Tension & thank you for showing us true horror fans that again a great remake is done from a legend of a horror film from the original.

","The 11 y/o I usually pal out with and I wanted to see this movie. Apparently, the previews we THOUGHT were for this particular movie were DEFINITELY not for this movie!! The movie was well-paced and had some blood and gore in it that made one lady in the theater scream!! (I, on the otherhand, was laughing hysterically because this grown lady screamed, haha- cruel, I know) There's a part with LOTS of stuff going on at once and all I could do was bite my nails and say over and over again, ""OMG! OMG! OMG!"" and it was WAY too much going on in the movie for my little buddy and he started crying and we had to leave for a little bit until he settled down. The rest of the movie wasn't too graphically violent or gory or anything like that, I found a good bit of it amusing as well (when some bad guys got killed, etc.). I'd go back and watch the movie again(with another unsuspecting child--- JK!) to see the 10 minute interval that I'd missed and the story was pretty well setup too. Kinda reminded me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre though..."
"paintedwallpaper","6","1","2","16 March 2006"," Just another mediocre remake of a unique horror movie.
","The original The Hills Have Eyes was an OK horror film, if not a bit slow and a bit rough around the edges. The remake lacks the raw realism of the 1980 version and it borrows too heavily from other recent remakes (including their flaws). It has Texas Chainsaw Massacre all over it and the mutant village reminded me of the House of Wax. Don't you think these remakes are following a formula? 20 minutes of bonding (pop culture jokes) between characters from popular TV shows or teen angst movies, then 20 minutes of wandering around to build suspense that is ineffective because everything has a familiar and predictable feel. The wandering around ends when the stupidest character reads a newspaper clipping (killers love to make scrapbooks, always) and gets killed before he can warn anyone. Instead of using creative writing the writers make the characters so stupid that that they put themselves in dangerous situations; unfortunately, people like seeing whimpering Nimrods die which makes suspenseful pacing becomes wasted time. What's with the gratuitous ammo wasting (a trained policeman firing randomly into the dark and his son waiting until the bandits are acres away before shooting)? When the daughter was heard screaming in the trailer why did the helpless mother and older daughter go see what was going on instead of the men with guns; somebody dangerous set your dad on fire(he didn't spontaneously combust), and now that person is raping your sister. When the dog was attacking the ax wielding ogre, why not take the chance to bash the ogre's brains in instead of poorly barricading yourself in a plywood bathroom? So you shot Mr. Cleft lip in the arm and he fell... shoot him in the head! Don't put your gun down right next to him; you don't know how many other mutants there are out there, and he might be playing possum. Plus, the mutant that was feeding on your mom was 30 feet away and unarmed... do you take time to aim a shot to kill him? No. What you do is waste all your shots while running away just to set up an overly elaborate trailer explosion. I am not impressed with the writing of this film, the only thing clever about it were the make-up/blood effects, but everything else has been done so many times that i could hardly get excited about anything happening on screen. I am a fan of B-Movies, and there is fun to be had here (the audience was not scared at all but laughing the whole time), but please, no more hurried remakes, people! These are the movies that got me into horror, and you are beginning to hurt my feelings as well as insult my intelligence."
"perfectsquare","5","1","2","16 March 2006"," A sad remake
","Where do I begin? I'm not going to go all out and bash this movie, even though it should be bashed, a lot, with an axe through the head.<br/><br/>If you have never seen the original movie, do not read further. I am biased.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is almost exactly the same as the original. B U T ....the original has the 'air' in its telling....and that mostly makes it more effective. The cell phone thing and the son-in-law could have been LEFT OUT. It does nothing for the story. I think they included it to show that that guy was a smart person, but not an effective person.<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start with the problems.<br/><br/>Acting is worse than anything you have seen. It is like watching bad 12 year old actors in a high school play. REALLY bad. Normal 12 year olds can do this better. See Youtube.com.<br/><br/>The script is more than horrid. There is not a human alive that can write a worse script, I think. I could have written this on the shitter in about 5 minutes. I am being 100% honest. I could not write this stuff if I tried. Is this People Magazine? My problems with this movie lie in the character development, the subsequent reactions, and the eventual outcome. It plays like a Bruce Campbell show...and you think it is kind of funny. There is some gore, but not to an extreme.<br/><br/>Don't listen to me specifically. Read all of the reviews. But, if you know me...you know what I'm saying. I guarantee you won't like this movie if you are a horror fan.<br/><br/>I would put this on the same plain as Wolf Creek. If you liked that pile, you may like this. Wolf Creek had some actors that could act, though."

Also, the shotgun suicide scene was amazingly IN YOUR FACE. I was shocked at how that girl from LOST played a ditz without an accent. Of course, the JUPITER character at the end is the ""your friend died like a pig"" thug from the Untouchables. FOr such a famous actor, he had a SMALL PART all things considered. Great cameo from Bruce Campbell in this movie as Ash."
"tricksixxx","8","1","2","10 March 2006"," I must put my two cents in on this one
","Right off the bat, I can tell you this movie will have very mixed reviews. I saw it on opening night with about 70 annoying teenagers, a few small children, and a couple real moviegoers like myself. After viewing the film, I jumped on IMDb to check the early reviews. I would like to address first my position on why the people that gave negative reviews are wrong. You don't go see a film such as The Hills Have Eyes for kid's night out and some good family entertainment. I read reviews that talk about this movie is atrocious and an over the top gore fest and things of that nature. The truth is, this movie is very violent with some gut wrenching scenes and some truly sadistic actions, but it is justified....let me finish. One review stated you would have to be a cold cold person to enjoy a film like this one, and I strongly disagree. This movie has a lot of emotion and very good acting. Very rarely in horror cinema do you get a chance to see what a murder actually does to a family. They really capture the suspense and drama of the situation and it's very real impacts on the family members. There is a lot of very well thought out heart behind the plot of this movie. Second, I read in a review that the gore takes the place of suspense, which is totally incorrect. The large amounts of unflinching gore and violence were put in places that were not supposed to be suspenseful to begin with. The gore comes from the protagonists actually rising up against incredible odds for the sake of love and family. The scene where the main character rises to his feet after being totally drained of all fight from opening his eyes to his wedding ring is absolutely genuine and fantastic. The suspense is there before the protagonists begin their uphill battle when they are the ones being preyed upon. OK now I've addressed a couple issues that concerned me. Now let me give you the good and the bad rundown on The Hills Have Eyes remake. The good points outweigh the bad by a long stretch. #1 - The acting is way above par from what I expected. The guy who plays Bobby is an especially solid and intense actor. #2 - The directing doesn't fall victim to clichéd ways to present a truly eerie feel. Aja gets mad props here. #3 - The antagonists in the movie are crazed and very monster-like, which makes the viewer have absolutely no sympathy for the murderers. To often we see movie makers somehow glorify the cold killers and the agony they place upon people. Not here my fellow moviegoers, here you will feel nothing but hatred towards these savages. Even if they are deformed and mentally unbalanced due to government nuclear testing, they still deserve to die. #4 - -------SPOILER--------- The protagonists actually fight back instead of just getting stalked and murdered like so many other movies. It is great when a movie shows the unbelievable fight a family member can have for another. They fight with every last energy they have and never give up or give in. The family fighting back is really where the gore hits in and it every bit appreciated by the time it happens. People were actually clapping in the movie theater when they fought with heart to overcome the eyes in the hills. -------END OF SPOILER------ #5 - I had to say it guys, the gore. The violence is well placed and satisfying to even ""Hostel"" lovers. This stuff is truly unforgiving in it's presentation I kid you not. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. #6 - The setting was outstanding. They really show us the isolation and misery of the desert. With edgy camera work and a dark, gritty feel to it, the setting breathes and has a life all on it's own. The setting is the best element of the picture. OK, now for the couple bad elements to the film. #1 - Some parts with the antagonists were a bit cheesy and over acted. They tried to be creepy in a couple parts where it really wasn't needed since the setting and makeup alone was creepy enough. #2 - The protagonists make a couple dumb moves, but then again you must realize that you know the characters are going to go through hell, where as the characters have no idea. #3 - The very last second of the movie was not needed. #4 - The opening scene didn't much impress me and they should have either made it more impacting or just cut it completely. Overall though, this movie is BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL and gets my 7/10 rating. I hope more people will agree with my points of view on this one and really give it a shot. Any horror fan will not be disappointed. Thanks for the time."

"analogeist83","9","1","2","10 March 2006"," Spectacular horror experience
","I am always wary of remakes of classic horror films, but this version of the Hills Have Eyes did not disappoint. First of all, the soundtrack was fantastic. The sounds really gave the feel of reality being eaten away by radiation while the orchestral parts gave a powerful emotional underscore to the scenes. Although the movie starts off slow, the action picks up at a pace that is neither too slow, nor too jarring. Even as someone who has seen a lot of horror movies, I was made rather uncomfortable by some of the nasty situations, but I still found myself cheering for the hero as he battled the evil mutants. This is probably because I am a registered Democract and also happen to sell cell phones for a living, and thus can relate to him rather well. The political aspects of the film are in the same commentary realm as that of George Romero. I don't often find myself on the edge of my seat much anymore in the theaters, but The Hills Have Eyes really gave me my money's worth. If you can stomach it, go see this film as soon as possible."

Kill is a funny word because this will kill 2 hours of your life and countless brain cells that could have been done drinking. Believe me, the hangover from a binge would be nothing compared to the agony of seeing this movie. There really are no central bad guys which bothers me because it seems like they can just pull someone evil out of the air whenever they want to. Fat guy, big head main evil guy, rapist guy, and creepy hair guy are all formulaic villains that you've been scared of before and in much better movies.

Seemingly there is no originality in movie making any more and the only way to get people to watch is to fill it with any and all manner of atrocities and label it as entertainment.<br/><br/>The Hills have Eyes is yet another in a long line of unnecessary movies that try to convince the world that the U.S is full of inbred and radiation affected cannibals and murderers preying on countless hapless tourists and somehow successfully managing to get away with it for generations. While the 1977 version was done at a time when a story such as this was more intriguing, without the copious amounts of gore, this updated version just comes off as stupid and predictable.<br/><br/>Apparently from the the end of the second world war and the early 60's, there were hundreds of nuclear tests complete with the obligatory government denial about genetic defects caused by the fallout. As the movie starts we get historical footage of nuclear tests done in the pacific (nowhere near New Mexico) as well as desert tests with mock towns etc. Spliced in with this footage are random shots of deformed babies in jars and mutated limbs and you can tell that there'd be more than a few people who'd think all this is real, just like the alleged based on true event stories like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or House of 1000 Corpses and dozens of movies like them. <br/><br/>Movie starts with a scientific team collecting samples in an irradiated area for testing purposes and they are all killed off by an unknown, abnormally strong killer using a pick-axe. We are then introduced to the group of unsuspecting victims, a family and their 2 dogs who stop at a, (now wait for it), a gas station! Just in case you didn't see that coming; and who is it who greets them? That's right, it's the unkempt and rather odd acting attendant. Do we have mobile phone coverage? Anyone care to take a guess? Of course we don't. One of them actually mentions that there's cell coverage over 97% of the country and they're in the remaining 3%. It's amazing how often that happens. <br/><br/>What comes next so obvious a blind person can see it coming. Family has no idea where they really are or where they're going, the ""helpful"" attendant tells them about a shortcut, so of course they decide to take it and not stay on the nice sealed road, tires blow out due to a hidden spike trap, both men go off in different directions, ones finds a massive impact crater with multiple abandoned vehicles indicating that an unusual amount of people have all disappeared in the same area and no one in authority has bothered to really look for them, the other guy ends up back at the gas station and finds newspaper clippings about mysterious disappearances despite all the cars, caravans, boats etc being in the open and easily visible from the air.<br/><br/>The family ends up being attacked, several members are tortured and killed, the baby is kidnapped and the remainder of the movie is a random assortment of violent acts perpetrated by both sides as the remaining family members tries to stay alive long enough to get away in relatively one piece.<br/><br/>Overall, I just can't see why a movie like this even needs to be made or re-imagined and in my opinion, while this updated version isn't a direct scene by scene duplicate, there is nothing here that really ads to or compliments the source material. It's the same as some faceless DJ running an old pop song through a computer and ""creating"" a soulless dance track; you didn't do anything except suck the guts out of it. If this were an original movie, albeit based on a derivative idea, it'd probably be worse. For some reason the abandoned nuclear testing town still full of mannequin residents, cars, indoor furniture and fixtures has amazingly been hooked up to a generator so they can watch TV. While these towns were designed to simulate the real thing, having TV's that not only work, yet can also receive broadcasts sends an already unbelievable premise hurtling into absurdity. <br/><br/>We're being led to believe that genetically mutated and misshapen cannibals who can barely string 2 words together, can set elaborate traps, evade detection for decades, can conceive children or look after abducted children, construct working generators and working appliances all while subsisting on nothing more than human bodies. Not only is it impossible, it doesn't even work as a piece of fiction. I can see more believability in the existence of Superman, seeing as he was at least alien, than I can in radiation from nuclear testing creating a family of stunted and yet super-intelligent freaks. I get that all artistic work is inspired from something else and is therefore derivative of what came before, but I hate it when there is practically no creative input into ripping off a story that's already been done and done better and then accepting kudos for making it worse. I guess this version will appeal to fans of gore and sadly not much else."
"vincentcrusifix","2","2","7","13 March 2012"," There are RULES to Making a Good Horror Film
","The ONLY reason this movie deserves two stars, is because of just how entertaining it was to watch the baby's father stab some mutant in the head with the American flag. That's it. No other reason.<br/><br/>There are a few reasons this movie is not a good horror movie. A lot of people have mentioned about how the villainous mutant freaks are unrealistic, and thus not scary or anything else for that matter except for disturbing, and I definitely have to agree with that. <br/><br/>The thing that REALLY ruined this movie though, was the scripting. Every single one of the characters were completely ignorant to everything going on around them, and made just plain stupid decisions. If you are stranded in the middle of the desert, and your dog runs off, do you chase after it for more than a mile off of the main road, when you know there are dangerous animals around? When you SEE that your dog is dead and gutted, do you say nothing to your family until it is too late, not ONLY that, but run after your other dog who runs away too, and then run outside to an OBVIOUS fake barking person's voice and letting your family be attacked while you prove your own stupidity? This is NOT realistic! And this is only one person's mistakes! Don't get me started on the Brother in law who has no peripheral vision and runs past his sister in law being raped right across the room from him, and can't tell when a burning man is crispy enough that it doesn't matter anymore and he needs to give up and help the family. ...you don't stab a man in the leg who has a gun, UNLESS you have someone ready to take him out the second that you do. This movie just keeps playing on the character's stupidity to make this a 'scary' movie, which it is absolutely not in the slightest. And I think the worst part was seeing the ex cop shooting blindly into the night because he 'heard voices', and then got into his car without checking his back seat. HOW STUPID DOES THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FILM THINK WE ARE?! <br/><br/>To make a movie scary, you need intelligent characters who are -just- dumb enough to fall for a few things. You can't just let them be complete morons. They need to be relate-able, otherwise you never feel anything about them dying or their plight. This film was a piece of garbage. Not really worth anyone's time, although if you put up with the ridiculousness of it all, it may be a decent time passer."
"stevetseitz","2","2","7","16 March 2006"," Reprehensible and abhorrently manipulative film-making
","O.K. Three showers later and I'm in a state where I can analyze this gruesome, disgusting, piece of trash. If this movie hadn't had some scares and shock moments, I would have rated it even lower. Aside from a brutal first attack and clever decoy tactic using a horrific human barbecue (Does Ted Levine have to moan in every film?) it was predictable and formulaic.<br/><br/>This movie was very manipulative and over-done. A great filmmaker could get the point across simply by letting the narrative depict the horror of a helpless baby and a teenage girl being trapped inside a trailer with two savage mutated freaks. Here, we have very average filmmakers so they resort to actually showing the events transpiring within. And what are those events? <br/><br/>The two savage mutated freaks dry-hump and terrorize the girl and act threateningly towards the baby. OOOOOOOH! Excuse me while I'm not shocked. Lesson: Don't go through the motions of shocking us without any actual shock. <br/><br/>Let's be clear: Shock is distinct from repulsiveness: Putting a child in harm's way and having a mutated freak breast-feed off a lactating woman while aiming a revolver at a baby is lower than most would stoop. Yes it's repulsive, but so is watching someone take a crap on stage or lick up vomit. It's beneath Wes Craven. <br/><br/>Besides, everyone in the audience knew you wouldn't actually have the cajones to go through with the worst of it. <br/><br/>Few movies actually make me mad. I can usually stay casually detached and objectively observant without seeing through the tactics so clearly. This movie made me mad. It insulted my intelligence. I could see what the director was trying to do a mile away and it was frustrating to watch as the fuse was lit only to have the bomb go off too soon.<br/><br/>I liked the allusions to ""Straw Dogs"" with the broken glasses etc. The ""Total-nerd-turned-scrappy-survivor"" was a neat idea and the transformation was well handled. <br/><br/>It always strikes me as funny how expert killers turn all thumbs in climactic showdowns. David slays Goliath so often in these glorified B-pictures that the betting line in Vegas always favors the little guy. <br/><br/>A great horror movie will have three elements: <br/><br/>1. Good shocks and scare moments 2. an overall pervasive sense of dread 3. abstract conceptual terror<br/><br/>This movie had all three elements but none were executed deftly or properly fleshed out. The shocks did come but were routine (Uhhh, guys? The fast sillouette moving by the camera has been done about a million times before!) The sense of dread was palpable in the first act, with just enough friction in the family to make it seem realistic, but enough family chemistry to make you dread what was going to happen. The abstract conceptual terror was that of human evolution or mutation due to radioactivity, but it was a poor rationale for the events depicted in the film."
"VampiressSara","1","2","7","13 March 2006"," not horror
","The movie could have been really good, leaving out the RAPE of a teenage girl, and the MOLESTATION on a women, right in front of a BABY. That part of the movie could have been left out completely. Now a days everyone has to take it up an extra notch just to make it ""scary"" or ""fun to watch"" so we don't get bored. TV and movies have numbed our minds to the point where we have to see something to horrible in order to be entertained. There is a difference between an entertaining movie whether it be horror, comedy, or action, and wrong. This movie is not for children and not for women or men who have been sexually abused, this movie needs to have Sexual violence in its ""r rating"" details, so people have a better understanding of the movie they are about to see."
"sparky_8_83","1","2","7","13 March 2006"," A terrible waste of time and money
","I really like gory, horrific, and scary movies, but this movie was senseless. Some horror movies are plausible, they can actually be somewhat believable. Yes it is true that those affected by radiation would look like that, but just because you look weird doesn't mean that you have to be a freak and kill everything you see and eat the insides! Sure they may be mad, but that doesn't mean they kill everyone. The plot wasn't well set out, there wasn't very much suspense, and the behavior of the ""boom babies"" ,as I call them, in the trailer was too disgusting to watch. I have a short attention span and this movie didn't have enough of a gripping plot to keep me interested. The Hills Have Eyes contains too much senselessness to constitute a star in my opinion. I rated it a ""black hole"" because like a black hole it sucks."

","My husband and I love to go see a good horror film every once and a while. Although I hate to see animals die I can take it, however, bringing a helpless BABY (less than a year old) in to this movie was just plain uncalled for. I paid $16 to see this movie and had to walk out mid scene because I was so terrified for the little baby. It was just a huge killing scene and I could not handle it. My husband warned me it was kinda like a TX Chainsaw movie, but believe me I can handle TX Chainsaw Massacre, this movie though, I could not! If you carry any kind of emotions, this is not a movie you want to see or at least pay to see. Rent it so you can turn it off or fast forward through those parts in the film!"

There's not much character development EXCEPT for our boy Doug, who was, in the end, the saving grace of this film.<br/><br/>I mean the film was utterly boring because the characters were stupid enough to root for the mutants aaaand the villains were predictable, not scary and kinda funny. BUT, boy oh boy did Doug make an 180 degree turn and all hell broke loose.

"skybrick736","8","1","3","18 September 2016"," The Hills Have Eyes (8/10)
","Director Alexandra Aja had a lot riding on his own Hills Have Eyes film and he certainly did not ruin his rep by remaking this film. In the grand scheme of the horror genre, Aja's Hills Have Eyes is one of the best remakes out there. It was true to the original with a very similar plot but it added some different twist and cool scenes along the way. The town scene, which is a unique idea to the nuclear subplot, is very gory and tense. One negative thing compared to the original is how deformed the mutants are. The mutants are too unrealistic looking, with no distinguishable features, the original gave a way better image. Also, the last five seconds is a big let-down, it's low class sometimes how horror movies try to make it interesting and set itself up for a sequel. Still, the 2006 modern version of The Hills Have Eyes is a big hit and one of the better horror films of that decade."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","9","1","3","17 November 2015"," One of the better remakes
","Traveling through the New Mexico desert, a family finds the area home to a group of deformed mountain-men hunting in the area and must find a way to escape from the ravenous, blood-thirsty psychos.<br/><br/>Overall this was quite the enjoyable effort that works better than the original. Among its great points is the rather hyped up amount of tension and suspense this one generates which makes it a far more enjoyable effort. The early scenes of the group out amongst the endless desert dunes under the blazing sunlight or the quick glimpses of them running around the cliffs while the victims are all completely unaware of their presence rare quite chilling, and even other tactics employed here as the glinting metal in the distance, strange grunting or being seen through the binoculars really let this one be known someone' watching them. All of this desert set-up perfectly allows the intense horror action to have a much bigger impact here as those are among the film's best here with the utterly impactful and dynamic van attack sequence. This is exceptionally fun here with a slew of utterly dark and morbid antics from the attempted rape and baby-theft to killing off the mothers all the while the others are distracted by their blazing companion outside, and all together the chaos, action and brutal activity create a spectacular highlight scene. There's a lot more fun here in the last half following up on the attack with plenty of tense stalking through the hills and tunnels before getting to the abandoned town as the walk-through here is just utterly chilling waiting for something to occur within the set-up of the dolls laid out in the town before the big action scenes through the brutal brawling in the house and the final fight in the hills where the brutality comes into even greater degrees where there's plenty of graphic bloodletting and frantic action that makes for plenty of good times here that really makes this so fun with the frantic pace making for quite the exiting time. Along with the creepy and utterly deformed look of the creatures and the truly brutal kills that are far more graphic and bloody than expected, all of these efforts manages to hold off the film's one real flaw here. The fact that this one spoon-feeds us the back-story of their genetic mutation history a second time here after doing so for the very of beginning of this one tends to really drag the film down in a crucial part of the film and lowers their mystique quite a bit by making them rather bland and nondescript during their time here. Overall, this issue is all that hold this one back.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Rape, animal violence and constant children-in-jeopardy."
"Evanoil","7","1","3","27 July 2015"," Scary , shocking , interesting!
","I would describe this title as mainly horror fan movie . It could be a tense movie for everyone if it wasn't so gory and shocking in some scenes. Don't get me wrong , it doesn't crosses any red lines or something like that but some of the scenes isn't a thing you see in every horror title. Gladly this movie has a descent score on the site , one that i actually almost agree with so this movie doesn't get underrated for some stupid reasons. The cast is good and the plot is good too even though its not an original one , The tension is kept through all of the movie since the beginning of the action till the credits . I guess this is one of few remakes that is actually better than the original."

I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened. Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge, we could see something like this for real. We may not, but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting, too.<br/><br/>Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own. He gave an outstanding performance, and I want to see more of him. Vinessa Shaw, Dan Byrd, and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable. hey, they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine)."

","The Hills Have Eyes is known as 'one of the most disturbing horror films since The Chainsaw Massacre - 1987' Well, I agree. Mearly - I think THHE is much worse then the entry of TCM. I found this film quite boring at the start in which I was going to turn it off but then as the action started I sat comfy in my seat and was looking forward to it! Two words 'Disturbing, Messed-Up' - I thought the action and blood parts were to over whelming and the idea of sexual violence, contact from Mutant to Human and the man on the burning tree was disgusting. The baby scene also radically disturbed me as I have a baby sister myself and if something like that was to happen I wouldn't be worrying about my own life. To be honest, animals being killed doesn't all bother me but I thought BBFC strictly banned animals being suggestively hurt in any kind of films. But maybe I was wrong. I think the writer of this film was just plain sick and twisted and I hit myself for watching this film as it has truly disturbed me. I'm not sure if I should watch The Hills Have Eyes 2 yet but I'm thinking as I bought the Movie Box Set..."

","This is great movie. It's definitely not the scariest movie you will ever see but it is very disturbing and some scenes will make you want to throw up. I'm not going to list the scenes like this but there are a lot! It's a splatter horror, so it's not the sort of film that would keep me awake at night, but it's not a nice film. I would recommend it to watch with friends to freak everyone out, but this film is definitely worth watching!<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>The film starts good and you can hardly predict what happens until they reach the gas station. When the man directs them to the hills you know whats going to happen. In this part of the film, you desperately want to tell the family not to go that way. After a while when the car stops, the disturbing part starts. The mutants faces are terrifying!<br/><br/>Really good film, watch it! I would not recommend it for people under 13 or people that hate seeing people get tortured."

So if you liked the original there's a good chance that you'll like the remake, but many things have been redone and have been terrible, but this one is great.<br/><br/>I sat watching this movie in disbelief of how good it was, i didn't expect it to be so good, but it was. You can say blah de blah you think this is a good movie what about Halloween that's way better!

","I recently re-watched this Aja movie to give it another chance before I see his latest horror project, Piranha 3D, and I must admit it thoroughly impressed me as a truly frightening and intense movie. I originally would have given it a 5/10, which it deserves more than.<br/><br/>I'll start with the pros, which are numerous. The cinematography is gorgeous in the desert and is something I missed on my first viewing. Every single fear you could possibly have while driving through the desert is explored. The isolation, the potentially lethal wrong turns, the creepy locals, traveling with innocent animals and a baby, (Spoiler) getting raped (End Spoiler), getting in a car accident, etc. All of these are amped up to the extreme. The gore is well done, and over the top, but not in a comic way. It is done so realistically that it is actually frightening and frightens you. The chase scenes and the death scenes are suspenseful and intense. They have you on the edge of your seat, widening your eyes in terror and fear, and giving you an adrenaline rush that you love having while watching a 'scary movie'.<br/><br/>The cons. Despite it's many pros it does have a few cons. The kills seem spaced out in odd places. And my only other complaint is that the actors weren't always believable, but they all played their parts well.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie to watch. I feel very stupid to not have recognized this on my first time view, as I'm sure with the first experience it would have been in my Favorites list."

Shot in Morocco, of all places. Ted Levine of MONK fame plays the dad, and the cast is peppered with several other familiar faces. The only problem with this remake, we've seen this story played out in so many movies over the years, most recently WRONG TURN and, to a lesser extent, the remake of HOUSE OF WAX. So it becomes more difficult to offer up something new or different by way of shock or scares. The final battle between human and a really ugly, really big bad boy is a winner, however."

The Hills Have Eyes is geared for a teen audience and never lets you forget it. It's laughably bad. The acting is just a smidge above House of 1000 Corpses and the directing is possibly worse (if that's possible). The cinematography (hardee-har-har) is like an MTV music video of the lowest quality and just as irritating (jump cuts and illogical angles and edits). The characters are just stupid (both enemies and heroes) and I was just hoping everyone would drink poison and die together in the first five minutes and end the pain.

","As the film is ""spoiled"", so is my review full of Spoilers.<br/><br/>I must admit up front that I gave up after an hour. Of course, I was hoping the family would be massacred before my boredom threshold was reached, but no such luck.<br/><br/>There is nothing subtle about this film regarding character development, plotting or ""creation"" of suspense, of which there is absolutely no suspense whatsoever. We are deluged almost from the start with interactions between family members and all too soon get to meet, in daylight, the evil radiation diseased coal-mining monsters.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't really give a hoot about this boring family, but the director apparently coerced the screen writers to pad this film to the hilt giving us all the clichéd characters under the sun. The family is a caricature of the generation gap and political polarization which has existed since before the Constitution was written up.<br/><br/>Let's see, the dad's a private eye who haphazardly fires his gun at oxygen molecules and then gets into a vehicle during a duress causing scenario, in the dark of night, without looking in the back seat first. Brilliant screen writing, but I was bored to tears way before this scene.<br/><br/>Oh yes, let's not forget that mister private eye, whose job it is to find people, has led his family into a completely deserted desert which was used by the government for atomic weapons testing.<br/><br/>The son, influenced by his father's gun-toting antics, is portrayed as freaked out after finding one of his dogs guts ripped open and yet wanders off the main ""camp site"" alone, at night, without his gun.<br/><br/>The mentally deranged gas-station attendant has, gasp, almost no teeth and looks not at all affected by radiation poisoning like the others of his ilk do. Mr. gas-pump spends about 10 really dull minutes with the family pumping their vehicle with gasoline, and telling them exactly how to proceed to their destination. After an impromptu scene where he suspects they might find out he's a deranged gas-pump attendant with cannibalistic tendencies, he then proceeds to guide the family in the direct opposite direction. And Mr. private eye listens!<br/><br/>By the way, who delivers the gasoline to the gas-station in the middle of an area abandoned by and forbidden by the U.S. government? Who delivers the food and drinks to this diner in no man's land?<br/><br/>The nuclear coal-mining victims are portrayed as wild, mindless cannibals, yet know how to fire weapons, gut out dogs and outwit stupid families who listen to the gas-stop attendant who thankfully finally shoots his brains out almost half-way through the film.<br/><br/>The son-in-law is a peace loving democrat who sells cell phones and won't pick up a gun, but will venture out, at night, without a gun, to search for mr. private eye with mr. private eye's son.<br/><br/>Apparently, my suspension of disbelief failed me."

The plot is that mineworkers from the desert is living in a old nuclear testing area and has become degenerated and runs around with pike axes and kills tourists while uttering lame noises ""brrroohh"". In my movie opinion this places it self very much below average due to the bad story, clipping, acting and lines. It does not have the tease and exiting element of SAW 1,2,3 nor does it have the shock effect of other decent horror movies.

"spittle8","1","1","3","30 April 2007"," Repugnant garbage
","As a spoiler warning, the following may give away minor details of the violent acts contained in the movie. Nothing to spoil your viewing.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I think anyone who enjoys this movie should be taken out of society, or heavily medicated. I've seen some disturbing movies before, but for sheer repulsiveness, this takes the cake, and then some. Some of the scenes were utterly indefensible in their depravity, and no healthy individual can benefit from viewing these scenes.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around some vacationing folk who take a wrong turn in the desert, and it slowly escalates. Once the movie hits its peak of violence, there's enough horrors to truly shock you. I can take severely graphic gore. If you planned on watching this film at any time, I take it you can, as well.<br/><br/>What makes this movie different from other films that capitalize on gore is that this movie combines relatively severe gore with truly horrific situations. They combine two things: extreme violence, and unfathomable human suffering. Gore can be used effectively in a movie, and human suffering is key to many movies, but when movie makers take maximum human suffering of a physical and emotional nature, combine it with gore and disturbing visuals, they've gone too far.<br/><br/>What plot exists is bland and amateurish on its own, and certainly can't make up for the repugnant scenes that is the crux of the movie. If you're turned on by the idea of a woman being brutally raped by a monster, or a person being put through unbelievable physical pain, crying in agony, then you will enjoy this film, but I imagine a snuff film, which this essentially is, might be a better choice. If you are not interested in such things, then pass, as the heart of this movie is nothing more than human suffering and unnecessary evil. This isn't an intelligent movie like 'The Exorcist' that disturbs with imagery and sounds of a more spiritual nature, nor is it an enjoyable survival movie like 'Dawn of the Dead (2004)', that uses gore effectively and has a passable plot, entertaining while not truly disturbing you with over-the-top viciousness and torture.<br/><br/>In short, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I am disgusted and concerned that people could make a movie like this and get it into theaters, and turn a buck. I an individuals right to freedom of speech, but when people create this kind of schlock, that serves no purpose whatsoever and can do only harm, then I really believe that such voices must be stifled. This movie is really that bad..."

","I viewed this thing over the weekend on the recommendation of an acquaintance whose judgment is now seriously in question. I can only assume that the agents for the name stars were not shown the full script or REALLY needed a paycheck. * SPOILER ALERT * At the point where the mutants have entered the trailer, raped the youngest daughter, molested the older daughter before shooting her in the head I was ready to give up on it. If I had been in a theater, I would have walked out and demanded a refund. Since I was watching a borrowed DVD, I stuck it out to the end to see if there was any redemption. Not much. The concept of an isolated mini-civilization made up of radiation-damaged mutants is a potentially interesting story, but in this film this storyline is is relegated to a sub-story. The primary focus in this film is gratuitous violence for the mere sake of gratuitous violence for apparently little or no reason. If this is your ""cup of tea"", then enjoy. If you prefer good writing and some semblance of viable storyline, look elsewhere."
"peter-2212","2","1","3","13 December 2006"," Lots of blood and thats the end of the good parts
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>If you are into bloody gutsy movies full of gore and general unpleasantness then this is going to be an hour and fifty minutes fairly well spent. The whole thing for me was ruined however by one simple oversight on the shock factor: The film avoids all violence towards animals, except a few flagrantly staged punches toward a dog hanging off someones arm, yet feels comfortable enough to show a long rape scene with an infant baby in the foreground.<br/><br/>Now, on the scale of bad things, whats worse? Brutal rape or hurting an animal? Even the most sadistic torture you could perform to an animal is less bad on the karmic scale than beating and raping a young girl. Ask anyone, they will likely agree unless they work for PETA.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film is generally a ""I really hope someone, just let it be anyone, dies soon"" kind of experience with one massive bout of killing followed by one massive bout of suspense. Not the good kind though, its the kind where you just want something to happen. Anything will do. Aliens invading, Skippy telling us that Joey has fallen down a mineshaft... anything! You just stop caring about who is going to die next or who is going to get hurt. How much can you care about someone getting whacked with a pan after you've just seen someone get shot through the head point blank? Half way through the movie its really hard to even care what happens. After most of the characters are just straight up brutally killed, its hard to relate to the people left alive, and its even harder to stay emotionally attached to them since half the ""good"" guys have been killed in one swoop. After that point you expect everything thats going to happen, even if you cant tell what its going to be.<br/><br/>I have to also add that anyone who has been shot in the stomach and the throat - twice - with a shotgun is certainly never going to be able to stand up let alone draw breath. The same shotgun had been used earlier in the film to blow a guys head clean off, yet three hits with it in what some people would describe as ""critical areas"" leaves one mutant freak with enough gall and resolve to stand up and aim the damn gun right back for revenge! After watching that, I was surprised that the guy who took an axe to the head didn't get back into the action and start gnawing peoples knees or something. In a film like this realism is something thats only really broadly skirted, but two hits to the throat with a shotgun usually means that even if you head is somehow still attached that you would bleed to death in about ten seconds. THe very action of standing up would have squirted half the guys blood out through his neck from the change in blood pressure.<br/><br/>I have to say that Im less than impressed. For bloodbaths, its pretty good... people die, there's lots of blood. There's a fair amount of shock in it too. As for this being a good film... this isn't one. Bloodbaths usually have at least some degree of emotional attachment to the characters, this one has none. Whatever was built at the start is utterly ruined by the killing spree, and whatever is left after that is certainly not enough to give a damn about the ending."

I think the last time i watched decent horror films was the 'Saw' series. However, this horror film has got to be the most scariest and goriest film ever for 2006. Excellent story, good acting, outstanding special and make up effects, awesome scenes complete with screams and close ups. The story is not original but how it is employed in the film is. The cast are relatively unknowns but they all do a good job in carrying the film. The 'kill' scenes need to be watched on an empty stomach or else you will have an accident in your pants.

Somewhere in the middle of the wasteland they get stranded, and find out there is a truth about bad things happening to people that lived in the desert at the times of the big nuclear tests that were done there.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of the film with the same title from 1977. I must admit I have never seen that one and after seeing this one I might be willing to see that one - usually the originals are a good deal better and this one was okay, almost at least.<br/><br/>The story line is a normal one - very comparable to a lot of films that deal with the same ideas (people getting stranded in the wrong place and then getting slaughtered), but the work out isn't as good as the most of them.

"Super_Fu_Manchu","10","1","3","26 July 2006"," In defense of this flick and remakes in general
","I finally saw this flick unrated (big fan of Aja's debut 'Switchblade Romance', as well as the original 'Hills')... and felt like defending it from the onslaught of abuse it seems to be receiving on these boards.<br/><br/>This movie is everything horror should be. There's suspense, neatly done character work, aesthetically perfect direction, taut editing, balls-to-the-wall gore and a nifty political subtext. There's a strong undercurrent of satire and graveyard wit to this picture that I imagine will float by your average viewer (especially those that have their head up their asses already on the remake front or on the horror front in general). The republican gun-tooter ends up burnt at the stake and impaled in the skull with the American symbol - talk about flag-waver! I saw the scenes in the empty, ghostlike testing houses as a hostile perception of the facade of the American 'nuclear family' by French director Aja - considering the original movie was semi-inspired by the war in Vietnam (at least on a subconscious level), Aja's attempt at bringing some of that subversive element to his version was admirable and subtle.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'd like to say something on remakes. Naturally there are some TERRIBLE remakes - 'The Fog', 'Assault on Precinct 13' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' come to mind as particular offenders in that they totally lost the spirit of the originals, bringing them down to base formulas and clichés, taking away what we loved about them in the first place. However, there are terrible MOVIES too. The last non-remake I saw at the cinema was Superman Returns last week, and it was intolerably bland, charmless, humourless and overwrought in this armchair critic's opinion. It also, aside from being a sequel, followed the Superhero formula so precisely that it may as well have been a remake. On the other hand, Spiderman was great, stylish, entertaining movie-making. My point is there are good movies and bad movies just like there are good remakes and bad remakes. Most of horror retreads old story lines and themes anyway, it's the individual touch that's important. Let's not forget that Cronenberg's 'The Fly' and Carpenter's 'The Thing' are remakes, as are plenty of other great non-horror flicks (Scarface... hell even the original Assault on Precinct 13 is a loose remake of Rio Bravo). Essentially it's down to the skill with which the story is told, even if we've heard it before.<br/><br/>Finally, I admired the gutsy gore in this movie. There were no restraints (at least in the unrated version), and it's clear where Asian cinema has rubbed off. Just as we expect to be taken away from the action, Aja gives us a close-up. I mean I've seen a lot more violent and disturbing movies of course.. but I think horror movies HAVE to take the violence seriously... so many recent horror flicks (remakes or otherwise) have sucked in this department. I even thought Hostel was a BIG cop-out, especially since Eli Roth was so determined to go all out. That movie didn't make me bat an eye. But Hills didn't pull any punches.<br/><br/>Anyway there's my rather lengthy defense. It's actually one of my favourite horror movies of the decade, along with The Descent, Battle Royale, Land of the Dead, Switchblade Romance (minus the ending) and Shaun of the Dead... If you haven't caught it yet, and you like your horror pics, don't miss it."

","In 2006, there is really no need for a film like The Hills Have Eyes. It may be that I've seen the Unrated DVD, but the truth is, when you don't have the ability to scare people, you should stick to other forms of theater.<br/><br/>Instead, what we experience with this film is quite the opposite. They simply can't scare you at all, so instead, they'll offend you, and honestly, they'll thoroughly disturb you.<br/><br/>The fact that the ""Director's Cut"" DVD (Quoted because it was not titled as such, nor is he a director), is quite possibly my most disappointing purchase ever. The rape scene with Brenda was actually so tasteless that I had to watch the last half of the film at another time, and the need to show Big Bob's eyes turn white during his gruesome death scene was just a ridiculous attempt at finding credibility with horror fans .. which is an otherwise lost effort considering how completely not-scary this movie is.<br/><br/>I won't even go into a detailed rant about a scene where you point a gun at an infant, however, mentioning it at all should tell you something.<br/><br/>Save your money. Wait for a real horror movie, not a remake, not a glorified snuff-film (a la House of 1,000 Corpses), and rent/buy something that can scare you without offending your most basic respects for humanity.<br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" .. just more evidence as to why horror movies are regularly snuffed by critics, and proof that American movie-goers have no reason to spend their hard earned money in theaters any more."

The Hills Have Eyes decided on a different approach: They decided to skip the whole ""scary"" thing and go straight for shock and revulsion. The film attempts to be eerie near the beginning without much success, then jumps straight into scenes designed to shock and offend the viewers, in order to evoke a sense of loathing for the antagonists. After watching a particularly gruesome scene that involved rape and murder, I felt disgusted and angry. ..disgusted that I actually paid money for this and angry that I probably won't be able to get a refund.

","I loved the original. I seriously can't decide which one I like more though.<br/><br/>When I was trapped in the desert with my family last summer, and the mutants launched their offensive, my father advised me to maintain a certain degree of weapon proficiency. He told me, ""Son, please don't spray bullets in every direction the minute I catch fire. Take care of your mother, and don't let your sister get raped by radioactive rednecks."" That's what he said.<br/><br/>I never got to use my gun. My sister gave it up willingly, and my Dad probably hitched to Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The Democrat that married my big sister acted a whole lot like the one in the movie. After our faithful canine had effectively saved all our lives by eating two or three atomic gimps, he took him off to the very same suburb that the Hulk grew up in, and promptly locked him in a hot car on a summer day. Then, when the dog attacked the biggest nuclear knucklehead of them all, Jason Schwartzman ran away like the French. The dog got punched, and the frog played Daredevil until the the fight got too stupid to continue.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for anybody that loves icky movies. I loved it.

"Jexxon","2","1","3","8 June 2006"," The Hills Have Two Stars
","OK, I thought the first half of the movie was quite good: atmospheric, building up tension, decent acting, and solid production values. Then comes the cannibal/mutant attack, and every sane thought goes out the window.<br/><br/>From the halfway mark, the characters impressively enough have the skill to make the wrong choice at every possible moment. I guess you could let it slip by if it happened once, but when it happens about fifteen times, then there's no way back on track: Someone killed the dog? Better not tell anyone. Creepy people sneaking around the trailer? Let's ditch it and go watch that fire over there. Your sister screaming in the trailer? Let's head out in the opposite direction. Finally got the upper hand on a crazy cannibal mutant that is kicking your ass? Better run off to the bathroom, so he can gather himself again. Got the drop on a mutant who's eating your mother? Run away, and shoot blindly while running. And so on, and so on ...<br/><br/>Also, the makeup on the mutants was definitely sub-par, and kind of takes you out of the movie when it's supposed to scare you. There's plenty of blood, but the constant sharp-object-in-the-head thing does tend to get tiresome after a while. In the end, the movie feels like some R-rated Lassie movie, because let's face it - the damn dog is the real hero of the movie."

The fact that they blew away the father tied to a pole as a distraction so they could torture Brenda,the daughter,and by torture i mean,hit and rape,is incredible.The feeling i had at that moment was only hatred for the cannibals,i wanted to see them suffer so bad...

The mother comes in,to find a horrid scene,her daughter Brenda,bloody,lying on the bed exhausted,her parrot's Head bitten off, and her elder daughter on the floor,being tortured.The second she tries to pull something off ( i am not sure with what she wanted to hit the maniac ),she gets a bullet in her stomach that blows her on the sofa,which seems at that time,like ""where the hell do u think you're going"".Then,he points the gun straight at Lin's head,then at her sister.This is were a classical brave part comes up,Lin takes a screwdriver,and shows it in his leg,OUCH!He takes the gun and blows her head off,i think that was more painful.Then,they take the baby,and tell Brenda that they will be back...scary!After that,u can leave it to Lin's husband and Beast,the dog.They go to the miner's town,looking for revenge,and they rip them off!I can't even start to describe how well,and realistic the killing scenes are made.What is cool,is that he takes a short American flag,and like a killing move,shoves it in Pluto's throat,then u can hear one of the coolest tunes that u can put in a horror movie,which has no tension in it.The same tune,i think they use for the end of the movie,where u see him coming back with the dog and the baby.Lucky ending,hum,not sure.But i hope that they don't make a sequel,at least,if they have to make it,the director has to be Aja,he is the best there is at the moment. Plus,the acting is incredible,who would expect those actors to give such feelings to the moment?It rocks when Lin's husband get's to the point where he goes rampage and starts killing each miner brutally.

The original is a tight examination of how the ""civilised"" can be brutalized to base human instinct and vengeance. The new version is a sloppy statement of how much the French really hate Americans... As much as I usually agree, it feels forced, like having your teacher b**** at you over your older brothers behavior.

I even once thought i was going to be sick.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good film if you like your scary stuff this is one to watch! None of that teen slasher rubbish either!"
"bomber_2003","8","1","3","23 March 2006"," About Time, A Decent Horror Flick...
","This has to be one of my favourite horror films of recent times, along with Final Destination 3. What makes this movie stand out is that it goes further than most movies, making the viewer so scared and then firing a violent death at them. Very disturbing and gruesome ones may i add.<br/><br/>To begin with, this movie started out like a standard horror/suspense flick. Building up all the tension with some nicely placed scares. Then after all the horror, comes a violent revenge film. Thats probably what made me love this, is that it doesn't stick to death after death of dumb/helpless people - they finally fight back! To be honest, I was expecting more violence and explicit scenes with all the hype. But i guess thats saved for an Uncut DVD :D I recommend this for any Horror lover out there who would finally like to see something that feels original, is actually scary and makes you feel sorry for victims.<br/><br/>10 Stars."

","Trash, pure trash. The initial story line about a family traveling through the desert who encounters poor mountain dwellers who just happen to be genetic mutants didn't sound too bad. I didn't bargain on what Wes Craven delivered in this repugnant flick. Rape, forced breastfeeding, and torched daddies were only punctuated by a relatively undeveloped plot that could have used a bit more story and a little less gore. Not only do I feel as though I just wasted $10.00 and two hours of my life, (which my movie-going companions point out can never be regained...), but I think I might be permanently damaged from enduring such garbage. Well done horror, such as Seven, can be tolerated and even appreciated. The Hills Have Eyes made me want to gouge mine out."
"Roverthemoon25","8","1","3","16 March 2006"," Opinion of a non horror fan
","I was in Glasgow for about 4 hours and went to the cinema to see what films were showing and there wasn't much choice of films that were starting shortly. I decided that I would go and see The Hills Have Eyes as it seemed the best option to kill a couple of hours (no pun intended). Now as my summery says I'm not a real big horror fan and I didn't even know that this was a remake until I read the reviews on here, I have only watched a handful of horror movies like Nightmare on Elm St and People Under The Stairs, the latter of which I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>This movie is about a family who are told of a short cut through a desert road by a garage attendant, the family are headed by a former cop Bob Carter, his wife is Ethel and they have 3 children Bobby ,Brenda and their oldest daughter Lynne who is married to mobile phone salesman Doug who have a baby called Catherine.<br/><br/>Their journey on the short cut road id sabotaged and they find themselves stranded, but they are not alone in the desert as there is a family of deformed mutants who live in a area which had been used in the 60's for testing nuclear bombs. As night falls the mutants attack the family and in a quick succession of events which include burning, rape ,murder and the abduction of baby Catherine the family finds themselves down to just 3 members ( 4 if you include the dog).<br/><br/>We then get to the point where if it were a Seagal or Arnie movie that it's time to kick some ass and mild mannered Doug who is assisted with the dog goes in search of the mutants and his baby. He finds the mutants small town and goes in search of his baby, what follows is a bloodbath as Doug gets revenge and with the help of a mutant girl gets his baby back. Doug meets back up with Bobby and Brenda and the closing shot is that somebody is watching them, so the hills maybe still have eyes and the possibility for a sequel.<br/><br/>My opinion is that is a good horror movie once it gets going, and maybe I should take a look at the original to see how the 2 compare."
"ExpendableMan","4","1","3","15 March 2006"," So derivative it hurts
","There comes a point when the latest trend sweeping Hollywood falls into a specific pattern. Innovation becomes a stereotype and movie after movie seems to simply retread ground already worked by it's predecessors. Genres become stale and boring and right now, it's happening to the old-school Horror film. When movies like Wrong Turn originally came out, their depictions of sadistic brutality and unrelenting violence were a breath of fresh air compared to the waves of little Japanese girls getting Naomi Watts all worked up, but with The Hills Have Eyes the ideal has become overworked, stale and predictable.<br/><br/>Set in the deserts of New Mexico, this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven movie features an American family on a road trip to California who find themselves falling afoul of a group of mutant rednecks warped by the radiation from atom bomb tests in the area for generations. And as we all know, not only are rednecks bad, but nuclear radiation also causes super strength, high pain tolerance and an insatiable desire for human flesh.<br/><br/>From here on in, the movie seems to be on a single-track mission to outdo all the violence the genre has thrown up recently and in this, it certainly succeeds. The initial assault on the family trailer is horribly graphic but unlike the previously mentioned Wrong Turn, here it seems to go a bit far, as if the director is having too much fun lingering the camera on the sight of a woman being raped while her mother gets a hole blown in her chest only inches away. Sure, there is some fun to be had when one of the protagonists goes nuts and fights back in suitably vicious ways in the second half, but witnessing the earlier scenes is neither scary or entertaining, it's just unpleasant.<br/><br/>This isn't the only problem either. In typical Hollywood fashion, the intended scares are mostly created by quick jump shots to disturbing images or by trying to make you jolt out of your seat by having something surprise one of the characters and playing a loud blast on the speakers at the same time. There's even the pre-requisite redneck gas station attendant who could have warned them of the danger and obligatory ""finding the cars of all the previous victims"" scene that's appeared in nigh on every single horror film since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Wonder if there'll be a hint towards a sequel at the ending...well dur...<br/><br/>To put it simply, this is not a great film. The second half is entertaining enough but unfortunately for Wes and co, it's a case of seen it before too many times. If Hostel and Slither are really going to jump-start the horror genre into unexpected realms of extremity later this year, they're going to have to pull a few pretty impressive surprises out the bag."
"johnfrancisco1987","5","1","3","14 March 2006"," I wish I didn't have eyes
","Maybe that's a bit harsh. This was a bog-standard formulaic horror flick. Even if you hadn't seen the original, from the first minute of the movie onwards you would know the storyline, recognise when the jump scenes would be, and to be blunt you'd have a pretty accurate idea of how the film was going to end.<br/><br/>That in itself is not necessarily a criticism. I knew full well what I was going to see. I wasn't expecting bucket loads of originality, but I was expecting something more than a few folk in masks going ""arrrrgh"" as they chase after a character.<br/><br/>If I didn't know better I would have assumed certain scenes were spoofs (shots of our hero from below with sky whizzing past; shots of our hero with baby in one hand and dog leash in other; the German shepherd saving the day; beating a mutant with a shotgun - that's what you use one for, right? - then dropping it right next to the mutant that we all 'believed' was dead; etc etc).<br/><br/>However, I must defend one aspect. I'm actually quite shocked to find so many people found the gore over the top, sick, twisted, or depraved. To me at least, it seemed particularly standard fare. Also, unless the UK showed the scene with something removed, which I doubt, the rape scene was fairly tame and inoffensive.<br/><br/>All in all there is nothing memorable about the Hills."
"drownnnsoda","9","1","3","12 March 2006"," Best Horror Remake So Far? I'd Say So.
","I have seen many horror movies in my day, and this is by far one of the nastiest, most intense horror movies I think I've ever seen. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake follows the Carter family, who are on their way to California. After taking advice from an old gas-station attendant (bad mistake), they take a shortcut that supposedly goes through the hill and hits the freeway from there. Unfortunately, they hit some bumps in the road, and their tires are blown out after driving over a string of spikes. The father sets out to get help, and the oldest sister's husband goes in the other direction for help. As night falls, the family starts getting hunted down by a crazy family of deformed cannibals, and the blood starts to flow - like a river.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja (who brought us the brutal French horror flick, ""High Tension"") gives the remake some new folds that make it a bit more interesting and different from the original, although most of the film is very similar to Craven's original film. We get more of a back story on the mutant cannibals, and it turns out that they were descendants of miners who were exposed to radiation when the U.S. government conducted nuclear tests in the New Mexico desert. Another addition to the film is their residence, and in the remake they inhabit a town filled with mannequins that was used in the testing on how nuclear weapons would affect communities.<br/><br/>The acting here is excellent, and the whole cast does a great job at invoking terror and dread as we see them go through an unimaginable situation. I actually felt bad for the family, it's hard to even imagine yourself in a situation like that. The cannibals are new and improved, and even more violent and insane this time around - the makeup is great and they look really disgusting. While they are much less human-like than in the original, they are scary nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is probably the best remake I've yet to see. Beware though, it is very brutal and violent. There was actually someone who threw up in my theater, so those with weak stomachs probably shouldn't watch it. To sum it up, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a wild ride, filled with intense violence, insanity, and terror. Aja does the original film justice. I'll give it a nine, pushing a ten. 9/10."
"caseago","3","1","3","11 March 2006"," Not even close to the original
","I was very excited to see this remake, especially since the original was such a classic, and boy was I disappointed. The acting was stiff, the mutants almost laughable and the plot quickly degenerated into a predictable farce. The scenery was beautiful and the dogs Beauty and Beast were exceptional, but Wes Craven made a monumental mistake typically seen in remakes of classics. He went for the gore effect instead of sticking with what works- suspense. The boy Bobby was to young for that role, the mother was unbelievable and the brother in law, Doug, a stand up guy in the original, was a whiny pedophile, with his obscene stares at the younger sister. I am not sure how Craven felt this advanced the movie, but it made me look away. The scene in the trailer where the mutant is suckling Lynns breast while the others look on was my final straw. I am half considering sending Mr Craven a request for my money back, as I feel like i was ripped off by this cheap trashy remake of a classic horror film. I own the original, signed by Mr Craven, but would not even consider renting the remake."

","A previous reviewer is going to be wasting A LOT of money if he goes back to see this movie.

I was working all day yesterday and decided to catch the last showing at 9:50 after I got off of work. It was obvious people had to get their late-night scary movie fix, because this was the only sold out showing of the day. Anyway, let me describe the movie for you.<br/><br/>-SPOILERS- The first time you see the beings that live in the hills makes you laugh and think of ""The Goonies."" I swear the whole theater began to chuckle, and I heard someone yell ""Hey, you guys!"" The beings were just hard to look at. The director did a good job, however, in making me sit in my seat and just want them dead! The whole theater actually cheered at the part where the one being gets stabbed in the head with the American flag. You're telling me that's horror when a theater full of people cheer? You've got to be kidding me. <br/><br/><ul><li>MORE SPOILERS- I'm sorry, but this movie is not the best horror movie ever. The last 10 seconds, which are nothing but the survivors walking through the desert, are not the best 10 seconds to close a movie. If the reviewer that said that is such a horror movie buff, then how can he say that this movie is better than ""SAW"" in the last 10 seconds? I'm ashamed at that comment. Yeah, it shows the binoculars, but so what? You already knew that there were more out there. I don't think it sets up a sequel in any way. I can name 3 beings that I saw throughout the movie that I know weren't killed, so that ending didn't come as a shock to me. The acting is surprisingly well for a horror movie and the fact that no big actors/actresses are involved. Other than that, dull!</li></ul>"

","I just watched this movie early to day and I think this is one of the better horror movies of the past few years. I didn't find the movie too scary but it was suspenseful at times and very gruesome. It started out intense at the opening but then things calmed down as the character background was being developed. As soon as the mutants ca.me out, the intensity picked up and although things were predictable at times, there was also a lot of suspenseful moments. I enjoyed this a lot more than any other remakes. Dawn of the Dead was good but I think this was more original in the direction it took. I would recommend this to fans of a lot of blood and gore cause its not really scary but I don't really know of any horror movies that are scary anymore.

","well I don't know about everyone else who saw this movie but I'm both disgusted at the excessive amount of gore and angry that almost 2 hours of my life have been wasted on this pitiful excuse of a horror movie. The very first scene in the movie is of three scientists in radiation suits being mauled by an unseen man with a pick ax. Why were the scientists there? Beats me. Then, It outlines the background of the area the movie will be taking place in. After years of government funded nuclear testing in the desert, mutant children are born and now roam free. Okay, thats creepy. We're off to a good start. Once the movie begins though things start to decline at an incredibly fast rate. As it starts you see a desert road. It slowly zooms in to a lonely gas station and the owner bursts out the door brandishing a shotgun no less. He wanders around for awhile calling for his pig Ruby(at least I think its the pig thats named Ruby). As he's doing this you are watching him through the perspective of a heavily breathing crouching thing. When he returns from his search for Ruby he find a leather bag on his front porch and turns around to face the desert and yells, ""I told you that I was done. I can't take much more of this."" Then he takes the bag inside and examines the contents. There's some money, jewelery, a watch and even a bloody human ear with some earrings in it. Well at this point I had figured that he had made some kind of deal with the mountain folk a while back that they had been robbing people and giving the spoils to him. Why? Who knows they never explain. Anyway after that a typical dysfunctional family shows up at the gas station who the owner convinces to take a short cut through the hills. Well guess what happens. Their RV brakes down. Then The father and brother-in-law split up in the middle of the dessert to go get help. Then the family dog is gut gutted and then son finds it and run screaming, falls off a cliff, and is knocked unconscious.<br/><br/>I think I've said enough. Overall the movie is has an unoriginal plot, to much gore, and relies on merely startling you with sudden movement and loud noise. Not worth the popcorn money. 2/10 because the picture of the mutant babies at the began was creepy"

","Man, oh man. I remember 12 years ago when I was a horror-hound junior in High School and the trailer/website for The Hills Have Eyes remake showed up on the internet. Despite my luke-warm response to High Tension (the clunky Lions Gate released a R-Rated english dubbed version left me disappointed) I was excited to say the least. <br/><br/>Before I start critiquing, I want to note that I do enjoy a lot of horror remakes; The Thing is arguably one of the best horror films ever made. I found The Ring superior to Ringu, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) was a surprisingly brutal & unsettling experience, The Last House On the Left (2009) shot a dose of family drama into what many were expecting to be a trope-saturated horror flick, and I Spit On Your Grave was a balls-the-wall revenge shocker with no signs of pretentious social commentary. The fact that THHE is a remake is not the problem, it's just a really bad film. <br/><br/>The film is so paper thin. The acting is solid, if not lazy at times. The violence is rather overt with no real purpose aside from appeasing to the fans of the vapid Saw franchise. The hillbilly killers look like guys from those high production haunted hayride events; they're costumes, blatantly absurd to look like actual monsters; it feels like you're playing something out of the Mortal Konbat universe. The most 'shocking' parts are nothing other than exploitation in high contrast. The camera work/editing is similar to a heavy metal music video, and the music at one point mimics the National Anthem after an American flag gets stabbed through a skull; I mean, were they serious? Then they try to justify this whole deliberate killfest at attempting to make somencommentary on the injustice of social classes? Kill me now! Horrendous movie."

","My husband and I watch a horror movie every night of October...""scary movie month""...a thing we copied from my sister-in-law. This was our selection last night, and it made me absolutely sick to my stomach. Instead of putting effort into developing the characters and providing some connection through which the viewer can empathize at least a little with the family of ""mutants"", a back-pocket cop-out like rape is used. For all the boundaries most horror movies push, most rape survivors don't expect to suddenly be plunged into the horror of our very worst life moment during a flick. I get weary of the use of rape as a cinematic tool to spice up or fill in where writers can't or won't make the effort to do something better, more complex, or that apparently requires more work, and this time...an underage girl....it was absolutely reprehensible. And no, I'm not a ""snowflake"" and don't walk around being ""triggered"" by anything and everything in life, but judging from the other reviews here, not many people were appreciative of this scene either. Ruined what could have been a good horror film."
"thor-teague","Null","1","4","5 October 2016"," Not so great, not terribly scary, not terribly interesting
","Billed as a horror movie, this film really fails to instill any sense of dread whatsoever. It's characters are unlikable and dopey, it's villains are unhateable and nondescript. The plot is questionable, linear, and leaves me feeling unsatisfied and bored. <br/><br/>The story is very basic, which could work given the right director, but evidently Alexandre Aja is not the man for this job. First of all, the film starts with stock/public domain footage. Many of you might not care, but this is a HUGE no-no in my book. He did a neat tie-in later, but it was still a clear case of inept filmmaking in need of burning up some screen time. <br/><br/>The formula is all too familiar. Some stupid white tourists are out lost on the desert, and upon finding a guy running a gas station whom they trust implicitly, are given instructions to ""take a shortcut"" that will get them to their destination faster. It's almost not worth bothering to type it out, but they are in fact being led to their doom. <br/><br/>The characters are total douchebags. I think we're supposed to like the women a bit more, but after all, they did choose these men for their S.O.'s. I did like the young teenage brother, but other than that, I think they all sucked. Dad dies first, but sadly the other main douchebag never dies. At some point, in fact, we are supposed to believe that he becomes a hero, but the transition never happens. He's just a piece of garbage, then suddenly he's being a hero. It's clear what motivated him to this 180 degree personality shift, but it's presentation is clunky and the audience is expected to accept it without question. <br/><br/>So about that neat tie-in. It earned the film a few dubious points w/me. The final showdown, which I was anxious to get to as it meant the film's end, took place in a cool re-creation of those nuclear test towns, complete with mannequins and 1950's TV broadcasts. While not earning the film the right to include public domain footage downloaded from prelinger, it at least (FINALLY) created some sense of creepiness. Unfortunately it was too little too late."

","If you're gonna remake something, this is how you should do it, to excess. This remake shocker, I've been witness to seeing girls dragging their boyfriends out of the cinema, or hearsay as well, really shocks with more violent than violent violence, glorified here you could say, as this film goes all out. It's disturbs some, especially a 'going too far prolonged scene' with one mutant raping the hot daughter of a family who should of stuck to the main road. You can thank Levine for that, and all the violence he's brought with em'. You can't say he wasn't warned. The mutants who we first see in some great flashes of face, and disappearing shadow shots, stayed to live out on the canyons. They were once human, but thanks to good old radioactivity, plutonium, bomb testing, they are now ravaged and rampant, spouting angrily ""You made us this way"", and the way Levine and family takes, definitely the wrong way. Violence is high, continuous, some of it too confronting for some. We even see a mutant, the same who raped the daughter (a familiar more human face, from Land Of The Dead) bite a parrot's head off and suck out the yellow blood, whatever. Even for horror fans, some scenes are pretty heavy and will disturb, one scene near the end that will shock and having you say ""Oh no"", where later initial shock becomes a surprise and relief. Working from the Wes Craven film, that stacks up pretty ordinary compared to this, Aja, is definitely a new directing talent. As not only bringing this successful remake to the table, with all the trimmings, take no prisoners approach, he also brought out the superior horror indie flick 'High Tension', a year prior, when he eventually sank to indulging in Piranha. Nice character work, from the pen of the writer, and good performances, especially from the olds. We really get to know the family, some not as long as we like too, but true horror fans will eat up this 2006 flick, and the daughter (an actress from Oz) sunbaking, light blue bikini, out there in the canyons, I don't think I mentioned, is hot."

The use of a ghost town/testing village as the residence of the deformed people was also effectively chilling and eerie. The film, unlike any horror film has done to me for a long time, gave me a much- wanted adrenaline high. I also liked the fact that ""The Hills Have Eyes"" didn't use excessive amounts of gore and the film wasn't centered on one or several torture scenes.

The characters weren't your average stupid people, just an unlucky family. I did find it strange that all these people go missing, including scientists and no one looks for them. This film builds enough suspense , not letting you fully see the mutants. Then they show them in full, they weren't scary but they definitely were sadistic. The last half becomes a revenge action movie. There is a great and bloody fight scene, and large amounts of blood and body parts, more than enough for any horror fan.

However, I enjoyed ""The Hills Have Eyes"" much more than stuff such as ""Hostel"", ""The Devil's Rejects"" and the 2010 remake of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" which in my opinion were just plain awful. At least in this movie the characters weren't so annoying and the script wasn't so pretentious.<br/><br/>The visual aspect from this movie was quite good, having an appropriate atmosphere of tension and bleakness. There was also an interesting tribute to the disturbing (Yet, incredibly fascinating) experimental music video ""Rubber Johnny"", directed by Chris Cunningham.<br/><br/>Without being the greatest horror film ever made, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is still a decent effort, which personally I found to be more effective than other movies with a similar premise and treatment."

This movie plays off the radiation and A-bomb scares of those 50s and 60s sci-fi cult films, but it's the new millenia so get ready for something much more gruesome. The plot, as far as the setting, is predictable enough, somehow a family is trapped in the lone deserts of New Mexico, far from any reliable cell phone signals and civilization. The mutant people have decided to continue to live in these harsh conditions and have taken a liking to the taste of human flesh, although their sex drive apparently hasn't changed ( a disturbing part of the film I must say).<br/><br/>The plot is interesting enough and you'll find yourself entertained.

Meanwhile, the kiddies somehow manage to make a sophisticated trap that involves trip wires and an exploding trailer (How????). As a lover of sci-fi flicks, I'm usually not one to put a movie on blast for its realism, but when the kid had a gun with multiple rounds it seemed kind of overdone. Back at the mutant village, the dad is forced to confront a barrage of freaks and by the end of the movie is practically dead, taking more damage than I think a human can survive. But with a little help from a mutant who looks like red riding hood (the deformed version of course), he kills the remaining freaks in a blood bath. That's what you guys get!! I personally was rooting for the guy the whole movie and in the end it appears to be a happy climax..... Do I smell a sequel???"

","Lauram1985, I could not agree more with your comment. I began watching this movie with my boyfriend and best friend, both of which happen to love horror movies as much as I do. We all came into this with the imagination it would be horrifying, but not offensive and brutal. Unfortunately, we were wrong. After watching less than an hour, my best friend and I broke down into hysterical tears while watching a man burned at the stake by monsters while his baby granddaughter is jeopardized and daughter is being raped, only to have a mutant stop his comrade to rape her himself. It is disgusting, gory, and a sad excuse for cinematography. I hope none of you decide to waste your time and braincells on this ""movie""."

","I'm not much for remakes of film's that doesn't really require being remade. Some classic examples being Psycho, Dawn of the Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes came to mind. Both Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake and the Michael Bay-produced Chainsaw remake were critical failures from both fans and critis alike. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake only succeeded for the fact that it's more of a reimagining than a straight remake. The only thing that film had in common with Romero's classic was the location. Now we have another remake of a horror classic (though to some calling Craven's second film a classic might be somewhat of a stretch.) in the Alexandre Aja directed and Wes Craven produced The Hills Have Eyes. Aja's The Hills Have Eyes becomes the rare horror remake in that its more than a match to Wes Craven's original.<br/><br/>The first half of the film was very slow as it slowly built up the tension and dread as the Carter family's journey through a supposedly short-cut through the desert put them closer and closer to the dangerous people who dwelt amongst the desert hills bordering the desert road. Once the family becomes purposely stranded in the middle of nowhere the fun begins for horror-aficionados. For those who have seen the original this remake doesn't deviate from the main story. The hill people who, up until now have only been glimpsed through quick shadowy movements across the screen, were the true cause of the family's predicament attack in a brutal and grisly fashion. None of the Carter family members were spared from this attack. From Big Bob Carter, his wife Ethel, their three children, son-in-law and young granddaughter they all suffer in one form or another. The night attack on the camper is the main highlight of the film and shows that Aja hasn't lost his touch for creating a cinematic setpiece that doesn't hold back. From the brutal rape of the Carter's youngest daughter Brenda to the sudden deaths of several Carter family members. This sequence was both fast-paced and chaotic in nature. It also helped push the definition of what constitute a very hard R-rating. Just like Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel, The Hills Have Eyes push the limits and boundaries of what the MPAA has allowed so far in terms of on-screen violence. I'm very surprised that some of the violence and deaths in this film made the final cut. This film definitely brings back the 70's style horror.<br/><br/>The cast for this remake was one high point that the original didn't have. Where Craven had a very inexperienced cast for the original film, Aja had the luxury of a bigger budget to hire a more competent and able group of actors. A cast that was led by Ted Levine who shined in his role as the patriarch of the civilized Carters. Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of the bunch soldiers on even though its almost predestined in films such as this that she would be one of the doomed. The two daughters as played by Vinessa Shaw and Lost's Emilie De Ravin did extremely well in roles that involved some of the more graphic rape sequences put on film that wasn't from a film called Irreversible. Much kudos must go to De Ravin for having to perform through her scene during the trailer-camper attack. But the two actors who excelled in the film has to be pacifist turned avenging angel Doug as played by Aaron Stafford. We see in his character Doug the lenghts a civilized human being would go through to survive and protect those he cares for. Even if this means resorting to becoming more brutal and primal than the inbred, mutant hill dwellers. It's in Doug's character where the basic premise of the clash of the modern with the primitive comes close to matching the same theme in the original. To a smaller degree this was also echoed in the Carter's teenage son Bobby. Dan Byrd of Entourage plays Bobby Carter and its in him we see the level-headedness of the family. Despite all the horror and carnage he has seen the hill dwellers have inflicted on his family, Bobby remains somewhat calm and level-headed to protect what is left of his family. The only drawback as to the cast itself was that the opposing family seemed to have been shortchanged. In the original we actually got to understand some of the motivations that drove the hill dwellers to prey on unsuspecting travelers through their area. In this remake the hill dwellers seem more like superhuman monsters and boogeymen. It didn't bother me as much, but then it also lessened the impact of the story's basic premise of civilization versus primitives.<br/><br/>In the end, Alexadre Aja has cemented himself as this generations premiere horror auteur. The Hills Have Eyes might not be the original second helping some have expected from Aja after his brilliant, if somewhat flawed first major film with Haute Tension, but it does show his growth as a filmmaker and his clean grasp of what makes horror cinema truly terrifying and uncomfortable. Two ingredients that makes for making a genre exploitation fare into something of a classic. I'm sure that outside of the horror-aficionado circles this film will either be met with indifference or disgust, but for those who revel in this type of film-making then it's a glorious continuation of the grindhouse horro revival that began with Aja's own Haute Tension, continued by Zombie's The Devil's Rejects and Roth's Hostel. It truly is a great time to be a fan of horror. And Aja's The Hills Have Eyes more than holds its own against Craven's original."

","I had been waiting a while to see this and when it came out on DVD i bought it immeditaely. I hadnt seen any clips from it or a full length trailer, just the flashy TV spots, so i had no idea what to expect. the opening scene is 2 scientists getting killed gruesomely in the desert, which is pretty scary. We are then introduced to our main characters, a family of 5 (one of the daughters is married wiht a baby) driving across the new Mexico desert in a camper van. Their camper van then crashes and they have to spend the night in the desert. Basically this movie is scary as hell, its as gory as a bloodbath, and is reeeaaally atmospheric, with the whole empty desert (well not completely empty). The scene where everyone realises that their are mutants trying to kill them is disturbing and sick, a teenage girl getting raped, and a few people being killed. The mutants are all really well played but they are seriously scary, and this movie is Absolutely TERRIFYING. In fact, i love this movie so much that i have only watched it twice all the way through since i bought it. Because if i watch it all the time it will lose its scariness....and i would advise u to do the same as me!!!!"

","One stormy night my boyfriend and I decided to go see this because after seeing the preview about nine-hundred times, the idea of seeing it was pounded into our brains. I'm a huge horror movie fan. Part of me really enjoyed the movie..even the stereotypical horror movies can scare even the hardest critic in the theaters due to the volume of the movie and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>For a lover of horror movies, I embody one strange quality..I hate the sound of people enduring prolonged pain. The scene in which the father is burnt to death made me cringe and is the most memorable scene in my mind from the film. All the while the husband is being burned and most of the family is watching, the younger daughter is being brutally attacked and raped in the motor home. The combination of these two components was way too much. It crossed a line and made the movie seem desperate to make the audience want to vomit and increase the shock value.<br/><br/>I also have to add that I despised the fact that one person had the power to rise against and kill all of the enemies to the stranded family. The ending, honestly, also outraged me. I hope to God that there is never a sequel made...this movie already pushed the grotesque envelope and this is being said from a horror movie fan.<br/><br/>I have yet to see the original.

","Remakes are infinitely frustrating to me. I wish I had the capacity to forget the film on which the new version is based, if only for the duration of the film. It's just not fair to hold a remake up to the standards set by the original. Or is it? In the case of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, I think the compare-and-contrast session that ran rampant in my brain is a justified one. Because the new version stays so close to the original story, the comparison is unavoidable, and the effect is unfortunate. Wes Craven's 1977 original film was a breakthrough in horror, and one of the best genre films of the 70's (on a list with the likes of THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, DON'T LOOK NOW, and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT). It made a bold statement about morality, humanity, the sanctity of family and the feral nature that lurked beneath the veneer of civilization. It was a fascinating and shocking character study. The only message conveyed by Alexandre Aja's remake is that a remake that looks better, sounds better and is performed better than it's source material does not make it superior. The film is lacking a soul. It is a cheap commercial cash-in on what was once a ground-breaking film. The story is not altered, nor are the characters or their struggle. The only alteration is that now the violence is much more potent, the villains much more deformed, and the settings much more stylish. This saddens me. It says that the horror genre has become an intellectual wasteland, with the innovators raped to death and left for the vultures. It says that movie-goers of my generation are much more interested in nihilism and less in irony, more in the aesthetic and less in the cerebral. I wouldn't be surprised to see a hollow-headed remake of 2004's 28 DAYS LATER within a couple years."
"coppersandhoods","3","1","4","25 March 2006"," The Hills Have Eyes and, unfortunately, so did the audience
","I think it says something about a movie when the only character that I wanted to see live was the dog. Perhaps this is because the dog was the most intelligent of the group. I won't spoil any of the ""terrific"" story for you but I will say that this movie is why I mostly rent these days. I would not have felt so violated if it were only a 3 dollar rental. I could have just hit stop, eject and moved on to the next selection. That being said, I will expound upon exactly what was wrong with this film. Here are 3 issues in particular (although there could be more).<br/><br/>1. There are some ""shocking"" elements that might not make it into other horror movies. Unfortunately, they seem gratuitous and non essential other than serving as a device for the movie to get some buzz. The truth is, they aren't even that shocking. What really happens is you get these things fairly early on in the confrontation and then that's it. You've peeked in the shock value and everything afterward is pretty standard fare and, subsequently, a let down.<br/><br/>2. There is no credit given to the audience. I understand that there must be certain suspension of belief when one walks into a theater. With this movie, we have to believe that everyone is completely retarded. There was one fleeting moment when one of the characters displays a flicker of intelligence but it is a flame quickly extinguished by a tidal wave of stupidity. If you are trying to sneak around, why are you talking out loud...TO YOURSELF!!! They allude to the fact that a kid grew up firing guns (his dad is a detective) yet he is the worst shot I have ever seen. The cop has 2 German shepherds that one would assume are well trained (since they are the K-9 unit dog of choice) yet they continuously disobey and run off. I could go on and on but it would require me spoiling the story for anyone planning to watch this. I will just sum it up in the immortal words of Forest Gump's mom, ""stupid is as stupid does"". I think that was it anyway. Regardless, one would have to be a moron to exist in this movie's version of reality.<br/><br/>3. The cheesy f'n music. My god it was awful. I don't know who came up with the soundtrack but apparently they are stuck in 1981. The music you here is corny and laughable. There is one cool electro bass thing and the rest is just campy. I wasn't the only one that thought so either. A very large portion of the audience found it as amusing as I did. The ending is especially funny. You may want to rent the movie just so you can watch the end and see/ hear what I am referring to. It was hilarious.<br/><br/>I think what disturbed me the most about this movie is the comments other people had left on IMDb. I actually looked it up and read a couple of reviews prior to purchasing my tickets. Generally, I find IMDb comments to be a fairly good barometer of what to expect. In this case I have to wonder if people were paid to write the positive posts.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3. I came to this by a simple equation.<br/><br/>1 is the lowest possible score.<br/><br/>I added 1 more point because I liked one of the dogs and 1 more point because some of the killings are pretty cool when the ""heroes"" finally have their moment.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful for those thinking about seeing The Hills Have Eyes. I have never posted a review before but because of all the positives that have been posted I thought someone should warn you about the truth of this movie.<br/><br/>Happy Movie Going PS You know it's bad when the ushers are mocking the movie as you leave. I quote. ""bet you can't wait for the DVD ha ha ha ha ha."" Yeah, it really is that bad."

","If by 'horror' you mean 'horrible' then that is the correct genre of this movie. I took a date to it because she likes horror movies and rarely gets the opportunity to enjoy one. We sat down and got ready for some entertainment.<br/><br/>Instead, what was served to us was an eyesore of crap. Some movies rely on visual effects to stun their audiences. This movie was set in the desert, so there was no scenery change. The coolest effect I saw was someone on fire, and the fire was even questionable.<br/><br/>I'm not finished ragging yet.... The movie took FOREVER to get going. I think it was trying to hold our suspense, but instead it just bored me. The first 30 minutes is the family gasing up and changing their oil. The writers could have easily circumvented this whole pointless scene of them gasing up and getting bad directions by having them get lost and break down.<br/><br/>Also, I can understand the actors making cliché mistakes for the forwarding of the plot in standard horror movies, but this movie was ridiculous. I found myself constantly asking WHY would anyone in their right mind do that. They were practically killing themselves.<br/><br/>The freaks/zombies/whatever weren't scary. The special affects here included some 80s style horror flick face adhesives and some makeup. They weren't superhuman. They just seemed dumb and determined to rape/kill everyone. Given a 9mm with a full clip, a 5 year old could've taken them all down. I would've been more frightened of the radiation in the area making me sick than I would be from the mutants. Maybe next time have the radiation give them super abilities, like invisibility, so I don't have to see an abomination of make up artistry. And for god's sake, spend a little money on some up to date special effects.<br/><br/>This crap chute of a movie gets 2/10, for wasting my time, being disgusting, making my date feel awkward about rape, charging me to much money, and embarrassing itself to the public."

"HEFILM","2","1","4","12 March 2006"," The Hills Have Boredom
","A really cool precredit sequence and title sequence set you up for a long long wait until there are any real scares in this film. The ""normal"" family characters are, like the original films, pretty hard to be with, they bicker and nag each other and are generally unappealing and with not much going on it's a pretty tough sit. Nice locations adequately filmed helps as do some nice, matte painting style CG elements. But there just isn't much going on other than a few fake scares and a not very good dead dog prop. Then suddenly lots of stuff goes on, none of it very coherently staged, then another lag. The night photography is kind of grainy and occasionally even slightly bluish in a, not exposed right, kind of way. The whole thing sticks relatively close to the original, the makeup work is uneven--rubbery looking with blood that looks like candy--and just nothing in this remake is very thrilling or horrifying. The characters, both good and evil keep the plot going long after it should have ended by doing stupid things and you don't get any sense of the mutant family as to size or does the film offer much in the way of interesting mutant family behavior. Their home is cool when you see it, but what goes on inside isn't interesting. During one fight scene the one mutant seems to be more interested in chopping up the cool set than actually chopping up the good guy, who could easily be chopped to death many many times. Retro bad music doesn't help, but the film isn't too much in the jump cutty style that is so trendy--though that might have helped.<br/><br/>I suppose some of the shocks work if you haven't seen the original but this film lacks the rough edge that made that rough violence more convincing. Given the number of torture and violence films lately there's nothing here that you haven't seen done better in SAW or the like.<br/><br/>The audience I saw the film with opening weekend grumbled and scoffed loudly at the non ending and shuffled out bitching about the film. All and all a pointless remake, there are lots of those, but this one is just dull and dumb aside from a few sparks of strong production design the movie doesn't show much competence or feel for the material.<br/><br/>Anyone who finds this film overly shocking really needs to either see more movies or just stay home. This film offers nothing of much note in the shock and gore department."

When the ending comes, you will be happy that it's over but also clamoring for more.<br/><br/>With that said, if you can get free tickets to see this, I would recommend it. If not, there are far better movies coming out to see instead."
"poolandrews","8","2","14","24 December 2006"," Excellent horror film remake, much better than the original.
","The Hills Have Eyes tells the tale of Big Bob Carter (Ted Levine) & his wife Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) who are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary by driving from Cleveland to San Diego with their family, including their son Bobby (Dan Byrd) along with their two daughters Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) & Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) plus her husband Doug (Aaron Stanford) & their baby daughter Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi) all couped up together in one 4x4 & a trailer in the 100 plus degree heat of the New Mexico desert miles from civilisation. They stop off at a gas station where they fill up & are given bogus directions by the attendant (Tom Bower) which leads them even further from civilisation, however that's not all they have to contend with as deliberately set spikes on the road puncture the tyres on their car which causes them to crash. At first everyone is annoyed as they are miles from anywhere & nobody can get a mobile signal but Bob says he can walk back to the gas station & get help so it's no major problem, that is until a gang of mutant cannibals turn up looking for their next meal...<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Alexandre Aja I thought this remake was absolutely top class & enjoyed it infinitely more than the dull & drab original Hills Have Eyes (1977). I think I am right in saying that there are two versions of The Hills Have Eyes readily available, the cut 'R' rated one & an 'Unrated' one, I will be basing my comment on the uncut edit (the only one available here in the UK anyway). The script by Aja & Gregory Levasseur is slow going for the first half but still manages to retain ones interest with decent character's & a good opening massacre along with the suspicion that it will explode into life at any moment & boy does it. Once it gets going there's no stopping it, there's loads of gory violence, some nasty exploitation including pointing a magnum at a baby & an unpleasant rape scene you don't usually expect from Hollywood, some nice ideas that distances itself from the original but not greatly & it makes for a terrific blood-soaked, mutant filled, special effect leaden twisted quality piece of film-making! The first half plays almost the same as the original as it introduces exactly the same character's from the original while it takes a few twists & turns later on with the introduction of a town & the mutants origins but it doesn't muck around with the basic story of survival at all costs that the original was all about. A top notch horror film & one well worth watching.<br/><br/>Director Aja does a great job, the desert locations are magnificent with some really striking jagged rock formations & some just plain cool landscape shots. The feel of isolation is definitely there & Aja keeps on reminding us of it, it has a great atmosphere, it has some great action & gory set-pieces & it has a underlying tension to it. Now onto the violence & gore, while it's not packed with the stuff what's here is cool, there are pick axes in eyes, axes in heads, severed body parts galore, burnt corpses, someone commits suicide by literally blowing their head off with a shotgun, fingers are severed, people have their brains shot out, there's gutted dogs, someone has their throat torn out, impalings, spikes through throats, the family's pet bird has it's head bitten off & there's even a bit of cannibalism in there all of which comes accompanied with plenty of he red stuff splattered all over the place. The special effects on the kills & the mutant killer's are excellent.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 The Hills Have Eyes is technically brilliant, the production design, the special effects, the locations, the fights, the stunts, camera-work & music are all as good as one would hope. It was actually shot in the stunning deserts of Morocco. The acting is fine from everyone with the actors playing the mutants doing a particularly good job under all that latex, foam, rubber & fake blood. Even Billy Drago makes an appearance & he gets to eat a human heart...<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a top remake that easily surpasses the original in my opinion. There's not a lot of love around for the majority of classic horror remakes but this along with the equally brilliant The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) remake means many may have to start & think again. I was throughly impressed, definitely recommend & worth watching (even on Christmas Eve!)."
"EdwardNashtonReeves","8","1","5","29 August 2012"," Excellent! Unpredictable! Chilling!
","Two things that I require from a film are being interesting and being convincing. And horror movies need to be scary and bloody. And Hills Have Eyes has it all! After seeing few mediocre clichéd horrors, I was quite pleasantly surprised with this one.<br/><br/>Characters are very believable and likable. I could easily relate to Bobby and Brenda and my favorite was Doug. That guy turned out to be a quite amazing action hero, which was not obvious, but had most sense. Some characters in horrors do things just for the sake of action/killing, but Doug was motivated by returning his baby. I think that is the strongest reason someone could have for facing possible gory death. All the good characters were well acted and acted like people in their situation probably would.<br/><br/>Furthermore, villains were awesome too. Nuclear experiments amongst mining inbreds would cause a lot of damage to their physique and intelligence, but I guess that surviving the radiation would make one more enduring. And unlike many other horror environments, this one actually makes sense to be isolated and have no phone signal. Also, most governments probably would try to ignore/hush down failed experiments with human casualties.<br/><br/>When watching this film, I was anxious all the time, at the same time enjoying every moment while also being afraid what the future scene brings. It wasn't illogical or boring at any time.<br/><br/>After seeing it, the scenes, the characters and the atmosphere stuck to me. I love this film and I can't find anything that I think is wrong, too much or obsolete nor anything I would have changed about it. Even the ending is very nice and rewarding to see.<br/><br/>Sequel is also worth seeing, being very original in it's own way and not being the replica of the first one.<br/><br/>9/10"
"asda-man","10","1","5","10 July 2011"," The hills do have eyes! (and a bit of blood!)
","Wes Craven created the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in 1977, and the concept was certainly original and had lots of potential. Unfortunately Wes didn't manage to make a classic, but instead an average 70's slasher film. Here, Alexandre Aja takes that brilliant idea and perfects it into exactly what Wes was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Of course only horror lovers will really understand why this film is so great. Others will simply think it's mindless violence, however I don't believe it is. At times it can seem like killing for the sake of killing but that only occurred to me once during the whole film and is that such a bad thing anyway? What's great here is the wonderful screenplay by Aja himself (I'll call him Aja because that amuses me) it begins as a slow burner. We are given plenty of likable character development, which paints a wonderful portrait of family life. My family isn't like this but I can certainly imagine this would be an accurate portrayal for many other families. The key to a really masterful slasher is having characters who we can relate to and care about. Aja has got this down to a tee! So Aja gives us brilliant characters for the first 40 minutes and teases the audience with only slight cameos of the mutants and then BAM! We're given this truly brutal and hideously memorable scene in within 10 minutes where everything happens! I won't spoil it for you but it really is horrific and as with all French directors, outlandishly brutal and realistic.<br/><br/>From here the film turns into this incredibly epic survival game where our anti-hero Doug goes on a bloody quest to find his baby. We're given suspense, tension (like in Aja's superb ""High Tension"") and edge-of-your-seat bloody fight sequences that always ends with you going ""OOH!"" or ""YOUCH!"" But at the same time thinking just how perfect these sequences are.<br/><br/>Aja's directing is really nice. He knows how to make the audience jump or how to make them pump with excitement. At times the cinematography can make you feel really isolated, with the long ominous shots of the desert hills and the endless planes of sand. This is film making at its best.<br/><br/>Love slasher horror? Then you will absolutely adore this! ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is 100x better than the original and that's due to Aja's remarkable directing and screenplay. The acting is pretty good to and the mutants are horrifying! Right from the make-up effects to the soundtrack, the hills do have eyes, they also have a heart and plenty of blood!"

","This is a SICK and DISGUSTING movie which I think nobody should watch it. I understand there are weird people out there, for example pedophiles, but you don't release pedophile movies to the general public.<br/><br/>I was told this will be a horror movie. And no, this is not a horror. There is nothing scary about seeing people being tortured - it is just DISGUSTING to watch. Movies used to be about art some time ago, then they turned into entertainment. This movie is neither art, nor entertainment, it is a pile of crap.<br/><br/>If you're bored, go watch some other movie. No matter how boring anything else can be, you will be saving yourself of a lot of awful scenes. I've heard they're doing part 2 of the movie, which is plain sick.

","Twenty minutes into this movie, I was ready to walk out.<br/><br/>I would suggest seeing the original. This was easily the most over-hyped movie in recent memory. I saw at least 1000 trailers for this movie in the week leading up to its release. The trailers made the movie look relatively scary. It wasn't. It was boring, predictable, and annoying. How many times are we going to be forced to watch the typical, psycho-family-tries-to-kill-tourists movie? Its been done before, successfully. However, there is no reason to keep making The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn or any other of these ridiculous excuses for horror movies. Can't we just be content with the original? DO we really need to watch a Hollywood version of the Hills Have Eyez with better makeup than they had in 1977? Please, save your time and money and skip this one.<br/><br/>This movie was no better than Wrong Turn and it is not worth wasting $10 at the movies to see it. If you must see it, wait til it comes out on video...at least then you can shut it off after 20 minutes and do something more productive."

Yeah...this ain't one of those movies. The horror genre is a genre of originality. RARE is the time when a remake will not only pay homage to it's predecessor, but can reinvent the film in itself. The Hills Have Eyes is a horror classic...not only for Wes Craven, but for horror fans such as myself.<br/><br/>This remake is so boring, so devoid of any life that I quickly remembered that Hollywood has done this to us before. The Fog remake...no. An American Werewolf in Paris...hardly worth the effort. The Amityville Horror...Ryan Reynolds is NOT frightening. Need I go on? The movie rests too much on setting up the scare that by the time you get to that point, you realize that you just missed it because the film is setting up the scare again. The family in this film complain and whine and fight and hate and ridicule each other like so many families do on road trips.<br/><br/>Oh yeah...how can I stress this enough that just because you make a horror film and put weak, formulaic chin-rock on the soundtrack, the film will NOT be scarier. (Resident Evil...I'm looking at you right now). And the mutants in the hills...the worst make-up since ""Monster-In-Law"".

The Hills Have Eyes was the FIRST movie I have ever walked out of in my life. I was so disgusted, not with the amount of gore, but with the lack of plot and character development. There is a difference between scaring your audience into thinking that something could happen, and taking something that is not plausible and not bothering to create a background for it. The family's combined IQ could not have been greater than 70. This movie did not need to be remade. Nuclear radiation does not make people drink blood and eat raw German Shepherd flesh.

"Hey_Sweden","8","1","6","20 October 2013"," There's gore in them there hills!
","Remake specialist Alexandre Aja tackled Wes Cravens' 1977 shocker with this balls-to-the-wall, extremely intense sequel, and it's one of those cases where the new version is at least equal to its predecessor. (Some horror fans prefer the newer version.) Once it's got you, it just doesn't let you go, putting characters and viewers alike through an insane bloody ordeal. As a result, it's very entertaining in a very visceral way, but spectacle isn't all that it's got on its mind. It actually brings the political context even more to the forefront. It also devises a different sort of third act wherein the guy who becomes our principal protagonist meets the monsters on their turf, a devastated desert community.<br/><br/>For those who aren't familiar with the story, it deals with a fairly typical urban family on a vacation who travel through some desolate countryside. They make a major mistake when they follow the advice of a decrepit gas station attendant (Tom Bower) and take a shortcut. They then make easy prey for another family, made up of mutated, cannibalistic, savage psychotics who naturally make their presence known once night falls.<br/><br/>It may take a while for some people to start liking the victims, but they do become more engaging once they are able to tap into their inner badasses and go on the offensive. The biggest character arc belongs to Doug (Aaron Stanford), whom the viewer might not expect to be capable of handling the crises. Breathtaking scenery is one asset; this was actually filmed on location in Morocco. Creditable efforts by a top notch cast are another. Ted Levine is macho patriarch Big Bob, Kathleen Quinlan his more reserved, religious wife Ethel. Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, and Dan Byrd play their kids, and reliable character actors Billy Drago and Robert Joy are among those playing the creeps. (Drago, playing the 2006 version of Papa Jupiter, ends up utterly wasted, however.) The makeup effects and splatter devised by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger are excellent and Nicotero also has a cameo as one of the mutants.<br/><br/>Right from the start, with his brutal bit before the opening credits, Aja is determined that his audience not be bored, and he succeeds admirably, keeping the film full of action until its big finish. It follows the story of Cravens' film closely enough for its first two thirds, then goes off on its own path. And it proves to be a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Craven and Peter Locke (producer of the Craven film) were among the producers on this version.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"ThreeThumbsUp","1","1","6","13 September 2010"," Sad...
","How far is too far? The answer: The Hills Have Eyes (2006).<br/><br/>I've never respected Wes Craven's work because of The Last House on the Left. That film pushed us past the imaginary line of ""Ok this is a creepy, exciting movie"" to ""This is way too disgusting. Who thinks of this garbage?"" Quite simply: I turned against him after seeing Last House of 1972. I never bothered with the re-make of '09. No need to put myself through the same anguish.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 34 years and we have his re-make of The Hills Have Eyes (from the original of 1977). Actually, Craven had nothing to do with the film as Alexanra Aja directed and wrote the latest version. Still, Craven's fingerprints were all over this trash. I'm sure he was smiling ear to ear when the two women are sexually assaulted in a five minute span of the latest Hills version. Also during this turbulent span a baby has a gun lifted to her head. How gross? I cannot stress enough how disturbing, and just plain wrong, these scenes are. How it was ever approved for an ""R"" rating is beyond me.<br/><br/>I've attempted on two occasions to sit through this ""film"" and both times I've had to shut it down after the aforementioned depictions in the trailer. I don't mind mindless violence because it's often done in a fun and over-the-top manner to entertain the audience. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING, entertaining about the graphic assault scenes in Hills. Since I haven't sat through the whole thing, I cannot begin to grasp what a violent rape scene would do to advance a plot. To be completely honest, I think rape should be illegal in movies in the United States. Millions of women -- and some men -- are taken to the dark place of sexual assault and are forced to live with the nightmares for the rest of their lives. What do you think they would feel about a movie like The Hills Have Eyes? Think about it..."

","I have never seen the original movie by Wes Craven, I want to though, but I am guessing that one is going to be a more realistic movie while this one ramped up the violence and the mutation on our radioactive desert family. What we get is a rather intense movie that once our innocent family has an accident in the middle of nowhere the film does not let up. It also made me want to get a German Shepard doggy. So the story is basically a family are driving I am guessing cross country or something in a rather old motor home...the type that gets pulled along by a truck. They make a stop at a gas station and things go wrong when the creepy attendant tells them of a shortcut when he fears one of the family members sees something they should not. Well this sets them along a dirt road which you never take no matter how good of a short cut it is and they get eight flat tires, what is the chances of that happening? Well now our family is stuck in the middle of the desert to bicker and such, but not for long as they are being stalked by some folks out in the desert hills. There are some rather brutal scenes to follow as I really felt for the family, and I wanted nothing more than to see those responsible pay. Which is much better in a horror movie than that group of thoroughly obnoxious people that you want to die in horrible ways. So be prepared for a lot of gruesome killings and one heck of a dog in this very hard core horror movie. Something about the stranded traveler horror movie I usually like."

","There's something innately irritating about a horror film where the protagonists have guns at their disposal, but can't hit a radioactive mutant from ten feet away. In this movie it's so blatant that it actually smacks of a PC liberal Hollywood anti-gun message . . .Am I the only one who dosn't want a lecture on social reform from a B-rate gore-flick? In this particular gem, the people with guns manage to kill exactly '0'radioactive mine mutants while the anti-gun PC Hollywood liberal mows them down by the dozens with an ax, a screwdriver and a dog. (the screwdriver scene is stolen from Tarantino's 'True Romance', just in case the films makers thought no one noticed). You may want to rent it just to see the stupidest scene ever put in a movie (here's the spoiler) towards the end, one of the gun-toting protagonists becomes riled because a cannibal mutant has stolen his mother corpse from his vehicle. In a fit of blind rage he follows the bloody footprints to a well lit open area where he finds the alleged offender feasting on his mamma in broad daylight. (keep in mind that the mutants are just ugly humans; if shot they will die.) The mutant charges the lad, and he turns and runs away, spraying the canyon walls with bullets as he does so--you see,he does not want to shoot the mutant, because he is leading it into a super sneaky explodee trap instead, and shooting it would spoil the trap. . .clever huh? He leads it back to the trailer which his sister has already filled with propane gas. They rig the door with some strike-anywhere matches and wait for the mutant to stick his arms through the window which they quickly bind to the trailer utilizing a bungee cord. They then escape out a window. The mutant frees himself and then decides to use the front door, which blows up the trailer.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding, this scene is actually in the movie.<br/><br/>We can all learn from this. If being chased in the middle of nowhere by a cannibal mutant, don't shoot it! instead lead it to your only source of shelter and blow it up. <br/><br/>Oh, and there's a crying baby in it. . .I guess they figured the thing didn't stink bad enough already. <br/><br/>Anyone who liked this desert-loaf needs to remove their crash helmet and have their head examined."

I don't want to have my outlook colored by my reaction to the original.<br/><br/>That said, I love the trailers and commercials that have been released thus far. It has that grim and gritty look, reminiscent of the '70s' films. It looks right for the material. On top of that, it looks like it is going to be truly creepy.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Alexandre Aja, who was behind last year's (in the US anyway) High Tension. I saw that movie, and loved it until the end. It was dark and gruesome, and really felt like a throwback to the old-school slasher films. It had a relentless killer, who liked to ply his craft in a variety of ways. There was the heroine who is pushed to the limits in her attempts to get away, but has a powerful reason to stay. Aja's style, as demonstrated in High Tension, seems to be perfectly suited to this remake. Hopefully, I won't be proved wrong.<br/><br/>The cast also looks pretty good, with a mix of recognizable faces and no big name stars. Included are Aaron Stanford (Pyro in X2, and upcoming X3), Emilie Ravin (Claire on Lost), Kathleen Quinlan (Breakdown, Event Horizon), and Ted Levine (Monk, Memoirs of a Geisha).<br/><br/>Remakes are always a questionable exercise. Lately, there has been a deluge of remakes, particularly in the horror genre. I don't have anything against remakes, although a lot have proved to not be worth my time. Occasionally one sticks out of the crowd and brings an interesting new vision to the screen. What I have seen so far indicates that The Hills Have Eyes may be one of those few."

Well outside of the initial concept of the movie, nothing else is original. For the first 50 minutes or so of the movie what we get is a very slow drawn out ""charcter development"" phase. This portion of the movie blows the concept of pacing the movie out of the water and really drags the film down as a whole. Outside of pacing problems, we have a lot of scenes that play out like a really bad version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". This movie was made for the type of teenagers in America who are easily impressed by garbage. I'm getting less and less impressed with American cinema these days. One good aspect of the film, is that the sound is amazing. When voices are calling from off screen, they truly sound like they are from off screen, the sound effects are also really good.

The United States tested well over one thousand nuclear weapons (mostly because the physics was so new, scientists were unable to predict the actual yield of weapons, and to test new methods and designs), most of which were on (or under) American soil. Officially, two more bombs were detonated in Colorado, two more in Massacheusetes, three in Alaska, seven more at three other sites in New Mexico, the famous Pacific tests accounted for over a hundred bombs, and three bombs were detonated in the atmosphere in the South Atlantic Ocean. The majority of Testing was done at the Nevada Test Site (nnounced 925 circa 1992), bordered by the Nellis Air Force Range and the Tonopah Test Range, altogether encompassing one of the largest unpopulated land areas with around five and a half thousand square miles (it is only 65 miles from Las Vegas). The likelihood of exposed families living near the test site is lower than the entire population of Las Vegas being irradiated (better movie), because the bombing ranges make this impossible, especially in New Mexico. Secondly the affects of radiation are well known, and public finally, The US and Japanese governments released reports as well as the Sandia Laboratory and the National Cancer Institute, and more recently, eyewitness accounts of the bombs dropped on civilian populations (Japan) by an American reporter who was silenced until his death, have all come into public light in the last decade and a half. This movie is like Jaws had Roy Schneider spent half an hour underwater (on the moon, say) fighting the shark with his fists. It doesn't have to be believable, it really shouldn't, it does have to be convincing, though."

"ashturner-79373","8","0","1","11 April 2019"," Well-made modern exploitation trash.
","Having never seen ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977), I can't say whether this is a good remake - what I can say is that this is a solid exploitation film. Importantly, our protagonists are fairly likeable and only irritating in the ways that normal people are. Their chemistry with one another is good, and the actors convey their characters' distress later in the film very well.<br/><br/>The story is well-paced, dedicating a good chunk of its running time simply to introducing the protagonists and their family dynamic, as well as building up the tension with hints of something wrong. Halfway through the film descends into chaos, and the attack is an awesome sequence that flips everything on its head and turns this into something of a revenge flick. This film is trashy and definitely not high art, but it's fully aware of that fact and embraces the exploitative nature of the original film's subject matter.<br/><br/>There's a sort of grainy, grindhouse look to the orange-y desert landscapes that really suits the atmosphere. Good use is also made of the environment, including the desert and hills, a huge bomb crater full of old cars, and the bomb-testing village littered with scorched mannequins. There's also some good makeup and prosthetic work on display, most notably the hill-person known as 'Big Brain', and good sound design around the violence (gunshots, rattling chains). Even the throbbing, bass-y score is good, and mixed in nicely with some old-timey ""Fallout""-esque music.<br/><br/>The nuclear themes are outdated and portrayed in an over-the-top way, but they're still kinda creepy for what they are. There's some neat symbolism to the protagonists' use of guns too, as the nuclear American family brings weapons into the wilderness. Not a particularly deep movie overall, but a thoroughly enjoyable and distressing exploitation piece.<br/><br/>8/10."

","There's not much difference between this remake and the 1977 original. A family of campers have decided to drive across America. Unfortunately for them, this includes the desert, wherein the 1950's the army carried out a series of nuclear tests. After stopping for gas, and inadvertently offending the station attendant, he tells the group of a shortcut through a valley in the hills... Just as it starts to dawn on them that the shortcut is turning out to be a long drive, their tyres blow out... This is a 50th wedding anniversary they'll remember until they die... which won't be long...<br/><br/>This may sound disrespectful of Wes Craven, but the best thing about this film, by far, is the direction. Alexandre Aja, who had only previously directed the acclaimed, magnificent, and one of my favourite films, Haute Tension, does the story proud. His eye for panoramic shots and the ability to create an atmosphere of aloneness with them, and then his use of the nuclear-blasted ""Little America"", complete with creepy mannequins, creates a really uneasy eeriness that's exactly what the story needed.<br/><br/>Also opting to get rid of the dreadful electronic soundtrack was a bonus. This was a major hindrance to the original. Without it, the excitement is created in different ways; camera shots, angles, lighting, acting, and sound effects.<br/><br/>The other nice thing was the cast... though a cameo by Michael Berryman wouldn't have gone amiss. There are a more than a few solid actors in the film. Ted Levine as Big Bob the ex-policeman and father of the group. He gives a solid reliable performance in a supporting role, though he's yet to come across a role as meaty as his Buffalo Bill Silence Of The Lambs character. His wife, Ethel, is played by the beautiful and talented Kathleen Quinlan. Though the stand out characters is Tom Bower as the gas station attendant, Robert Joy as Lizard - he really does appear to enjoy this role, Dan Byrd as Bobby, and Emilie De Ravin as Brenda.<br/><br/>Also, the special effects have moved on a long way from 1977... instead of the bright red blood which flowed copiously back then, we have a more realistic crimson, which gets slashed, gouged, and blasted insanely all over the place. Not only do the hills have eyes, they also run red...<br/><br/>This is how a remake should be made. It was brave of Aja not to change the story but to bring it up-to-date, not just in the story but also with the filming techniques. Aja, just adds his skill into the mix and the outcome is beautiful, brilliant, and spooky as hell enjoyment. Because of this, I would recommend every horror fan or wannabe to check this out rather than the original 1977 film."

","This is a very cool one except for a flaw early on. Shortly after they crash, the older sister sees a reflection of sunlight up on the distant hill and shows obvious concern and wonder but only for that moment, and then moves on and forgets all about it, which is pointless and unrealistic. She would speak up about it, not just keep it to herself in that moment and then forget about it. Later, the family keeps getting hints of a presence around (dog barking (the mom goes, ""Oh...there's...probably just some...rattlesnakes around.""), an obscene voice on the radio, and Bobby freaking out about their dad not back yet) and she's STILL forgotten about it. She even snaps at Bobby to get control of him, saying that they're out in the middle of nowhere, and then looks mesmerized with the expression, ""Are you serious...?"" when he tells her they're not alone. During the part where she's watching the reflection, Bobby startles her as a joke and she gets irritated. What she realistically would then do is tell him to turn around and point it out to him."

Some of her crying scenes seemed fake but then again, she did have one that was believable. As for the deformed people, the make-up was just amazing. Well done on that.

Along with them is their daughter Brenda (Emilie de Ravin), son Bobby (Dan Byrd), eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw), her husband Doug Bukowski (Aaron Stanford), their baby Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi), and the German Shepherds, Beauty and Beast. After there tire goes flat they go back to the last gas station. Beauty runs into the hills and Bobby chases after her, eventually finding her dead body. He runs, slips and falls, knocking himself out. When Bobby awakes, he returns and does not tell his family of Beauty. As the family tries to sleep, mutants sneak in and disrupt the family. Lizard points the gun at Lynn's head, shooting her and killing her. The gun is out of bullets before Lizard can shoot Brenda, and he and Pluto flee with Catherine. Doug goes off in pursuit of their attackers. He finds an abandoned nuclear testing village and enters the house where Catherine is kept. He is knocked unconscious. At the trailer, Ethel's body is dragged into the hills. Jupiter pursues Bobby to the trailer, where Brenda releases gas from the propane tanks. Bobby binds Papa Jupiter's hand to the window and he and Brenda escape. <br/><br/>The blood flows freely as a woman's organs are consumed in front of her son, a man is burned alive, fingers are chopped off and pickaxes plunge into skulls. This use of excessive gore adds nothing to the films, in fact it distracts from it. By having so much violence, so much ridiculously elaborate gore, the film creates a bloody other world for the film to exist in. The viewers are not part of this world, so they cannot be frightened by it. A lot of the angles created suspense and a little mystery. The scenery was a desert nothing special. The timing of traveling on foot didn't match right.<br/><br/>I give applause to the makeup artist they looked great.<br/><br/>Every single one of the characters was completely ignorant to everything going on around them, and made just plain stupid decisions. If you are stranded in the middle of the desert, and your dog runs off, do you chase after it for more than a mile off of the main road, when you know there are dangerous animals around? the Brother in law who has no peripheral vision and runs past his sister in law being raped right across the room from him, and can't tell when a burning man is crispy enough that it doesn't matter anymore and he needs to give up and help the family.<br/><br/>If you like horror films, you are going to like this one, because it was made for the horror fan. Be prepared to see a lot of blood, gore, and guts. This is a remake that is actually better than the 1977 original. You will applaud for the actions of a German shepherd named Beast, and even the tech geek Doug (Aaron Stanford) when he takes on the mutants.

"Bloodwank","7","0","2","29 December 2010"," Pretty effective cheesy and gruesome fun
","Recent notable Alexandra Aja's The Hills Have Eyes begins in fairly awesome fashion, roaring out of the gates with a rather spectacular bit of murder. It may be holding to a standard slasher trope but it does it well, its a ballsy, exuberant piece of mayhem that gets things moving in just the right way. Sadly the film then sets about doing its best to undo this fine work, tiresomely moving back down the gears in its mishandled build up to its later shenanigans. The trouble is with the characters, or rather lack of them, writers Aja and Gregory Levasseur adopt the cheap shot approach to writing characters, piling up the symbols of a clichés eye view of Americana, guns, god and government, with a prominently shown American flag to drive home the impressionthat this isn't just any family we are watching but an American one writ large. The cast do well, but their roles are woven around careless emblems rather than genuine attempts to conceive worthwhile characters, as a result it appears that the makers care not for their characters, only the terrible scrapes that befall them. As a result I cared even less than I usually would, and so all the period of calm before the storm that the film takes is rather humdrum. The second half boasts some great fare though, brutal violence and bloody gore, smart pacing and generous quantities of cheese, its pretty darned silly but it works because if nothing else, Aja really knows his way around a violent set piece. He knows his way around a location as well, soaring camera and ruminating takes give the desert location a suitably desolate grandeur, while the cinematography of Maxime Sendre brings out a certain doomed and rusted out atmosphere. The Kurtzmann, Nicotero and Berger team do a fantastic job of effects as well, savage splatter rendered with grim realism is the order of the day here, as well as some effectively gnarled designs for the twisted desert dwellers. Acting wise everyone is solid, Ted Levine an effectively gruff patriarch, Aaron Stanford essays a fair badass in the films more ludicrous moments, while Kathleen Quinlan, Vinessa Shaw and Emilie de Ravin all get to run through fear, screams and brutalisation, all coming off relatively sympathetic in the process. Undoubted highlight though was Robert Joy as the liveliest and most talkative of the mutant enemy. Making good use of quirky looks under make-up his leering, grotesque enthusiasm is a pleasure to watch, skin crawling villainry that steals every scene in which he appears. Overall this is pretty decent stuff, but it never made me care. Mishandled elements in the writing, a certain smugness, various silly moments in the second half as it adopts the manner of an action film, all this brings the film down to a pure and simple level of cheesy fun. Problem is, it just isn't joyful enough for this approach to really work, so the film rather lacks in impact. Still, its quite well done stuff, a pretty good time. Reasonably recommended at least."

","The Hills Have Eyes (remake) 2/5/2010<br/><br/>Very few words can make a hardened movie fanatic like me cringe more then when I hear ""remake"" or the now popular ""reboot."" Studios will only remake successful movies that they shouldn't touch to begin with. Because nobody in there right mind would remake a piece of crap that actually deserves to be remade. No matter how good or bad the remake is they still make money due to sheer name recognition and curiosity. Now you must be thinking this is going to be a negative review. This movie is the exception to the rule. The original ""Hills Have Eyes"" was made in 1977 by Wes Craven, and it was mediocre at best. The job of remaking this film was given to French director Alexandre Aja who's horror film ""High Tension"" was completely awesome (if you can ignore the illogical ending). <br/><br/>Aja and his writing partner Gregory Lavesuer took Craven's original script and made into one of the sickest and taboo busting horror films in years. Filmed in Morocco to look like New Mexico, it really looks like the surface of Mars. This movie is like a shotgun to your senses. Although it is based on some well known horror clichés, it just works.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the ""Hills"" movies goes like this. Back in the 1940's and 50's the United States did extensive Atomic bomb testing in the Nevada and New Mexico deserts. A group of miners were caught in the fallout and have been hideously deformed and now have a taste for human flesh. These mutants live in the abandon mine shafts picking off tourists. The bomb tests and radiation deformities are based on fact, while the whole cannibalistic mutant tribes are not (maybe).<br/><br/>The Carter family is taking a summer road trip to San Diego. They're driving a Suburban with a refurbished Airstream trailer in tow. All of the characters are very likable and down to earth. Real characters, not just one dimensional stereotypes. They stop at the ole clichéd dilapidated gas station with the one crazy attendant, which is the very definition of a tourist trap. The man has a deal with the Hill people. The Carters take a short cut suggested by the attendant and run to a trap that cripples their Suburban. Stuck in the middle of the dessert, they try to make the best out of the situation. Little do they know they are being watched. The mood, atmosphere, and music add the perfect touch of edge of your seat creepiness. When the Hill people make there move on the Carter's all bets are off. The filmmakers hold nothing back; this sequence of events is so utterly disturbing it will rock even hardcore fans. I don't want to give away too much, because this is a movie that has to be experienced. Although this is a crazy story, it seems to be grounded in a sort of reality. This is an extremely rare occurrence when a remake is far superior to the original. There are two version of film available ""R"" and Unrated. There was a sequel made the following year that is very average."

","In this remake of Wes Craven's 1977 cult hit, a family stops for petrol in a remote New Mexico desert, only to discover that the road less traveled is best left that way, but then we wouldn't have a film.<br/><br/>From the opening minute, its clear young French wunderkind, Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension) has this journey under his control, and what a sick, twisted little trek it is. It's very violent, perhaps unnecessarily so, though it does add to the tension and increases the payoff. Sometimes the characters act so stupidly you think that they deserve what they get, but this wouldn't be a horror film if the players acted with sense. It's almost as though the Darwinian theory is at work here, but then it doesn't go the way you expect, which is part of the reason it works so well. The writing team of Aja and his usual cohort, Grégory Levasseur provide plenty of suspense and a solid back-story for their desert loving maniacs. They also throw Middle America into the mix by assembling a family that is Republican and religious; there's even a newborn in tow, something you don't see in the average horror flick, and this certainly isn't one of those.<br/><br/>Hills ranks as one of the very few worthy remakes in recent times; I found myself enjoying it in spite of myself. This plays at many emotional levels, and questions our propensity for revenge. Exactly how far would you need to be pushed before you react with violence, no matter what your political leanings and beliefs? A smart, slick, but sick little puppy."

","Few horror movie remakes can surpass the standard set by the original film it was based on. Fewer still can manage to craft a story that balances believable characters, intrigue, suspense and genuine horror. The Hills Have Eyes 2006 by Alexander Aja is a remake of the 1977 Wes Craven classic which does just that.<br/><br/>After an adrenaline charged and intriguing(not to mention graphically violent) opening sequence involving the murders of some men in HAZMAT suits, we go into the story proper which follows a unsuspecting family, the Carters, who are tricked into taking a short cut through the desert and ambushed by a clan of mutated cannibals(These mutants were the result of nuclear testing conducted in the 40s ).<br/><br/>Now here was a horror movie in which i actually grew to like the main characters. The Carter family, consisting of middle age Ethel and Bob along with their son Bobby, teenage daughter Brenda and eldest daughter Lynn with her husband Doug and their baby Catherine, is played with such earnestness and believability that it is really easy for anyone to relate to them and connect with them emotionally. This emotional connection made the Carter family's tragedy a whole lot sadder and scarier.<br/><br/>Alexander Aja and Grégory Levasseur manages to add a lot of depth to the characters particularly Doug; his development throughout the film from a spineless pacifist husband picked on by his father in-law to a reluctant hero pushed to the limits to save his family is handled very well be believably. The acting is adequate and serves to heighten to realism of the film.<br/><br/>I applaud the decision to limit exposure of the mutant cannibals. It serves to make them scarier when they are only partially exposed in shadows. When we do finally get to see them in full view, they look shockingly hideous thanks to some really creative make-up and prosthetics. I also liked how unlike usual horror/slasher shows, these malformed misfits are not dim-witted, dull brutes but are as clever as regular human beings(they coordinate their attacks via walkie talkie for heavens sake!)<br/><br/>Like most other horror movie remakes of recent years, The Hills have eyes revels in its bloody gory violence. Alexander Aja's unabashed camera shots allow all the kills and spills to be viewed in full bloody glory. A sure-fire way to please any slasher movie fan. <br/><br/>Arguably one of the better horror movie remakes around, The Hills Have Eyes 2006 manages to not only keep faithful to the original story, but surpasses it in many aspects. For those who think horror movie remakes are a waste of time, this movie would change your mind. It is an impressive little piece of work that manages to to be genuinely scary while delivering a well plotted story with some intense action and visceral bloodletting. <br/><br/>Horror movie fans should not miss this and even the casual movie goer would grow to like it if he/she could stand the gore."

","The Hills Have Eyes is the most shocking and disturbing movie ever made to watch. At all times I felt like switching the DVD off. But not because it was a bad story or anything. But it just made me feel terrible and depressed.<br/><br/>On the bright side! It was a great, fun and adventurous movie. Lots of gore, guts and violence. Below are the things that made me disturbed, depressed and made me feel like turning the DVD off.<br/><br/>1. Brenda's rape: VERY and I mean VERY VERY graphic scene of rape, TOOO disturbing and terrible.<br/><br/>2. Brenda's Sister's death and rape: When I looked at her eyes and saw that she was SOOOOO sad, I shut my eyes- and opened them, still going on the two rapes.<br/><br/>3. Baby Catherine: This would've been a terrible movie if the mutants had done anything with the Baby Catherine. If a mutant had raped it I would turn the DVD off STRAIGHT AWAY AND COMPLAIN TO 20th Century Fox.<br/><br/>4. The two parrots: This made me very depressed, seeing two innocent creatures dying. I don't even want to tell the details for you.<br/><br/>5. Beauty: At that moment I couldn't stand it any more, seeing a GIRL DOG being killed and slaughtered. (BTW, there is a deleted scene of mutants KILLING the dog on the EXTENDED VERSION, not the unrated or theatrical. There is a new version now.<br/><br/>So those of you who don't like rapes or disturbing scenes, I advise you not to watch this movie. And I feel really concerned for the kids under 15 years of age who decide to watch this shocking and family killing movie. 8/10"

","I enjoyed seeing The Hills Have Eyes, which i thought was a great but brutal film. A family called the Carter's are travelling in a trailer to California through the New Mexico Desert, they end up near a shortcut going to nowhere,which is closed off from the public, and end up crashing their car into a rock. They manage to find an isolated gas station nearby. the area in which their car breaks down was used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing An area that was thought to be empty this means that they are stranded in the middle of nowhere. the family soon realise that they might actually be caught in a trap. which was set up by the inhabitants of the site who are out to start a gruesome massacre. I found this to be a great film with a lot of violence and blood around."

","This came on Channel 4 the other day and I left it on not knowing what to expect. Wow! This was one the best horror movies I've seen in recent times. I liked it so much I sought out the original, and this is the first time I've ever said it, but, the remake is actually better. Far better.<br/><br/>This film is genuinely shocking, scary, horrorfying, and unnerving. It fills out all the holes in the original and more. With inventive and creative use of the original script this makes one very good film. The addition of the nuclear theme over the original, and weak, freak theme is excellent. The only thing I can compare this to is the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. If you like scary slasher type films do not miss this one. If like me you not really a horror buff, you just like a good film that takes you out of yourself, then you won't go wrong with this one.<br/><br/>A word of warning though, it is not for the faint hearted.

"LuckyMatt93","9","0","1","8 March 2009"," Utterly fantastic
","I love Wes Craven's original 1977 Hills Have Eyes. Although it's extremely dated today, it was great and very impressive for it's time. It doesn't hold up as well today as it did back then, but it's still a wonderfully creepy and enjoyable movie. In my opinion, it's Wes Craven's best work next to Nightmare On Elm Street (Scream is somewhat overrated). I've seen many similar films of that era which have scared me out of my wits and spooked me out for nights on end. I was excited and had high hopes when I went to see this remake. Aja's previous film High Tension impressed me, and I had a sense that this would impress me even more.<br/><br/>I should've seen it coming, as I was uncomfortable and uneasy from the opening credits and things just got worse from there. Yet that's really good, because there's one thing that I believe every film needs to accomplish: it needs to make you feel something. This film does that, and much more. It makes you feel uncomfortable, uneasy, emotional, scared, shocked, surprised, disgusted, and horrified. In other words it delivers in abundance. <br/><br/>As I said, this film had me chilled from the opening scenes, and actually by that I mean the titles. There's this great trick of flashing images and piano wire kind of music which makes you jump out of your seat. That little audio clip is also used throughout the film at certain parts to unnerve you again; it's very clever and very effective. <br/><br/>Having witnessed some extreme violence and the total annihilation of a small group of people, you then meet the main characters of the film, stopping by a gas station in the middle of the desert, setting off on their journey. You already know they're close to danger, and as they're sent on their way you know they're heading straight towards it. A couple more clever touches are added here, knowing the family are headed towards danger you are introduced to a baby and a pregnant young mother in the group, and you feel the worry and terror rise. You know they are headed for trouble, and you begin to wonder what horrors face them. In fact, you sympathize so much for the family that you just don't want it to happen or even see it. I was literally almost in tears when *SPOILER* Doug was comforting his slowly dying mother in law. This is saying a lot, because little to no horror films in the past few years have gotten to me so much on an emotional. Kudos to the excellent cast, you guys succeeded in pulling it off.<br/><br/>It does a great job with the suspense and fear, at some points it builds it to the point where it's almost unbearable. Aja is already messing with your head, and he knows just how to do it to perfection. Something else he does well is film some great shots. Some of the opening scenes with his tracking camera shots are superb and really give exposition without words. It looks great, the style throughout gives a feel of remoteness and a little seventies feel to it much like the original film without going too overboard. Many of the shots and camera movements through the film are really effective in heightening the fear and anticipation, particularly when he actually doesn't let anything happen. When you traditionally expect something, he stretches the scene, or doesn't deliver, and then he'll catch you off guard. Sure, there are one or two traditional Hollywood scares (perhaps to make the studio happy) but these are early on and very VERY few. About one or two. This whole style was the most effective in the first night attack and also in the later scenes in the town. There's a ton of surprises in the film; who gets killed, who doesn't, and how and when. Once the suspense goes, we arrive at the real horror. Horror in the form I remember, when I saw the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time. <br/><br/>Talking of the horror aspect, the special effects are amazing and make for some unbelievably horrific scenes. The whole premise could have easily turned cheesy and unbelievable, yet it doesn't. It never feels that way. Aja actually makes you believe the unbelievable. No wonder this film holds its own!<br/><br/>The mindblowing direction, along with the stellar performances, well written screenplay, and great execution makes for a completely satisfying film. It really gets to you and makes you feel a big range of emotions, even after leaving the cinema. It's not only one of the best horror remakes ever made, it's also in general one of the best horror movies this decade!"
"kinglouie40","6","0","1","21 February 2009"," Not sure about this one
","The Hills Have Eyes is not a complete waste of time but it is further confirmation that the horror film has become a wasteland of cheap shocks. There is always someone unexpectedly jumping into frame in this movie. This is almost always accompanied by a loud noise. Very little of these instances serve any purpose other than to try and get the audience to jump.<br/><br/>A vacationing family are directed onto an isolated desert road and trapped by a group of radioactive serial killers. Killings, burnings, guttings and rape ensues. That is the entire plot.<br/><br/>This film has some great stuff going for it. Alexandre Aja is a great director. He knows how to breath suspense into a scene. The desert settings are unsettling. The effects are well done.<br/><br/>Why didn't I love it then? The Hills Have Eyes goes wrong on several accounts. The biggest is the unnecessary rape sequences. I guess you could argue that they were tastefully filmed but they were still unnecessary. It seems that Aja didn't feel that radioactive, deformed, baby eating cannibals were shocking enough, so he had to make them sexual predators for good measure."
"MOscarbradley","7","0","1","2 January 2009"," It does exactly what it says on the tin
","Extremely nasty, (the gore factor is stomach-churningly high for those that like that sort of thing), but a terrifically effective shocker nevertheless. On one level director Alexander Aja may be appealing to the slasher brigade but he also knows how to crank the tension all the way up to eleven and the film works as a genuinely frightening comment on the (literal) nuclear family, even more so than was the case with Wes Craven's celebrated original.<br/><br/>The problem is that the family at the centre are so unlikeable and act so dumbly you may be inclined to side with the mutants even if they are presented in a far less sympathetic light than previously. Still, it should appeal to anyone who rates ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" as a satire on a warped consumerist society as well as a great horror movie. The rebirth of the film's obnoxious 'liberal' hero as a macho superman will obviously remind you of Dustin Hoffman's similar transformation in ""Straw Dogs"" and the whole thing is very dubious. It may also put you off mobile homes for life."

","Based on his own 1977 film, Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream) produces this remake film, I admit seeing the original first might have been better, but I don't think it matters. Basically the Suburban Carter family are travelling in their trailer, and a guy at a gas station (deliberately I guess) misleads them to pretty much the middle-of-nowhere desert, where the end up getting the car wrecked. Oh, it should be mentioned that the USA did atmospheric nuclear tests between 1945-1962, and the cause was turning many innocent people into deformed and cannibalistic mutant type creatures. One by one obviously, family members are being taken away, eaten or hacked up by these psychotics, and the remaining are fighting for survival.

","When I first saw The Hills Have Eyes, I thought it was one of the most perfect movies I'd ever seen. Obviously, my stance on that has changed, but I still think this is better than a lot of pretension time-wasters out there within the horror genre. I can understand why opinions on this movie would go in both good/bad directions, which I think is why I'm just taking the middle stance.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this movie understands something it seems no one really understands anymore in HollywoodÂ—entertainment. Among the worthless movies out there today, you hear so much about the moral points a film makes, or the social commentaries, but those things are not entertaining or worthwhile. The Hills Have Eyes doesn't go there. It's pure entertainment.<br/><br/>However, with that comes the cheesy factor. Mutants aren't exactly serious, but the film takes itself very seriously. I can see this making a lot of viewers think it's cheesy, but I was okay with it. I wasn't really okay with the fact this was just another overdone virus story that has been done a thousand times.<br/><br/>The violence is decent. It's more graphic than the lame cut-away-scenes in Hostel, but not as over-the-top as it could have been and it was pretty generic.<br/><br/>Overall, fun little horror flick. Nothing more, nothing less. Watch it with some friends, and don't expect a masterpiece, though I will say it was well-done.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","7","8 September 2008"," Some nice effective modern horror.
","I'm not against remakes in general, since sometimes modern movies can give 'older' movies something extra with a makeover with todays technology and standards. Doesn't mean that I just agree with all remakes, since some of them are just plain pointless since the original ones are already brilliant at their own right. However this is just a remake that I don't mind. To be honest I haven't seen the 1977 Wes Craven original but I'll bet that it was quite different from this movie. This movie is a typical modern horror movie, with a modern atmosphere and style written all over it. I wouldn't at all be surprised if this movie actually turned out to be better than its original.<br/><br/>The movie features purely unknown actors, with the exception of Ted Levine perhaps and Kathleen Quinlan also has had her 15 minutes of fame. The fact that this movie purely mostly features unknown actors in it ensures that you just never know in advance who is going to die next. This of course has a successful effect on the tension and therefor the movie overall.<br/><br/>Yes, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is mostly a formulaic genre movie and also story-wise this movie really ain't anything special (basicly the movie is about the one killing after the other) but its simply such a fine made one that you tend to sort of forgive the movie for all of its imperfections.<br/><br/>For the genre movie lover this is just one great to watch movie, that features all of the ingredients you would expect from it. Some good scare moments, some fine make-up effects and plenty of good old gore. It's a quality made movie, with a fine crew behind it. Director Alexandre Aja previously had directed the French stylish horror hit ""Haute tension"" and was probably the reason why he got picked to directed this movie.<br/><br/>There are definitely worse genre movies to watch out there, especially when it comes down to remakes.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","The Hills Have Eyes is a very good, detailed and genuine take as a remake of the original directed by Wes Craven. Cravens artistry bellowed power and significance among most of the horror films he had directed. The remake is by far scarier, more sadistic, more terrifying and gut wrenchingly bloodier than its original. Great horror to me hasn't been created by anyone since The Exorcist (1973) or The Shining (1980.) These two iconic films stand the test of time as great tributes to the horror genre, and i think The Hills Have Eyes (2006) has nearly reached this level.

","We all know how bad remakes can be, especially in the horror genre, but that's certainly not the case here. In fact, I like the 2006 version BETTER. This was terrific I thought, coming from French director Alexandra Aja who's first film ""High Tension"" was a highly disturbing masterpiece. This movie isn't really scary (except one specific jump-out moment that I distinctly recall). It's mostly about how sick these mutants are. The key to the movie was the drama and the edge-of-the-seat suspense, which grabbed you by the throat the whole way through. This movie also has one of my favorite fight scenes of any recent horror film. I would definitely recommend this movie to fans of the genre, as long as you have a strong stomach. This movie makes the desert hills much more creepy and unsettling. And again, it's not very scary as you're watching it, but if you ever end up stranded on a deserted back road out in the desert, you'll be ten times more scared than you would've been after seeing The Hills Have Eyes."

","Hills Have Eyes, The (2006) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Alexandre Aja's remake of Wes Craven's 1977 shocker about a family who gets stranded in the dessert just in time to become dinner for some mutants. Craven's film is one of the greatest of the genre and remains a high point in the director's career as well as the horror genre overall. It's also a personal favorite of mine so I was interesting in seeing what Aja did with him version. Just like Haunte Tension, the director pulls out some great stuff but also some weak stuff. You can tell Aja has a very good directing style and this is clear during the first attack on the campsite. The biggest problem I had with the film, as well as the director's first movie, was the violence. I don't think I'm becoming sensitive because I a true, 100% gorehound but the secret behind most slashers is that the violence in never mean spirited. The violence and gore here is just downright cruel, vicious and at time too disturbing to actually enjoy. Craven's film didn't have any gore and instead went for scares and got them. That film, with humans and not mutants like this one, is a masterpiece of suspense and that's why I love it so much. With this film, every time Aja gets the suspense going he throws it out the window with the violence. It was a pleasure to see Ted Levine as the father since he's one of my favorite character actors. Kathleen Quinlan seemed out of place but oh well. The rest of the cast were decent but no better or worse than what we usually get. While the ""humans"" were changed to ""mutants"" this time around, the basic storyline and how things happened all stayed the same down to who gets it and how. I thought a few of the scenes got laughs when they weren't suppose to and the political stuff thrown in was also qutie cheap. I think Aja is going to be very good for the genre but he needs to cut back some."

","Aja's the Hills Have Eyes retains the suspense, feeling and real horror of Wes Craven's original 1977 The Hills Have Eyes, and adds more modern characters and a bit of plot. Unlike many recent horror films, Hills develops its characters beyond stereotypes before subjecting them to grisly deaths and cannibalism, and develops suspense very well by allowing the plots to expand between gross-out scenes. The Hills also cuts very few corners in terms of graphic horror and disturbing violence, and the gore is refreshingly realistic, non-Tarantino, and unsanitary.<br/><br/>A family is traveling across the Nevada desert near a former nuclear testing range when they need to get gas. The gas station attendant finds them annoying and decides to misdirect them into the testing range. A few clues are scattered about the early scenes from which the back-story of the plot can be deduced, but these are not to be fully understood until it becomes clear that the family is to be hunted down, sadistically murdered, and eaten - 1 by 1.<br/><br/>Although the film vaguely connects to environmental issues and various fears concerning deformity, it appropriately avoids making any political and/or moral statements and exhibits the sort of nihilism needed for a truly scary film.<br/><br/>The acting and the script are very good in comparison to the genre's norm. Dan Byrd was particularly impressive as Bobby Junior. the film is also well directed and the cinematography, pace and editing are a touch better than the original Craven film. All considered, this is one of the better horror films of the new millennium, so far - a little less innovative and intelligent than The Descent and a little less scary than 1408, but much more suspenseful than either."

Despite a relatively impressive opening, my instincts proved correct. While the new film is a reasonable re-imagining of the original, it still suffers from the poor premise.<br/><br/>With both Craven's and Aja's movies, I've felt very little empathy for the characters. While I like horror films, the nihilistic elements of ""Hills"" has always left me feeling somewhat cold.<br/><br/>The film does have some redeeming features. There are some brief scenes of tension towards the finale and the effects work is top drawer stuff. The cast is pleasing and the cinematography is beautiful.<br/><br/>What lets the film down is an overall sense of suspense for the most part and the overall premise doesn't really work for me.

The mutants here are gruesome, but not as chilling.

","There are plenty of movies I would much rather see than this. I thought I was in for a good ride, considering how much everyone seemed to like it. However, it was far from a good ride. I could care less about the violence or gore, that's not what turned me off of the movie. It was the fact that very little makes sense in this movie, which makes it hard to interact with or even feel anything for. Another fact that makes this movie hard to interact with is that the movie treats the audience as if we're all idiots. For example: The movie starts out with a montage of nuclear explosions, as if we really need to see each and every shot to get how screwed-up the mutants are. It also shows the predictable shot of mutants killing scientists in radioactive suits right after the fact, as if we need to know that the mutants are violent against people. And, of course, the movie goes on predictably, with everyone doing all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons. Characters split up and go on their own ways, leave each other behind, chase after idiot dogs, et cetera. One of the only surprising things is who lives and who dies. Aside from that, I had almost literally no interest in this movie. Personally, I cannot think of anything where I cared less as to what happens.

At times, the movie was taken to ridiculous and in my opinion cheesy, points at which I actually burst out laughing. My favorite scene involved a dieing husband who finds strength in his wedding ring. While this scene would sound touching, his blood splattered face and the ridiculous situation he was in made the entire scene a flop.

"Disarmed-Doll-Parts","7","0","1","16 March 2007"," Moments of sheer brilliance are ruined by moments of pure stupidity.
","This comment contains very mild spoilers Let's start off by saying that although I thoroughly enjoyed Alexandre Aja's remake of Wes Craven's groundbreaking shocker THE HILLS HAVE EYES, most of what I will focus on in this review is comparing the original to the remake, and to Aja's other film HIGH TENSION.<br/><br/>THE HILLS HAVE EYES starts off with a laughably bad opening scene. I dunno if Aja intended laughs with this part, but there's something comical about a 7 foot deformed Neanderthal mutant spinning an astronaut around with a pick-axe in the middle of the desert. Is it just me? Now that is an example of one incredibly dumb scenes.<br/><br/>After that we are treated to an awesome credits, with a cool 50s song and footage of deformities and nuclear explosions. I have to give props to modern horror films, the opening credits always deliver something interesting.<br/><br/>Following the credits we meet an old gas station owner packing up his store. Enter a nice typical all-American god fearing family; the Carters. Father (Big Bob Carter), mother (Ethel Carter), eldest daughter (Lynn Carter), eldest daughters daughter (Catherine) and husband (Doug), younger daughter (Brenda Carter), son (Bobby Carter) and two faithful dogs (Beauty and Beast). The family are shown the off-road route by the gas station owner and told they can take the back way to say a few hours drive. <br/><br/>The gas station owner was poorly acted. In the original, John Steadman portrayed the disturbed old man with a campy, charismatic and frantic charm about him. It seemed as though Tom Bower just wanted to get out of the role as quickly as possible, and his performance was rushed and hollow.<br/><br/>When the family station wagon and Winnebago crash off the road, the Carters are stranded in the middle of the desert. Big Bob pulls out two guns, gives one to his son Bobby and keeps one for himself, and Doug and Big Bob head off in different directions looking for some help. When are clan of cannibalistic mutants attack the family in their Winnebago, the resulting film could have been a horror fans wet-dream. Rape, cannibalism, a cool setting, cool music, dismemberment, mutants, homage to famous films, hot young things, home invasions, revenge, sadism, everything a fan could hope for. But THHE is missing something. The mutants have no personality, unlike in the original, when the mutants had ALL the personality. They're not recognizable, and the scenes are not suspenseful. Aja goes all out for shocks and jump scares, where as Craven went for suspense and little violence. Intead of Brendas blood curdling screams terrifying you, it was that a mutant was sticking his meat in her. Instead of Lynns fight for the life of her child, she's getting her breast milk drunk. Instead of a social commentary on who the real evil is and which family rally is more civilized, Aja ditches that and goes for a pretty poorly done kill-the-monster-you-created angle.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about this film were the kills were very well done, the rape scene was pretty suspenseful (I loved the rock musical score), Big Bobs capture was also suspenseful, and the best part was how much Doug was willing to do for the life of Catherine. There was also a cool homage to one o my favourites, TRUE ROMANCE, where Doug, clearly defeated, sticks an ice pick through a mutants foot and resourcefully gets the better of him.<br/><br/>The acting was good, I liked the casting of Emile De Ravin as Brenda and Vinessa Shaw as Lynn. And Aja's style was clearly evident, in comparison to HIGH TENSION. Like the time inconsistencies and graphic murder, and the cool camera work he does. Little heavy on the CGI when it came to the mutants but they still looked good.<br/><br/>Overall I thoroughly enjoyed THE HILLS HAVE EYES, I've probably seen it about 5 times now. But it fails in comparison to the original and Aja's other film HIGH TENSION. Better than most of the recent crop of remakes.<br/><br/>7/10."

","A surprisingly powerful and emotionally investing horror film that's almost unbearable to watch at times, but remains suspenseful throughout. The story is the same old clichéd, illogical tale that's been used in horror flicks for years, with a few twists, but the characters are so well-developed that, when the inevitable slaughter begins, you feel incredibly sorry for the victims. Thus, certain scenes are very difficult to watch. For this reason, though, it is easy to identify with Aaron Stanford's lead character and his quest for revenge, and the last third of the movie is very satisfying, while remaining realistic. Still, there are some huge leaps of logic in the story, and - other than Stanford - none of the acting is that impressive. Overall, a memorable horror flick."

The violence was OTT (over the top) and especially disturbing during the ""rape"" scene (need I say any more!). The main characters (republican withstanding) were all a bit grating - people you didn't really care if they get brutally raped or murdered or both by violent mutant zombie people.

In this one, there is the added deserted town and it does have a final resolution. Also, there is no snakes like in the original.<br/><br/>It has some gruesome deaths and disturbing scenes. Watching your dad burn to death is very bad and that really wasn't the worst part. One of the final fight scenes between Doug and the big mutant was good.

","As a geneticist, I was a bit taken back by this movie. The mutants make statements that they were driven into the mine by the nuclear testing and that it was the nuclear testing that ""made them."" Certainly radiation can cause harm to DNA, but that would show up in the NEXT generation. Given the ages of the mutants and the approximate time line, it wasn't clear that it was their parents who were radiated causing those births; nor that enough time had past for a second generation to be produced --- assuming the parents did not receive sufficient radiation causing them to die prior to producing offspring. While certainly radiation exposure can result in ""mutant"" offspring, most of them would either be still born or die shortly after birth."

","The horror genre has a tendency toward recycling ideas over and over, whether it be for the purposes of sequels, remakes, or franchise mergers. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was a chiller written and directed by Wes Craven in 1977, and has now reappeared in the hands of ""High Tension"" director Alexandre Aja with the horror master's presumed approval, since he is credited here as producer. The basic premise remains intact from the original with a family's road trip hitting a dead end in the middle of a former nuclear test site. Much of the first half of the film unfolds with squirm inspiring tension, but once the pay-off arrives the quality of the film-making simply goes down. The unevenness this causes loses the film any possibility of being more than just a lazy, creepy, nonsensical shocker, which is a shame since the first hour suggests something more."

","""The Hills Have Eyes"" wasn't that bad of a movie, but it wasn't that good either. I only saw a couple of brief trailers before seeing the movie so I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to be watching. The only thing I really expected was some type of suspense or fright factor based upon the trailers I saw.<br/><br/>The movie was about a town of miners and their families that were horribly disfigured because of living near a government nuclear test site. During the movie you come to know that the reason these side show freaks are so hideous and venomous is due to their idiotic decision to stay in a town near a government test site though they were given ample warning to leave. That little tidbit of information helps the story a little bit, but not much.<br/><br/>The movie does give you a rooting interest in the family that is being preyed upon. They are a typical vacationing American family totally undeserving of being victimized AND... they have a baby. Of course the movie is very graphic as well just to get you to cringe. If you are looking for a movie to be startled and disturbed by, then ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the movie for you. I was expecting a bit more of a story without the heavy reliance on blood and violence, hence this movie didn't quite suit my taste. Still, it was an above average movie, only slightly though."

","Remakes have been excellent lately. Aside from a few crappy ones such as The Fog and When a Stranger Calls, the remakes are often better than the original film which they are based upon. Such is the case with Alexandre Aja's The Hills Have Eyes, a remake of Wes Craven's cult classic. Hopes were set high for this remake after Aja's amazing High Tension. <br/><br/>Aja effectively takes a tired old tale and turns it into a frightening horror film with extreme gore, violence, substance, and character. The acting is perfect, with each actor fitting their roles seamlessly. It may have taken nearly half the movie to get into the horror, but when it got there, the events that occurred were all the more effective. The movie is certainly not for everyone, with its graphic nature and chilling scenes. <br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes stays very close to the original with better effects and acting. I can't see why so many critics hate it so much, because only about half an hour differs from the original. The original was good, but not good enough. It needed something more, and Alexandre Aja gave the remake just that.

That's not to say that I think there really are mutants living out in the New Mexico deserts, however the way that the first ""scary scene"" is filmed, it is terrifying, and well - horrific.<br/><br/>The setup is a family traveling to California, via the New Mexico plain terrain. They come across a random gas station to fill up their tank, and the attendant, a bit shifty, suggests that in order for their journey to go a bit more quickly, they should take a short cut. They take his advice, and end up running into some car trouble later down the road. Miles from civilization, their car is now broken and two of the men decide to split up and walk to the nearest town or rest stop for help. Three women, a teenage boy and a newborn baby stay behind. Nightfall comes, and so does the terror of the film, which does not cease until the credits roll.<br/><br/>It is without a doubt one of the best, and most disturbing horror movies I've ever seen. It leaves you feeling violated, uneasy and uncomfortable to sleep without the lights on. <br/><br/>I recommend it to those horror fanatics out there (like me), and those who can appreciate good cinema like this. It may leave a knot in your stomach, or a nawing at your brain - but if nothing else, it will totally scare you."

","I personally have to say i think the hills have eyes movie was brilliant, its different to your average horror movie, it has more depth and detail than most, it can be completely gross and disgusting at times but to me that makes it so much more interesting and better. the make up is brilliant, the scenes are amazing, especially certain scenes where they detail it more than most scary movies. they make you really feel for the characters and you get very into the movie from the very beginning. Its also different to most movies in the way that they don't have the usual beginning where nothing happens, the middle it gets a bit scarier and the end where everything happens, no its not like that, it straight away gets into the story and through out the movie you don't know what to expect, plus they chose great actors for the movie. to me this is probably the best scary movie i have seen so far, excellent story!!!"
"jluis1984","7","0","33","13 November 2006"," Excellent new take on a 70s classic!
","Right after the worldwide success of the excellent violent horror film ""Haute Tension"", French director Alexandre Aja found himself under the spotlight as one of the new talents in the horror genre. Asked by director Wes Craven to rewrite his own 70s horror movie ""The Hills Have Eyes"", Aja accepted to write the remake but as the project got bigger, Aja finally accepted to direct the film himself. The remake of Craven's violently gory tale of a dark ruthless side of America remained mostly faithful to the original, although Aja certainly did add his own touch and aimed for a subtler (but still appropriate) social cometary this time. This new version of the old 70s classic really plays its chances and does what every remake should do: try to actually improve the previous film. And surprisingly, it succeeds.<br/><br/>As in the original, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is the tale of the Carters, an all-American family on a trip through the American southwest as they head to California for a nice Vacation together. While crossing the most difficult part of New Mexico's desert, their vehicle's tires blow and soon they find themselves stuck in the middle of the desert. Apparently without any way to get help, the family members' own personal differences begin to arise, but their familiar difficulties will be the least of their troubles as they discover that their accident was in fact a trap, a trap set by another all-American family, that just happens to be a bit twisted.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja and his regular collaborator Grégory Levasseur take Craven's original nightmarish plot about the violent meeting of two sides of America and flesh out the story giving some more details about the origin of the mutant family. As in his previous movie, ""Haute Tension"", suspense and tension play a role as big as the violence and the gore, and the long scenes of introduction of the characters are a key factor in this: Aja and Levasseur create believable and overall likable characters, so realistic that it's really easy to be identified with them and be terrified by the horrors they have to endure. While the film may not offer something truly original, I found that the way it develops the characters is really what makes it so effective.<br/><br/>As in his previous two films, Aja makes an excellent use of color and cinematography to create haunting atmospheres of isolation and hopelessness. The graphic violence displayed on the film is ruthless and without remorse (specially during the first attack), but what makes the film so powerful is the way Aja builds up the situation, making the actual violence seem even more disturbing than what's shown on screen. While the film still follows some of the conventions of modern horror (mainly the editing style), it somehow recaptures the spirit of the original's ""grindhouse"" way of film-making.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is remarkably realistic, as most of the cast does an excellent job, particularly Aaron Stanford and Vinessa Shaw, who are very effective. Stanford truly stole every of his scenes and ends up being an excellent lead actor. Ted Levine, Billy Drago, Tom Bower and Kathleen Quinlan are the experienced side of the cast, and without problem show their talent even when their roles are somewhat small (Sadly, Billy Drago's screen time is almost a cameo). Dan Byrd and Emilie De Ravin are the youngest and show a huge potential as their reactions to the horrors in the film are nothing short of believable.<br/><br/>As far as remakes go, it's safe to count Aja's take on ""The Hills Have Eyes"" as one of the best, not only in terms of being an excellent horror film, but also as a movie that shows respect for the original while adding some good new ideas (as well as better technology for the effects) to an already known plot. Probably my biggest complain would be that Aja's decision of taking the mutants out of the spotlight makes Craven's cometary too subtle to be noticed (they look less as a family, and more as a gang of monsters), however, I can understand his reasons, as the now enhanced mystery surrounding their actions truly adds to the suspense and tension that Aja was going for.<br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" may not be a turning point in cinema, or a very original film (it's still a remake after all), but it certainly delivers what one looks in a horror film of this kind: captivating plot, enough suspense, and horrifying violence. All in all, it may not become a classic, but it's good enough to give it a chance. Alexandre Aja is showing a lot of talent, and one wonders what he'll show us in the future. 8/10"

","The Hills Have Eyes is a re-make of Wes Craven 1970's classic following a family of cannibals pursuing a stranded family in a deserted wasteland.The remake is one of the most amazing slasher films on the planet and is easily surpasses the original.The most appealing part of the movie is the fact that the victims are intelligent.The plan,they defend themselves,they place traps,they bring weapons every time they go into the hills,it's a rare thing to see in a slasher movie.The film is shot with a look that is in every visual way like the original movie.The only noticeable cliché is the fact that the film begins with the creepy gas station guy giving the family the wrong directions.After that the film becomes a totally intelligent and unique horror movie.The film contains some disturbing content and some imaginative and brutal kills,that give it an edge over every slasher movie out there.Alexandre Aja is a great director when it comes to horror and makes the original version look inferior.The Hills Have Eyes is a smart,edge of your seat thriller,with a tendency to make you cringe.The bottom line is if you enjoyed the original or are a fan of great 70's horror flicks The Hills Have Eyes is a must see."

","There are many things one can say about a movie like this. Everybody knows that when they go to see a horror movie, they go to see a movie with little story line and a vast amount of violence. In this case, The Hills have eyes contained both. Not only were there the greusome images that everybody hoped for, but there was also a REASON to make all of the killings. The movie could make a lot of sense if you put into a real life conflict. Although the PEOPLE would probably not kill just for the ufn of it, I could see a family getting stuck in the desert where they lived when the US dropped bombs and then they became mutated and got revenge. <br/><br/>As for the storyline, the writer makes a concrete conflict between the people in the hills and everyone else.

"rixrex","Null","0","2","16 October 2006"," Above average remake, half better than the original, yet half worse.
","The Hills Have Eyes, 1977 version, is one of the films that always requires inclusion in the seminal horror film period starting with Night of the Living Dead, and continuing up through the 1970s. These were films that were Drive-In flicks that constantly pushed the boundaries, and were the precursors to today's modern gore-filled horror films. The remake attempts to take the basic premise, updated and technically superior, and make a B-movie into an A film. This is what most of the remakes of these great 70s horror films try to do. This new version of Hills Have Eyes does an excellent job and still maintains its own individuality.<br/><br/>In these ways it is better than the original: Much more interesting detail and story about the desert mutants, and more of them as well. Technically superior, which is what we all like to see. Better direction of characters, sorry to Wes Craven but it's true. Good use of Pluto, the most interesting mutant character, but who was used in an inferior manner in the first, a waste of the great Michael Berryman.<br/><br/>However, in these ways it is the lesser of the two: Bad use of Papa Jupiter (who looks like John Carradine in his later horror films), basically relegated to second class mutant status here and not really that scary (James Whitworth was SCARY!). A lousy job of redoing the final scene where Papa Jupiter meets his finish, the original is 1,000% better. Dwells too long on the burning scene, which is not necessary. A little too much anticlimax in the fight between Pluto and the Democrat turned NRA member.<br/><br/>Both are great at the development of tension and suspense, and both have very eerie atmosphere. Fortunately watching one will not ruin the other at all. Then also include in your viewing, The Hills Have Eyes Part 2, 1985, if only to see John Bloom as the Reaper!"
"DevilPaul","8","0","2","11 October 2006"," A worthy remake.
","The original version was directed by Wes Craven and released in 1977. The plot was loosely based on the Scottish legend of Sawney Bean who headed a family of highway robbers living in a cave that also happened to eat the flesh of their victims. Basically the plot of both movies follows a family traveling across the country in a motor home. The father decides to take the back way out west because it's scenic and of course this puts him in the middle of nowhere. A helpful gas station owner points him towards a shortcut that no one knows about. Unfortunately this seemingly helpful person is in cahoots with a cannibal clan and the road is actually a dead end into their lair. The family becomes stranded in the hot desert with no help and then the battle begins between the cannibals and family. As the cannibals attack their home and taunt them they become desperate to fend them off and find a way.<br/><br/>No one can forget the face of Michael Berryman that graced the cover of the original THHE poster. (If you don't know who I'm talking about he's the guy who was the biker at the end of Weird Science who said ""Can we keep this between you and me? I don't wanna lose my teaching job."" Apparently he was also the high school principal in Motley Crue's ""Smokin' In The Boys Room"" video.) The original is definitely a classic but you can forget about the pathetic sequel which even Wes Craven is embarrassed of now. While the original movie is engaging it didn't really explain much about the cannibal family and why they were living out there in the first place.<br/><br/>The remake starts out with an introduction detailing US Army nuclear tests in the Nevada desert. It turns out that the cannibal family were actually miners who refused to vacate their town after the Army selected their home as a test bed for its nuclear program. As a result the survivors have become horribly mutated and hateful of the outsiders that they gleefully prey upon. In the original version our villains are merely weird looking cavemen out in the desert and don't seem as threatening looking back on the movie today. I felt that the remake really did well by making them grotesque and truly barbaric.<br/><br/>Also, in the remake the family explores the cannibals' home. This was never touched upon in the original and for all we knew they just lived in caves. In the remake we find that they live in the old miners caves and also reside in a small village that was built to observe the effects that a nuclear explosion and fallout would have on actual homes. Also, the cannibals store the old marauded cars of their victims in a giant crater that has become one large junkyard which is discovered by one of the family later on in the film.<br/><br/>Overall I felt that the remake really did improve on the original by adding better effects and expanding upon the story in the original. I found it interesting that they were created as the result of experiments our government had done. There is more violence in the movie including a pretty wince inducing scene where the mutants have their way with one of the female characters but it serves to show how depraved these people are."
"jzappa","7","0","2","9 October 2006"," Still Weighing It
","I've never seen the original Wes Craven version of The Hills Have Eyes, so I will not be comparing this one to that one. However, as its own beast, it's good, but it's frustrating in some ways. It's apart of this new batch of slasher and horror movies, where the cinematography is boisterously gritty and choppy, the script and the acting are more contrived in the melodrama department than horror films before the 21st century, etc. It seems to have boomed since High Tension came to America and though its plot disappointed it carried itself in a manner and style much above average, keeping us riveted with its brutalizing tension and suspense. Its director, Alexander Aja, spends his sophomore effort here with this film.<br/><br/>His suspense remains very fulfilling and very nervous, his cinematography is stale and overused by now but it does work well, his attention-grabbing stylistic details are kind of fun, and Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan are good, even if their roles are almost painfully cliché. That is this film's biggest drawback. It not only completes a competent checklist of all horror/slasher/survival film/thriller/sci-fi clichés, but accents a few of the more frustrating ones. Among these particularly frustrating clichés are the use of animal death as a precursor to the terror upon the humans. Yes, I'm very biased because I am an incredible animal lover and I hate it when animal cruelty is seen as ""Hm. Strange,"" and when humans are terrorized, not only are they surprised at their dangerous situation after they've practically ignored their pet(s) being mauled, but they treat human casualties as something so incomparable to the death of an innocent animal. But aside from this bias, aren't you tired of knowing as soon as you see an animal in a horror film that that animal is going to die? Another painfully hackneyed inanity here is its entire exposition. The film almost confuses itself, for instance by making Quinlan's character a strict, structural mother and still making her the cool mom that can talk about pot with her kids. The dialogue is so loaded with routine that it defeats itself when trying to develop its characters.<br/><br/>The horror franchise is almost founded upon giving the audience what they expect, which is entirely the WRONG WAY TO DO IT. Horror films need shocks and surprises, yet nearly every one, even these new high-production-value slashers, can't help but succumb to them. However, Aja has somehow kept The Hills Have Eyes suspenseful enough to entertain, even if he let it be too much of a stereotype to be memorable."
"pgelatt","Null","0","1","4 October 2006"," Best of the remakes
","The recent trend of remaking old horror films has been really disturbing (and not in the way intended). I was disheartened (though not surprised) to recently read about possible remakes of Don't Look Now and Suspiria. This after the utterly unnecessary Wicker Man remake seems such a shame. But, in the out pouring of poorly conceived remakes, this one stands to me as a success. <br/><br/>First of all, I don't think the original film is that strong. Craven has had moments of directorial brilliance, but Hills Have Eyes is not one of them. The remake however, is a stylish, grotesque and, for the most part, intelligently conceived film. True, at times the characters act without much sense, but on the whole this is a tense and worthwhile viewing for anyone interested in current horror trends."

I was very surprised to see the rape scene in a Hollywood movie, mostly because Hollywood doesn't like breaking with tabus. Maybe it was because the director is french and doesn't care about breaking with the rules. Anyway...the first scene takes place exactly halfway through the movie with a family lost in the desert being more less wiped out in about three minutes - the second scene is the son-in-law hunting down the mutants and killing them with an axe, dog and shotgun.

"DonFishies","5","0","1","11 September 2006"," Outstanding makeup, but the film just does not have the same edge as it did in 1977
","In an act that only continues to prove Hollywood's infinite wisdom, the film studios continue to greenlight remakes of older films. But the modern filmgoing audience keeps eating them up, so is there any wonder why they continue rolling them out, subpar or not? While there have been many examples of such thinking, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes is somewhat split down the middle. On one hand, it does better for itself than Wes Craven's original film could have ever hoped for itself. But on the other, it just lacks any of the spirit or the intensity of one of Craven's master films.<br/><br/>The basic way to explain the film is just to simply state that the films revolves around two families. One is the good, wholesome Carter family lead by Big Bob (Ted Levine), on their way to California with their truck and camper in tow. The other is a family who has been mutated by radiation from American nuclear test weapons, and now live in the deserted hills in the middle of nowhere. After the Carters get some really terrible directions, they hit a snag and end up mangling their truck. As Bob and his son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford) set out to get help, the rest of the family stays back and sit idly waiting while the mutant family begins to devise their own plans.<br/><br/>In comparing the original and remake side-by-side, the thing that works the best in favour of the remake is the backstory for the mutant family living in the hills. In the original, they just seemed to be a small group of deranged hillbillies who happened to live out in the hills. Here, it is a rather large group of people, who just never left their home town when they were asked to by American nuke testers. As a result, the testers dropped their bombs and thus the people began to mutate. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, as a result of making this contribution to the sequel, Writer/Director Alexandre Aja and his partner Grégory Levasseur have sacrificed any sort of development they could do with these characters. Instead of having some form of conscious and thinking like Craven's hillbillies, Aja and Levasseur's mutants are just monsters. They are evil and sadistic on purpose, not just by chance. They lose any of the terror or intensity they built in the original film right after we find out that they are the reason for the Carters crashing.<br/><br/>But then, purpose is also a problem for the Carter family too. They have no humanistic traits, they are just the bait to the monsters. Yes, we understand that they are like sheep being led to slaughter, but they just do not seem to feel real enough for us to care. No one stands out as a likable character, and no one is developed enough for us to dislike them either. When members of either family start to die, the audience just cannot fathom the proper way to react. Aja and Levasseur just keep feeding the story along, and just do not seem to have any idea what kind of reactions they want to get from what is happening. In Craven's film, he managed to ensure that the audience had no idea which group to sympathize with. Here, no one seems to care what anyone does.<br/><br/>And of course, the characters are not helped by any of the performances. Levine's Big Bob, the mother Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) and their eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) are completely downplayed throughout their limited screen time, as is Papa Jupiter (the always excellent Billy Drago), who Aja and Levasseur do not even bother explaining to the audience to be the leader of the mutants. While they were not exactly big characters in the original (except for Jupiter, who was actually a key part of that film but is basically worthless here), they still had the audience caring for them. Not here. Putting every single ounce of focus on Bobby (Dan Byrd), Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) and Stanford's Doug just does not cut it. This movie was longer than the original, but lacks any of the dialogue or story for the actors to use for their characters. How does that work? <br/><br/>I must concede however that the gruesome makeup and gore shots are fabulous. The continued excellence from the wizards Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger is absolutely astounding. From simple blood shots, to the brutal wounds and bruises inflicted upon our cast of characters, all of it is just as bloody and horrific as it should be. They do not skim on any brutality like a PG-13 rated horror film does. They revel in their R-rating, and they totally deliver on that rating's promise. As a result, the much hyped sequence inside of the trailer half way through the film is for the most part, very well executed and squirm-inducing. The makeup that brings the mutants to life is award worthy on its own. The look and feel of these monsters is absolutely terrifying, and should send shivers down people's spines as they look at these grotesque creations. It's just too bad they border on parody when they are actually doing something on screen.<br/><br/>And while you would not exactly think it from the type of film it is, the cinematography and set direction is very well done.<br/><br/>Yet again, Aja has fumbled. While the mutants make look nightmarish, and the look of the film is fairly terrifying, the script just does not make anything good come out of it. The acting is nothing special, and the story just does not have the same edge as it did in 1977. But hey, what do I know? They are already in production of the sequel as I write this. I guess it really is just a matter of taste.<br/><br/>5/10.<br/><br/>(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

Later they did that bit when instead of killing him instantly in the multitude of opportunities they had - they toyed with him (mucking about with his hair etc.) ultimately taking their eye off the ball and getting killed themselves.<br/><br/>There are dozens of other plot holes - like why assume you've killed everyone at ANY time? Particularly the kids, both of whom behave like the one guy they kill must be the last villain alive when both were previously attacked by two other villains they don't, at the time, know are dead. One of them wasn't, in fact.<br/><br/>At the end they are miles away from anywhere, in the middle of the desert, still unaware of how many other loonies are left alive, in exactly the same situation as they were at the start but with a burnt motor home, less amunition, no food or water and half the family dead. Yet they act like they're home and dry.<br/><br/>Add to this a dog that instinctively makes moral judgements and discerns whether people are good or bad, and you have a bit of a stupid film.<br/><br/>Have seen the end now - guess what - I was right about the baby.<br/><br/>Nothing special."
"BA_Harrison","7","0","3","21 August 2006"," Solidly entertaining horror, but no classic.
","With his debut feature Haute Tension, director Alexandre Aja received mixed reviews: some saw the film as a breath of fresh air and hailed Aja as the future of horror; others lambasted it for stealing the plot from Dean Koontz's book Intensity and delivering an unbelievable twist ending. I am definitely in that second camp.<br/><br/>Aja proved to me that he certainly has no problem in delivering the requisite gore and he has an eye for a nicely framed shot, but decent ideas and an inability to create an atmosphere seem to be his sticking points. For his second movie, remaking a classic like The Hills Have Eyes didn't seem like such a wise move to me.<br/><br/>The new version, for the most part, follows the original pretty faithfully (a family gets stranded in the desert and are attacked by cannibalistic mutants) but adds all of the bells and whistles too often expected of a modern horror movie: we get loads of extremely convincing gore, a pretty girl, some MTV style editing, and the possibility of a sequel. The result is a relentlessly gruelling experience, but Aja forgets a couple of things that would've massively enhanced the experience for me: a smidgen of tension and a tad of originality.<br/><br/>Aja makes the mistake of thinking that, by totally disgusting his audience, he can ignore the fact that a good horror should scare. I love a decent dose of gore as much as the next splatter fan, but I like to be frightened too and feel that Aja missed a great opportunity to absolutely terrify the pants off the audience.<br/><br/>The French director also loses his way when the movie veers too close to Texas Chainsaw Massacre territory: Doug (Aaron Stanford), the pacifist husband of eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) discovers the home town of the mutants, a dilapidated nuclear-bomb test area, whilst searching for his abducted baby daughter. In one of the decaying houses, he discovers a chair-bound freak who handily fills in the audience with some background story detailing the cannibals' existence. Doug is then captured by the freaks, and subjected to all kinds of horror in a charnel house before escaping, and exacting bloody revenge. This whole section is way over-the-top, stretches plausibility and seems completely out-of-place. It was if Aja, knowing that he wouldn't get a chance to remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (having already been retold in 2003), tried to shoehorn his version into this film instead.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a passable slab of modern horror; it does manage to revolt and is never boring, but I do think that Aja needs to choose his next project very carefully. I sincerely believe that he has talent and, at some point in the future, he will deliver a truly great horror film; one that doesn't rely on borrowing thematically from others or on dishing out excess gore. I look forward to that day."

","I have watched and enjoyed a lot of horror movies over the years and was looking forward to this remake after the excellent way the new ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was handled. Sadly, I found this movie to be over long and formulaic by comparison.<br/><br/>The characters in the new ""Hills Have Eyes"" were almost all completely unsympathetic, with the possible exception of the mother and older sister. To sit through and enjoy a survival horror movie it is important to care about (at least) some of the characters and hope they survive, but I found myself caring more about the dogs than anyone else. At times, I even found my mind wandering off to other movies as I watched this.<br/><br/>Sadly, with a new generation of less-demanding movie-goers we can probably look forward to several more inferior remakes of old horror movies, and this may even end up being one of the Aces in the pack."

The stuff between was just violence. I am actually a horror movie fan, but this movie made me sick and angry (not because how bad the world could be, or is), it made me think that the director is a sick pervert. I almost wished sometimes that some scenes were supposed be funny, but they were not. I believe that too much of anything does not do any good. This movie is not telling us any new message, it is just a condensed can of violence. Exactly like Hostel."

","Not scary at all, and so stupid in places I laughed at it. The scariest part was the opening with the mutant fetuses in jars. After the very boring beginning there was some neat stuff like the guy killing himself with a shot gun, the babies toys being sprayed with blood, and the dad burning. After that there were mutants and pick axes got really old fairly quickly. Then it was just lots of really pointless killing that was overly gory and not very realistic. I like gore as much as the next horror fan, but I like a little plot in there SOMEWHERE. I didn't find very much. I really like Ruby, but she really didn't do much until the very last few seconds, and then they kill her. I would have liked to see the other characters interact with he, but didn't. Heck, getting to know anything about any of the other mutants probably would have make me at least feel *something* when they killed them off, but alas it was just an excuse for more random badly done gore. I wouldn't recommend it unless you need fodder in a horror parody."

NO SUBTEXT.<br/><br/>It was admittedly a little slow at first, but then all of the sudden things began to take a turn for the wicked.

I'm glad I didn't pay $$$ to see it in the theater, I would have shot my own version of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre right there.<br/><br/>First of all, I have never seen the original movie so I can't comment how how great it was or how the remake competes. But as soon as the movie started I already knew exactly the whole plot from beginning to the end. It was like watching the new Chainsaw Massacre plus Wrong Turn combined.<br/><br/>There is zero creativity left in Hollywood for the horror genre and it's sad. And what's worse is that they treat viewers like idiots by producing the same crap again and again and expects us to pay to see it. To illustrate, read movie summary below:<br/><br/>1. Family goes on vacation and drives through remote area<br/><br/>2. Family meets gas attendant, gas attendant works with the freaks/psychos (with zero motivation behind their killing habits except they are all mental)and sends family off to direction of death <br/><br/>3. Family drives toward death and has tires blown by psycho.<br/><br/>4. Family dies one by one.<br/><br/>(cue in me falling asleep here...)<br/><br/>5. One family member becomes super-human and kills psycho one after another, even after being beaten unconscious, knocked over the head, thrown over glass windows, slashed over the face, knocked near unconscious again.<br/><br/>6. Psychos die, the end.<br/><br/>How very original.<br/><br/>And to stretch out the film even longer (or to even have one at all), each family member has the brain size of a pea. And it's the lack of any intelligence of these characters that really ticked me off. The kid in the movie can't aim at all and just randomly shoots at thin air even when the psycho is directly behind him with no weapon. Then there's the superhero who gets saved by the dog, and the first thing he does is run all the way across the house to fetch his baseball bat, when the villain has just dropped the Axe right in front of him.<br/><br/>To continue the plot further along, they have made pea sized brain kid super intelligence near the end. The kid figures out how to make booby trap with a fishing pole, match and gas tank and miraculously learns to do bondage knots on the villain's hand (in a split second) as well.<br/><br/>I felt like I was cheated, like the director was making fun of viewers' intelligence. There is no continuity or any coherence to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs to wake up and stop rehashing old materials again and again... the shock value is numbing, the originality is zero, and the entertainment value is.....

","The director really couldn't decide where he was going with this movie. I think he was trying to go for the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" effect but ended up with a movie that was a very bad horror in the first half and a decent action in the second half. <br/><br/>There are certain parts of the movie that could be edited out entirely- the entire first third of the movie except the first 10 or 15 minutes could have been taken out with no effect on the plot. The main part that needs to be removed is the section concerning the gas station. This is how the movie progressed:<br/><br/>1. Talks about nuclear weapons testing which resulted in mutants. five min 2. Family traveling near testing area. three min 3. Gasses up, is sent into the dangerous zone by the gas attendant. FORTY MINUTES. 4. Crashes in danger zone. five minutes 5. ""Dad"" goes off and dies. five minutes *At this point, the supposed horror movie becomes an action movie* 6. Women are raped, Baby is stolen. ten minutes 7. The other guy goes on a killing spree to get his baby back. forty-five minutes 8. End.<br/><br/>This is a very rough summary of time spent in each main ""portion"" of the movie, and as the reader of this can see, almost a third of the movie was devoted to the gas station portion where pretty much nothing happened, except that the gas attendant became angry at a woman for going through his bag and sent them to their death. The director needs to change the movie into either a complete horror, or a complete action movie."
"missmarmite","4","0","1","14 July 2006"," For fans of the genre only - unfortunately...
","Although I normally prefer other types of films, a good drama, a feel-good comedy, an art-house film, I need a good horror film from time to time. I had hoped this was one for me. It was not.<br/><br/>I had chosen this particular film because Ted Levine is in it. And having seen lots of his films, the choice was an easy one to make.<br/><br/>The problem was, apart from him, there was nothing to like about the film. And even he couldn't deliver a performance up to his standards.<br/><br/>When I read horror, I expect horror, and not just some cheap close-ups of blood gushing from various wounds. But this film didn't offer much else. I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't even disgusted by the amount of blood, I wasn't entertained. Because there was no horror, just the work of a director, who doesn't seem to know any other way of filming something apart from close-ups. The easy way, in my opinion.<br/><br/>One example. In a scene some fingers get cut off by an axe. This happens in a close-up, the viewer sees everything, blood spurts, the owner of the hand yells out in pain. I think that is an easy but not clever way to show what's happening. Let's compare it to a similar scene in L'empire des loups, a French film with Jean Reno. Here we have a police officer who isn't shy. He grabs the bad boy, sticks his hand under a huge paper knife ( the one you cut entire sheets of paper with) and yanks the knife down. You see the officer's distorted face while he is doing it. The bad boy cries out in pain. Similar scene, but so very different, because in the French film the viewer sees the hand being placed under the knife, but not in a close-up, in a corner of the room, and the rest happens in the imagination of the viewer. The ones who need gore can imagine it, the weaker ones can imagine something softer. So it's right for everybody and everybody will remember that scene as a good and satisfying scene. This is clever film making. Just bluntly showing everything isn't. Every film student can do that. Not showing things and yet letting people think they actually did see something, that is art.<br/><br/>Maybe this film was made for an audience who love blood and nothing else, don't expect clever film making, unusual solutions in showing simple slashing, new ideas for old hat. Then this film hit the target, no doubt. But everybody who wants to see a good horror film, turn away and look someplace else.<br/><br/>I give this film 4 out of ten. One for Ted Levine, one for the fuel station house which was built from scratch in the Moroccon desert, one for the CGI faces which really looked very good. And one for the laugh I had about a film, which could have been so much better."

"tonymurphylee","Null","0","1","10 July 2006"," Another Letdown from Director Alexandre Aja
","*1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>When I saw HIGH TENSION, I was completely disappointed. The film was terrible and unbelievable, and yet it was well acted, sounded great, and looked cool. However, the storyline stretched out into a terrible film in which a lesbian woman completely screws up all of her easy chances of saving her and her friend so many times that the film turned into a big joke. Many people had complained about the ending of the film being terrible, but it was my favorite part of the movie because it confirmed that it was all actually a big joke.<br/><br/>Now there were a few little moments in HIGH TENSION that I thought were excellent scare quirks. Two good examples were an early scene in the film where the killer has oral sex with a severed head. And another scene when a tiny little musical device dances on a woman's desk gave the film a creepy mood, but when the thirty minute mark of the film was hit, the film instantly became horrendous. The film was my #1 most hated film of 2003, but I knew that the director of the film could make a good horror film with the right stuff though.<br/><br/>Now director Alexandre Aja has made another film. A remake of an early Wes Craven film that is now considered to be one of the best cult classics of horror. THE HILLS HAVE EYES. In it, a whole family is forced to do battle with weird inbred freaks with a cannibalistic urge. This man's remake changes a couple things. First, instead of being weird inbred people, they are now mutated creatures that were the result of a nuclear reactor exploding and melting them. And the family seems to have many more members. Did I think that this film was the good horror film that I have been waiting for? Well I'll tell you...<br/><br/>The look of this film is beautiful and ugly, just the way it should be. The characters do seem quite realistic in there own little ways. The mutants are scary and grotesque, and the music is appropriately eerie enough to create the right amount of tension and suspense, and yet it is a terrible film. The reason why has nothing to do with the film being made poorly in any particular area, and I am well aware that a horror film doesn't have to be entertaining or thought provoking to be good(just look at THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE). And I normally have no real complaints about shock value. But this film is just plain disgusting and horribly overdone.<br/><br/>Again, this normally wouldn't be a problem at all, but in this case it is. Don't think that I hate shock and gore and disturbing stuff. Some of my favorite films are PINK FLAMINGOS, OLDBOY, BRAINDEAD, ICHI THE KILLER, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and IRREVERSIBLE. The film is overdone to excess. The real scares are drowned out by the buckets of gruesome images and events. There is exploding heads, crucifying, burnings, dismemberment, mutilation, cannibalism, and even a couple quasi-rape scenes. The film just isn't worth the time to sit through in my opinion. The film is boring in its excess of flesh and torture and yet somehow gives the impression that it is a serious movie. There is so much gruesome, disgusting, and violent content that the film stopped being scary and because the equivalent of a freak show. It would have worked if it were low budget, but for a theatrical project, it was boring and stupid.<br/><br/>The audience in the theater were pretty freaked out. Many girls were crying and screaming, and many boys were jumping at the jump scenes and being shocked by the scenes of violence. The theater was pretty packed when I saw it opening day. This film obviously was an unpleasant experience for them. The number of people who walked out was a little surprising because I honestly was far more grossed out by sAW2 than this. It didn't help that I was watching this with three of my cousins who were all horror film fans. After we all came out when the film was over, all of my cousins said that they hated it, but I didn't hate it. I was just wished that it was done a lot better.<br/><br/>I still do not doubt that Alexandre Aja can make a really good horror film, and I know that for a fact now. This film was close, but he overdid it. The original film was bad, yes, but it didn't really matter that it was bad because it tried to be bad. It tried to be trashy and stupid and excessive. This film sucks because it didn't try to be bad. It tried to be good and it had spirit, but it didn't have a heart. The film was too ""in your face"". It was to resilient. It was too unforgiving. A good horror film doesn't have to be any of these things. A good horror film has to have a good story, good characters, and a heart. This had a good story and good characters, but no heart. Oh well. Maybe next time it will be perfect. It was better than HIGH TENSION, but it was still stupid.<br/><br/>Rated R for strong gruesome violence and terror throughout, and for language."
"Anonymous_Maxine","3","0","3","10 July 2006"," Ah, the evolution of the movie monster
","I admit first off that it is s surprise to me that the new Hills Have Eyes has a higher rating on the IMDb than Wes Craven's original film, a democratic oddity that I chalk up to more and more young people watching the IMDb, not only interested more in newer horror movies than older ones, but interested less in watching original, or even classic, films. I really hope the young people of today are not losing sight of the great films that have come in years past, because that would have a dire effect on the kinds of films that we can expect in the future. On the other hand, I could just be losing interest more and more with disturbing horror movies, although I still love the old ones, so I doubt it.<br/><br/>In this remake of The Hills Have Eyes, the murderous people that come out of the hills are not just cut off from society and displaying the effects of generations of inbreeding, but are instead horrific examples of the effects of nuclear testing in the American deserts of the southwest. So everything needs to be bigger and faster and scarier than the original movie, which may be why the quality always seems to suffer so badly in modern remakes. The traveling family can't just break down, they have to crash, they can't just be on a vacation, they have to be suffering from almost universal internal strife (no one can communicate with each other in a civilized manner), and of course, we can't just have dirty, depraved villains, they have to be cartoonish movie monsters that are barely human. It's sad the effect it takes to shock people these days because filmmakers have lost sight of what is scary and are just going for something grosser than the last movie.<br/><br/>Here's another thing, there's a rape scene in the movie. I hate that. I'm adding rape scenes to my list of things I would be perfectly happy to never see in a movie again, right along with beheadings and anything involving any of the Wayans brothers. Anyway, as with just about every other wrong turn movie (including the god-awful Wrong Turn), a group of morons take the advice of a degenerate gas station attendant and take a dirt road off of the paved road in the middle of the desert, idiotically believing that it is some kind of short cut. <br/><br/>The sad thing is that the mutants' indignation at having been subjected to ""your"" radioactive poisoning is eventually displayed, as the family is blamed for these peoples' deformities and thus their massacre supposedly justified. Yeah, I have all the sympathy in the world for the people that suffered radioactive poisoning from nuclear testing back in the 1950s and 1960s, but I will go ahead and say right now that the people that are eligible for my sympathy did not think it best to set up residence in the fake town built by the government (and intended to be destroyed) at the bottom of one of the craters created by the bombs and then proceed for generations to mate with each other.<br/><br/>We are then led off on a boring journey of the owners of the eyes doing the eating and the idiot family being eaten. There is no depth to a single character so it's impossible to care about a single one of them (it also doesn't help that not a single one of them made one smart decision in the movie from beginning to end)and we get to see some gore and some heavily made up movie monsters. Yawn. <br/><br/>(spoilers) Oh here's something, why is it okay that a little girl dies in this movie? Is it because she's saving one of the normal people from being killed or because she's deformed? I'm curious as to the assumptions that can be made about modern moviegoers where that didn't kill the movie with controversy, because I can pretty much guarantee that this movie would not have been released if that girl's eyes were even."

"BrutusCalavander","1","0","2","1 July 2006"," Do the producers feel as bad for making it as I feel for watching it?
","After watching ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake, I asked myself ""What is a horror film?"" I guess the category is so broad that it is near impossible to define. All I could come up with is ""Does it scare you?"" If it does, then it is a good horror film. Sorry folks, this film did not meet that criteria for me. I always immediately discount the little cheap thrills that bad directors will bring about by having a loud noise combined with either a quick view of the killer/monster/alien or a cat/dog/bird jumping across the screen. After all, I will jump if you sneak up behind me and yell ""Boo!, but I hardly think I will be psychologically scarred by that act. Well, there's plenty of that in this film. Removing such contrivances from my assessment of the film, the only thing left is a sickening, disappointed feeling that I feel towards myself for actually staying to watch this whole movie. <br/><br/>As others have said, this movie is chock full of dumb, pseudo horror movie behavior. Here are some highlights: -Two cases of guys with little ammunition firing blindly into general direction of bad guys. (One a former cop!) -Several instances of characters slightly wounding bad guys and rather than finishing them off, they are apparently waiting for the wounds to fester and the bad guys to die of an infection. -The total denial syndrome. In this case, a truck and a trailer run over some spikes. No one seems to think it odd that they have blown out eight tires simultaneously. Just some dumb luck I guess. Darn! <br/><br/>Putting all that aside, the main reason I can't recommend this film is just that it doesn't care about any of the characters in it. If you want me to care that these characters are getting killed, you have to at least make me understand them. There is no character development on either the side of the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" in this film. I have seen more character development in shampoo commercials. So, if you don't care what happens to the main characters or why the bad guys are killing them, all you are left with is some weird voyeuristic need to see gore and violence perpetrated on some nice people on vacation. If this makes you sick, good. (This indicates you are actually a human being. Go watch something uplifting and try to forget about this pile of manure.) If you still like this movie, go seek some professional help and stay away from small children and house pets."

","I never thought it could or would happen. Having a remake that is actually better than the original. The Hills have Eyes remake IS much better than the original. I hated the original. This version however is terrific. I have read some reviews where people thought this movie was to brutal and graphic. I'm not sure what they watched. This is no worse than any other slasher movie. Heck, movies like Texas Chainsaw, I Spit on your Grave, Last House on the Left, Evil Dead, Friday the 13th have more gore and rape in them than The Hills have Eyes. I thought the mutants were much more scary and more realistic looking in this than the original. I thought the actors were better too. For being a slasher film I did not feel like I was watching actors. I really felt this family being terrorized by the crazed killers. This time I feel like we got some kind of ending. The original had the worst ending in movie history in my opinion. The Hills have Eyes is a must for any horror fan. If your not a fan of horror, then you should be watching these kinds of movies in the first place. Enjoy!"

There's a good bit of relatively graphic violence, some tense moments and once it gets going, stays pretty ""intense"". The mutant make-up FX are good for the most part, though a few of the mutants were kinda goofy looking. I typically prefer more ""underground"" horror films, but THE HILLS HAVE EYES ('06) is definitely a solid film and worth a look.

","This horror has drawn much too many comments than it deserves, so I'll add only a few words. First,the director being the son of the well known Alexander Arcady, (Le Coup de Sirocco, Le Grand Pardon, etc) a ""Pied Noir"" (i.e. formerly a French from North Africa), he was able to film most of it in Morocco, where the desert is more colorful and sinister than New Mexico's (I've traveled to both). Second, the assistance was made (I may as well type ""mad"") mostly of teenagers, who knew what they wanted and came to see it. Third, when the so-called ""goods"" kill the so-called villains, the assistance burst into frantic applause, forgetting that those villains were merely victims of the ""civilization"" which tested nuclear experiments in the nineties. I must confess than the movie is cinematographically well done, but absolutely senseless. And I haven't the slightest intention to see the 1977 version. harry carasso, Paris, France"

","I just finished watching this movie for the first time and have to say that I didn't really expect much out of it. And that's about what I got.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was alright, and it was certainly gory. But a lot of the film just didn't go together too well and was shaky. The dialogue was pretty horrendous (my favorite being when Bobby says ""that's so random"") to the point where it added humor to the movie. And the plot wasn't amazing by any stretch.<br/><br/>But I expected this from Craven. Knowing that the great Robert Burns was involved in the original along with Craven, I expected some awesome messed up gore. And there was some. However, the digital age showed itself a bit too much in this film; the deaths were way too overdone and extreme. Not in a gore sense, as I'm a man who likes his gory horror films, but in a computer graphics were really only made to go so far and if you make it look too fake it looks almost cheesy sort of way. It made me yearn for the claymation of the evil dead series or the classic CGI-less shots of TCM and the Nightmare series.<br/><br/>It certainly tried to step out of the realm of the average horror movie.

"frantic119","4","0","1","25 June 2006"," I'm a little disappointed
","OK through this I am pretty much just going to point out the stupidity or illogical decisions I saw. After a long introduction the movie really picks up. One thing that I do'nt think was properly explained was the gas station attendants relation with the mutants. Here are my thoughts. 1.He in someway raised the mutants after their parents death(Although papa Jupiter looks to old for this to be) 2.He only made a deal to send people to the mutants. So anyway after the families car breaks down I start to have some major problems with the story. Here are a few -Bob(the father) fires rounds from his revolver into the air, basing his shots only on sound(it's made clear he was a police officer) -After finding his large German Shepherd ripped open Bobby decides to tell no one in an effort not to scare anyone. He does however later bolt from the RV with a gun after the dog gets off its chain. -When the mutants begin burning big Bob the mother comes out of the ""3 person RV"" without noticing her daughter being raped by what later appears to be a 7 foot tall mutant -This maybe a goof I'm not really sure, but during the burn a piece of big Bobs burning shirt blows up to reveal perfectly unharmed flesh OK then after having experiencing 3 murders Doug decides to wonder off into the desert with a dog and a baseball bat. I know it was to get his child, but still thats just not a good plan..or a plan at all.. So after somehow finding the prop town I ran into another problem. -Doug manages to get himself and the dog into the car without making a single sound in an inhuman amount of time.I guess this is excusable though. So after sneaking into the playroom to get his baby he is knocked out and placed in a human butchers shop while other then a bump on the head he is completely unarmed(in contrast with what is in the freezer(?) he wakes up in which is full of well butchered arms and legs. After breaking out and being attacked by a huge mutant(papa Pluto I think, but his name is never made clear) and when finally given a break from the fighting by the dog Doug decides to lock himself in a bathroom(?) instead of beating the hell out of the mutant while he's being distracted by the dog. So after having 2 of his fingers chopped off(which really seems to have no effect on his ability to grasp objects) Doug stabs the mutant in the foot(which kind of confuses my perception of the mutants stamina given that 5 minutes before he was stabbed in the STOMACH by a pike) he distracts him long enough to grab the American flag out of the head of big Bob(who for some reason was'nt put in the butchery for unknown reasons) stab the mutant in the neck and then finish him off. This is where I also got a little confused. Why did the mutant with the neck brace and a limp get a gun despite the almost complete lack of peripheral vision while the rest of the mutants got spike strips and pick axes. I thought at first maybe Pluto did'nt get the gun because he only has one(working) eye..then I remembered him driving a pickup at the beginning Well anyway Doug kills this mutant easily and takes his shotgun then goes to another house to look for his baby. After not finding her and being introduced to 2 characters(the girl with the boil and the boy who looked like he came out of a chimney) who do absolutely nothing whatsoever to advance the plot Doug runs back outside to see Ruby(a little mutant girl) on the cliff with his baby. He then runs after her and is attacked by Lizard. After lizard beats Doug to what should be to death he runs after Ruby because killing the baby is so important.. Doug then retrieves the shotgun smashes Lizards face with it then unloads 3 rounds(1 being in Lizards neck!) he then is given his baby as Lizard inevitably stands back up with the shotgun that was conveniently laid by him and attempts to kill Doug, but is pushed off a cliff by(and with) Ruby. Meanwhile the surviving family(Bobby and Brenda) setup a trap for any mutants who come close enough to the RV. Here is where I run into some more problems -Papa Jupiter although I may be mistaken looks completely normal -Bobby unloads a clip mostly into the air, but he also manages to hit Jupiter twice(there were even small dust clouds from the impact)... These rounds simply bounce off.. So instead of taking the front door Jupiter for some reason decides to go around and play peak-a-boo with the kids...he then comes back around after untying his hands from a bungee chord and opens the door to meet a wall of fire(the kids escape the explosion though) The kids then meet Doug who's been walking in a desert with an infant wrapped in a blanked. So the kids and Doug are stranded in the Desert as some other either unmentioned or surviving mutant is watching them in the distance. About the only character who had any sense was the dog, beast. On the plus side though the suspense is well done along with the gore..The movie really just isn't scary though other than a couple of shock moments. If anything it's a little disturbing."

There are no specific details in this review.<br/><br/>While this Wes Craven film has a good concept, and I have nothing but respect for him, this movie was SICK. There were things that just did not need to be done at all to get the point across.<br/><br/>I was so excited to see this movie, and rented the ""Unrated"" version as soon as it came out. I don't know if it was because it was unrated that it was so terrible, but I saw things way beyond what were necessary to enrich the story.<br/><br/>Just to give you an idea, my husband is a US Marine and at one point he got up and walked away. We have no problems with blood and guts, but rape and such things are a little different. If you have qualms about sexual abuse, or anything like it then maybe you should skip this one.<br/><br/>The storyline is great... A little slow in the beginning, but it moves along in the latter portion of the movie. Aside from the plethora of inaccurate information (no one could survive the initial blast unless they were VERY far away from it; all dummies in the test site were almost intact aside from a bit of charring... Nuclear bombs completely obliterate everything within a large radius)the story is great and has a strong psychological draw. It will definitely leave you with your mouth hanging wide open at times.<br/><br/>All in all I give this 3 stars, just because the raunchy parts override the good parts."

To be brief, the movie was dry and stale. The special effects were pretty good and the story itself was inventive and at least somewhat original. But, it was the poor acting from the stranded family that really killed this movie for me. Not only that, but the majority of the movie is shot in a giant, over-rated sand box. It screams low-budget! Fans of the original version may like this, as well as those who like a good thriller.

","I'm very sceptical when it comes to horror movies. Most of them suck. The last really good horror film I saw that I had nothing bad to say about was The Ring. That was pretty good. Which brings us to The Hills Have Eyes. It's not bad, but not really great. I liked the violence. It seemed right that it should be so extremely bloody. The tone of it was pretty cool. And the actors did a good job portraying a normal American family, trying to survive in a desert full of cannibals. What I didn't like were the cannibals themselves. They're too funny looking. I couldn't help but think of The Goonies when I saw most of them. It would have been better if they didn't speak. It might have made them scarier. The only other thing I didn't like was the ending. I won't say what exactly happens, but I thought it needed more of a finality (if that's a word. lol) It was left open and I don't like that. But, overall it was okay and worth watching at least once, so.... hey! Why not?"

"ninjagaiden007","10","0","1","19 June 2006"," The best horror remake ever to be made.
","On a road trip through the New Mexico desert on the way to San Diego, the Carter family (including Kathleen Quinlan, Ted Levine, Aaron Stanford, and Vinessa Shaw) find themselves in the middle of nowhere. Asking directions from a local gas merchant, the family is purposefully sent into hell where a macabre band of irradiated mutants (from government nuclear testing) attack the clan, leaving the few remaining survivors to spend the next day fighting to stay alive when certain doom is all around them waiting in the hills of the blazing wasteland.<br/><br/>French director Alexandre Aja made a glorious debut with the 2003 Euro chiller ""High Tension."" Admittedly, he screwed up the ending with worthless twists and turns, but the core of the experience was pure dread, and promised a bright young talent who has respect for the art of the fright, and is fascinated with the power of the genre to disturb. That promise was kept for his Hollywood fat-cat debut.<br/><br/>An update of Wes Craven's 1977 film, Aja's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (IMDb listing) is eager to thicken the trauma inflicted by Craven almost 30 years ago. I wouldn't call the earlier film a classic, but it has a strong following, and Craven worked wonders with a non-existent budget and a screenplay geared toward pummeling drive-in entertainment. Aja has more tricks up his sleeve, along with more coin and wonderful make-up work from KNB to viciously and extensively realize the mutants. Craven was looking to simply scare some folks with blunt violence and a subtle lecture on the primal nature of man. Aja's film is an absolute declaration of war. Also the mutants were nicely done and had fantastic fight scenes.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Aja isn't afraid to creep out his audience, and ""Eyes"" might upset some with its extreme splatter violence. Like Rob Zombie's ""Devil's Rejects,"" the new ""Hills"" is a robust genre concoction, twisting the MPAA's limits with ferocious depictions of murder and torment. The movie doesn't shy from showing the shocking menace and greasy strength of the mutants, nor does it turn a blind eye when the Carters try to even the score with guns, baseball bats, axes, or whatever they can get their hands on. Since Aja has the benefit of hindsight, his ""Hills"" is much more claustrophobic in locations (it was shot in Morocco) and story design. The film drags the viewer by the hair, kicking and screaming into doom, where Craven was simply summing up the gumption to suggest it. A lot has changed over the years.<br/><br/>While given ample opportunity to muck around with the original script, Aja plays his version fairly close to Craven's film. There is a greater expansion on the mutant family, who live in a ghostly, neglected mannequin community once used to gauge how nuclear weapons would affect 1950s suburbia. While we meet more of the ""family"" in this outing, their dialog is cut down severely from Craven's script, thus elevating their scare factor while emphasizing their horrifying deformities and thirst for blood. Sure, it's hard not to miss the magic of Michael Berryman, but what Aja dishes up here is terror, not a parade of oddities. These cannibals are fierce creatures, and Aja makes them into a substantial threat.<br/><br/>Not tickling me quite as much is the insistence that Aja has on cheap scares for the first half of the film. Clearly, the story doesn't need such counterfeit jolts, but Aja trots them out with an unmistakable amount of pride. The rest of the film has enough nightmare imagery for an entire orphanage, which promptly ends the need to keep the audience percolating, but the damage is done. Perhaps Aja isn't confident enough behind the camera yet to ditch these needless speed bumps in the pace.<br/><br/>Lost in Aja's interpretation is the character arc of Doug (Stanford), who in Craven's film was ""the larger idea"": the quiet pacifist turned into a blood-thirsty killer. Aja still plays around with those contradictory ideas, but he pushes the character into more brazenly iconic realms. Here Doug is given the best Sergio Leone encouragement, complete with rattling Morricone guitars on the soundtrack (part of the tremendous score by Tomandandy) and some minor heroic moments. It provides a needed thrill in the final act of the movie, and while it scrapes the sour taste of lunacy, it does so in all the right ways.<br/><br/>It's always tough to get behind a remake, but Aja has chosen a film that was ripe for a second chance, and I feel he's made a better piece of cinema as a result. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" might not have the sneak attack appeal of Craven's film, or the moral questioning, but it cooks in ways Craven has always missed in his own work. I'm positively itching to see what Aja has planned for his audience next."

","Having seen the original movie and being kind of disappointed in it I wasn't looking forward to a remake of a film that had cheesy acting and an ending that left me unsatisfied. Then I saw that Alexandre Aja was attached to it. Having seen High Tension and immediately loving it, I actually started looking forward to The Hills Have Eyes, because I thought Aja could (hopefully) save it. Now, I'm not one to hate the original, but then contradict myself in liking a remake- the original was gruesome and had some intense moments, but the ending just left me unsatisfied. The acting was mediocre, but the film was made on an almost shoestring budget. Dee Wallace was good in the original, no argument there. But everyone else seemed to overact in a way. Onto this remake. The opening sequence was great. I loved that intense moment of insanity. Brutal, to the point, and gave you a taste of what was to come. Normally I don't like it when movies do that because it usually sets itself up to be as good as that opening sequence, but then the audience is let down by the movie going nowhere near that exciting in the end. Not this film. The opening sequence is nothing compared to what will follow. The film overall had a great cast, plenty of intense moments, and gore galore! It was good to finally see a film which balanced suspense with gore the way Hills Have Eyes did. Unlike the original, the ending to Aja's remake was so gratifying. Throughout the whole film I was on the edge of my seat, and the ending left me wanting more- in a good way. It was one of those films I enjoyed so much I wanted to see more. I ended up going through my DVD collection and watching old horror movies. I even re-watched the original version. Wes Craven's 1977 Hills Have Eyes was a classic. Aja's remake of the film, in my opinion, will become a classic, just like the original. It was brutal, in your face, and left me with a sadistic grin of pleasure on my face. 10/10"

","With ""Haute Tension"", I felt that Alexandre Aja had a lot of promise in the Horror movie arena. When I learned that he was tackling what I feel to be one of the most overrated Horror films of all time in ""The Hills Have Eyes"", I was chomping at the bit to see it.<br/><br/>I rented the Unrated version this past week and on top of being disappointed, after stewing a few days, I'm equally as disgusted. Not just with the let down of a film, but the content that was tossed in for the lack of any real story. My biggest gripe was the horribly tasteless rape scenes. Extended scenes of a teenage girl being forcefully raped? A new mother, probably still lactating no less, with this beast sucking on her breasts as she sits there crying? Is this entertainment? Seriously.<br/><br/>People, like the original, are building this up as some Romero-esquire commentary of the depraved nature of human beings in some parts. Are we any better for willfully taking movies like this in? It was bad enough the first 50 minutes of the movie were filled with cheap jump score scares, but the pay off being a bad CGI immolation and some lurid mysogeny? When you helm a remake, you're normally tapped because someone thinks you can improve on the original. Not make an offensive, debauched reinvisioning with more style than substance. The plot was paper thing to begin with, people make it more than it is so that it seems important. This movie could have done without a lot of what made it so evil, and quite possibly still felt fresh and original like ""Haute Tension"". Instead, it lacked anything engaging, and ended up being pretty much a carbon copy with some added violence to taste."

","Remakes, either a clear sign that a particular genre and/or artistic approach is exhausted of original content, or a heart-felt and invigorating tribute to a classic effort of cinematography: opinions diverge and each case seems to be so particular as to render too strict generalizations somewhat trivial. <br/><br/>If one is to judge The Hills Have Eyes (2006) on how well it achieved what it set out to accomplish- a truly disturbing, violent and convincing portrait of human depravity- then can is fair to say it is nothing short of brilliant. However, it naturally follows that this is not an experience that everyone is likely to enjoy, it does contain very graphic gore and quite gruesome acts of sheer horror which will obviously alienate a certain audience. But, in a way, that is part of its impact. Horror, and particularly this kind of insane gore-driven horror, is not for everyone. <br/><br/>Plot-wise, The Hills Have Eyes is nothing amazing, it follows a pattern that has been long established to explore highly tense situations that include as major elements a complete sense of isolation and vulnerability, which is keenly felt by the victims, and naturally presumes a group of villains to ""ignite"" the action, so to speak. What is quite well conceived is how these basic structured is handled and delivered to the viewing audience.<br/><br/>First of all, the setting was simply perfect. The desert is described with a lucid camera, creating a truly bleak and desolate atmosphere that only gains by reiteration. That we are not presented any alternative location only makes the claustrophobia more sublime. Clever light filters transform the world of rocks and ravines into a near surreal worldscape of nightmarish proportions. <br/><br/>In terms of character, we are given enough time to empathize with the people of the movie, and even though it is far from being a study on character, there is more attention paid to the emotional interactions of the characters than what one would expect in such a movie. Which is always refreshing as it adds a grim intensity to the horror such characters undergo. <br/><br/>Now, for the monsters. Truly disgusting, viciously horrid, mindlessly abject. And amazingly menacing, their presence is enough to make one uncomfortable. Which does say a lot about people in general and how they react to deformity. Yet, in this case, it is simply impossible not to follow the formulaic rhetoric offered, ugly= horrifying. <br/><br/>****Spoiler****<br/><br/>It should be added, however, that this same logic is not strictly adhered to. Ruby, although not as deformed as her kin, is far from normal and she acts as a redeeming force nonetheless. It could also be said that the very fact that she manages to show and feel mercy is only a proof that the actions of the rest were, indeed, the product of a choice and not the result of a genetic pre-disposition. <br/><br/>****End Spoiler****<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that is not afraid to show violence on screen, a raw and vicious kind of violence that is not diplomatic and makes no compromises with the audience's expectations.<br/><br/>And even though The Hills Have Eyes is a cult movie, it is, nonetheless, a coherent work of cinema that displays a mature and sophisticated attitude towards shooting a film."

","Saying The Hills Have Eyes is a cliché is a massive understatement. The cast includes two hapless, screaming blonde girls, one likable nerd, one angsty teen, one ex-policeman dad and one cheesy mother. There's all the moments of horror films you've seen over and over again. There's the wandering into a dark room, calling out 'hello, is anyone here.' There's the killing of animals whenever possible for cheap audience reactions. There's the countless times when someone comes to the rescue at the last minute. Characters only talk of what they plan to do in the future (I'm going to Cancun next year. I'm starting a security business) with that old, tired irony that they will soon die. And then there's the gore which is hardly notice buried under the mass of clichés. Worst of all is the use of sound. The sight of a monster, a stranger stepping into a room, finding a dead dog - all of this and more is over-accentuated by THAT bass heavy, horror sound that tells us - we should be scared right now. The only times this film scares is with cheap 'cat in a basket' effects where something suddenly lunges on screen. Naturally this is accompanied by THAT sound to tell us this is scary. But it's not. The monsters are just ugly, angry humans who pose little threat aside from their weaponry. There are plot holes (mostly to do with the elapse of time) and character problems (you would think the dog loving teen could distinguish a human making a dog noise from his own dog barking) and to top it off, there are several moments of pure generic lameness that are laughably bad. As a horror movie, it's missing any thrills, chills and all-round scariness. There are however some saving graces. As a bad horror film, it still remains enjoyable enough for being incredibly bad. And the creature effects are quite good and somewhat original, even if they're more comic book cool than terrifying. But for the most part, you can anticipate ever single moment in this movie. If a movie can't surprise you - it can't scare you, simple as that."

","""The Hills Have Eyes"" continues several bothersome contemporary trends. The fact that it's yet another remake of a ""classic"" 70s horror flick is at this point no surprise. Sure, when there are folks out there like M. Night Shyamalan and Lucky McKee who are producing original and effective scares, the sheer laziness of all this rehashing seems particularly offensive and tiresome. But what's truly troubling about films like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is their seeming embrace of extreme brutality for its own sake.<br/><br/>Not having seen Wes Craven's original, I'm at a loss for comparison. I imagine a parable about the effects of US nuclear policy, though, would have packed much more topical resonance in the 70s. As it is, there are just a lot of things about this new version that make very little sense. Like why the film adopts a deliberate look and feel of decades past (the protagonists tow around an old-school Airstream trailer), but makes sure we know its characters are cell phone-equipped. Or what we're supposed to make of the nuclear mutants who stalk our unsuspecting travelers. ""You made us what we've become,"" gurgles one from a bloated, twisted face. I don't know my history well enough to be sure when the last nuclear tests were in the American Southwest, but I know it was a while ago. Are we to assume they've just been happily reproducing through the years, even though sterility is one of the major effects of radiation? Otherwise, they should be elderly mutants. Or more likely, dead. And is it reasonable to believe that the dummy town they inhabit, presumably a former test site in a blast radius, would still be equipped with posed mannequins for post-blast study? There are too many silly inconsistencies with which to take issue. Possibly aware of this, ""The Hills Have Eyes"" does its best to plumb new depths of graphic violence. It's a particular fan of the Axe To The Head maneuver, which it deploys no fewer than three times. My issue isn't with such violence per se, but with the ends for which it's used. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" appears most interested in revolting us, which is very different from wanting to scare us, and a different species entirely from making us think. The film seems to fancy itself an updated allegory, but a throat-stabbing with an American flag does not a satire make.<br/><br/>I suppose it can be argued that the political and social extremes defining the current times are now being reflected pro rata in arts and entertainment; that increasing grotesquerie in movies is simply another facet of a culture currently debating to what inhuman lengths it will go in the name of safety and security. But films like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" play the insidious trick of cloaking themselves loosely with the language of social commentary and satire, without making a genuine effort to engage in them. Such dishonesty is the last thing we need these days."

","I'm not into horror movies as much as others, but I can (and do) appreciate a good horror flick from time to time. ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" however was not a ""good horror flick."" This movie is one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen, and I felt like the producers were really relying on the ""oh, sick"" feeling to pull the rest of the movie out of its mediocrity. The character development wasn't so bad, and I found myself cheering for the ""hero"" at the end, but my main gripe with this movie was the conclusion. It was so lame, everyone in the theater kind of went, ""Awww."" There were certain scenes in this film which really stood out to me, for good or for bad. For example, there's a scene where the camera pans out, and you get to see all of the nuclear blast sites from an aerial view, and it's pretty impressive. However, scenes such as the ""bonfire"" scene, with its cheesiness and obvious animatronics, should have been re-shot.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was worth seeing once, if only for the gore, but I probably would rather have rented it for 3.00 instead of paying 7.50 to see it in a theater."

","The Carter family is on a vacation heading to California, but on the way there they stop off at gas station in the New Mexico desert. The old guy who works there tells them of a short cut they could take to get to their destination quicker. So on that advice, they take the detour and suddenly moments into the trip the tyres blow out and they have a serve crash. This was no accident and the family find out it's a nuclear test sight and soon enough they encounter a band of rampaging cannibalistic, mutants (caused by nuclear testing) who live amongst the mountains. These brutes taunt their hapless victims and leave behind such bloody macabre. So, the few survivors, group up after the ambush and try to stay alive as there isn't a hope in hell anyone is going to come to their aid in this wasteland.<br/><br/>I was waiting in growing appreciation to see this flick and I finally got the chance when I made my way to the opening screening at my local cinema. And I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed at all. Far from it. For me it's on par with Wes Craven's original film. I enjoyed Craven's film, but I'm not a massive fan. So I went in their with an open mind (like you should always do) and I liked it. Simple as that. I always thought there was room for improvement and while, director Alexandre Aja's version ups the ante. I just couldn't pick which was one better. Both have certain advantages and disadvantages over each other. But if you enjoyed the original you'll most likely get something out of Aja's take.<br/><br/>Producer Wes Craven decided to get director Alexandre Aja's to craft out a remake of his beloved cult film. This is Alexandre Aja's second feature, who debuted with ""High Tension (2003)"". This top grade remake (the best in a long time) is an impressing and immensely well done, bone rattling experience that Aja has tapped into. The premise sticks pretty close the original's plot outline with little changes and details making their way into the script and background story. The most noticeable of the lot has to be the expansion on the mutants back story involving miners and radiation testing, but also notable is their lack of dialogue and personality structure. The aim here seems more like creating a monstrous aspect that focuses on the deformities and sheer aggression to belt out terror than just the bizarre nature of the ones' in the original who seemed more human and in control of their actions. I did miss the iconic performance of Michael Berryman, though.<br/><br/>The social commentary seemed much more stronger here with the gripes against the governments' nuclear testing. The images we see prove that. While, the transformation subtext behind one character is to show a geeky pacifist resort to his primal instincts prove that when we come to shove we are no better than the ones who evoke such horror. We can't hide behind our shells because when it comes down to survival our true nature takes hold as you look out for yourself and loves one at any given consequence. What the film had going for it was that you can't help but go through what the family does. You feel every painstakingly, brutal and discomforting second of it that folks suffer through. Director Aja knows how to extract such a gruelling, intensity that just reaches boiling point when the unbearably, punishing attacks occur with its extremely vivid and brutal violence. It would be totally offensive and hard going for the uninitiated, but the nihilistic violence is a essential part of the story's moral justification. Aja has guts and he heightens these fierce attacks with such morbidity and generates an unsettling air with some very effective jumps. Even before the mayhem occurs he adds in some cheap thrills that still have the impact to startle before it hits breaking point.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is thick, but not as raw and claustrophobic like Craven's was. This is mostly due to the budget being definitely better here. While the remake might seemed more polished around the edges, it didn't lose any effect in alienating the audience in this desert-less wasteland. Even the fast cutting didn't bother me too much, which I usually can't stand. The films looks magnificent with the eerie details and erratic camera-work that gives it a real rush. While, the opening half hour and interludes between the grilling attacks are rather tolerable. I was surprise as I thought maybe it would lose its way within these parts but the performances and a above-average script kept me glued. There were four performances that stood out and they would have to be Aaron Stanford as Doug, Dan Byrd as Bobby, Emilie de Ravin as Brenda and Robert Joy as one of the mutants, Lizard. The family here might be your typical nucleus, but they were a likable bunch at least. The mutants make-up was tip-top and they definitely looked the part when they broke into these jolting tussles. But what made the film for me had to be the stingingly, pulsating score, which shook you about at every possible opportunity by lampooning you at every single side.<br/><br/>There's no denying, the film is repellently, in-your-face but it successfully terrifies when it tightens the screw. The violence towards the end might lose that sense of realism that eventuated throughout most of the film, but the maniac actions of it is not too distracting from the overall feel. <br/><br/>A faithful venture into the old school genre of horror where the splatter is unflinching, themes underline the story and the air is very grim."
"Gravesofthetrust","10","0","1","17 April 2006"," One of the best movies I've seen
","*Minor Spoilers* (for the first five minutes of the film)<br/><br/>Like so many others I went to see The Hills Have Eyes remake with lowered expectations. I thought it would be a terrible remake in the vein of The Fog, Night of the Living Dead, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. However after the movie began and the people in the hills viciously murdered four (maybe five) people I was instantly hooked. This movie is by far one of the best horror movies ever made. The movie starts out relatively peaceful with a little text scroll explaining how the good old' US used to test nuclear weapons in the New Mexican desert, and it shows some government officials seeing if the area is still irradiated when suddenly someone gets a pickax through their head. Then it shows some actual nuclear test footage playing over a nice charming song (all the while showing people who were mutated due to radiation), then it proceeds to play out like the original '70s Hills Have Eyes, with a family making their way through the New Mexican desert on their way to California. The story as a whole doesn't differ all that much from Wes Craven's Hills. That's not to say it doesn't, but the main story actually follows the originals quite a bit. One key difference to note is the number of the hill people, there's more of them in this gory remake than in the original. Also the violence, there is a hell of a lot more of it in this version of the movie. Fans of the original Hills Have Eyes will definitely like this movie, if for nothing else, the fact that it actually adheres to the storyline of the original (Character names too, it even has the dogs!), and horror fans will love the movie as well. This movie is one of those that some people will look down on (mainly due to the violence), but others will love. Overall this was a great movie, it is definitely worth shelling out eight bucks to see. This movie is most definitely one of the best movies of this year, and is certainly the best remake ever made."

","It is very unusual to walk out of a theater, after having seen a the newest horror flick, and being pleased with what you viewed. I see ""scary"" movies with a hint of boredom and apprehension these days. A proper horror film has not been made for quite sometime. The Hills have Eyes is a little different.<br/><br/>It begins ominously enough, and is quite predictable, but leads the viewers with a steady hand. The movie starts with a classic run-down gas station, at which an average American family is turned off the road by a seemingly well-meaning man. At this point the audience would be shouting at the screen ""Don't do it, it's a trap!"". . . . in the old days. Now, it is harder and harder to spook your average teenager, or, in some cases, your average five-year-old.<br/><br/>The characters make the characteristic moves of all horror characters: following the dog into the darkness (the dog, always goes to the trouble), leaving one person alone to hold down the fort, going off alone, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But, Hills has its redeeming qualities in that it gives excellent scare-tactics. The ending, also, ends as a cliff-hanger, allowing you to make up whatever you think would suit such a movie."

I've read a lot of bad reviews of this film, and i don't understand it. Who are these people writing crap about this movie??? This is a horror movie! Not the bridges of Madison county. If you are negative to remakes or horror in general don't go and see it!!! I think ""Haute Tension"" was a good contribution to the genre and Mr. Craven made the right choice in picking Alexandre to make the remake of his classic. If your a true horror fan this movie will blow you away, and i think that this is one of the best remakes up till this point. Alongside ""Dawn of the dead"". When i saw ""HOSTEL"" i was surprised of the gore. Although it took some time for things to happen. I saw the same in ""THE HILLS"" And that is the reason i haven't given this movie ten stars. But on the other-hand it has great character buildup. I've read somewhere that some people don't care about the characters in this film and what happens to them. This is because they don't seem too like each other in the film. WHAT IS THIS CRAP!!!? If you don't care about what happens to these people go have a cat-scan. Or commit yourself! These are realistic and believable characters. If you had to drive through the desert in a crowded airstream(RV) you wouldn't be smiling or having fun either. <br/><br/>The movie has great scares and the gore is even better. (Thank you KNB for everything you touch:) <br/><br/>But be warned. This is not for the faint of heart.

","I feel that a remake is only fairly judged in comparison to the original. If a bad remake is made, it should receive less respect for ruining a good idea. If a better remake is made, it should be praised for its improvement. But one thing we should never do is give credit to the new movie for things already established in the old movie (why give a writer or director credit for something they just copied?).<br/><br/>I ma pleased to say this remake was exactly the best it could have been. It kept all the best scenes, all the best dialogue and added to them. The gore was increased, a whole new extended scene was inserted. The opening credits added more to the feel of the movie than the entire 1970s version had at all. The only thing lacking is the experience of a 70s/80s film you can only get from the the original (or from ""The Devil's Rejects""), but this is also a strength... allowing us to identify better with the new characters and add the new aspect of cellular technology.<br/><br/>The story, as you may know, is that of a family stranded in the desert by a nuclear testing site. They are soon attacked by a clan of radiation-affected mutants who also like the taste of human flesh.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say. If you like a good survival story or a gorefest, this is a fine film. If you liked the original, you'll probably like this better. I have heard that this director is ""the new Wes Craven"". Not true... he is much better than Craven can ever be (see ""Cursed""). I will gladly see his next film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: horror movies should not be remade, and neither should most other movies. This film, however, is the one exception to that rule. See it."

","I can't believe that people from other websites gave this movie 8 points of 10. I really can't. I thought it could be quite good after such an evaluation but I was deeply disappointed. I also asked myself why an actor like Ted Levine (who plays very funny ""Stottlemeyer"" in the ""MONK"" series) is part of such a BULLSHIT movie. Why is it so bad? 1.) NO story. - What is this? Of course a family prefers driving through a few-thousand-miles (nuclear-contaminated)desert instead of flying. And of course they take an abbreviation a stupid and obviously crazy hillbilly shows them. 2.) Moral? - Where? Was this movie accusing the US government for doing a huge amount of nuclear tests? Or not?! I don't know it looked more like glorifying these tests to create a very very small message.<br/><br/>This movie was just showing violence to show violence. Now sense in it, no reason. Did these creatures (that once were ""normal"" human beings) kill for ""food""? Or just for fun? The audience won't get to know. And then there was this most strange son-in-law who develops to a fighting killer that stays most dumb the whole time. But therefor he can ""receive"" a lot of violence against himself and survives anything (almost with a smile). The daughter looks pretty bitch-like and is the only reason to keep watching (for the first 10 minutes). Only once before I considered leaving the theater like by ""The hills have eyes"" but then I thought of my money and then I decided to keep on. It was surely wrong. Nobody will give me my wasted time back. The only reason why it is not a ""1"" is that there may be other films that are even worse (although I hardly can imagine that).

I hated all the regular people, and the irradiated miners made me want to chug bleach. Yes, I understand that they were mutants, but why were they super-strong? I didn't think that they were exposed enough on the film; the directors never gave me a clear reason for why the miners were like that, other than that they were irradiated.

Even though Aja's movie High Tension pleased me in most ways movies never will. I think taking on a remake this early was a mistake. But after seeing it I changed my mind I think Aja did an amazing job on this remake. I liked the small beat down town and the character's such as Pluto and Lizard was done quiet well. I loved how Aja made Pluto a lot more aggressive and how he filled out the mutations very well. However one thing I was very mad with cutting out. Jupiter and his scene with his father and when he broke in through the window I was surprised he left that out. But what can you do substituting it with him blowing his head off was quiet hilarious. As for the acting I thought they focused more on the short scened sequences and not much talking happening which I was pleased with because they were pretty bad at acting.

"andell","10","0","3","28 March 2006"," A Rare, Great Remake
","I have deleted my old posting to provide a new one, in part because of what feels like a very condescending lecture of moralistic people who seem to think that simply because a movie pushes the boundaries, it is unworthy of consideration. For the sake of would be viewers, I will return to this point at the end.<br/><br/>The Hills Have Eyes is a faithful remake of the 1977 horror classic of the same name that was made on a shoe string by a young director who had found his voice but still wanted to test his boundaries. The original movie, like MANY films of the 1970's, explored and played upon the fears that were common to people: a family traveling through the Southwestern USA to their silver mine is stranded and ultimately played upon by a brutal clan of humans who, through exposure to nuclear fallout and isolation in a desolate region, have developed an unrelenting and terrifying habit of killing and eating those who happen along their path.<br/><br/>The 1977 film was characterized by an original storyline, colorful and flamboyant family of villains, a God fearing and conservative family of vacationers, and an atmosphere of beauty and desolation that is both inspiring and terrifying. The remake incorporates many of these same qualities.<br/><br/>In this remake, a family trip to San Diego to celebrate the Silver Anniversary of the Big Bob Carter and Ethel Carter are stranded when the short cut they are directed to is booby trapped by the mutant clan of cannibals who time has forgotten and society has abandoned.<br/><br/>Along for the trip are the Carter's three children, Lynn, Brenda and Bobby, Lynn's husband Doug, and their baby Catherine. Ironically for the first time in a LONG TIME, I find that I've had no problems remembering the names of the characters- usually that tells me that I've seen a movie that has touched me in a certain way.<br/><br/>And ladies and gentlemen, there is no avoiding the issue: the Hills Have Eyes is NOT a pleasant horror movie. The scene inside the trailer, in which Brenda is sexually assaulted, Lynn is sexually assaulted and murdered, and Ethel is murdered is brutal, no question about that! But really, what did people expect they were going to see? As the story line continues, once stranded, the family is subjected to a brutal and gruesome assault that robs three of them of their lives, leaves a fourth cripplingly traumatized, and sees the baby kidnapped. You see, Alexandre Aja has sent a very strong message here: in the dark places and remote stretches of the USA, not everyone follows the same rules that we, living in a civilized society, might think of as being paramount in the conduct of all.<br/><br/>Of course for me, what I admire most about Aja's remake is the way the truth of the peril descends upon each member of the family in a different way, and how these truths, when weaved together, would have given the family plenty of warning. Big Bob finds the bag and the newspaper clippings; Lynn sees the mirror signals in the hills; Ethel hears the breathing on the radio; Bobby finds the dog Beauty dead; Doug finds the crater with discarded vehicles and possessions. Individually, these things are meaningless, however when they are interwoven together, the paint a very clear message of doom that, although Bobby comes to understand before the assault on the trailer, comes too late to prevent the carnage.<br/><br/>There are subtle differences in the tone of the two movies, but for the most part, you are watching a very faithful remake of the original 1977 film- this is something that horror fans respect very much. Of course, the idea that horror fans should be held to a different standard because they don't delude themselves in the notion that the brutality should be a deterrent is ridiculous: simply note the differing reactions between a movie like this, or like ""Hostel,"" and movies like the ""When a Stranger Calls"" remake.<br/><br/>Having said that however, the truth is that this film DOES improve upon the original in many ways. While I missed the spirit of family that was incorporated in the original through Papa Jup's position as Patriarch, this remake featured better acting, more interaction with Big Bob & Ethel's family, and a wider storyline. I did feel for the characters to a great deal.<br/><br/>To come back to the scene in the trailer, I found it very difficult to watch; I also found it difficult to watch the scene outside the trailer, when Big Bob burns to death to distract the others from what is about to transpire inside the trailer. If it makes you feel better, leave the theater while it happens. It does surprise that those who would profess to being disgusted by the scene inside the trailer wouldn't find the scene outside the trailer as disturbing- as Big Bob burns to death.<br/><br/>But to summarize, the film is unrelenting in its depiction of the savagery of people that can be effected by the circumstances in which they live or those in which they grow. The only question you have to ask yourself is: can you handle watching a movie like that or not? If you can't, then I'd suggest you consider the remake of ""When a Stranger Calls."" If you can, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>In spite of all the cries that this film is sick and pointless, I still maintain quite pointedly that it is nowhere near as cold as the putrid film ""Wolf Creek."""

Simply put, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is unpredictable, well-acted, creatively shot, successful in bringing out some emotion when characters die, and most importantly it's genuinely creepy. Now that isn't to say it's a great movie, because it's not. However, 'The Hills Have Eyes' knows it's capabilities as a horror slasher flick and doesn't try to be something it's not.

You just don't miss a thing.<br/><br/>The fact that the director of this movie was not afraid to put in a little more makes it as good as it is. Although some scenes are very disturbing (like the part in the caravan when the deformed people first come in.. say no more!), it is this that puts this movie above all other horror movies.<br/><br/>There are many unexpected scenes as well. By this I mean; even though you know people are going to be killed, the way in which this is done makes you totally unaware of what is going to happen next. This makes it even more scary.<br/><br/>There is only one flaw: the deformed just won't die! I know they're radioactive, but come on :-p By this I mean the man that is blown up by the two children of the central family, and the man that tries to kill the baby. You cannot survive an explosion to the face, nor several shots to the body. Madness.<br/><br/>Apart from this, I say EVERYONE who loves horror movies should go and see this film. I can't wait to see the original."

","While leaving the theater after seeing, ""The Hills Have Eyes"", I was somewhat disappointed. I did enjoy the movie and I'll admit that I was given a few chills and scares throughout, but I can't say that this film is much different than most horror movies of this era.<br/><br/>The story is about a family that is own a traveling vacation (where they could be going is beyond me)through the deserts of the western U.S. We find them in New Mexico where the closest thing to civilization is a run down wooden gas stop ran by an alcoholic loner who is so effected by his location and situation, he doesn't know how to act. While using the man's ""shortcut"" through the giant hills of the vast desert, their truck and campers' wheels are popped by a spike strip. They are now stranded in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone signal. The only thing in the vicinity is a large group of freaks who were effected by the radiation of A-Bombs that the government tested on the desert land. They are now man-hunting cannibals that are undeniably somewhat retarded.<br/><br/>From here on the action of the movie maintains a solid state and never fails to keep the surprises coming. But a smart audience will see past that action and notice the poorness of the screenplay and how it makes you question so many aspects of the film. The actors in the movie (none in which I can name) are dumbed down to embarrassing extremes and forced to become nearly helpless victims to these carnivores. I will not tell about the decisions that the characters make, but I can say that they dodge the obvious and make poor choices in order for there to be some killing. The screenwriter should have figured out a way to have deaths, but not because the actors must force themselves into thoughtless dialogue and make childish decisions.<br/><br/>You will probably enjoy this movie. It will definitely make you cringe in your seat. But who likes to leave the theater thinking, ""Why did he do that?"" or ""Why did that happen? This makes no sense."""
"moose_hartigan","9","0","1","23 March 2006"," An excellent entry in an almost lost genre.
","Before I start I want to remind everyone that this is from the perspective of someone who has NOT seen the Craven original so I am reviewing the remake alone.<br/><br/>After such a disappointing year for horror I was certain that perhaps this genre had run its course. After being quite shocked at the chilling story of The Ring I figured that maybe it would lead to a jump in the genre. However, ever since the ring I have yet to see a horror film that was truly worth seeing{exception of Saw and Saw 2}. My worries are starting to get lifted after seeing The Hills Have Eyes. I wasn't expecting much from this movie because despite liking High Tension I thought this movie was just being over-hyped. However, I now realize that this movie is even more chilling than High Tension. This story is about a family that is on vacation through a desert when they stop at a gas station. The owner then tells them about a shortcut, but just like classic horror this shortcut leads them to nothing but disaster. I feel that I should remind you that this movie is not perfect. One thing that was disappointing was just how long it takes to get started. I realize that they can't just open the movie with the family getting chased through the desert but for pace sake they should have cut the beginning down at least a good 15 minutes. However, once it gets started it doesn't stop. This is one of the only horror movies I've seen lately that had me on the edge of my seat from the time it starts murdering to the time it is over. Some of the murder scenes in this movie are just disgusting, but that makes them fun as well. I found myself cheering for the family every time they succeeded in outwitting the mutants. The rock-esquire soundtrack is excellent. I hope more good horror movies come with this one. In summary this is {except for slow parts at the start} a chilling, edge-of-your-seat, disgustingly satisfying horror film. Now I just have to find something to do until the release of Silent Hill where I hope I am just as pleasantly surprised as I am here."

","If you're looking to be legitimately scared by a great horror movie DO NOT SEE THE HILLS HAVE EYES. If however you're looking for a good movie to see with some friends, with some cheap (and far fewer not so cheap) scares & have a good time this is the movie for you. This movie will scare you, it will make you jump and make your body tense up, but it will also make you laugh out loud and wonder if it's trying to make fun of itself or if it is supposed to be legit. By the end of the showing I went to opening weekend the entire audience was laughing at parts in the film which were, for lack of a better word, pathetic. The film had a very strong start, but lost all it's shock/scare value and finished somewhere below ""The Fog (2005)"" Would I see it again if I was drunk? IN A HEARTBEAT.<br/><br/>=======SPOILERS BELOW====== <br/><br/>The first time I burst out laughing was when the row of spikes shown in the preview which pops the tires on the SUV is pulled back by an unseen mystery man-mutant. And all we hear is some muffled grunting/laughter noise reminiscent of a troll from a children's cartoon. (Fortunately for those of us seeking laughs this was not the last time the mutants in this movie failed to use their linguistic skills and instead decide to use a cliché grunt while communicating with each other.) <br/><br/>At no point in the ""film"" does any character make a choice that makes any sense whatsoever. (Why shoot a bad guy with one of the bullets from your fully loaded handgun when you could kill him by blowing up your RV with everything you own inside it?) <br/><br/>The movie is also riddled with inconsistencies which just obliterate the little integrity it had coming up on the final scene, when a mutant child, who's main deformity was her left eye, is all of a sudden miraculously healed? As her eye makeup wasn't done for this scene and her face looked completely normal. <br/><br/>The main message in this awesomely pathetic attempt at a motion picture is that physical deformities are not just skin deep, they penetrate to the soul; they make you a senseless killing machine who thirsts for the blood of humans. <br/><br/>""GO BEAST!"""
"Robert_duder","10","0","6","23 March 2006"," The most horrifying, rip roaring suspense/thriller in years!!
","I am a HUGE Horror fan, have been for the last 10 years. So you must take that into consideration when reading what will be a glowing review. I had a feeling this remake of a classic Horror flick (which I have not seen) was gonna be good but imagine when I discovered how truly incredible this film is!! It's brutally gritty setting, it's excessive ""R"" Rated gore scenes, the apocalyptic ""no one left on Earth"" type atmosphere, the chilling and disturbing Nuclear mutated human beings, the controversial ""rape scene"", this may be the modern day version of what Texas Chainsaw or The Exorcist was to the film goers three decades ago. <br/><br/>Ted Levine is not the star but he's the head of the family, Big Bob Carter. Hauling his family across thousands of miles on his and his wife's 25th Wedding Anniversary. Ted doesn't last long sadly because he has a larger than life character who I thought would put up a bigger fight but I think it sets the tone for how brutal and vicious the killers are. Bob Carter is a former detective who is like Dirty Harry and doesn't take anybody's crap. Levine is good as the tough strong Bob. Dan Byrd gives an incredible performance as eldest son to Bob, Bobby Carter. Byrd goes through the usual range of emotions of any person trapped in a horror film but does it without being campy or off beat. He's strong but terrified, angry but saddened and determined to protect his family. This could really do something for Byrd's career. Oscar Nominated Kathleen Quinlan plays the mother, Ethel Carter in a fairly small but significant role. Much like Ted Levine she only shows a glimmer of what would be a vital character before she is stomped out but that too is meant to be. You're supposed to become as quickly attached to these characters so you really feel their deaths when it happens. Vinessa Shaw (who I thought bares a striking resemblance to Hilary Swank) plays eldest sister Lynne. Her motherly instinct, love for her family, and her sacrifice to try and save her family is definitive. Her performance fits right in with this terrific cast. The lovely Emilie de Ravin plays youngest sister Brenda and I immediately recognized her from one of my favorite TV series LOST. She is the scream queen of the film and probably one of the lesser performers in many ways. She's mostly the eye candy/time filler/ and screamer but for those purposes she does well. She spends probably 80% of the film literally screaming at the top of her lungs and trying to bury her heavy Austrailian accent which only works some of the time. And then we have the hero who starts out as the furthest thing from the hero, Aaron Stanford, who plays Doug, husband to the eldest Carter daughter and father to their infant daughter. Doug is made out to be shallow, rather annoying, unfeeling, always fighting with his father-in-law and maybe even a bit of a philanderer as he catches a glance at this young sister-in-law but in the thick of the film Doug is forced to become the Saviour of the entire family and he becomes this incredible hero who goes the distance and protects his daughter and his extended family. Stanford is unfamiliar to me but he does an incredible job in this role and easily carries the film. He has a definite seventies, hippie look to him which plays a part in the setting of the film which feels retro. He is the perfect guy for this role. Also honorable mention to Tom Bower who plays the disturbed but otherwise normal gas attendant who leads the victims to the killers. He definitely fits the profile of the weird, desolate gas station attendant and although the role is a little predictable he does it well.<br/><br/>One of the reasons The Hills Have Eyes is so great is it's unpredictability. How often can you say that about a hacker horror film. Never!! Rarely!! The Hills Have Eyes breaks the mold of who would normally die and how...who would survive...the story that is actually so well done and unfolds very subtly throughout the course of the film. Although some of the situations and characters are fairly run of the mill the plot and setting is very unique and I was so pleasantly surprised at the outcome of who survives...it's so unpredictable!! It's nice to know that not everyone will just get hacked to pieces. Fairly new director Alexandre Aja has hit a true home run with this film. He truly may have found a knack with this horror film. Wes Craven still produces this remake of his original film and I'm sure having the master of horror himself nearby helps a great deal. Still Aja's style was brilliant. He manages to make a wide open, completely empty desert seem like the most claustrophobic place on earth. Everything is shot so up close that everything looms at you and it's just terrifying. The entire film beginning to end takes place in that desert and yet it never gets boring or repetitive. The shock and horror comes from the brutal, gruesome, gory kills and the sheer sight of these horrible abominations that were once normal humans. I think one of the most horrifying scenes in film history is when Doug is attempting to save his daughter and the two grotesquely mutated little girls turn to him and say ""Hey Mr., will you play with us."" BRUTAL!! Better than REDRUM or anything from The Shining. The opening sequence set to soothing classical music that flashes scenes or deformed children will set the mood and your scares for the rest of the film. This film is exactly why we should embrace with open arms...remakes of great classic films!! 10/10"

","OK, so I am pregnant and me and my family are really close. So, if some weird ass mutant was raping my sister and sucking on me while there is a humongous gun on my babies head. Someone was going to leave that trailer without a mutated penis and his mouth was already screwed up but, that wouldn't stop me from tearing his teeth out. Honestly, if he was going to go any farther I was ready to walk out. I couldn't stand watching that. My fiancé had no blood in his hand at the end of the night.<br/><br/>It is one of those movies where you can't figure out what is going on and what is going to happen next. I didn't think at all for a second that the ""pussy"" Doug? was it? would save the day. And I really hope that they get outa that desert alive and I hope they have something for that baby to eat while they are walking out of there. Otherwise, they are screwed.<br/><br/>This movie was great other than that. It scared the crap outa me and I would see it again.

It brings a whole sense of scary to a new level due to the fact I have never contemplated been stuck in a desert and realising how scary it must be being miles from anywhere....let alone the fact their are radioactive mutants all around! This film has been given its fair share of stick but it keeps you gripped from beginning to end and the characters are really open and you can find pro's and con's and relations in them all.

"DICK STEEL","8","0","4","21 March 2006"," A Nutshell Review: The Hills Have Eyes
","Hot on the heels of slasher flicks like Wolf Creek and Cry_Wolf (so many wolves?) this year is The Hills Have Eyes, a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 movie of the same title. Directed by Alexandre Aja, who brought us High Tension (shown here uncut late last year), this remake is surprisingly quite good and bloody entertaining, and that's despite being behind the other releases as mentioned over the past 2 weeks. If you're already jaded by the wolves, grit your teeth and go for this one. Bloody satisfaction guaranteed.<br/><br/>A word of caution, this movie isn't just plainly blood and gore. There are bits that were chopped off (pardon the pun), either by the filmmakers to secure an R rating in the US, or done so by local censors. What works, is that somehow you actually give a damn for the characters / victims. Why? Because they're family. And it could be yours.<br/><br/>Unlike the teenage swingers in Creek, or rich frat kids in Cry_Wolf, The Hills Have Eyes sets focus on a typical family - mom, dad, 3 kids, one of whom is already married to a telco salesman, and have a newborn baby. They're on a road trip (very popular movie element hor?) and made a pit stop at a dinghy petrol kiosk (doesn't it always?), with a sly and suspicious looking pump attendant (stereotypical, I know). They're directed to a short cut (uh-oh, bad) in the middle of the New Mexico desert on the way to California, and naturally, their vehicle encounters an accident - yes, in the middle of nowhere, to set the scene.<br/><br/>So while the family bickers and decides upon their action plan, little do they know that the hills have eyes. They are being watched, and you're gleefully awaiting some action to happen. The prologue and opening credits will have prepared you for what's to come - grotesque humanoid creatures who are mutated by nuclear energy, with a thirst for violence and hunger to kill. However, don't ask too many whys or hows, just accept the fact that it is so.<br/><br/>Without spoiling much, it's wicked. While on one hand, you're anticipating something to happen, by the time it does and the movie progresses, you'll be sucked into actually wanting the worse possible to happen, as a means of eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth, broken skulls and bullet wounds, the works. While the film might want to suggest something about the negativity of nuclear testing, it doesn't get bogged down by the suggestion and before you realize, it gets tossed out of the window in exchange for action.<br/><br/>The cast, while some having more screen time than others (you need the fodders to have the movie belong to the slasher genre), did a rather commendable job, despite the genre. You see genuine fear in their eyes, and the tone of their voice - they're really afraid. And you witness their progression from fear to the downright need for primal survival of the fittest. It's pretty neat to see the all too familiar setting up, the initial incident striking fear and confusion into their hearts, and the resolution to the final act, which is split into two different narratives. Somehow the strength is in how the situation develops, although it did get a little while to get there.<br/><br/>Despite the cuts and having other lesser slasher flicks shoved down our throats the past weeks, if you have to watch something bloody good, The Hills Have Eyes will be my recommendation."
"stargunner","4","0","1","21 March 2006"," couldn't take it seriously.
","The Hills Have Eyes is too predictable, too corny and just didn't deliver the thrills that I was hoping for. It goes to great lengths to attempt to disturb you, and there were parts that were unsettling. It fits with the mood of the film, but it doesn't mean I was entertained.<br/><br/>Yeah, like a typical slasher/horror there were points of high tension, some great fighting and frightening imagery, but thrills become cheap when a movie isn't good. And this movie felt cheap. The characters are just way too predictable and stereotypical, and the ones that make it are so fake it's unbearable. And to top it off, every time one of the mutants is killed by our protagonists this corny triumphant chorus chimes in, which pretty much destroys the mood altogether.<br/><br/>The mutants are well done, yet when they are off-screen and we only hear them it's not very frightening. The characters on screen are just about wetting themselves, and I hear a poor voice-over on screen. This movie had a lot of potential, and it is very clear, but there were things that were done so wrong that the pieces didn't quite fit together.<br/><br/>A lot of people are calling this a great horror movie. As a big fan of horror, I can't really see that. I knew what was going to happen to each character as they were introduced and what role they were going to play, the soundtrack belonged in a Mel Gibson film, and was mildly disturbing but not scary at all. It's one of those films you walk away from and just say, ""okay.."""
"Nikki1042","2","0","2","20 March 2006"," The hills have eyes.....you mean someone is watching?
","This film, unfortunately does not live up to its hype. The plot is a predictable frame, only traceable in the first part of the movie, which just descends into needlessly gruesome violence rather than scary action. Although it is jumpy, like so many other modern horror films, this will not be remembered. Nothing new shown here, the film just incorporates many of the recent ""trends"" in horror movies at the moment. This films could have been great, if released 5 years ago. Although only an hour and a half long, you will find you self looking at your watch, it is rare that you will feel gripped by this film. although there are parts you are glued to the screen, they are far to few and far between to justify you paying to see this. The camera shots used in the film however are excellent, really capturing the audience and building the tension at points, if only they were not wasted on such a mediocre film."

"iamsam103","7","0","1","19 March 2006"," Could have been brilliant but ends up as a slither- above-average horror
","I watched the original Wes Craven film a couple of nights before this remake and was overall disappointed. I won't go into a review but I have to say that it was clumsily but together and overall not scary or gory as it has been raved about so often.<br/><br/>After several trailers, I was very much looking forward to this film, expecting plenty of frights and buckets of gore. The start of the film is predictable, a couple of people getting killed to establish to establish what the rest of the film is like. OK, so it's done well, and has a sinister and gory effect...but what does it accomplish that the audience doesn't already know? What would have been better is a proper and decent introduction to the family travelling through the desert.<br/><br/>The film's pace, as well as introduction is also questionable, it seems to leap forwards at times but only to grind to an immediate halt...whether this is to try and force feed us some character driven moments. The film only really picks up pace when it seems the director is most comfortable, towards the climax.<br/><br/>If you like your scares and gore, look no further. I can honestly say the film does have its jumpy moments and is indeed full of gore and some unpleasant moments...but these are far and few between. Between the moments of horror and gore, you really want certain members of the family to just get on with it and die...which shouldn't happen if the director wants his / her audience to sympathise with the characters.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film was worth-while experience...and whereas it fails to identify itself as a leading horror film, it certainly keeps itself above the likes of; ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2004) and ""The Ring 2""....but if you want in my eyes what is the BETTER Wes Craven re-make...then look to ""Wrong Turn "" (2003)...which although technically isn't a remake, serves as a better reminder of the earlier Craven work than this film does."

"RunnerOnIce1125","2","0","2","19 March 2006"," Aww...how cute. They almost made it work.
","The film makers obviously couldn't make up their mind about what type of film they wanted to make. Was it a political statement against nuclear testing? A sentimental film about family dynamics? A disturbing drama to leave audiences feeling ashamed about humanity? Or a gore-tastic, cheap effects, let's see how many teenagers we can get to jump at the same time horror film? They alternated between these four dramas, with a brilliantly ironic opening credits motif involving cheery fifties country music and shots of explosions and deformed babies, an almost romantic scene between a teenage mutant and the main family's teenage son, an almost tear-jerking scene where the son-in-law finds his wife's mutilated body, and a ten or so minute long sequence in which the father is slowly burned to death.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, however, I felt more disturbed than scared of this movie. The ""villains"" are people- deformed, yes, but still people. Any politically correct movie viewer would know not to fear these people appearance wise- after all, they were deformed by man's inhumanity towards man. And they fall into the same category as Barbosa's crew in Pirates of the Caribbean or Saruman's Uruk Hai in Lord Of The Rings- while they might be scary initially, enough contact with them, and you'll be willing to put aside any fears you have of their appearance. The difference between this movie and POTC or LOTR? POTC and LOTR weren't interested in cheap effects or gore as an art form- the magic in those movies came from other sources. And while I was less disturbed by the mutilated dog than I would have been in the past- let's face it, the dogs always die first in these movies- there's just something infinitely creepy about knocking off a mother, a father, and a mother of an infant in the first batch of human suffering, and then taking the baby to be killed later.<br/><br/>As for the survivors? They were as pedestrian as possible, and, quite frankly, the only ones I wanted to die from the beginning.<br/><br/>The scares were fairly predictable. Woosh! A raven jumping off of a car, combined with loud music! Ah! The crowd goes wild. Oh no! Teenage mutant cannibal running around camera! And she's the good one- so why is she the only one who really gets to do that? And, as I said before, yes, the dog does die first.<br/><br/>But seriously. If they had concentrated on the political angle, this could have been a deeply disturbing movie with a lasting impression. But no...they had to attempt to make a cheap slasher film with as much gore as possible. I left the theater feeling sick, the only shakiness in my body coming from nausea. And I thought Sin City was pathetic."

Also he gets punched so hard in the face several times that the sound effect shakes your very ear drum. Still! Despite his injuries he can perform swings and almost acrobatic stunts! Oh please. Try to stick to reality just a bit.<br/><br/>And the part where the two ""smart?"" teens make the ingenious plan to kill one of the savages. Instead of just shooting him with the 10 shots they have left in their gun, they make this insane McGyver plan involving blowing up their entire camper. <br/><br/>If the actors just had some brain this movie would never have existed.

","Kudos to Wes Craven (whose movies I usually do not like) for bringing forth a horror flick that TRULY SATISFIES and pulls few punches. When the first victim falls...you DAMN well know you are in for a gore ride like few others. If you are faint of heart...why are you seeing horror flicks to begin with. Yeesh. You can take the advice of the few who are giving this film bad reviews, but I'm tellin' ya...if you miss this one on the big screen, you are definitely being sold short.<br/><br/>I've seen a few reviews from *gasp* shocked individuals who were too sensitive for what this film delivers. Do the world a favor...stay home next time. If you go to see a horror flick...you assume the risk. Nobody is responsible to cater to your prickly, sensitive proclivities. Get a life already.<br/><br/>Additionally, it's one of the few horror flicks where the unknown actors truly deliver fine acting. The young teen boy was brilliant. He sold the fear and grief he felt...like a first rate actor. It wasn't a lot of mere screaming and acting all bonkers from fear...he ran the gamut of emotions and sold you on every one. There was a real subtlety to his character that few others, I think, can pull off in a horror flick. Did anyone notice that the dad in the film is the same man who played the crazy guy in Silence of the Lambs who put the girl in the well? The voice gives it away.<br/><br/>Another bright actor in this flick was Brenda, the traumatized sister. She looks like a younger Reese witherspoon and really sold me on her fear. Usually you get some young teen actor who just screams and runs and acts just like all unknown actors they toss in these flicks...but not this one. She and the boy were true standouts. The other actors simply didn't shine as much.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie were first rate. Forget the quick cut-a-ways in most horror flicks...Wes Craven gives you the real deal with this one. Certain scenes were very reminiscent of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with it's ultra-high-energy ""on the end of your seat"" thrill rides.<br/><br/>If there was anything that disappointed, it was simply the same old tired lines you hear in most horror flicks. The unbelievability of...""Let's split up. You go this way...I'll go that."" It never works. In real life, these people would be literally glued to each other.<br/><br/>I came away from this flick very satisfied. I love a good horror flick and this was one damn good horror flick.

","I was so so psyched to be seeing this movie, the trailer looked promising, as did the initial reviews, and all this talk of dismemberment, rape, gore and tension got my hopes up. But unfortunately, The Hills Have Eyes went downhill from the opening scene.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja's Switchblade Romance was actually one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen, perfect on every account. But The Hills Have Eyes was an unimaginable let-down for me. The opening scene was neither scary nor gory, just plain ridiculous. This trend continued throughout the movie. It was just pointless gore, followed by more pointless gore and some strange stunts. Most ridiculous was the fact that a 15/16 (?) year old could make up a security system in the middle of a scorching desert, on his own, without hindrance, it made the movie laughable.<br/><br/>This movie was meant to be sick and disgusting and scarring. It wasn't. It was good FX and VERY LOUD NOISES every 30 seconds. It lacked any tension, atmosphere, or chemistry between the characters. The decision not to show the rape scene or the older sister getting shot in the head was a bad decision, because it leaves little else to merit the 18 certificate, and left the audience bored.<br/><br/>It had a few good points, the body part box was good, as was the music. But that's it...<br/><br/>Clichéd, Over Hyped, Loud and often Pointless, the Hills Have Eyes 2006 is just a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>4/10"

","This was one horror movie that did not leave me feeling empty inside upon its conclusion. It was a relief to watch a slasher flick that did not try to add dimension to the plot and the characters with hard-to-buy romantic entanglements or irrelevant heart-to-hearts between the last two survivors. In The Hills Have Eyes no one falls in love because all the characters come from one family. No one has any deep secrets to divulge because they are, once again, part of the same family. With that taken care of, The Hills Have Eyes can focus on what's really important: violent, bloody, hideous death. And what glorious death it is! The Carter's are too terrified to talk about anything but their impending doom, and the mutants are often too disfigured to speak easily, so there is very little dialog that does not serve only to propel the movie forwards to the next gruesome confrontation. I felt very good after watching this movie."
"fam24","7","0","2","15 March 2006"," Solid movie, though not perfect
","This movie is actually quite scary. Not necessarily terrifying the whole way through, but certainly a film to have an effect on the audience. Unfortunately part of the effect comes from a terribly cheap and irresponsible tactic. It is something that I found no reviews mentioned, and something which I feel people should know. There is a rape sequence at one point in the film which last far too long and is far too tastelessly done to really get any reaction other than trauma out of the audience. From that point on the theater was silent after watching it. I went to see it with someone who was sensitive to that sort of content and it just was not a pleasant experience. Thus, its an excellent horror film, but be weary that there is some questionable material that not everyone is capable of handling."

","I am not a gore-hound, but I also don't wince very easily at most nastiness in horror films. I do, however, enjoy a horror film where I am not supposed to laugh or find levity with the villains. I can't stand Friday the 13th films, Nightmares on Elm Street, or even the Wes Craven Scream flicks. I personally enjoy the rush of even being a little shocked by scenes or situations in horror films. Therefpre...<br/><br/>Bottom line...this remake of the Hills Have Eyes is NOT a date movie. Trust me, your lady will hate you for making you go see this with her. The film is intense, visceral, and (bonus) not very predictable. The camera does not pull away from the violence or gore. The moments of ""down time"" for the viewer are usually when there is simply no atrocity being committed. In short, I did not love the film, but only because I'm not one of those horror fans who crave the on-screen violence, blood, guts, etc. The film works - the characters are given enough screen time and depth to make the audience care about what happens to them. They are not ""cool ways to depict movie deaths"" waiting to happen. And since I feel badly for some of what happens to this family, I can't love the movie.<br/><br/>But man was it an effective movie. You are shocked, repulsed, and taken beyond where most horror movies stop enough times to get your money's worth. Frankly, this is a strong ""R"" rating, approaching NC-17 (where the film was originally rated). The film does not follow a formula. You cannot predict what happens to whom, nor when, nor how. This film left me feeling a little disturbed. In short, I give it all the credit in the world for NOT being what most horror has been for so long."

The scene(s) when certain member(s) of the family die is (are) truly touching.

I think they still would have been scary.

Things that kept the spirit alive but still kept the viewer on the edge of their seat. The French man does it. And does it well. Of course, One certainly does miss the setting of the mother's coarpse on fire as a diversion scene (perhaps for the pure shock value of it) but all the other aspects were still intact. Aja was a fan of the original like Peter Jackson was of Kong. <br/><br/>Now if only more directors respected the materials they were remaking, could a whole new generation be as satisfied with the remakes as audiences had been with the original releases. Actually, if the new directors were able to pull this off they could even steal some respect from the original audience.

","I saw the movie and I thought is was Fan-Fricking-Tastic. I don't want to sound demented or anything but the blood and gore was awesome. It topped my list of all time favorite horrors. Sure, the movie had some plot holes and some things they could have elaborated on, but other than that the movie was great. The acting was really good I thought. I never saw the original but I will soon enough. I think that horror movies are better if you put no-name actors in it. It makes it more realistic. They went for the seemingly common no ending approach which I think is awesome because it allows you to recognize how demented your imagination can be. I read something that the movie originally had a NC-17 rating, but they were forced to take out a few scenes. Does anyone know what the scenes consisted of? I know that the DVD will have clips, but other then that I don't think we'll ever know. It's hard to believe that there was anything worse then what wasn't cut. The movie was pretty harsh."

","Having never seen the original movie, I didn't really know what to expect from this new version. But I have to say that this is a horror movie that will send most people home happy.<br/><br/>The first half hour or so is a little slow, building up the story and, to a certain extent, the characters. Although horrors aren't exactly known for strong characters. Eventually after around 30 minutes or so it all kicks off and we're bang in horror country as knives, guns and pickaxes are used in a bloodbath between good and evil.<br/><br/>The acting is decent throughout the film, even if there aren't any stand-out performances, but then again you don't expect Oscar winning performances in a gory horror. There are some problems though, such as some characters suddenly being killed off before we barely know who they are. As well as that there are some moments early on where the family don't really seem to realise the situation (being stranded in the middle of nowhere) they are in. And God knows what the old guy is on about at the gas station, his part in the film is never really explained properly. But these are all minor nitpicks as the action more than makes up for the minor plot and character flaws.<br/><br/>So overall, an above average horror movie, which has a likeness to 'Wrong Turn'."

There was no sustained intensity throughout the whole film, unlike Wolf Creek and the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. If they wanted to make an action about revenge they should have stuck Arnie/ Vin Diseal in there with weapons of choice and unlimited ammo and not a small village of ""freaks"" but entire cities of them. <br/><br/>All the characters bar the dog were pathetic, weak and useless."

"Trespasser2003","8","0","1","12 March 2006"," Far Superior to the Original, huge political allegory
","I was really nervous going into this movie. I knew it was going to be intense, and I knew it was going to be absolutely brutal.<br/><br/>There were a couple unintentional laughs in the movie, and a few parts where I wanted to groan. I was scared, I was grossed out, and I found myself noticing things about it more and more as I thought about it. The more time goes by, the more I like this movie. A lot of it has to do with some of the things i've read recently on IMDb's message boards. I didn't come up with all of these ideas alone.<br/><br/>Despite the view of movies like this as being just ""grindhouse trash"", some of them have a lot to say. Alessandro Aja is somewhat well-known for his previous movie, High Tension. This movie takes many of the same themes (losing your humanity to protect a loved one, isolation) and explores them in a much more straight-up manner. As opposed to his previous film, this one also contains some really blatant political statements.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know, the film is about a regular family traveling through the desert to California. They stop at a gas station and are given directions to a short cut that turns out to lead them right into an old government testing facility for nuclear bombs. In the 40s and 50s, miners lived in the area and were told to leave for the testing. Some of them didn't, and their descendants became deformed cannibals. The guy who runs the gas station is the father of one of these people, and he sends in normal families to get killed in exchange for their valuables. In the beginning of the movie, he wants to quit, but he sends in one last family because he's afraid they might suspect something's up with him.<br/><br/>The father of the ""normal family"" is an ex-detective and an old-fashioned conservative republican. He carries guns and swears by them. He's not a bad guy at all. His son-in-law, Doug, is a democrat, against guns, and later on becomes the main focus of the story. They make a pretty big point of their political positions early on in the movie, so it's very much worth mentioning. I think that what the mutants represent is a little less obvious, but they're supposed to be the new, Bush-style rabid redneck Neocons. Feeding off of average Americans. That seems far-fetched but when you think about it a lot, it becomes obvious.<br/><br/>The family ends up in the desert, totally cut off from the rest of the world. There's a scene in which they take someone and crucify him and burn him in front of the rest of this family. At first I took this scene as just a blatant effort to be shocking, but than realized that it really shows how the Neocons have hijacked Christianity for their own ends.<br/><br/>This was also an allegory for the Iraqi war. I refer to a scene in which one of the mutants sings ""The Star Spangled Banner"" and had an exposition speech about how ""we were made to be like this"". Looking back, it's pretty straightforward even with the argument between Doug and the father, where the dad won't listen to anyone and Doug insists that they need a plan. Furthered by the youngest son foolishly flailing his gun but not really getting anything done.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, Doug is forced to go into the village of the mutants to save a loved one. The place where they live is actually a government-built test town of modern-at-the-time houses, full of mannequins, each tagged to be studied by the government after the bombs. I think the mutants living in the dilapidated 1950s style homes of the facility could refer to the Neocons' trumpeting of what they refer to as old fashioned family values. The decayed state of the buildings is highlighting the actual unsavoriness of the Neocon way of life, while the mannequins are presented as what ""normal"" families should be doing, a stark contrast to how they live.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the depths of inhumanity and brutality that Doug is forced to go to to save the said loved one is a really interesting counterpoint. He has to sink to the level of the mutant freaks in order to save her. And sadly, in the end, it proves futile. In the last seconds of the movie, we see that there are still mutants watching, and they are not going to survive much longer. I think that is where the meaning of the tag-line ""The lucky ones die first"" comes in. This also refers to the atomic bombs, the people in the center die first and don't become radiated.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Carters completely destroyed their home by blowing it up to destroy one of the mutants. It is not at all a stretch to say that represented why bombs are bad.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's about the loss of your humanity and being forced to become a brutal psychopath to defend yourself, even though that was completely against what Doug normally would have done.<br/><br/>Yes, it was very brutal and disturbing and contained some DEFINITE things that are not at all appropriate for the weak-stomached, but I absolutely loved this movie. 9/10"

","Alexandre Aja was hot coming off of the love or hate film High Tension that has a cult following (mainly in France), but with ""The Hills Have Eyes"" he sinks to a very low level. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly you've heard of the amount of violence and gore in this movie, and maybe you've heard that it was originally rated NC-17. I don't know what the filmmakers did to lower the rating but I'm surprised they got it lowered at all. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is easily the goriest movie I have ever seen, and second in violence only to the newer version of ""Assault on Precinct 13"". The violence is unnecessary and off-putting and is not implemented well at all.<br/><br/>The movie starts out well enough. A family is traveling to San Diego and takes advice from a stranger and turns down the wrong road. Soon enough their car has broken down and their stranded in the desert. Only this is a desert full of mutants. The scares and tension are very real for the first 25 minutes or so before they start to disintegrate. After the first death scene tension goes out the window and gore comes in. <br/><br/>The first third of the movie is easily it's strongest point. The mutants rarely show themselves and the characters don't make stupid mistakes. But the second third drops the ball and the third third sinks the film for good. I don't want to give any spoilers so I won't go into any specific details but if you've ever seen a horror movie before the end will be nothing new to you.<br/><br/>Overall the film does have it's moments when its genuinely scary but gratuitous gore and a disappointing finale bring down the movie to a very low level."

The son of a former detective at one point aims a loaded pistol at his brother-in-law and then he and the dad laugh about it because the safety was on!!!! Then in numerous other scenes they will use all their ammo shooting off into the desert only to have an empty gun when they need it. This is typical of many horror films in that it seems slapped together and makes you almost happy when the people are butchered because they are so stupid.

","Wes Craven's 1977 The Hills Have Eyes was focused on two families, the Carter family and the inbred cannibal family.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja's new version of The Hills Have Eyes is focused on just the Carter family and their survival out in the desert. The now, atomic radiation deformed people are the enemy. But that's all they really are, is an enemy. there isn't any depth to them like in the original.<br/><br/>The original's main point was seeing two families, both being down to their bare essentials(the carter's were stripped of everything they had), the civilized versus the non-civilized, the carter family trying to survive by not being killed, and the cannibal family trying to survive by killing to eat and not being killed in defense from the carters. By the end, the cannibal family makes the carter family just as merciless as they were. excellent concept but put to the side in Aja's remake.<br/><br/>The remake is mainly for entertainment and visuals. It did have great scares and suspense, surpassing the original in those factors.

When Romero showed the living dead munching on the skin and bones of the actual living in 1968, people gasped in horror and disgusting, yet today, Night Of The Living Dead is a horror classic.<br/><br/>Alexandre Aja is the 21st century's answer to the zombie legend. Starting big with a cult-y very original ode to the 70's horror style ""Haute Tension"" to yet another horror remake: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" Many, many of the top film reviewers do not realize what decade they're living in. Roger Ebert, this is not the 1960's. Our society isn't keen on the horror ""parlor tricks"" of the 60's, showing people eating chicken although exclaiming they're chowing down on the flesh of humans. Our culture needs more visually shocking horror films to give us that sense of terror of the random people in the world being so villainous to commit these act of violence.<br/><br/>""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that type of movie. As it gets going after the mandatory 45 minutes of character development, the movie's brutality does not stop. Throat-munching dogs, burnings (â la Joan of Arc), throat stabbings with the American flag, an over-sized nuclear-deformed cranium, explosions, a freezer full of dismembered limbs and torsos, visually stunning facial deconstruction with a shotgun, and (the most recognizable trademark of Aja) numerous axe shots to the back, head, fingers, and chest.<br/><br/>""The Hills"" isn't meant to win big at the Acadamy Awards, another major aspect major movie critics forget. Horror movies are changing. The past five years have brought more visually-pleasing cinematography and more visually-stunning violence. This is where ""The Hills"" wins big on both accounts.

The beginning of the movie is awesome - a mysterious figure with a pickaxe savagely demolishes a group of scientists checking for radiation. But after that, it all kind of goes downhill. The mutated monster people aren't very well done - most look a bit like deformed teenagers with really bad acne and sunburns. The sounds they make (breathing, laughing, etc.) sound a lot like Sloth from Goonies, which makes it hard to take seriously. They also spend too much time on screen - once you see them, the scares are pretty much over - all that's left is a prolonged fight or rape scene. It really felt more like an action movie than a horror flick.<br/><br/>As far as the rape scene, it's very drawn out, and it would be hard to tell it was actually a rape without the dialogue and situation (girl with nightgown hiked up to thighs, monster holding her down, girl crying, monster number 2 saying ""It takes a man to do that"" or something to that effect). There is a second sexually explicit scene where are monster is sucking a girl's breast, which I found more disturbing.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie hands down is when Doug decides to take the fight to the monsters. This is kind of ruined by some serious mistakes by one of the monsters who actually beats the crap out of him (he's locked in a big meat container rather than killed - um... ooook...). The beating Doug's character takes is also kind of ridiculous. However, when Doug has the axe, that right there is pretty much the coolest part of any movie I've seen so far this year.<br/><br/>This film was fairly violent, but most of it has to do with eating things (strangely enough) or with things that are already dead. The body parts the monsters eat, and the corpses of things they've killed before the family came along are all fairly grody. But the actually killings of the family aren't that bad (although the suicide of the gas station attendent is quite gruesome). No intestines falling out, brains on the floor, etc. Mostly just fingers and arms being chopped off, lots of blood, and nasty cuts. Saving Private Ryan is more graphic than this.<br/><br/>I think the main reason I didn't like this film was that they showed too much of the monsters. If they had just stuck to keeping them off-camera for more of the film, it would have been scarier. But once you see that the villains are simply red-neck mutant desert cannibals who've been out in the sun too long, it's like ""Oh... yay..."" Or at least they could have developed their characters more. I'd give this a 3/10, but Doug's rampage with the axe bumps it up to a 5/10. Bottom line: it's not really scary, and the monsters are Star Trek rejects. You want to be scared, go rent The Relic."

","Aja hits you out of nowhere in the beginning, then spends a while with the characters after seeing exactly what's in store for them as you're getting to know them makes this probably the most unnerving film I've ever seen in theatres. The pacing and the atmosphere were right on target. People's complaints about the characters ""pointlessly bitching and moaning at each other"" were just what I thought they'd be, a great way of making them feel like real people and not clichés. I don't have any siblings, but I have two step-sisters, and the way they act around each other mirrors the interaction shown in the film beautifully. We all engage in petty bickering with the ones we love, especially under certain circumstances, and although it may annoy the hell out of us there will come a time when we wish those people were there to annoy us. I loved how well Aja showed this. It added so much more impact to the horror. The fact that I was teary-eyed at the end is a testament to Aja's characterization. Michael Bailey Smith needs to play Jason. Pluto was so damned cool that I couldn't help but love him even after he'd made me hate him. He gave me a chance to see what it was like to see the Jason of the 80's on the big screen. Aja's direction is spot on. I love his contrasts. Inter-cutting glimpses of deformities during the main titles with warm-hearted music playing over it to show the shift that happens in the area after the nuclear testing; the beautiful shots of the desert landscapes to offset the ugliness that lies within them; the use of visceral music that you almost feel more than you hear that keeps that sick, uneasy feeling in tact throughout the film, countered by the heroic orchestral themes used when the victims start to fight back... The political themes were a bit heavier than I expected, but Aja integrated them into the story without having them consume it. The film does have one scene in particular that has a great message about creating your own problems that applies heavily to the world today. I love Aja's use of things that have been done before in these types of films, such as the area where the killers keep the vehicles of people that came to their land and never made it back, this time showing them in a huge pit with crows everywhere to add a further sense of eerieness to the atmosphere. The fight scenes were incredible, and brutal enough to keep it from turning into an action movie. They don't feel choreographed, they reflect the mental state of the killers, and the victims after what the point that the killers drive them to. Aja's ending works both ways. I felt the same joy the family did when the survivors were reuinted, but Aja still left that sense of dread that there's still more members of another family out there lingering. I was going in expecting as close to perfection as it gets, and that's pretty much what Aja gave me. Anything I found wrong with the film was just a minor nitpick, Aja went a little nutts with the jump scares, but they still worked on me, which they often don't; but he delivered a film that made me feel the same brutality, intensity, terror, sorrow, and joy of what the characters were going through like films ever have."

","I'm a huge horror movie fan, but let's face it, good horror is hard to come by. I give out a lot of 9's but it's a hard push to get me to hand out a 10. This movie delivered and then some. My high expectations were shattered completely. Unlike most horror films, the characters were played very well. Even a bigger rarity, they were well developed and defined. The story is simple and is pretty dead on with the original. A family of travelers gets lost in the desert and is stalked and brutally murdered, molested, and kidnapped by a family horribly disfigured by radioactive testing. Again I must warn all that this movie is VERY BRUTAL. The connection and development of the characters adds a very powerful emotional element. I was almost driven to tears on more than one occasion. Even amidst the sadistic horror films like Saw and Hostel, this movie manages to stand on it's own as a well made, and very thoughtfully crafted horror film. I left the theatre slightly dazed and very disturbed. Although it begins slow, the last hour makes up for any drag in the action. After being decimated, certain survivors take up arms and seek grisly vengeance, All in all, a must see for anyone looking for a huge wallop of fear and disturbance. An adrenaline rush indeed."
"jayrandall883","10","0","2","11 March 2006"," Cheesy ending is forgiven for an overall great horror movie
","I absolutely loved this movie and thats actually saying a lot since I haven't seen a good horror movie since High Tension (I don't think its a coincidence that both movies have the same director). The opening completely caught me off guard with how fast and brutal the death scenes were and I was wondering if the movie would drop off after a great opening. I was wrong. It was a little slow for people who may get bored by a lot of character development, I know a lot of people in the movie theatre did. I liked it... but I like a lot of interesting and entertaining character development (especially since you rarely find it in a horror movie).<br/><br/>I had seen the original movie and remember being really shocked by it. The scene in the camper where a couple of the family members die also caught me off guard which is why it caught my interest. It got so brutal and disturbing and the first few minutes could have passed for a family drama. The scene when the father is hearing his named called in the darkness was one of the scariest scenes I had ever seen (still is). Thats why I was so shocked that the whole scene in the remake was still just as shocking and intense as the original. I still got scared s******* when the father was getting his name called in the darkness and still just as disturbed when all the chaos started happening in the camper.<br/><br/>I knew the movie would be brutal and bloody because Wes Craven was still producing it and he chose the director because he loved the bloody High Tension. The audience that was getting bored in the beginning while I was watching it was cheering, oohhing, and screaming by the end of it and I was doing the same.<br/><br/>The music was just right and the acting was top notch (I couldn't believe that the father was Buffalo Bill from ""The Silence of the Lambs""). It was a great horror movie especially after the crap thats been coming out. The last movie I watched was ""When A Stranger Call"" and lets just say that Simon West could have kept that to himself. I highly recommend this movie for anyone that loves a lot of gore and relatable characters (not something you find that often in the same movie).<br/><br/>I did find the ending to be a little to over the top. I think it would have been fine if it weren't for the cheesy music (that was the only time I didn't like the music). It kind of sounded like that triumphant music that you heard at the end of ""Cabin Fever"" when the blonde dude thought he was gonna live and then got shot all to hell. I hated ""Cabin Fever"" so anything that brings me back to that movie cannot be good. But the whole movie really made me forgive those bad last two minutes. I'm beginning to think that Aja just doesn't know how to end a film well, but the rest of the movie makes up for the bad endings. <br/><br/>Overall good film but great horror movie that I would recommend to anyone. It's not one that you'll be able to forget as you walk out of the theatre. It sticks with you"
"The_Fear","9","0","2","11 March 2006"," Now THIS is a horror movie done right!
","Another remake. We've seen so many of them recently and have been disappointed by most of them. Only a few, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of The Dead, have been good. No surprise here though that we have another one. This time it's Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes.<br/><br/>This film is written and directed by Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension). This film follows the Carters, an idyllic American family traveling through the great American southwest. But their trip takes a detour into an area closed off from the public, but more importantly from society. An area originally used by the U.S. Government for nuclear testing that was intended to be empty...or so they thought? When the Carter's car breaks down at the old site, they're stranded...or are they? As the Carters may soon realize that what seemed like a car casually breaking down, might actually be a trap. This trap might be perpetrated by the inhabitants of the site who aren't pulling a prank, but are out to set up a gruesome massacre.<br/><br/>I have never seen the original so I have nothing to compare this to; I am only going to review this movie on its own merits. I flat out loved this movie. It was so visceral and intense that no movie I've seen recently can touch it. Hostel was flat out violent and gruesome. This was something totally different. I have never been so exhausted after seeing a movie. When I walked out of the theater I had the biggest smile on my face.<br/><br/>I actually cared (a lot) about the characters. That's why this movie takes a while to get going, you get to know and care for the characters and when three of them died in the absolutely awesome trailer sequence, you'll know it, I was sad. **SPOILER**When the one guy was going to shoot Brenda and then you see the blood on the trailer window, I thought Bobby had shot the guy but when I saw that Brenda was shot, I was like ""HUH?"" and I felt bad.**END SPOILER** You care about the characters in this movie and it pays off big time. This movie is also very violent. Not sickening in your face violent like Hostel was, just plain awesome and disturbing violence. There's a ton of blood but it doesn't feel overused or ridiculous at any point in the movie. This is one intense movie. Whoa is all I have to say about it. Once it starts it never lets up, not even at the end. There's just so much to talk about with this movie but I'm not going to here, you all just need to see it. This is a breath of fresh air in this genre. Aja gives horror the kick in the ass it so desperately needed. This is how horror should be; an unrelenting, unforgiving thrill ride with huge balls. Thank you Alexandre Aja. I can't wait for you're next movie. Oh and this also is the definition of a theater experience. Instead of most movies where you have the sound blasting out of speakers this actually makes use of the surround sound. You'll hear crows or screams or noises that are off screen to your left or right. One time I actually thought somebody brought a baby in with them only to find out it was in the movie. This is an awesome awesome thing to witness. It truly breaks the fourth wall. Another interesting thing which I don't know if it was intentional or not but one time when one character shone a flashlight beam towards the audience the light from it made the light from the projector visible so it looked like the was shining the light right at us. Again, intentional or not, it was awesome! The music was pretty good, I didn't notice the score but maybe that was intentional like in Haute Tension. The makeup was pretty good, if a bit unoriginal at times, one guy looked exactly like Jason from F13 Part 2 minus the hair. I mean EXACTLY. At the end this also sets up for a sequel. I hope there is not one cause I like the thought of it ending right there. And even though it sets up for a sequel, it does so in an absolutely awesome way. I loved the last shot of this movie.<br/><br/>So I didn't touch on all the points I wanted to but as I'm sitting here writing this I realized I didn't need to, all I should do is give my basic thoughts and let people experience this for themselves. Alexandre Aja is the next big horror director/master and I for one will be in line eagerly awaiting his next picture. This was a horror movie and everyone should see it. So, what are you waiting for?"

","Let's face it. Most horror movies are pieces of garbage. Its rare when you run into a truly good horror movie. This movie does the job and then some. It sticks to the original perfectly, and the nuclear monsters are on a completely different level of scary (With a new backstory). Even though this movie had its share of corny moments, and seemed to drag on a bit too long... I loved it. I didn't expect an Academy winner here, and If you compare it to most of the crappy remakes that have been processed the past 5 years Id make it one of the best. Some of the acting was poor, but what do you expect in a horror movie? Soundtrack was also amazing. Highly recommend to any modern horror fan. Up there in my rankings as of late with The Ring and Dawn of The Dead. Best Remake in a long time."

The movie begins with a family going to California on vacation. They stepped on the wrong toes and were sent to the hills, instead of the highway. Little did they know ""the hills have eyes"".

"The_Moose","8","0","1","11 March 2006"," Gritty, gruesome and graphic - better than the original
","Unlike the 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" this update of Wes Craven's cult horror classic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a visceral, stylized, and disturbing tour de force. This effective remake has a lot of soul and bares large fangs that bite the jugular. It's a film made by a grind house horror fan for grind house horror fans - he knows what the audience wants and how to deliver it. Director Alexandre Aja (Haute Tension) is a student of the 70's/80's horror era.<br/><br/>The story is about an all American family who gets lost in the New Mexico desert and is attacked by cannibal freaks, who are the byproduct of nuclear testing. You might laugh at this idea, saying to yourself ""freaks attacking a family, that's so lame."" To be honest, several people in the theater were chuckling in the beginning, but by the second act, no one was laughing. In fact, by the end of this movie several people fled the theater in terror.<br/><br/>As a horror buff myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this piece and highly recommend it to those who are fond of other grind house works such as ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Zombie 2."" It's a superior work of terror that's a delightful departure from the recent PG-13 horror junk (such as ""When A Stranger Calls"") that's plagued theaters.<br/><br/>However, a word of warning. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is very violent and gory. If you've seen Aja's last film, Haute Tension (which I highly recommend), you know what kind of blood and guts you're in for. Don't be fooled by the rating. Despite the fact that this film was re-edited for an R, there still remains a lot of graphic and gruesome gore and violence, which includes, but is not limited to head explosions, graphic gun shot wounds, stabbings, and a scene of rape.<br/><br/>All this mind, I conclude with a simple, and meaningful statement that I rarely plan to utter again. ""The remake was better than the original."" 8/10"

The acting is well done and I was pleasantly surprised by the turn that Emilie de Ravin takes from the other roles I have seen her in, mainly the television show Lost. The film is gritty and realistic, which adds to the creepy ambiance of being stuck in the middle of no where with half retarded monsters who want nothing better than to gut you, on your tail.

I have to admit though, not a huge fan of these type of films myself, I did find that becoming startled almost became the norm for the first fifteen minutes or so. The film takes numerous routes open to exploration, some unpredictable, others more obvious. But as the film went on I found myself wondering where it was going to go, and certain characters (one in particular) certainly showed they weren't going to be restricted by what you would typically expect capable when first making judgements on the characters. I have to say though by the end this particular novelty began to wear thin, and crossed over into unrealistic. Adrenaline is one thing, but it is arguable that determination beyond human capability was shown. Moreover, as the film came to a close the more typical expectations began to shine through. You find yourself saying ""No, don't do that."" and ""What are you stupid?"" just as in every other mediocre film of a similar sort, where you can see whats coming about 30 seconds to a minute beforehand.

I want to keep this review short but I will touch on a couple of things worth mentioning: - I felt very tense watching this. For the first hour or so, my stomach was twisted into a tight knot. It's been a while since a movie's done that to me.

If watching well meaning, innocent people get it in different ways is not your thing, then look elsewhere. This is a film about tragedy and injustice and the film pulls no punches when it comes to dispatching people, mutated or not. Even after people are killed, they still get disrespected.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great special effects. The make up on some of the characters is downright disturbing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Director Aja more than made up for the piece of crap that was ""Haute Tension"".</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The rape scene isn't as bad as you have been led to believe.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This movie suffers from one of those things I absolutely hate about horror movies: characters doing absolutely idiotic things.

","I am something of a classic horror aficianodo and Wes Craven fan. I went into this film preparing to be disappointed and was pleasantly surprised. The film does a good job of being faithful to the original but adds some new aspects and updated special effects (but not too much to be over the top) to make the film good. I would still recommend the original, even though it is certainly dated in its special effects and limited by its shoe-string budget.<br/><br/>Make no doubt about it, the film is pretty intense, gory and brutal--definitely not for the faint of heart. It does, however, have its share of starts and I jumped a few times--which isn't easy to make me do.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot revolved around a typical middle class family which gets lost in the desert and is attacked by a feral family that lives in the hills. By the end, however, you are supposed to be asking yourself who the real savages are. In this respect, the re-makers stay true to the original film. In this version, however, we find out more about the feral family and why they are the way they are.<br/><br/>The film does a very good job at creating suspense and using subtle effects (sounds, music) to generate fear without necessarily utilizing typical gore.

The kid who plays him did an excellent job and was very realistic, and though the character makes some stupid mistakes throughout, he never really has you yelling at the screen. <br/><br/>-The music from Tomandandy (who did Mean Creek's excellent music) was good, mostly country and B-movie instrumentals (like in the old Dogs of War trailer). <br/><br/>The bad -Pretty much everything else. <br/><br/>-The back story about the miners refusing to leave their homes and being mutated by government nuclear tests is weak. Hey guys, if they were going to do tests there, chances are the mines were barren and you'd be living in a ghost town anyway. This makes the ""point"" of the movie- that anyone can be driven to murder like a barbarian- kind of moot. The trailer family (who, by the way, are hardly the usual city folk pitted against murderous hillbillies-- they're gun-wielding republicans who would probably vote to let them keep their land, while liberals may have stopped the nuclear testing in the first place) is killing because half of them have been raped and killed and had their baby stolen, not because they were asked to move out of their dying desert town. Maybe if the government had taken the people's children away or not warned the residents in time... I dunno. After Wrong Turn, maybe we're just lucky to get ANY explanation for inbred hicks killing outsiders, other than the fact that, hey, they're inbred hicks and they've got a taste for blood.<br/><br/>-The rape scene and ensuing murders were needlessly graphic. Call me old-fashioned, but I like my horror movie serial killers impotent and sexual threats nonexistent or implied, like in Texas Chain Saw Massacre or A Nightmare on Elm Street. If Oscar-winning filmmakers have trouble not making rape scenes exploitative, Alexandre Aja sure isn't going to pull it off.<br/><br/>The ugly -The make-up is pretty good. The creepiest mutated people were really the ones who looked most human.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I would even call this movie horror. It's more 1970s exploitation (unsurprisingly) meets snuff flick, with better special effects. Plenty will be disgusted, few will be truly scared. I guess now I know how other people see horror movies that I love."

","this is your movie.<br/><br/>it's chock full of BOO! and gore and all kinds of silly scary stuff, but if you haven't turned your brain off altogether, you too will be annoyed. it was fun, but not that fun.<br/><br/>the story (and movie) has been done before, and while this version is far more ookie and blood and gutsy, it's really no better than the first.<br/><br/>there are so many GIANT bad holes in this version that the audience was audibly laughing at things that they probably weren't supposed to.<br/><br/>all i gotta say, if they make a sequel starring ""beast"", i'm in, as he was arguably the most interesting, talented actor in the movie."
"The_Duderino87","7","0","3","7 March 2006"," Finally a decent one.
","A family decides to take a vacation to California. After stopping at a run down gas station and taking directions from a seemingly less than trustworthy individual, their innocent little family outing turns into a living hell. I think everyone has been waiting for a good horror film, in spite of the recent lack luster ones that have came out this year. Having never seen the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" I couldn't tell you which one is better. This one definitely exceeded my expectations. I had an opportunity to see this at an advanced screening. It starts of a little on the slow side. Some of the characters are just strait up annoying starting off, so be prepared to be wishing death on some of them. When the action starts, it hits hard. You will find yourself pitying this poor family. The acting wasn't that bad surprisingly. If you are a fan of gore this movie offers some pretty good scenes. Nothing outstanding though. The suspense was a little mediocre. You have your typical ""boo"" type scares. You can see most of them coming. This movie's strength is in the situation this family is in. They start off not getting along very well, but after loosing some of their own they have to learn to get along as a family and fight for survival. I'll give the family dog kudos. You'll see what I mean."
